hedging you have an investment and are worried that the price might drop in the near future you do n't want to sell as this will realise a capital gain for which you may have to pay capital gains tax so instead you make an investment in another instrument sometimes called insurance to offset falls in your investment   an example may be that you own shares in xyz you feel the price has risen sharply over the last month and is due for a steep fall so you buy some put option over xyz you pay a small premium and if the price of xyz falls you will lose money on the shares but will make money on the put option thus limiting your losses if the price continues to go up you will only lose the premium you paid for the option very similar to an insurance policy diversification this is when you may have say $ 100,000 to invest and spread your investments over a portfolio of shares some units in a property fund and some bonds so you are spreading your risks and returns over a range of products the idea is if one stock or one sector goes down you will not lose a large portion of your investment as it is unlikely that all the different sectors will all go down at the same time

the difference is in the between the varied investments you make hedging is about specifically offsetting a possible loss in an investment by making another related investment that will increase in value for the same reasons that the original investment would lose value gold for instance is often regarded as the ultimate hedge its value is typically inversely correlated to the rest of the market as a whole because its status as a material durable store of value makes it a preferred safe haven to move money into in times of economic downturn when stock prices bond yields and similar investments are losing value that specific behavior makes investing in gold alongside stocks and bonds a hedge the increase in value of gold as stock prices and bond yields fall limits losses in those other areas investment of cash in gold is also specifically a hedge against currency inflation paper money account balances and even debt instruments like bonds and cds can lose real value over time in a hot economy where there 's more money than things to buy with it by keeping a store of value in something other than currency the price of that good will rise as the currencies used to buy it decrease in real value maintaining your level of real wealth other hedges are more localized one might for example trade oil futures as a hedge on a position in transportation stocks when oil prices rise trucking and airline companies suffer in the short term as their margins get squeezed due to fuel costs currency futures are another popular hedge a company in international business will often trade options on the currencies of the companies it does business in to limit the seen in the forex spot market caused by speculation and other transient changes in market demand diversification by contrast is about choosing multiple unrelated investments the idea being to limit losses due to a localized change in the market companies stocks gain and lose value every day and those companies can also go out of business without bringing the entire economy to its knees by spreading your wealth among investments in multiple industries and companies of various sizes and global locations you insulate yourself against the risk that any one of them will fail   if tomorrow kroger grocery stores went bankrupt and all its stores people in the regions it serves might be but the market as a whole will move on you however would have lost everything if you 'd bet your retirement on that one stock nobody does that in the real world instead you put some of your money in kroger some in microsoft some in home depot some in some in pg&e etc etc by investing in stocks that would be more or less unaffected by a downturn in another if kroger went bankrupt tomorrow you would still have say 95 of your investment next egg still alive well and continuing to pay you dividends the flip side is that if tomorrow kroger announced an exclusive deal with the girl scouts to sell their cookies making them the only place in the country you can get them you would miss out on the full possible amount of gains you 'd get from the price spike if you had bet everything on kroger   hindsight 's always 20/20 i could have spent some beer money to buy bitcoins when they were changing hands for pennies and i 'd be a multi millionaire right now you ca n't think that way when investing because it 's survivor bias you see the successes topping the index charts not the failures you could just as easily have invested in any of the hundreds of internet startups that do n't last a year

i 'd like to see a credible source for the highest but it 's certainly fairly high household debt could be broadly categorized as debt for housing and debt for consumption housing prices seem very high compared to equivalent rental income   this is generating a great deal of debt   keynes said that if something can not go on forever it will stop   just when it will stop and whether it will stop suddenly or gradually is a matter of great interest   obviously there are huge vested interests including the large fraction of the population who already own property and do not wish to see it fall   nobody really knows my guess would be on a very long term plateau in nominal prices and decline in real prices the australian stock market is unlike the us since it 's a small country a lot of the big companies are export driven either by directly exporting physical goods miners agriculture or by fdi property trusts banks   so a local recession will hurt the stock market but not across the board   a decline in the value of the australian dollar would be very good news for some of these companies debt for consumption i think is the smaller fraction   arguably it 's driven by a wealth effect of australia having had a reasonably good crisis with low unemployment and increasing international purchasing power   if this tops out you 'd expect to see reduced earnings for consumer discretionary companies

the iron clad rule of investing is that risk and return are directly related it is impossible to get a higher return than you are getting without putting principal at risk your emergency fund should be in cash preferably in government insured cash like a savings account the best you could probably do is laddered 3-month cds that way you could cash them out one per month as they mature

nearly every country has its own exchange because so many countries have their own currency and currency every part of an exchange 's business    generally an exchange will support transaction and settlement only in local currency   securities except those that explicitly enable fx trading are denominated and will trade in a single you can only buy a share of ibm in u.s. dollars   securities trading always seeks to be a clean scalable process and adding cross currency translation to the mix would just complicate things   so it 's one exchange one currency in most countries citizens and even businesses are largely restricted to having bank accounts in local currency   there are various political reasons for this but there it is   it is difficult or impossible to open a domestic bank account in a foreign denominated currency   a public company headquartered in a given country will be required to publish financial statements in local currency will be more likely to do business with the local and businesses in that currency and so will likely look for investors from that same which generally means listing in local currency which means on an exchange in that country there are exceptions of course   big multinationals do business all over the world and many seek investors all over the world as well   mechanisms have been created to permit this american depositary receipts or adrs for example   but once again cross currency translation makes things more complicated so adrs and their like are only practical for very big international players as to why there may be many exchanges in a single country imo nick r has it right   read flash boys many market makers profit from trading between exchanges and so have an interest in there being many of them   and in the u.s. regulators have expressed an interest in innovation in the exchange space and so permit them   there is also an argument to be made against having a single too big to fail exchange just like the argument for banks but i would n't call that a reason for the current state of affairs

there are mechanisms for determining how valuable a property is without resorting to artificial government valuations that can rise drop in relation to the local economy   the most interesting i 'm aware of is to force a sale of a property for x times the tax the person is paying   so for instance if i value my home business property at 100 k and the forced sale factor is 100x then i would pay at least 1k year for taxes maybe a bit more just to be safe   this also solves the imminent domain issue   that is a bit science though   in reality using an average of similar recent sales while imperfect is good enough    is important in all kinds of investments   i agree but governments can always raise rates or cut services or borrow in hard times in general the property values should track fairly closely other forms of economic activity

for manual conversion you can use many sites starting from google type 30 usd in yuan to sites like xe.com mentioned here for conversion you could use google calculator api or many other currency exchange apis that are available beware however that if you do it on the real site the exchange rate is different from actual rates used by banks and payment processing companies while they use market based rates they usually charge some premium on currency conversion meaning that if you have something for 30 dollars according to current rate it may bet yuan but if he uses a credit card for purchase it may cost him for example yuan you should be very careful about making difference between snapshot market rates and actual rates used in specific transaction

your math is correct as you point out because of the property of multiplication roth and traditional iras offer the same terminal wealth if your tax rate is the same when you pull it out as when you put it in   roth does lock in your tax rate as of today as you point out which is why it frequently does not maximize wealth most of us have a higher tax bracket when we are saving than when we are withdrawing from savings there are a few other potential considerations advantages of a roth roth and traditional iras have the same maximum contribution amount   this means the effective amount you can contribute to a roth is higher $ 5,500 after tax instead of before   if this constraint is binding for you and you do n't expect your tax rate to change roth is better roth iras allow you to withdraw your contributed money not the gains at any time without any tax or penalty whatsoever   this can be an advantage to some who would like to use it for something like a down payment instead of keeping it all the way to retirement   in this sense the roth is more flexible as your income becomes high the deductibility of traditional ira contributions goes to zero if you have a 401(k at work you can still contribute but ca n't deduct contributions   at high incomes you also may be disallowed from contributing to a roth but because of the backdoor roth loophole you can make roth contributions at any income level and preserve the full roth tax advantage which type of account is better for any given person is a complex problem with several unknowns like future tax rates   however because tax rates are generally higher when earning money for most people who can contribute to them traditional iras maximize your tax savings and therefore wealth edit note that traditional ira contributions also reduce your agi which is used to compute eligibility for other tax advantages like the child care tax credit and earned income credit   agi is also often used for state income tax calculation in retirement traditional ira distributions may or may not be state taxable depending on your state and circumstances

you 're missing the concept of systemic risk which is the risk of the entire market or an entire asset class diversification is about achieving a balance between risk and return that 's appropriate for you your investment in vanguard 's fund although diversified between many public companies is still restricted to one asset class in one country yes you lower your risk by investing in all of these companies but you do n't erase it entirely   clearly there is still risk despite your diversification you may decide that you want other investments or a different asset allocation that reduce the overall risk of your portfolio over the long run you may earn a high level of return but never forget that there is still risk involved bonds seem pretty worthless at least until i retire according to your profile you 're about my age our cohort will probably begin retiring sometime around 2050 or later and no one knows what the bond market will look like over the next 40 years we may have forecasts for the next few years but not for almost four decades writing off an entire asset class for almost four decades does n't seem like a good idea also bonds are like equity and all other asset classes in that there are different levels of risk within the asset class too when calculating the overall risk return profile of my portfolio i certainly do n't consider treasuries as the same risk level as corporate bonds or high yield or junk bonds from abroad   depending on your risk preferences you may find that an asset allocation that includes us and/or international bonds fixed income international equities real estate and cash to make rebalancing your asset allocation easier reduces your risk to levels you 're willing to tolerate while still allowing you to achieve returns during periods where one asset class e.g. equities is losing value or performing below your expectations

the other issue you could run into is that each deferred account is going to be subject to its own rmd 's required minimum distributions when you 've retired or hit 70.5 years of age   roth 's do n't generally care about rmd 's at first but are still subject to them once the person that created the roth has passed   having fewer accounts will simplify the rmd stuff but that 's really only a factor in terms of being forced to sell something in each account in order to make the rmd    other than that it 's just a matter of remembering to check each account if you come to a decision that it 's time to liquidate holdings in a given security lest you sell some but forget about the rest of it in another account   and perhaps as chris pointed out maybe having to pay fee 's on each account for the sale   where this really can come into play is if you choose to load up each individual account with a given kind of investment instead of spreading them across the accounts   in that case rmd 's could force you into selling something that is currently down when you want to hold onto it because that is your only choice in order to meet rmd 's for account x.   so if you have multiple accounts it 's a good idea to not particular vehicles into a single account but spread similar across multiple accounts so you always have the choice in each account of what to sell in order to meet an rmd if you have fewer accounts it 's thus a lot easier to avoid the effect

excellent answers so far so i will just add one additional consideration liquidity money invested in a mutual fund exclusive of retirement accounts with early withdrawal penalties has a relatively high liquidity whereas excess equity in your home from paying down early has very low liquidity to put it simply if you get in a desperate situation long term unemployment it is better to have to cash in a mutual fund than try to sell your house on the quick and move in with your mother liquidity becomes less of an issue if you also manage to fund a decent sized rainy day fund 6 9 months of living expenses

if your financial needs are n't complex and mostly limited to portfolio management consider looking into the thing called robo advisers proper term is automated investing services   the difference is that robo advisers use software to manage portfolios on a large scale generating big economy of scale and therefore offering a much cheaper services than personal advisor would and unless your financial needs are extremely complex the state of the art of scaled up portfolio management is at the point that a human advisor really does n't give you any value add and as other answers noted human advisor can easily bring in downsides such as conflict of interest and lack of fiduciary responsibility   disclaimer i indirectly derive my living from a company which derives a very small part of their income from a robo adviser therefore there 's a possible small conflict of interest in my answer

what you 're looking for is expected value let 's say you invest $ 1000 in option a and later discover that you are going to lose 20   so the expected value of option a is $ 800 if option b has a 50 chance of losing 50 and a 50 of gaining 20 then your expected value is $ 650 $ 650 = $ 1000 50 50 + 50 20 $ 800 > $ 650 so you should stay with option a. in the real world you usually do n't know the exact odds and percentages so substitute in your best guesses   this may lead to suboptimal results but only if your estimations are wrong the formula itself is ideal

you add the wash sale loss to your cost basis for the other transaction so you would have two entries in your schedule d reporting 1 listing the $ 2000 loss as a wash 2 the cost basis for your second transaction is thus $ = $ 3000 so when it was sold for $ 2000 you now have a reportable loss of $ 1000 for more information see here

best buy 's customer service is the sole reason i will never set foot in one of their stores ever again     several years and two tvs ago i purchased a floor model on sale   while i did n't expect much it was cheap   one of the things i asked specifically about was the remote   the salesman assured me the remote was there   i said okay and we got the thing off the wall and he went looking for the remote for 30 minutes   came back with a remote with the same brand as the tv and said here it is it was   we did some rudimentary tests in store power on channel flip etc   seemed to work   got it home remote only worked for those basic functions power channel volume   anything else did n't including the number pad or the various launch netflix buttons etc   did some research the remote was for a different line   so i went back to best buy with the remote and told my tale   i asked for the reasonable   the remote for the tv itself or for best buy to order the remote from the manufacturer   it was literally a $ 20 part which i could 've done but they said they 'd take care of it   i even had the part number and shit   all they had to do was call the number give them a card and a shipping address and i would've been happy   i got delivered to my door in order   one order cod to my home   i refused delivery a box with 3 the same model as the one i originally got which was not the right remote   i sent those back a box with a universal remote really nice but i already had one by that point i sent it back a we 're sorry letter and a coupon for like 20 up to $ 500 at best buy   i sealed it back up and wrote return to sender not a remote on it and sent it back   finally after almost three months a lady from the office of the president at best buy called me apologized in a rep from the manufacturer and ordered the fucking remote with me on the phone     i can only image the amount of money and time they wasted trying to save $ 20     fuck 'em

note i have no experience of attempting what is described below neither am i a lawyer nor an accountant the process may range from a small bureaucratic hurdle to a complex legal nightmare if it seems a plausible approach you would probably be well advised to reach out to others that have established for help and guidance according to this hmrc page the two ways a body can claim gift aid is if either it is a recognised charity or if it is a community amateur sports club casc so one option may be to try and establish a casc i suspect that this is unlikely to be an easy process but may be a more likely approach than trying to get the council to establish a charity the register as a community amateur sports club casc page on the hmrc site very briefly describes the steps as you can see from their eligibility criteria to register as a casc you would first have to create a sports club of some form that has a formal constitution is open to the whole community and has affordable membership fees is on an amateur basis provides facilities in the uk is managed by fit and proper persons you would probably need the co operation of the local council to allow the proposed sports club the use of the local park one of the several requirements of becoming a casc is that it must so it could in theory be possible to spend money raised through both membership fees and gift aid qualifying donations on the improving the facilities of the park tennis courts bowling green etc however note that how to register page mentions among many other requirements the need to provide accounts from the last 12 months and bank statements from the last 3 months it does n't as far as i can see explicitly state that the club must have been in existence for 12 months before applying for casc status it might be possible to send only what you have but be aware that you may need to establish the club and let it operate under its own steam for a period before applying

i probably know more about both business and drugs than you 'd assume    but there are a lot of jobs where it 's not a big deal i understand that most companies who drug test do so for liability because their insurance requires it when workplace injuries are reported and that they have to cover their asses so that the insurance wil pay out    and operating machinery equipment etc while high is the same as doing so while drunk or otherwise impaired but we do n't keep employees from drinking on weekends and current drug test policies do n't do much to keep employees from popping pills or doing meth on weekends either so they 're weeding out a lot of pot smokers while still hiring people who use harder drugs   i 've worked at one job that was all about mid week drug tests to screen out marijuana users but where people were pretty open about abusing prescription pills and other drugs   i 've worked in a law office where cocaine and adderall were openly abused with higher level associates offering to hook me up if i needed a source for either and i 've worked in sales positions where those same drugs were pretty openly used and talked about    and yes plenty of corporate and pill would look down on pot smokers too and try to tell you that their drug of choice made them more productive

exactly what you do with the money depends on various personal choices you 'll have to make for yourself   investing your money in vanguard index funds such as the ones you mentioned is certainly one smart move   however i think you 're quite right to be suspicious of an advisor with a 1 fee   in many cases such advisors are not worth their costs   the thing to remember is that typically with that type of fee structure you always pay the costs even if the advisor turns out to be wrong and your money does n't grow one thing to check is whether the advisor you mentioned is paid only by the fees he charges a fee only financial planner or whether he also makes money via the sales of financial products   some advisors earn money by selling you financial products such as mutual funds which can create a conflict of interest   you can read about fee only financial advisors and choosing a financial advisor on investopedia

i live in one of the highest cost of living areas in my country   for the cost of less than half the down payment my spouse and i have saved up for a house we could easily buy a home in most of the lower cost of living areas and several homes in say detroit as for the rest of your question though we 've chosen not to live that way   because like all high cost of living areas ours is near a city there are more free and inexpensive things to do than you would think at first   while others in our area think a great time is pre gaming drinks at a nice bar an expensive restaurant then some more drinks we 've taught ourselves how to make great meals from scratch using sale and inexpensive ingredients from the grocery store and often do that on weekends topped off by a movie from the that we promptly return the next day   we have chosen friends who will hang out with us over dinners and board games instead of out on the town   on weekend days we visit free do hikes wander around downtown strips or play at the local parks   our groceries as i mentioned are sale items or use coupons and we go for less expensive meats and produce   we visit our local farmer 's market for fun not to buy the expensive produce   we might find ourselves wandering through the mall to window shop but when it comes time to actually buy clothing or goods for the apartment we shop around for up to months to find a good deal plenty of our friends have money enough to spend and the most debt they are usually in is a big car payment no consumer debt   at the same time i have trouble imagining some of them buying a house any time soon because they simply ca n't be saving all that much since i know their incomes   they may eventually be able to afford a condo and ride rising housing prices to a and then a house it 's what lots of people do around here loosing buckets money in realtor fees and closing costs along the way   even with these choices it 's hard to view my friends as selfish knowing that most of them give around 10 of their income to charity there are probably plenty of people around here swimming in debt somebody recently asked in a q&a with the local paper editors how she could stop going to the city 's most expensive restaurants and start living within her means when she only liked expensive places but lots of folks can stretch themselves and afford to get by while wasting a lot of money   it 's not what my spouse and i have chosen to do because we want to be able to live very responsibly and plan for a rainy day but the longer you live with and around the money that tends to high cost of living areas the more it will seem normal to you also if it 's really $ 1000/mo for a 2 br apartment your cost of living is still lower than mine is if i were you i would n't try to myself to the habits of your surroundings   instead i 'd find friends who are frugal and work on maintaining your good financial habits   if you ever want one of those $ 4 $ 5 or $ 6 k plus houses you 're going to need them

payment such as square do not normally withhold tax it is up to you to pay the appropriate tax at tax time that having been said square does report your payments to the irs on a form 1099-k if your payments are large enough according to square you 'll get a 1099-k from them if your total payments for the year add up to $ 20,000 and more than 200 transactions   whether or not they report on a 1099-k you are required to pay the appropriate taxes on your income   so now the question becomes do i have to pay income tax on the proceeds from my garage sale and the answer to that question is usually not when you sell something that you previously purchased if you sell it for more than you paid for it you have a capital gain and need to pay tax on that however generally you sell things in a garage sale at a loss meaning that there is no tax due   if you make more than $ 20,000 at your garage sale and the irs gets a 1099-k the irs might be curious as to how you did that with no capital gain so if you sell any big ticket items a for example you should keep a record of what you paid for it so you can show the loss to the irs in the event of an audit

in the u.s. at least a lot of these coinstar machines are now owned and operated by the store or other venue in which they 're placed as a convenience to customers and the fee for using it is waived   these machines even without a fee attached are still beneficial to the store for two reasons first they bring in potential customers the machine usually spits out a ticket that you take to the cashier meaning you pass by all the impulse items they put in the checkout lines and someone using the change will invariably pick up a pack of gum or a magazine to spend your newfound wealth the fact that one store has a change machine while another does n't can also be the difference between choosing that store over the other for a planned shopping trip second and less obvious a store that owns a coinstar machine has full access to the change people put in it hey they own the machine and are paying out cash on the receipts it spits out during normal use of a cash drawer or register to take in money large bills $ 20/20 € or larger are accumulated to be broken small to medium bills 1 10 units stay roughly static in number as payments are made and larger bills are broken and coins are invariably depleted as change is paid out this means the average retail store needs a constant incoming supply of coinage and that generally happens either through armored car service or similar commercial banking which costs the store money or through change like machines which usually ca n't supply all the needed denominations the coinstar machine effectively reverses at least a portion of this attrition of coins and accumulation of large bills the store can now receive coins and pay out large bills as a part of its day to day business reducing or even eliminating the need to have a bank or armored car perform this service anyway check and see whether the coinstar machine you last used is still operating on a percentage fee basis it might be the case that the store has purchased the machine outright and is offering its services free of charge if not look around other stores may be waiving the coinstar fee where this one is n't or they may have similar non coinstar branded machines lastly as other answers have mentioned if you cash out in the form of a gift card there 's no fee so you can pick a gift card to a store you 're likely to visit anyway in the u.s. there are a lot of good choices like home improvement stores starbucks major department stores clothing retailers and even an airline

short answer absolutely not unless you 're comfortable with putting years of your labor into a depreciating asset that will incur hefty maintenance costs over its remaining life i.e. consider your 10 k gone forever once you buy the car and then some some comments on your reasons keeping up with spoiled brats is a losing proposition and is a mindset counterproductive to financial independence i 'd encourage you to find a way to not care about how the spoiled brats live their lives it wo n't be easier when you 're older and you see your peers driving fancy cars and living fantasy lifestyles that you are tempted to emulate break the impulse to keep up and you 'll be in a much better place a used bmw may not be a piece of junk at first but once you hit 100 k miles everything will suddenly fall apart and need repair been there myself still have the car after 7 years only because very few people want to buy a high mileage german sport sedan with recurring maintenance issues see 2 it will be a good drive for a while then it will own you this is not so bad when you have a decent amount of savings but when you have nothing it 's very hard to truly enjoy the car while knowing that any problems not covered by warranty will be financially devastating are you prepared to ride the bus for 4 weeks while saving enough income from work to replace a bad clutch i had to do this and it 's not something i brag about

good grief   ask a republican to define their terminology to avoid conflict and confusion and you get labeled a liberal   honestly the stupid labeling thing is one of the most and idiotic parts of our political discourse these day   the idea here is to remove obfuscation so we can get to the point   clarify yourself   you have declared paying government employees better than others is waste   you ’ve also declared the current government delivery system is waste   but the whole system is not waste   parse it out     you do n’t want people paid more than a business can afford right   so there is no financial loss   you do n’t want a system in place that ca n’t afford to pay for itself now or in the foreseeable future after all everyone should have a chance to recover right   but when you say there is waste in the government i have to be sure you are discussing complete value including social educational technological national military and not just budget   this is important because my arguments hinge on the non budget side whereas yours seem to focus on the financial aspects    not that these are the whole of either of our views   they are simply the focuses we have used in this discussion   so stop with the cheap and we ’ll continue   there are many wasteful aspects of the government   i agree with that    it there are many things the go does that private industry either ca n’t or wo n’t do   biggest of these is corporations will not go out of their way to protect their citizens   they will do what they are paid to do and nothing else   the postal service will probably never be closed or privatized if it were however i would love too see how the cost of delivery and the pay for delivery employees are affected   i agree the question of why government waste exists is the most important   but in order to see it clearly we must get a lay of the land   we need to review two edge cases   1 where is the most waste   why is it so extreme here   2 where is the least waste   why is this part of the government more efficient   then we can inspect the different influences in each system and explore why efficiency is n’t enforced or encouraged in so many government areas and what can be done to improve efficiency or if it is an area that the nation would do better with privatization instead

an option by definition is a guess about the future value of the stock if you guess too aggressively you lose the purchase price of the option if you guess too conservatively you may not take the option or may not gain as much as you might have you need to figure out what you expect to happen and how confident you are about it against the cost of taking the option and be reasonably confident that the change in the stock 's value will be at least large enough to cover the cost of buying into the game opinion unless you 're comfortable with expectation values and bell curves around them it 's significantly easier to lose money on options than to profit on them and i 'm not convinced that even statisticians can really do this well i 've always been told that the best use for options is hedging an investment you 've already made treating them as your primary bet is gambling not investment

when you withdraw money from an rrsp account it is added to your current year 's taxable income it does not matter what year the money was previously deposited in if you deposited money into an rrsp this year and withdrew the same amount of money then the net effect is that you have $ 5000 rrsp contribution and $ 5000 extra income and the two effects should cancel out the only remaining effect is that you wasted $ 5000 of contribution room which can never be regained the exception to this rule is that after 90 days you can withdraw funds from an rrsp for the hbp and llp without adding to your taxable income

to be clear a 401 k is a vehicle you make investments within it if you choose poorly such as say putting all your money into company stock when working for the next enron you can still get hurt badly   so it is important to have diversity and an appropriate risk level based on your age tolerance for risk etc that said as vehicles go it is outstanding and the always max your 401 k is very very common advice for a large number of investing professionals cfa 's pundits etc   that said there are a few priorities to consider here first priority if there is some level of company matching grab that it 's hard to beat that kind of return in almost any other case second since you never want to tap into a 401 k if you can at all avoid it before you are ready to retire you should first be sure you have a good emergency fund set aside in the event you lose your job or some other major happens   many recommend setting aside at least 6 months of basic living expenses    third if you have any high interest debt like credit card debt pay that stuff down as fast as you can   you 'll save a ton of interest it 's pretty much the same as investing the money you use to pay it down and getting a return equal to the interest rate you are paying with zero risk ca n't be beat   you 'll also end up with a lot better cash flow and the ability to start saving first and spending out of savings so you earn interest instead of paying it once you have those things out of the way then it is time to think about fully funding the   401k.   and keep in mind since you do n't pay taxes on it the felt effect to you pocket is about 80 or even less of what goes into the account so it 's not as painful as you might think and the hit to your take home may be less than you 'd expect   contributing as much as you can as early as you can also lets you benefit from the effect of compounding and has a far larger affect on the balance than money put into the account closer to retirement   so if you can afford to max it out i surely would advise you to do so

when dividend is announced the stock and option price may react to that news but the actual payout of the dividend on the ex dividend date is what you probably are referring to the dividend payout affects the stock price on the ex dividend date as the stock price will drop by the amount of paid out dividend not taking into account other factors this in turn drives the prices of all options   the amount of change in the option price for this event is not only dependent the dividend payout but also on how far these are in our out of the money and what there time to expiration is the price of a call option that is far out of the money would react less than the price of a put that would be far in the money therefore i would argue that these two will not necessarily offset each other

so i will attempt to answer the other half of the question since people have given good feedback on the mortgage costs of your various options assumptions    it is certain that i am off on some or all of these assumptions but they are still useful for drawing a comparison    if you were to make your mortgage payment then contribute whatever you have left over to savings this is where you would be at the end of 30 years wait so the 30 year mortgage has me contributing $ 40k less to savings over the life of the loan but comes out with a $ 20k higher balance   yes because of the way compounding interest works getting more money in there faster plays in your favor but only as long as your savings venue is earning at a higher rate than the cost of the debt your are it with if we were to drop the yield on your savings to 3 then the 30yr would net you $ while the 15yr ends up with $ in the bank   similarly if we were to increase the savings yield to 10 not unheard of for a strong mutual fund the 30yr nets $ while the 15yr comes out at $   yes in all cases you pay more to the bank on a 30yr mortgage but as long as you have a decent investment portfolio and are making the associated contributions your end savings come out ahead over the time period   which sounds like it is the more important item in your overall picture however just to reiterate the key to making this work is that you have an investment portfolio that out performs the interest on the loan   rule of thumb is if the debt is costing you more than the investment will reliably earn pay the debt off first   in reality you need your investments to out perform the interest on your debt + inflation to stay ahead overall   personally i would be looking for at least an 8 annual return on your investments and go with the 30 year option disclaimer all investments involve risk and there is no guarantee of making any given earnings target

i do n't think you can compare savings accounts and peer to peer lending the former is a liquid way of stashing some money away iow you can get at it pretty much any time you want whereas the latter is extremely illiquid you only get your money back if and when the loan has been repaid also as mentioned by the other posters there is a risk attached to p2p lending even if the borrowers are vetted by the p2p lending platform you 're essentially taking the same risks that a bank would take when writing a couple of personal loans and that 's quite far removed from a safe haven for your cash if you have enough money to invest not save invest then it might be worth putting a small amount into p2p lending but it 's anything but an alternative to a savings account

the previous answers have raised very good points but i believe one facet of this has been neglected while it 's true that the total accessible supply of gold keeps rather slowly as was mentioned earlier the fact remains that gold like oil is a non renewable natural resource so at some point we are going to run out of gold to mine due to this fact i believe gold will always be highly valued of course it can certainly always fluctuate in value in fact i expect in the reasonably near future to see a decline in the price of gold due to investors selling it en masse to re enter the stock market when the economy has recovered more substantially

one topic that i 've been trying to learn more about is the affects of the low interest rates on businesses and the economy from quantitative easing due to the amount of free money corporations have received over the last 5 years there has been a few interesting consequences there are several corporations that have borrowed money at little to no interest with the feds intentions of seeing it go back into the economy however instead corporations have used it to buy back stock which was not necessarily the plan in the first place you could definitely have a unique thesis written about something within that flow of funds if that makes no sense apologies stupid undergrad here

this might sound absurd but japan has a lot of debt held by itself in other words when people say a country is just printing money it 's rarely true it 's often some kind of beyond being issued and sold to the public or to institutions but in japan 's case they actually did print money and have done so for 30 years yet they 've had a deflation almost every year since this shows that expanding the money supply does n't always result in inflation it depends a lot on the country and its people and means of production i guess japan 's move to cut the debt is a step into unknown territory and we ca n't really know what will happen

a real simple definition or analogy of present value would be the principal or loan amount being lent and the future value as being returning the principal along with cost of borrowing the is the interest you earn on present value the is the interest you pay on future value the first one is the or future value of a $ 1 the second one is the or present value of a $ 1 both these interest factors assume interest is paid annually if the interest payment is made more often within the payment year then interest factors look this way m is the frequency of interest payment the higher this frequency the more of interest you pay or earn and you pay or earn the most interest when compounding occurs on each small fraction of time this entails here e is the 's e   thus the interest factors turn to this the examples only considered a single repayment at future date now if you were obliged to make periodic loan repayments say in amount of $ 1 for n number of periods then the present value of all such periodic payment is the principal or amount you borrowed this is the sum of discounted periodic payments as   if we replace with x then this turns out to be geometric series of the form this simplifies to   replacing for x we get which is the present value of periodic payment in amount of $ 1 the future value of periodic payments in amount of $ 1 can be arrived at multiplying the by giving once again the interest is compounded per annum and for intra year compounding you would have to at first find the annual effective yield to use as the effect rate is the and calculation for continuous compounding all the calculation discussed thus far did not take inflation into consideration if we were to adjust the amounts for a growth of then the present value of a $ 1 would be as follow once again you would have to use if compounding frequency of interest is intra year now assume that each loan repayment increases or decreases by an extra amount q per period to find the present value of series of payments p that increase or decrease per period by an amount q we would do the following calculations here and all of these calculations have been available in add in for finance and incrementally being offered as javascript financial functions library please note that the tad series of the financial functions library for various environments such as excel javascript php ruby and others are property of the author writing this post all of these libraries except one for excel are available for free for public use and the future value of such payments with increments may be found by multiplying the pv by as follows here

yes it 's called executive hedging and it 's a lot more common than most people know as long as it 's properly disclosed and the decision is based on publicly available information there 's technically nothing wrong with it   enron and are the most notable companies that had executives do it on a large scale but almost every company has or had executives execute a complex form of hedging known as a prepaid variable forward in a the executive gives his shares to an investment bank in exchange for a percentage of cash up front the bank then uses the executive shares to hedge in both directions for them this provides a proxy that technically is n't the executive that needs to disclose   there 's talk about it needing to be more public at the sec right now

gt the system is designed   would n't that be more the union is designed why not just end the union 's contract entirely and hire from outside the union or find a different union to negotiate with maybe someone wants to form a union of teachers who want to teach that focuses on job security for the best teachers not the longest serving   i mean if i was negotiating for myself i 'd want merit based pay increases rather than seniority based i 'd probably also be asking that my health benefits be the same as the district administration i might ask for a clause saying that i ca n't be fired unless all worse performing teachers have already been fired yeah about measuring that have n't figured that out yet i might also ask for some sort of third party policy for representation in the event that there 's a need to lawyer up under circumstances where a conflict of interest exists between myself and the district   the last of those the lawyer issue i 've been told by at least one teacher that they feel that 's the primary service the union provides they hate the contract negotiations because they always seem to go to threats to strike before being resolved   i guess it just seems weird to me that once a union has formed the union has a monopoly on providing the services you 'd think that some could join the union while others could choose to operate independently if the advantages of being in the union outweigh the advantages of being independent then you 'd expect everybody to join a 51 vote to unionize seems like a terrible reason to bring the rest of the employees and any new hire along for the ride it should be an individual 's choice to be represented by the union and whether to accept the union terms or negotiate on their own

another factor to consider beyond the fact that growth and volatility go together is that the times when many people will need to liquidate their investments will correlate with the times that many other people need to liquidate their investments and such correlation will push down the immediate value of those investments while certificates of deposit have penalties for early withdrawal one can establish up front what the worst case penalty would be for cashing it in at the most inopportune time   by contrast stocks offer no such assurance   stocks sometimes have weird downward spikes that may be short lived but if life circumstances force one to liquidate stocks during such a downward spike the penalty can be much larger than on a cd

just for clarification my perspective on education background is from a front office associate at a bb that interacts with the traders and analysts at other bb 's and hf 's daily many of whom have become good friends   take it for what you will   it 's not my role to tell you which is right for you but i can definitely give an honest perspective of which is far more common    gt there were people who passed l3 last year    does n't take into account the number of these that were already mba holders quite a larger percent as mba has become less competitive and a cfa is required to demonstrate the quantitative capacity of a mba holder   this is a huge factor in the skew of your numbers as mba 's have become dime a dozen mba holders are now being expected to hold a ms or get a cfa to establish that their quantitative skills are qualified for working on modern day wall st front office roles   gt and became charter holders   wrong   passing l3 does n't automatically make you a charterholder   you need the 48 months of approved experience in portfolio management investment analysis or market research   these roles are becoming more and more exclusive to target graduates and mba holders so the likelihood of a cfa charterholder already having a mba is actually increasing   gt now lets just take the top 25 mba programs that 'd be 460 people class graduating to reach this number actual numbers are much lower than this   clearly you do n't realize the graduate enrollment levels at target schools   lets take a look at full time enrollment meaning 1/2 graduates each year for the top 10 for finance   wharton     nyu   columbia mit   stanford   harvard   uc   ucla   750 northwestern     that 's averaging graduates year per school at the top 10 schools for finance   to argue that there are no graduates from unc duke usc cornell dartmouth yale rice etc on wall st would be ignorance in its form   gt trust me i 'm a big fan of the cfa    you might be a fan but clearly you do n't know much about the exam keep reading and you 'll see why   gt but i know some really dumb people who are charter holders because they learned to memorize a test   memorize a test   you can def argue that for l1 not for l2 or l3   there 's a reason there 's such a collective failure amongst candidates that pass 1 and move on to l2 and l3   l2 requires critical scenario understanding of the concepts more than the formulas itself   it tests your ability to understand complex and unique fra such as repatriated foreign delta 's on cash flows not just memorizing a formula and regurgitating   l3 is even more removed from just formulas as requiring detailed essay responses   3 hour section with 10 15 essay questions yeah sounds like formula memorizing /s   gt these same people would never get admitted to a top 10 no less 25 mba program   this is an irrelevant point   there are plenty of top 10 and top 25 mba program grad 's that would n't pass the cfa either   both emphasize different skillsets   front office wall st is becoming more and more geared towards ms holders and cfa charters many mba 's holders and mba programs lack the quantitative focus to take these roles and are being denied   gt;one thing i will give you there are way too many mbas in general partially because of all the part time night time executive ones but an mba is very different then a cfa in that its banded by school and category   absolutely   that reinforces my entire point that mba 's are dime a dozen   what are we arguing about again   mba 's are very different than a cfa in that even within target schools they each emphasize on entirely different skills   mit finance mba grads are far more likely to possess strong quantitative than say a harvard mba   the reason is that the cfa is a standard qualification that focuses entirely on quantitative capacity it is like a ms in the sense that its a mile deep and a foot wide whereas mba 's are a foot deep and a mile wide   gt everyone with a cfa has the same cfa however a wharton degrees sure carries a lot more clout than a one   you 're right   but a cfa is n't meant to be comparable and interchangeable with a wharton degree   the cfa 's closest comparison is a ms in quantitative computational finance   so if you 're trying to say cfa is less valuable than a mba it 's apples and oranges   you never will see a job require a mba or cfa the cfa will always be listed on a job role as preferred ms cfa   try comparing cfa against a ms from columbia or carnegie mellon grad and you might have valid results

i believe you are missing a complete aspect of figuring out price points you completely disregarded how price affects perceived quality people generally assume that higher price means higher quality pricing too low will give many people the impression that at that price it could n't be very good and do n't buy the product as a result   crown royal became crown royal after being a mediocre brand they did n't change the way they made whiskey instead they raised the price by 400 now it was viewed as a premium product simply because of it 's price   while i do n't want to knock your view of tycoon games but it 's just a game with one point of view it 's not the real world it 's just what a programmer thought would make the game interesting i sure would n't consider it to be some source of great business wisdom   look at what really happens taking video game consoles and games as an example they start at a high price point this makes it prestigious to own when that price point becomes saturated meaning everyone that is going to buy at the price already has they lower the price a little and do the same then when everyone that can afford that price has bought one they lower it again eventually it gets to a point where almost anyone can afford   this style taps the market for every price point and is much better model than the one you suggest there are many things that use this model like car sales the end of a model year is the time to buy because everyone that was willing to pay the full price already had and they need to move them off the lot to make room for new cars that will have a higher price point   so i do n't buy into your theory at all   edit grammatical error

for various reasons real estate prices exhibit far more memory than stock prices   the primary reason for this is that real estate is much less liquid   transaction costs for stock trading are on the order of 10 basis points 0.1 whereas a real estate transaction will typically have total costs including title lawyers brokers engineers etc of around 5 of the amount of the transaction   a stock transaction can be executed in milliseconds whereas real estate transactions typically take months   thus today 's behavior is a much better indicator of future price behavior for real estate than for stocks

you ask about traditional ira vs taxable non retirement investment account   you already know about tax deductible iras which are similar mostly to your 401(k a traditional ira can have a non deducted component in a sense it then functions similar to the fully pre tax ira as it grows tax free but then withdrawals are made and taxes paid on the pro rated not yet taxed money   it also offers the simple conversion to a roth ira for those who have no current ira with pre tax money a conversion will be tax free for those with an existing pretax ira conversions are prorated for tax due if the account had say $ 10,000 and $ 5,000 was post tax any conversion will have half taxed at your marginal rate

federal tax refund is taxes you 've overpaid what you 're saying is that this year you overpaid less than before i do n't understand why you see this is as a bad thing optimal situation is when you have no refunds and no taxes due on tax day but it is really hard to get there but the closer you can get the better which means that reducing your refund should be your goal in any case federal tax refund is meaningless what you need to look at is your actual taxes due this is the number you should be working to reduce is it possible to shift the amounts on a w-2 with correct adjustments to tax all of your wages instead of leaving some of it deducted pre tax why would you want to pay more tax if your goal is to have a refund i.e. it is your way of forcing yourself to save then you need to recalculate the numbers and adjust your w4 taking the pre tax fsa into account if it is not the goal then you should be looking at the total taxes owed not the refund and adjust your w4 so that your withholding would cover the taxes owed as closely as possible and to answer your question after all this of course it is possible but it is wrong and will indeed likely to trigger an audit you can write whatever you want on your tax return but in the end of it you sign under the penalty of perjury that what you filled is the correct information perjury is a federal felony and knowingly filing incorrect tax return is fraud especially since your motive is to gain even though you 're not actually gaining anything fraudulent tax returns can be audited any time no statute of limitations

money and wealth are two different things   money is an item that can be used as a store of wealth and as a convenient medium of exchange but it 's not the same thing as wealth   if you have a lot of money then you have a lot of wealth   but you can have a lot of wealth in the form of for example real estate company ownership financial assets and loans and physical capital and not have a lot of money there is a very very large amount of money in the world so bitcoin would have to appreciate in an extreme way in order to replace the other forms of money   in that case someone owning a lot of bitcoin will be pretty rich   but having half the world 's money is a much smaller thing than having half the world 's wealth your inflation question is n't real clear to me   because bitcoin is not kept in banks and lent out a bitcoin user in your proposed world creates inflation when they spend their bitcoins increasing demand for goods and services   this increased demand drives up the price of those goods and services   prices react pretty quickly so it seems like the effect of an increase in the effective money supply the bitcoins actually being used rather than hoarded would have a similar effect when spent quickly as slowly   think of it this way if you are buying the first few thousand could be had cheaply at walmart and amazon   then you would have to go to more and more expensive sources to get them   eventually you would run out of sources and have to have them special made at yet higher expense   it 's not the time that raised the prices but the actual purchasing behavior   same thing is true of houses yachts islands or whatever else a very rich hypothetical person might buy

five years is too short to be able to safely invest the money in any productive manner you 're saving not investing part of the problem is that you do n't have all the money right now and you 'll need to add to it over the next few years until you have enough for a down payment see the notes under cds and bonds below for why this is a problem the universe of options as for the roth as duffbeer703 said i 'm not sure it 's worth the hassle and risk that you 'll want the money sooner and be forced to wait e.g. you end up with enough money in 4.25 years for a house that you want but you have to wait 9 months to be able to tap the roth as noted above the yields are so low that the losses to taxes are n't really going to amount to much on $ 10k you 're looking at $ 150 max earnings and losing maybe $ 40 of it to taxes annually so avoiding taxes wo n't shrink your time horizon by any meaningful amount i 'd just open a high yield savings account and start dumping money in keep an eye on shorter term 1yr cd rates and if they go above the savings yield and the timing is right then take advantage of it

i work on a buy side firm so i know how these small data issues can drive us crazy hope my answer below can help you   reason for price difference 1 vendor and data source basically data providers such as google and yahoo redistribute eod data by aggregating data from their vendors although the raw data is taken from the same exchanges different vendors tend to collect them through different trading platforms for example yahoo is getting stock data from which was acquired by morningstar which is not the most accurate source of eod stocks google gets data from deutsche   to make the process more complicated each vendor can choose to get eod data from another eod data provider or the exchange itself or they can produce their own open high low close and volume from the actual trade tick data and these data may come from any exchanges   2 price adjustment   for equities data the re distributor usually adjusts the raw data by applying certain customized procedures this includes adjustment for corporate actions such as dividends and splits for futures data rolling is required and back ward and for rolling can be chosen different adjustment methods can lead to different price display   3 extended trading hours   along with the growth of electronic trading many market tends to trade during extended hours such as pre open and post close trading periods futures and fx markets even trade around the clock this leads to another freedom in price reporting whether to include the price movement during the extended trading hours    conclusion to cross verify the true price we should always check the price from the exchange where the asset is actually traded given the convenience of getting eod data nowadays this task should be easy to achieve   in fact for professional traders and investors alike they will never reply price on free providers such as yahoo and google they will most likely choose bloomberg reuters etc however for personal use yahoo and google should both be good choices and the difference is small enough to ignore

source see if you have access to it convertible notes are often used by angel investors who wish to fund businesses without establishing an explicit valuation of the company in which they are investing     when an investor purchases equity in a startup the purchase price of the equity implies a company valuation   for example if an investor purchases a 10 per cent ownership stake in a company and pay $ 1 m for that stake this implies that the company is worth $ 10 m some early stage investors may wish to avoid placing a value on the company in this way because this in turn will affect the terms under which later stage investors will invest in the company   convertible notes are structured as loans at the time the investment is made   the outstanding balance of the loan is automatically converted to equity when a later equity investor appears under terms that are governed by the terms set by the later stage equity investor   an equity investor is someone who purchases equity in a company suppose an angel investor invests $ 100,000 using a convertible note   later an equity investor invests $ 1 m and receives 10 of the company 's shares   in the simplest possible case the initial angel investor 's convertible note would convert to 1/10th of the equity investor 's claim   depending on the exact structure of the convertible note however the angel investor may also receive extra shares to compensate them for the additional risk associated with being an earlier investor the worst case scenario would be if the issuing company initially performed well meaning that the debt would be converted into shares and subsequently went bankrupt the converted shares would become worthless but the holder of the note would no longer have any recourse will twitter have to sell their offices and liquidate staff to close this debt this depends on the of the debt debt is serviced according to seniority the higher seniority debts will be paid off first and then only the lower seniority debts be serviced this will all be in the agreements when you enter into a transaction when you say liquidate staff you mean sell off their assets and not sell their staff into slavery

you are suggesting something called dollar cost averaging or its cousin dollar value averaging   this is certainly a valid investment strategy although personally i feel that for long term investment it is not necessary unless you plan on being an active trader i still strongly encourage you to research these two methods and see if they would work well for your personal investment strategy and goals as far as what sorts of investments for a taxable account i have three general recommendations as far as which company to use for your brokerage i personally have accounts at price and fidelity i would strongly recommend fidelity out of those three mostly due to customer service and quality and ease of use of their website vanguard is a great brokerage but you do n't have to choose them just because you plan to mostly invest in vanguard funds i also recommend you research how capital gains and dividend taxing works and things like lost harvesting so that you can structure your investments with taxes in mind do this ahead of time do n't wait until april of 2016 because it will be too late to save on taxes by then

they have forever to collect a balance from you   furthermore they can add whatever penalties and fees they wish to increase that balance   worst of all they do n't have to remind you or send you bills or any other notification   you owed it when you left the office   there very well could be local laws that require notifications but that is n't really the issue here that dentist has every right to deny you service until you settle the account   forever the statute of limitations on collecting that debt via court which covers the rules on how long they have to collect the debt   owing the money is one thing but the rules and tools that you creditor has to collect the debt are another   you are probably worried about them suing you but if you do n't pay the debt or settle in some way that dentist can refuse to provide services to you even if they write off the debt ways you can be punished by your dentist for not paying the bill are depending on your jurisdiction and/or type of debt they typically only report it on your credit if they are reporting at all for 7 years   even if you pay and settle the account it will still be reported on your credit report for 7 years   the difference is how it is reported   they can report that is a super reliable person who always pays debts on time   they can say is a who pays but takes a while to pay   or they can say is a bad person to provide services before collecting money because do n't pay bills other people considering lending you money are going to read these opinions and decide accordingly if they want to deal with you or not and they can say that for 7 years   the idea of credit reporting is that you settle up as soon as possible and get your credit report to reflect the truth one popular way to collect a debt to is to sue you for it   there each state has a different time period on how long a creditor has to sue you for a debt if you pay part of the debt that will often reset the clock on the statute of limitations so be sure any partial or negotiated settlements state very clearly in writing that payment is considered payment in full on the debt   then you keep that record forever there are other interesting points in the fair debt collection practices act   see debt collectors calling know your rights   they can only contact you in certain ways they must respond to you in certain ways and they have limits on what they can say who they can say it to and when they can say it   there are protections from mean or vicious bill collectors but that does n't sound like who you are dealing with   i do n't know that the fdcpa is a tool you need to use in this case you should negotiate your debt and try your best to settle up   from your post both parties dropped the ball and both parties should give a little   you should pay no or minor late fees and the doctor should report your credit positively when you do so   if you both made honest mistakes they both parties should acknowledge that and be fair and not defensive this is not legal advice   but you owe the debt so you should settle up   i do n't think it is fair for you to not pay because they did n't mail you a paper   however i also do not think it is fair for the doctor to run up fees and not remind you of the bill finally you did n't bring up insurance or many other details   those details can change the answer

if you have wage income that is reported on a w2 form you can contribute the maximum of your wages what you can afford or $ 5500 in a roth ira    one advantage of this is that the nominal amounts you contribute can always be removed without tax consequences so a roth ira can be a deep emergency fund i.e. if the choice is $ 2000 in cash as emergency fund or $ 2000 in cash in a 2015 roth ira contribution choice 2 gives you more flexibility and optimistic upside at the risk of not being able to draw on interest gains until you retire or claim losses on your tax return   if you let april 15 2016 pass by without making a roth ira contribution you lose the 2015 limit forever   if you are presently a student and partially employed you are most likely in the lowest marginal tax rate you will be in for decades which utilizes the roth tax game effectively    if you 're estimating a few hundred then what you pick as an investment is going to be less important than making the contributions   that is you can pick any mutual fund that strikes your fancy and be prepared to gain or lose call it $ or pick a single stock and be prepared to lose it all   at some point you need to understand your emotions around volatility and the only tuition for this school is taking a loss and having the presence of mind to examine any panic responses you may have   no reason not to learn this on a few hundred   while it 's not ideal to have losses in a roth a few hundred is not consequential in the long run    if you 're not prepared at this time in your life for the possibility of losing it all or will need the money within a year or few as your edit suggests keep it in cash and try to reduce your expenses to contribute more   can you contribute another $ 100   you will have more money at the end of the year than investment choice will likely return

a common response to poor labour conditions is if you do n't like your job leave and get a better one    however in idaho the state is trying to deregulate aspects of the labour market it 's making it easier for companies to enforce non compete agreements meaning you literally can not leave for a competitor if you do n't like your employer    that 's a natural consequence of labour markets it lets the companies with enormous budgets push around workers who are at the same time having their ability to organise into unions and bargain collectively undermined by companies who use said economic power to lobby against regulations that protect workers    so free market away but do n't convince yourself that a lack of regulation will somehow magically lead to a utopian allocation of resources where everyone gets what they need    in a totally unregulated market the wealth only trickles one way and it 's not down

i think the first step is to get an accountant whose advice you believe your accountant is far better placed to advise you on what sounds like a fairly complicated fairly high stakes corporate arrangement than the internet   i would go back to the accountant and get him to explain in writing what his specific advice is if you still do n't like it absolutely get a second opinion you may also want to speak to a lawyer

yes this is possible the most likely tool to use in this case would be a home equity line of credit heloc this is a line of credit for which the full amount is backed by home equity difference between market and book prices most likely your financial institution will apply a factor to this collateral to account for various risks which will reduce the maximum amount that can be taken as a line of credit

it 's funny how you say they will resort to laws to stop consumers from getting what they want when in reality the so called upstarts are the ones on very thin ice with breaking the law   if you define netflix as an upstart then i can already see that we do n't agree on the same premise and hence further argument is pointless   and for the record was only possible with tv and all the talented people in production   do you really think youtube or netflix will be able to produce a quality show   i think not   like i pointed out everyone is giving too much credit to netflix because it 's easy to stream a show after the risk has already been taken to spend the time and money to produce a show   this is why these upstarts operate on a profitable margin they are eating tv cable 's lunch   i am all for tv i believe that tv will still be around 50 years from now   the internet and tech is very volatile and you never know where it will stand 5 even 10 years from now   in the end people do not want to watch cheap low quality comedy on their iphones   60 inch lcd home theaters are here to stay in peoples homes   maybe it will be streamed via the internet but tv will very much still pull a lot of weight   afterall tv built the industry they deserve to own it     i do n't see the logic and destroying tv to benefit companies like apple or netflix who really have no idea how to even begin on a quality show    this boils down to the fact that people will always consume the cheapest form of entertainment and while this is true   americans are sophisticated enough to distinguish cheap from quality   tv delivers quality and will continue to deliver quality while the internet delivers a few occasional packaged in mediocrity

that 's not what he 's saying at all   basically most of his argument 4 of 6 points is the connection between bond prices and equity prices it 's not particularly interesting but it definitely does n't always apply either if bond yields fall then so too should equity earnings yields if spreads remain relatively constant i.e. higher equity prices additionally if bond yields are low then any future equity growth gets capitalized at a much higher value because discount rates are much lower again not particularly insightful   the two interesting comments were about oil and cash as a of assets at financial institutions both of these are likely linked to falling or low rates above because banks ca n't invest profitably at low rates and hence hold cash and equivalents instead and oil prices are more likely to fall in a low or falling inflation environment implied by the low rates or fed tightening   really i think he s 's saying something more obvious but not necessarily trivial which is if one asset class goes up so too is another related one

you own a fractional share of the company maybe you should care enough to at least read the proxy statements which explain the pro and con position for each of the issues you are voting on that does n't seem like too much to ask on the other hand if you are saying that the people who get paid to be knowledgeable about that stuff should just go make the decisions without troubling you with the details then choose the option to go with their recommendations which are always clearly indicated on the voting form however if you do this it might make sense to at least do some investigation of who you are voting onto that board i guess as said you could just abstain but i 'm not sure how that is any different than just trashing the form as for the idea that proxy votes are tainted somehow the one missing piece of that conspiracy is what those people have to gain are you implying that your broker who has an interest in you making money off your investments and liking them would fraudulently cast proxy votes for you in a way that would harm the company and your return why exactly would they do this i find your stance on the whole thing a bit confusing though you seem to have some strong opinions on corporate governance but at the same time are n't willing to invest any effort in the one place you have any control over the situation i 'm just update per the following information from the sec website it looks like the meaning of a proxy vote can vary depending on the mechanics of the specific issue you are voting on my emphasis added what do for against withhold mean on the proxy card or voter instruction form    depending on what you are voting on    the proxy card or voting instruction    form gives you a choice of voting    for against or abstain or    for or withhold here is an    explanation of the differences election of directors generally    company bylaws or other corporate    documents establish how directors are    elected there are two main types of    ways to elect directors    vote and majority vote a vote means that the    winning candidate only needs to get    more votes than a competing candidate    if a director runs he or    she only needs one vote to be elected    so an against vote is meaningless    because of this shareholders have the    option to express with    a candidate by indicating that they    wish to withhold authority to vote    their shares in favor of the    candidate a substantial number of    withhold votes will not prevent a    candidate from getting elected but it    can sometimes influence future    decisions by the board of directors    concerning director nominees a majority vote means that directors    are elected only if they receive a    majority of the shares voting or    present at the meeting in this case    you have the choice of voting for    each nominee against each nominee    or you can abstain from voting your    shares an abstain vote may or may    not affect a director 's election each    company must disclose how abstain or    withhold votes affect an election in    its proxy statement this information    is often found toward the beginning of    the proxy statement under a heading    such as votes required to adopt a    proposal or how your votes are    counted proposals other than an election of    directors matters other than voting    on the election of directors like    voting on shareholder proposals are    typically approved by a vote of a    majority of the shares voting or    present at the meeting in this    situation you are usually given the    choice to vote your shares for or    against a proposal or to abstain    from voting on it again the effect    of an abstain vote may depend on the    specific voting rule that applies the    company 's proxy statement should again    disclose the effect of an abstain    vote

when evaluating a refinance you need to figure out the payback time refinancing costs money in closing costs the payback time is the time it takes to recover the closing costs with the amount of money you are saving in interest   for example if the closing costs are $ 2,000 your payback time is 2 years if it takes 2 years to save that amount in interest with the new interest rate vs. the old one   to estimate this look at the difference in interest rate between your mortgage and the new one and your mortgage balance for example let 's say that you have $ 100,000 left on your mortgage and the new rate is 1 lower than your current rate in one year you will save roughly $ 1,000 in interest if your closing costs are $ 2,000 then your payback time is somewhere around 2 years if you plan on staying in this house longer than the payback time then it is beneficial to refinance   there are mortgage refinance calculators online that will calculate payback time more precisely   one thing to watch out for when you refinance if you expand the term of your mortgage you might end up paying more interest over the long term even though your rate is less and your monthly payment is less for example let 's say you currently have 8 years left on a 15-year mortgage if you refinance to a new 15-year mortgage your monthly payment will go down but if you only pay the new minimum payment for the next 15 years you could end up paying more in interest than if you had just continued with your old mortgage for the next 8 years to avoid this refinance to a new mortgage with a term close to what you have left on your current mortgage if you ca n't do that continue paying whatever your current monthly payment is after you refinance and you 'll pay your new mortgage early and save on interest

no you will not have to pay taxes on the corpus principal of the trust distribution   if the trust tax forms were filed correctly you might have as much as a $ 9000 loss that will flow to you on the trust 's termination   previously the trust was supposed to file a return each year and either claim the dividends or realized cap gains each year and pay taxes at trust 's rate or distribute them to the beneficiaries via k-1 form this is the best way to handle this as the trust has a steep tax table relative high rates vs the kiddie tax which would let you get nearly $ 1k yr tax free each year as a minor   during that time losses net again gains but ca n't be distributed to the beneficiary they are carried forward year to year in the year the trust is terminated that loss is not lost but it 's then passed on to the beneficiary still via k-1 see schedule k-1 instructions and schedule k-1 itself   on a lighter note the trustee failed you in the 16 years jan 2015 the market s&p grew by 88 with a compound return instead of any gain you got a loss with a return if this were a paid professional you 'd have a potential claim for a lawsuit this is a reason why amateurs should not be assigned the role of trustee   to clearly answer the mix of questions you asked note it 's always a good idea to seek professional advice but the nature of this board is that if any of my answer is n't accurate a high ranked member top 20 or so on this list will likely set me straight within 24 hours

option 2 selling the car yourself will give you the best value especially if you can get its full value this will cost you time but will return much better return for your money also i would strongly recommend buying a used car from a private owner not a dealer rather than buying a new car for $ 14,000 in cash you can probably get a car like a 2013 ford fusion that has excellent all wheel drive and winter handling a new fusion loaded will cost at least $ 25,000 from a dealer if you buy a 2013 car outright from a private owner you will have no payments and can spend that money on investments and build your wealth

one thing i thought of when i heard this was first announced is how theaters actually make money theaters do n’t make much from the movies they show since studios take a huge portion of ticket sales for themselves especially at release theaters make money with concessions and value add services which would still be in full effect even on this movie a day subscription model i ’m no expert in the industry though so i could be completely wrong here but i ’d imagine if theaters have a limitation on the pass in terms of how long a movie must be out before a pass can be used to see it thereby avoiding the super high studio ticket cost then they can still make good money from people dropping 30 bucks for popcorn a drink and candy before they go in to see the movie

are these people making min wage dying en mass no then they are supported i do n't want to sound crude but there really is n't a profession on earth where you do n't have to rough it out for a few years life 's tough the abundance of min wage jobs you speak of are either not as abundant as you think relative to the demand or the minimum wage is already too high relative to the demand either way my scenario in my previous comment holds do things the right way and you will be all set to make more money    staff and wage are all a result of loans given to optimistic short sighted without the steady flow of these kids who can suddenly afford college there would be no    i agree on the rest and the answer is accountability we should start with holding people accountable to the high interest loan they took out 4 years before they hand any income

there is a large market where notes bills bonds are traded so yes you can sell them later   however if interest rates go up the value of any bond that you want to sell goes down because you now have to compete with what someone can get on a new issue so you need to discount the principal value of your bond in order for someone to want to buy it instead of a new bond that has a higher interest rate the reverse applies if interest rates fall although it 's hard to get much lower than they are now   so someone wanting to make money in bonds due to interest rate changes generally wants to buy at higher interest rates and then sell their bonds after rates have gone down   see my answer in this question for more detail why does interest rate go up when bond price goes down to answer is that good the answer depends on perspective

the best advice i can give you is that you need to start on math now*. i made the same mistake as op and did n't realize that going up in finance would require as much math as it does granted i was undergrad finance not marketing like him so maybe it was a little better for me but if you really want to do upper level finance do not on math   it 's easy to fall into the trap doing cal 2 your sophomore year and thinking i wo n't really need this and just doing the minimum to get through it for undergrad that 's true for master 's you 'll need it this happened to me and i suffered a lot because of it your professors in the master 's program will likely give you a crash course in what you need to know but you wo n't have a real understanding of it unless you took and did really well in those math classes beforehand   to answer your question    1 maybe you should definitely take cal 1 early depending on how you can hold on to the information cal 2 can wait a bit so it 's fresher when you start doing upper level finance your second half of junior year senior year   2 upper level finance is a whole different beast from lower level finance same with economics if you 're not good at math if you do n't enjoy math it might not be the best choice i 'm not good at math and the undergrad finance was n't too bad however the master 's program was very very not fun    edit ymmv but i do n't recommend going straight into the master 's program straight out of undergrad work in industry for a bit first the jobs you need to a master 's for wo n't hire you straight out of undergrad so it 'll be dead weight experience is what you need

quote driven markets are the to the modern securities market before electronic trading and hfts specifically trading was thin and onerous   today the average investor can open up a web page type in a security and buy at the spread permitted by regulators with anyone else who wants to take the other side before the lines between market maker and speculator became blurred to a market maker was one who was contractually obligated to an exchange to provide a bid and ask for a given security on said exchange even though at heart a market maker is still simply a trader despite the obligation   a market maker would simultaneously buy a large amount of securities privately and short the same amount to have no directional bias exposure to the direction of the security and commence to making the market   the market maker would estimate its cost basis for the security based upon those initial trades and provide a bid and ask appropriate for the given level of volume   if volumes were high the spread would be low and vice versa market makers who survived crashes and spikes would forgo the potential profit in always providing a steady price and spread ie increased volume otherwise known as revenue to maintain no directional bias   in other words if there were suddenly many buyers and no sellers hitting the market maker 's ask the mm would raise the ask rapidly in proportion to the increased exposure while leaving the bid somewhere below the cost basis   eventually a seller would arise and hit the mm 's bid bringing the market maker 's inventory back into balance and narrowing the spread that particular mm could provide since a responsible mm 's ask could rise very high very quickly if a lack of its volume relative to its inventory made inventory too costly   this was temporarily extremely costly to the trader if there were few market makers on the security the trader was trading or already exposed to market makers prefer to profit from the spread bidding below some predetermined price based upon the cost basis of the market maker 's inventory while asking above that same predetermined cost basis   traders profit from taking exposure to a security 's direction or lack thereof in the case of some options traders because of electronic trading liquidity rebates offered by exchanges not only to contractually obligated official market makers but also to any trader who posts a limit order that another trader hits and algorithms that become better by the day market making hfts have supplanted the traditional market maker and there are many hfts where there previously were few official market makers   this speed and diversification of risk across many many market making hfts have kept spreads to the minimum on large equities and have reduced the same for the smallest equities on major exchanges orders and quotes are essentially identical   both are double sided auction markets with bids and asks   the difference lies in that non market makers specialists etc orders are not shown to the rest of the market providing an informational advantage to mms and an informational disadvantage to the trader   before electronic trading this construct was of no consequence since trader orders were infrequent   with the prevalence of hfts the informational disadvantage has become more costly so order driven markets now prevail with much lower spreads and accelerated volumes even though market share for the major exchanges has dropped rapidly and number of trades even though the size of individual trades have fallen the worst aspect of the quote driven market was that traders could not directly trade with each other so all trades had to go between a market maker specialist etc   while this may seem to have increased cost to a trader who could only trade with another trader by being arbitraged by a mm et al paying more than what another trader was willing to sell these costs were dwarfed by the potential absence of those market makers   without a bid or ask at any given time there could be no trade so the costs were infinite in essence a quote driven market protects market makers from the competition of traders   while necessary in the days where paper receipts were from brokerage to brokerage and the trader did not dedicate itself to round the clock trading it has no place in a computerized market   it is more costly to the trader to use such a market explaining quote driven markets rapid exit

i ca n't vouch for australian law but in the us there is actually a recognized mechanism for in family loans which ensures that it 's all fully documented for tax purposes including filing it as an official second mortgage just did that recently in my own family which is why i 'm aware of it we 're required to charge at least some interest there 's a minimum set currently around 0.3 and the interest is taxable income and it is wise to get a lawyer to draw up the paperwork there are a few services which specialize in this charging a flat fee of about us$ 700 if the loan is standard enough that they can handle it as fill in the blank but outside of that it 's pretty painless this can also be used as a way of shifting gift limits from year to year if you issue a loan and then gift the recipient with the payments each year including the payments you 've effectively spread the immediate transfer of money over multiple years of taxes of course it does cost you the legal paperwork and the tax in the interest which they 're still paying out of your gift but it can be a useful tool and it 's one that was n't well known until recently again this is all us codes posted only for comparison and for the benefit of us readers it may be completely irrelevant but it may be worth investigating whether oz has something similar

yes and the math that tells you when is called the kelly criterion the kelly criterion is on its face about how much you should bet on a positive sum game imagine you have a game where you flip a coin and if heads you are given 3 times your bet and if tails you lose your bet   naively you 'd think great i should play and bet every dollar i have after all it has a 50 average return on investment   you get back on average 1.5 $ for every dollar you bet so every dollar you do n't bet is a 0.5 $ loss but if you do this and you play every day for 10 years you 'll almost always end up bankrupt   funny that on the other hand if you bet nothing you are losing out on a great investment   so under certain assumptions you neither want to bet everything nor do you want to bet nothing assuming you can repeat the bet almost indefinitely the question then becomes what percentage of your bankroll should you bet kelly criterion answers this question   the typical kelly criterion case is where we are making a bet with positive returns not an insurance against loss but with a bit of mathematical trickery we can use it to determine how much you should spend on insuring against loss an easy way to the kelly criterion is that you want to maximize the logarithm of your worth in a given period   such a maximization results in the largest long term value in some sense let us give it a try in an insurance case suppose you have a 1 million dollar asset   it has a 1 chance per year of being destroyed by some random event flood fire taxes pitchforks you can buy insurance against this for 2 of its value per year   it even covers pitchforks on its face this looks like a bad deal   your expected loss is only 1 but the cost to hide the loss is 2 if this is your only asset then the loss makes your net worth 0   the log of zero is negative infinity   under kelly any insurance no matter how inefficient is worth it   this is a bit of an extreme case and we 'll cover why it does n't apply even when it seems like it does elsewhere now suppose you have 1 million dollars in other assets   in the insured case we always end the year with million dollars regardless of if the disaster happens   in the non insured case 99 of the time we have 2 million dollars and 1 of the time we have 1 million dollars we want to maximize the expected log value of our worth   we have million 20,000 the insured case vs 1 million + 99 million or vs   the kelly criterion says insurance is worth it note that you could afford to replace your home but because it makes up so much of your net worth kelly says the hit it too painful and you should just pay for insurance now suppose you are worth 1 billion   we have billion 20k on the insured side and million + 99 billion on the uninsured side the logs of each side are vs   note that the base of the logarithm does n't matter so long as you use the same base on each side according to kelly we have found a case where insurance is n't worth it the kelly criterion roughly tells you if i took this bet every period of time would i be on average richer after many repeats of this bet than if i did n't take this bet   when the answer is no it implies self insurance is more efficient than using external insurance   the answer is going to be sensitive to the profit margin of the insurance product you are buying and the size of the asset relative to your total wealth now the kelly criterion can easily be   being worth financially zero in current assets can easily ignore non financial assets like your ability to work or friends or whatever   and it presumes repeat to infinity and people tend not to live that long but it is a good starting spot note that the option of bankruptcy can easily make insurance not worth it for people far poorer this is one of the reasons why banks insist you have insurance on your you can use kelly to calculate how much insurance you should purchase at a given profit margin for the insurance company given your net worth and the risk involved   this can be used in finance to work out how much you should hedge your bets in an investment as well in effect it how having money makes it easier to make money

the two banks involved may have different policies about honoring the check it might not be written on the check   your bank may decide that the stale check has to be treated differently and will withhold funds for a longer period of time before giving you access to the money they will give time for the first bank to refuse to honor the check they may be concerned about insufficient funds the age of the check and the fact that the original account could have been closed if you are concerned about the age of the check you could go to your bank in person instead of using deposit by atm scanner or smart phone this allows you to talk to a knowledgeable person and if they are going to treat the check differently or reject the check they can let you know right away the audit may not have been concerned about the fact that the check had n't been cashed because when they did the audit the check was still considered fresh some companies will contact you eventually to reissue the check so you they can get the liability off their books   if the bank does refuse the check contact the company to see how you can get a replacement check issued they may want proof the check ca n't be cashed so they do n't have to worry about paying you twice

what options do i have realistically   get a regular full time job   work at it for a year or so and then see about buying a house that said i recently purchased a decent home   i am self employed and my income is highly erratic   due to how my clients pay me my business might go a couple months with absolutely no deposits    however i 've been at this for quite a few years   so even though my business income is erratic i pay myself regularly once a month   in order to close the deal with the mortgage company i had to provide 5 years worth of statements on my business and my personal bank accounts   also i had about a 30 down payment    this gave the bank enough info to realize that i could absolutely make the payments and we closed the deal i 'd say that if you have little to no actual financial history do n't have a solid personal income and do n't have much of a down payment then you probably have no business buying a house at this point   the first time something goes wrong water heater ac etc you 'll be in a world of trouble

the yen is the source of carry it means whichever savvy people with means who want to borrow money to invest on a leveraged basis anywhere in the world come running to borrow in yen why because 1 japan is an advanced economy whose currency is freely convertible to many many currencies countries who are happy to convert yen back and forth 2 japanese interest rates are low lower than in the west b c of their earlier deflationary crises due to too much debt and due to west requiring yen to be too strong after the plaza accords so it 's cheap to borrow there   so a lot of investment around the world has in origin come from borrowing in japan   as long as that investment is on the loan to japan remains outstanding but the investor earns the carry the rate of difference between the cost of borrowing in yen and earning the return from whatever investment it is    when scary things happen like war disaster etc the big money bags investors pull their money out of their investments and put it in their banks   this means they sell their investments wherever they are convert some of that money back into buy yen to return their yen loans yen goes up

you want a fee only advisor   he charges like an architect or plumber by the hour or some other flat fee that is his only compensation he is not paid on commission at all   he is not affiliated with any financial services company of any kind    his office is starbucks   he does not have a well lit office like the commission broker down the street   he does not want you to hand him your money it stays in the brokerage account of your choice within reason some brokerage accounts are terrible and he 'll tell you to get out of those   he never asks for the password to your brokerage account   edit the uk recently outlawed commission brokers   these guys were competitive sales types who thrive on commissions and probably went into other sales jobs   so right now everyone is clamoring for the few proper financial advisors available   high demand is making them expensive   it may not be cost effective to hire an advisor you may need to learn it yourself   it 's not that hard   ever hear of a plumber who works totally for free and makes his money selling you wildly overpriced pipe   that 's what regular financial advisors are    they sell products that are deliberately made unnecessarily complex the purpose is first to conceal sales commissions and high internal fees and second to confuse you so the financial world feels so daunting that you feel like you need their help just to navigate it    they 're trying to fry your brain so just give up and trust them    products like whole life and variable annuities are only the poster children for how awful all of their financial products are   these products exist to fleece the consumer without quite breaking the law   of course everyone goes to see them because they have well lit offices in every town and they 're free and easy to deal with do n't feel like you need to know everything about finance to invest   you do n't need to understand every complex financial product that the brokerage houses dreamed up they are designed to conceal and confuse as i discuss above and you do n't want them   the core of it is fairly simple and that 's all you really need to know    look at any smaller university and how they manage their endowments if whole life annuities and those complex financial products actually worked university endowments would be full of them    but they 're not   endowments are generally made of investments you can understand   partly because university boards are made of investment bankers who invented those products and know what a ripoff they are    some people refuse to learn anything   they are done with college and refuse to learn anything more    i hope that 's not you    because you should learn the workings of everything you 're investing in     if you do n't understand it do n't buy   and a fee only financial advisor wo n't ask you to   1000 well well advised university endowments seek the most successful products on the market and end up choosing products you can understand   that 's good news for you

as someone who has a very similar debt amount and environment new grad nice new paying job want a car etc i 'd like to share something with you life has unexpected costs luckily i did n't buy that new car the first few months out of college like i had planned to i 'm glad that i did n't because as a fledgling adult despite having lived on my own while in college while working part to full time there are some things you just do n't realize until it either happens or it happens to someone else here are some of those things i could go on but i wo n't $ 95 k is good money and i would definitely recommend spending it a bit to enjoy yourself but i would honestly tell you that taking your monthly expenses adding a few hundred on top of that and then multiplying   that sum by 3 would be a smart savings amount before picking up a car loan maybe that 's an excessive savings but i 've seen way too many people burn out over their cost of living and their failure to adjust appropriately when shit hits the fan so instead of having to deal with the stab at your pride when having to lower the cost quality of living that you 'll probably grow accustomed to at a $ 95 k salary just prepare for the worst   oh and did i mention a new job is not a secure job consider yourself to likely be the first asset dropped from the company if even the tiniest thing goes wrong i know way too many people who were fresh hires at intel boeing and a few other big tech companies that pay around what you make and despite being bad asses in college they were dropped like a bad habit when their employers hit rough patches to those even more experienced than me please feel free to add to the list i 'd personally love to know them myself

your question does not say this explicitly but i assume that you were once a w-2 employee   each paycheck a certain amount was withheld from your check to pay income social security and medicare taxes   just because you did not receive that amount of money earned does not mean it was immediately sent to the irs   while i am not all that savvy on payroll procedures i recall an article that indicated some companies only send in withheld taxes every quarter much like you are doing now   they get a short term interest free loan   for example taxes withheld by a w-2 employee in the later months of the year may not be provided to the irs until 15 january of the next year    you are correct in assuming that if you make 100 k as a w-2 you will probably pay less in taxes than someone who is 100 k self employed with 5 k in expenses   however there are many factors   provided you properly fill out a 1040es and pay the correct amount of quarterly payments you will almost never owe taxes   in fact my experience has been the forms will probably allow you to receive a refund   tax laws can change and one thing the form did not include last year was the medicare surcharge for high income earners catching some by surprise     as far as what you pay into is indicative of the games the politicians play   it all just goes into a big old bucket of money and more is spent by congress than what is in the bucket   the notion of a social security is pure politics fantasy as well as the notion of medicare and social security taxes   the latter were created to make the actual income tax rate more palatable      i 'd recommend getting your taxes done as early as possible come 1 january 2017   while you may not have all the needed info you could firm up an estimate by 15 jan and modify the amount for your last estimated payment   complete the taxes when all stuff comes in and even if you owe an amount you have time to save for anything additional   keep in mind between 1 jan 17 and 15 apr 17 you will earn and presumably save money to use towards taxes   you can always rob from that money to pay any owed tax for 2016 and make it up later all that is to say you will be golden because you are showing concern and planning   when you hear horror stories of irs dealings it is most often that people spent the money that should have been sent to the irs

you 're certainly referring to ex post facto laws and while the us is prohibited from passing criminal laws that are retroactive the us supreme court has upheld many tax laws that apply tax code changes retroactively you might ask a similar question on law se for a more thorough treatment of the legalities of congress passing those laws but i will stick to the personal finance portion of the question what this means is that you ca n't expect that the current tax laws will be in force in the future and your investment retirement plans should be as flexible as possible you may wish to have some money in both roth and traditional 401(k accounts you might not want to have millions of dollars in roth accounts because if congress does act to limit the tax benefits of those accounts it will probably be targeting the larger balances if you are valuing tax deductions you should put slightly more weight on deductions that you can take today than deductions that would apply in the future if you do find yourself in trouble because of a retroactive change be sure to consult a tax lawyer that specializes in dealing with the irs to possibly negotiate a settlement for a lower amount than the full tax bill that results from the changes

suggested way to make the decision to repair or buy figure out what it will cost to repair your car if necessary pay a garage to evaluate it as if your daughter was interested in buying it then think about whether you would pay that much to buy a car just like yours but without those problems if the answer is yes fixing it us probably your most cost effective choice even if it is a big bill if the answer is no consider a used car and again have the mechanic check it for any horrors before committing to buy it that avoids the line tax where a new car loses a significant percentage of its value the moment it leaves the dealership an almost toy car us virtually indistinguishable from a new car costs much less and realistically has about the same expected life span i bought a new car once at about $ 300 over the dealer 's real as opposed to sticker cost since i was willing to take the one he was stuck with from the previous model year thank you consumer reports for providing the dealer 's cost info and making this a five minute transaction if it had n't suffered flood damage i 'd probably still be driving it and even so i sorta regret not pricing what it would have cost go completely replace the engine if you really plan to drive it until it is completely you may be able to justify a new car but realistically buying a or two year old car would have been a better choice

i do n't understand the op 's desire i 'd love to have a few hundred dollars coming in each month until i really get the hang of things   when growing your wealth so that it will be large enough in retirement to throw off enough profits to live on you must not touch the profits generated along the way   you must reinvest them to earn even more profits   the profits you earn need not show up as cash   most investments also grow in re sale value this growth is called capital gains and is just as more important than cash flows like interest income or dividends     when evaluating investing choices you think of your returns as a percent of your total savings at any time   so expecting $ 100/month equals $ would require a $ 12,000 investment to earn 10%/yr from the sounds of it the op 's principal is not near that amount and an average 10 should not be expected by an investment with reasonable risk i would conclude that there is no free lunch   you need to continually save and add to your principal   you must invest to expect a reasonable return less than 10 and you must reinvest all profits whether cash or capital gains or else start a business which can not be compared to passive investing

as you say life insurance is about covering the loss of income so unless your child is an actor or musical or similar and already earning money there is no income to cover and in fact you would have less of a financial commitment without a child to provide for the other angle is that child life insurance is cheap and they 'll have lower premiums than an adult i 'll quote the referenced article directly to address that another ploy is that children 's life insurance is cheap it is inexpensive compared to adult life insurance because plain and simply children rarely die while the numbers that the sales agent puts together may make children 's life insurance sound like a great deal take the time to run what you 'd have if you instead invested the exact same amount used on the insurance fees into a roth ira and you 'll find the true cost of purchasing this type of life insurance

welcome to personal finance and money this answer will depend a lot on what is most important to the buyer for example whether it is important to always be in a newer car to save money or strike a balance between the two there are trade offs and i do n't think there is one right answer for all circumstances leasing leasing does make financial sense for at least two types of people i 'm aware of the company i work for provides company cars to sales executives which we lease we lease because it would n't be appropriate for a salesperson to meet a client in a car that clearly appears used similarly i know people who value being in a newer car all the time and for them leasing makes more financial sense then buying a new car every 2 3 years and selling their old car which is now 2 3 years old and has depreciated significantly they understand that they are paying more to always be able to be in a newer car i used to work with a manager who every time the new model of the car he owned came out would see the car and buy it on the spot even though he already owned last year 's model and he did n't need two cars he just could n't help himself he felt he had to have the new model it 's no use about how he should learn to save money by just being content with what he had in reality if he is going to buy the new model every year no matter what he should lease rather than buy from my experience i would only recommend leasing if you would otherwise be buying a new car on a regular basis and the lease would be less expensive this is probably the most cost effective way to maintain the highest possible quality but would cost much more than buying and holding a new car or buying a value used car i do n't see reliability as much of a factor here since the seller will have a very good idea of how much maintenance will cost but you will pay a premium to be able to pay a fixed cost for maintenance instead of risking a worse than average experience buying new according to edmunds and only a relatively small number of people are ever in the market for a new car at a given point in time while you do pay quite a bit more to own a brand new car instead of the same car that is 2 3 years old there are several reasons i 'm aware of why people buy new cars number 4 is probably the biggest reason and many people are willing to pay for the certainty of knowing that the miles are correct the parts are new the car is in good working condition etc additionally some makes of cars have much higher resale values than others such as meaning that there is n't as large of a drop in price between a new car and a used car many people consider buying a new car the best way to ensure they get the best reliability since they know the initial condition of the car and can care for it meticulously from that point on this can especially make sense when the buyer intends to keep the car for the like of the car as the buyer will then benefit from having no car payments once it is paid off buying used buying a used car is the most affordable option but for a given quality of car the reliability can be a significant potential pitfall it can be very difficult for a non professional to tell whether they are getting a good value additionally it is hard for an owner who wants to sell a used car in excellent condition to get the true value of the car and much easier for an unscrupulous seller to to get the market price by selling to an unaware buyer the lemons problem in economics you could buy an inspected car with a limited warranty from a retail seller like carmax or a dealership but you often pay a significant premium that cancels out much of the biggest reason to buy used saving money however there is an opportunity to save money when buying used if you 're willing to compromise on the condition of the car if you do n't care whether a car has hail damage for example or if you are able to wait until you find a motivated distressed seller who needs to sell quickly and is willing to sell at a discount if cost is your primary priority buying a used car is likely the best option but i would recommend the following in all circumstances if the seller is n't willing to offer both of these i would walk away when buying used you will also need to consider maintenance which will vary significantly based on the make and model of the car as well as the condition which is another risk you need to be willing to take on if you choose to buy used

as mentioned in other answers the interest you make is negligible and the calculations would depend on the bank in saying that the general trend is calculate daily pay monthly   a typical scenario would be that every night at midnight the interest for your account at that point in time is calculated this occurs every midnight and at the end of the month the sum of those calculations will be added to your account you could have had several significant transactions pass through your account in one day although if the interest is calculated at a specific point in time some transactions may not contribute to any interest these calculations are worth thinking about   even in circumstances of negligible returns as it could assist when considering combining credit cards with home loan offset accounts so it is not a complete waste of time to understand how interest is calculated the more you know

you really should consider sitting down with an independent financial advisor to run the numbers for the various options and discuss what risks you 're comfortable with and what your requirements goals are this is n't a simple decision   unfortunately advice i 've seen suggested that some portion of the money should stay in the market earning market rate of return exactly how much and invested in what is complicated an annuity is essentially an insurance policy   the company assumes the risks and promises you specific payments in exchange for keeping the money   they would n't do so if they did n't think that on average they 'll pay out less than the combination of your purchase price plus earnings so you really are paying a fee for this service whether it 's worth that cost and for how much of your money depends on how much you have saved and how risk tolerant you are i 'm going to steal a moment here to point out that many charities offer annuities these may or may not pay out less than commercial annuities   but the profits go to a better cause either way if you plan to leave part of your estate as donation to a charity anyway this basically lets them have the money earlier while you continue to receive income from it

well you you purchased the shares at a weighted average price of $ per share 350k at $ 2.00 and 50k at $ 1.50 the shares are now trading at $ 1.50 assuming the market has n't changed since you last purchased stock so you 're down $ share from the stock but you have received share in dividends you are down $ share which means on paper you have lost $ on your $ investment down of total investment so i 'd say the investment is not performing well no if a stock pays a dividend it usually should not dip 25 unless something is up with the business i can not think of any example where an investment can be said to be performing well while at the same time the stock price decreases unless you are shorting the stock

is right all shares are owned by someone   depending on the company they can be closely held so that nobody wants to sell at a given time   this can cause the price people are offering to rise until someone sells   that trade will cause an adjustment in the ticker price of that stock   supply and demand at work   berkshire hathaway is an example of this   the number of shares is low the demand for them is high the price per share is high

it will depend on how much you expect to earn this way and whether you expect the company to become profitable soon has the company just not made a profit yet or has it actually made a significant loss that your invoices would just be offsetting if you 're earning over £ 10,000 per year then invoicing through the company is preferable above that level you 'd be taking money from the company as dividends after paying 20 corporation tax with no other tax to pay on your personal tax return as a sole trader you 'd be paying 20 income tax and 9 ni note however that the company can only pay dividends from profits which is a problem if there are significant losses to offset below £ 10,000 there 's little difference through the company you can take a salary of £ per year without paying any income tax or ni with the new £ 2000 discount on employers ni you could then take salary up to £ 10,000 and just pay 12 employee 's ni as a sole trader you pay 9 class 4 ni over £ and a fixed £ 143 per year for class 2 ni paying 9 rather than 12 saves you £ 60 but then you add the £ 143 in practice the company would work out more expensive at this level because you 'll probably want to pay an accountant to deal with the payroll for you having the company repay your £ 2000 from the invoices does n't really save any tax if the company will become profitable in the future you do n't pay any tax now since the money you receive is n't income and the company does n't pay any tax if the extra £ 2000 of revenue does n't put it back in profit however if the company is profitable next year then it will have an extra £ 2000 of profit that would otherwise have been offset against this year 's loss and you do end up paying 20 corporation tax on the £ 2000 you could still have the company repay the loan in order to delay the tax liability but it 's not really tax free money loaning additional money to the company has no tax benefit you just give the company £ 1000 and get your original £ 1000 back later you pay no tax and neither does the company but it was your money in the first place

the american express card the black card is for extremely wealthy people who like to show off how much they spend there are no cash back benefits like you have with traditional rewards cards the benefits are all geared toward spending more money not saving money    for example the benefits include a personal travel agent personal shoppers at high end stores elite status with airlines and hotels etc   there are some benefits that you could put a dollar value on for example first class upgrades and complementary companion airline tickets if you like to fly first class and you do a lot of flying it is conceivable that you could come out ahead   however someone that does that much flying has probably already achieved elite frequent flyer status and enjoys regular upgrades without the black card in my opinion it is pretty difficult to justify the initiation and annual fees of this card as anything but a luxury

i started a business a few years ago   at one point it was n't going so well and my father loaned me an amount not too dissimilar to what you 've done from a personal perspective the moment i took that loan there was a strain the relationship   especially when i was sometimes late on the interest payments   unfortunately thoughts like he does n't need this right now but if i do n't pay the car loan then that is taken away came up a few times and paying the interest fell to the bottom of the monthly bill payment stack at some point my wife and i finally took a hard look at my finances and goals   we got rid of things that simply were n't necessary car payment cable tv etc and focused on the things we needed to   doing the same with the business helped out as well as it helped focus me to to turn things around   things are now going great that said two of my siblings ran into their own financial trouble that our parents helped them on   when this happened my father called us together and basically everyone 's debt by an equal amount which covered everything plus wrote a check to the one that was doing fine   this cleared the air with regards to future inheritance questions about how much one sibling was being helped vs another etc   honestly it made family gatherings more enjoyable as all that underlying tension was now gone i 've since helped one of my children   although i went about it an entirely different way    rather than loan them money i gave it to them   we also had a few discussions on how i think they ought to manage their finances and a set of goals to work towards which we co developed   bearing in mind that they are an individual and sometimes you can lead a horse   given the current state of things i consider it money well spent

pension in this instance seems to mean pension income as opposed to pension pot this money would be determined by whatever assets are being invested in it may be fixed it may be variable completely dependant on the underlying investments an annuity is a product in simple terms you over a lump sum of cash and receive an agreed annual income until you die the underlying investment required to reach that income level is not your concern it 's the provider 's worry so there is a mount of security to the retiree in having an annuity the downside of annuities is that the level of income may be too low for your liking for instance £ would mean £ 400 for every £ 10,000 given to the provider that 's 4 and would take 25 years to break even ignoring inflation opportunity cost of investing yourself therefore the gamble is whether you outlive the deal you could hand over £ 50,000 to a provider and drop dead a year later your £ 50k got you say £ 2k and then you popped your provider wins or you could like 40 years after retiring and then you end up costing the provider £ 80k you win best way to think of an annuity is a route to guaranteed agreed income to secure that guarantee there 's a price to pay and that is a lower income rate than you might like hope that was the kind of reply you were hoping for if not edit your op and ask again chris ps the explanation on the link you provided is pretty dire very confusing use of the term pension and even if that were better the explanation is still bad due to this is much better

yes it 's unreasonable to think the prices will drop 10 20 in that time frame   housing prices are not an equation that can can be solved to home prices are x% overvalued you have 3 answers so far 's prices are inversely proportional to rates rob 's there 's no strong correlation between interest rates and house prices and mb 's rising interest rates create downward pressure on housing prices any research into price history had better take every other variable into account articles that look at rates vs price do n't always address a key item income say we agree that the data show your city to be 10 too high but if sellers like their high price and have some dig my heels in power prices wo n't drop the seller simply stays put and the supply demand curves result not in a lower price but in less supply and the effect is to change the demographic of that area i.e. attracting higher income earners   rob linked to an article with a nice set of charts one chart showing the yr fixed rate and real house prices what results is a chart that can refute the relationship between rates and prices but that would ignore an historical point that 's too important to forget the tumble that started in jan 06 had nothing to do with the 30 year rate it was the result of a series of insane financial products including interest only option arms which permitted buyers to get approved for a purchase based on a payment that was n't fixed and would change to a fully amortizing mortgage at a higher rate that was unaffordable a product that was a financial time bomb canada banks offered no such product and when the us market got canada experienced a mild cold with respect to any answers that offer us centric data to prove any hypothesis i do n't feel such comparisons are appropriate   correlations and the data used to prove them are an interesting thing i can suggest that you take the us 30 year rate along with our median income or rather 25 of monthly median income calculate the mortgage that results this translates nicely to the home a median family can afford and i claim that long term this is the equilibrium price of that median home but supply demand has another factor or the more technical term of demand this means that for example a 10 increase in the price of cigarettes does not cause a 10 drop in consumption each and every good has its own elasticity and in the case of housing a rise in cost would certainly impact the marginal buyers but others will simply adjust their budgets not all buyers were planning to hit the bank 's limit on what they could afford so the rise does n't change their mind just their budget   last i know that canada does not have a 30 year mortgage most common is a 5 year rate with 30 year amortization correction clarification anyone the effect of this is less volatility in the market since i believe your rates are not poised for the 2.5 to 4 jump implied by another response small increases can be absorbed   in a beautiful coincidence the federal reserve board sent me a link to the interest rate elasticity of mortgage demand evidence from at the conforming loan limit it 's a bit long but a worthwhile look at how the correlation is n't as instant as some might think

i would also be getting out of the stock market if i noticed prices starting to fall and a crash possibly on the way there are some good and quite simple techniques i would use to time the markets over the medium to long term i have described some of them in the answer to this question of mine what are some simple techniques used for timing the stock market over the long term you could use similar techniques in your investing and in regards to back testing dca to timing the markets i have done that too in my answer to the following question investing in low cost index fund does the timing matter timing the markets wins hand down in regards to back testing and the concerns kent anderson has brought up when i back test a trading strategy if that strategy is successful i then forward test it over a year or two to confirm the results as with back testing you can sometimes curve fit your criteria too much by forward testing you are confirming that the strategy is robust over different market conditions one strategy you can take when the market does start to fall is short selling as mentioned by some already i am now short selling using cfds over the short to medium term as one of my more aggressive strategies i have a longer term strategy where i do not short but tighten my stop losses when the market starts to tank sometimes my positions will keep going up even though the market as a whole is heading down and i can make an extra 5 to 10 on these positions before i get taken out the rare position even continues going up during the whole downturn and when the market starts to recover so i let the market decide when i get out and when i stay in i leave my emotions out of it the best thing you can do is have a written trading plan with all your criteria for getting into the market your criteria for getting out of the market and your position sizing and risk management incorporated in the plan

social lending may help you qualify for a loan but does n't necessarily provide better rates you have to shop around to get the best rates this is a market as any other so do n't expect one place to be consistently below the market either the market will move or the place will move eventually everyone wants to earn the most for the buck

the key with analyzing financial statements is that you need to look at all angles of a particular item ie sales has gone up but has the cost of sales increased by even more implying narrower margins or interest expense has gone up but is that because new debt was taken on to pay for expansion   in the specific case you mentioned buying assets that will create depreciation expense over time there is a grouping on the cash flow statement called investing which will state the amount of cash used during the year to invest in the business this could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on other factors and your personal preference regarding dividends being paid to shareholders in addition you can see the amount of depreciation expense separately listed on the cash flow statement this tells you many things consider a company with $ 10 m in assets on the balance sheet but $ 2 m in depreciation expense this tells you that in a very loose sense every 5 years the assets owned by the company will all need to be replaced compare that with the investing section of the cash flow statement if they are buying $ 4 m of new assets this year this tells you that on an overall basis they are likely expanding the business because the new investments outpace the depreciation   but is your concern of under reported earnings a common issue typically keep in mind that the most common bias of a company is to over report earnings this is because management compensation in the form of performance bonuses and stock option valuation is increased by profitable years however in a year where a loss poor performance is likely a reverse bias occurs to take as much of a loss as possible in that year this is because if a manager 's bonus is already 0 due to poor company performance having a worse year will not turn the bonus negative so by taking all expenses possible today on the financial statements next year might have less allocated expenses and therefore the manager might get a bigger bonus impact next year this is called taking a big bath   note that public companies must meet certain reporting standards and they are audited by external accounting firms to show that they meet those standards of course there is no guarantee that the auditors will catch all cases of accounting manipulation see enron etc etc

warren buffett pointed out that if you set 1 million monkeys to flipping coins after ten flips one monkey in about 1,000 actually would have a perfect track record of 10 heads if you can double your money every three to five years basically the outer limit of what is humanly possible you can turn $ 1,000 into $ 1 million in 30 50 years but your chances of doing this are maybe those of that one in 1,000 monkeys there are people that believe that if warren buffett were starting out today today 's version could not beat the historical version one of the believers is warren buffett himself if you read between the lines of his writings what the promoters do is to use the benefit of hindsight to show that if someone had done such and such trades on such and such days they would have turned a few thousand into a million in a few short years that 's easy in hindsight but then challenge them to do it in real time

first let me fill in the gaps on your situation based on the numbers you 've given so far i estimate that your student loan balance principal is $ with the variable rate loan option that you 've presented the maximum interest rate you could be charged would be 11.5 which would bring your monthly payment up to that $ number you gave in the comments your thoughts are correct about the advantage to paying this loan off sooner   if you are planning on paying off this loan sooner the interest rate on the variable rate loan has less opportunity to climb one thing to be cautious of with the comparison though the $ 1200 difference between the two options is only valid if your rate does not increase   if the rate does increase of course the difference would be less or it could even go the other way   so keep in mind that the $ 1200 savings is only a theoretical maximum you wo n't actually see that much savings with the variable rate option before making a decision you need to find out more about the terms of this variable rate loan how often can your rate go up what is the loan rate based on i 'm not as familiar with student loan variable rate loans but there are other variable rate loans i am familiar with with a typical adjustable rate home mortgage the rate is locked for a certain number of years perhaps 5 years   after that the bank might be allowed to raise the rate once every period of months perhaps once every year   there will be a limit to how much the rate can rise on each increase perhaps 1.0 and there will be a maximum rate that could be charged over the life of the loan perhaps 12 the interest rate on your mortgage can adjust up inside of those parameters   the actual formula used to adjust will be found in the fine print of your mortgage contract   however the bank knows that if they let your rate get too high above the current market rates you will refinance to a different bank   so the mortgage is typically structured so that it will raise your rate somewhat but it wo n't usually get too far above the market rate   if you knew ahead of time that you would have the house paid off in 5 years or that you would be selling the house before the 5 years is over you could confidently take the adjustable rate mortgage credit cards on the other hand also typically have variable rates   these rates can change every month but they are usually calculated on some formula determined ahead of time   for example on my credit card the interest rate is the published prime rate plus   on my last statement it said the rate was   of course because i pay my balance in full each month i do n't pay any interest   the rate could go up to 50 for all i care as i said i do n't know what determines the rate on your variable rate student loan option and i do n't know what the limits are   if it climbs up to 11.5 that is obviously ridiculously high   i recommend that you try to pay off this student loan as soon as you possibly can however if you are not planning on paying off this student loan early you need to try to determine how likely the rate is to climb if you want to pick the variable rate option

yes a diversified portfolio can generate greater returns than the s&p 500 by going outside it for instance small stocks on average generate higher returns than the large caps found in the s&p 500 so if you own a diversified portfolio of stocks some of which are smaller in market cap than the typical s&p 500 stock you have a chance to outperform you might also outperform by owning other asset classes than stocks such as gold real estate and timber among others at appropriate times you may also be able to get the relevant exposure by owning gold and timber stocks and reits this was a lesson that david of the yale endowment taught us

a lower price is likely to be slightly more attractive to sellers than paying an equivalent amount in closing costs the seller is going to be paying the commission on the higher sale price and will net slightly less money it is common in my experience to ask for closing costs   the generic answer for your questions about how it is spent depends on the bank and type of loan in general you will not be able to walk away with the cash if closing costs are less than the concession but they can be applied to funding escrow and points transfer fees etc there is the potential to lose the concession if there are n't sufficient closing costs i am fairly certain that there is n't any tax differences between the two in the us

get a credit card is not the answer the reason people have a bad or no credit score is often because they 're new to the country have just turned 18 have previously fallen into arrears or are just bad with money getting a credit card is risky because if you do n't stay on top of your payments it 'll just damage your score even more   now it sounds like i hate credit cards but i do n't and they do have their benefits but avoid them if possible because they can be more hassle than they 're worth ie paying the credit back on time cancelling accounts when the interest comes in moving money in and out of accounts it 's risky borrowing money from anywhere whether it 's a payday lender a bank a credit card etc so use them as a last resort if you 've got your own income then that 's amazing try not to live outside of your means and your credit score will look after and increase itself it takes time to build a good credit score but always make sure you pay the people you owe on time and the full amount i 'd stick with paying your phone provider and any other direct debits you have setup and avoid getting a credit card i 'd recommend to keep track of your credit score and read their faq on how to help build it unlike experian it 's free forever so not quite as detailed but are owned by one of the biggest credit reference agencies in the uk so they should have the latest information on yourself in conclusion if you already have financial commitments like a mobile phone bill gym membership store cards anything that gets paid monthly by direct debit your credit score will increase provided you pay the full amount on time    i hope this helps ps i do n't work for any of the companies here but i 've been working in the finance sector more specifically short term loans for 3 + years now

there are a couple of things that are missing from your estimate in addition to your standard deduction you also have a personal exemption of $ 4050   so d in your calculation should be $ 6300 + $ 4050 = $ 10,350 as a self employed individual you need to pay both the employee and employer side of the social security and medicare taxes   instead of 6.2 + 1.45 you need to pay 6.2 + 1.45 2 = 15.3 self employment tax in addition there are some problems with your calculation quarter 1 estimated income should be your adjusted annual income divided by 4 not 3 likewise you should estimate your quarterly tax by estimating your income for the whole year then dividing by 4   so annual estimated federal tax should be quarterly estimated federal tax would be = 4 annual estimated self employment tax is = 15.3 a with the quarterly self employment tax being one fourth of that = 4 self employment tax gets added on to your federal income tax   so when you send in your quarterly payment using form 1040-es you should send in + the form 1040-es instructions pdf comes with the 2016 estimated tax worksheet that walks you through these calculations

this all depends on your timeline and net worth   if you 're short on time before you plan to start spending it or have a large net worth parking some of your money in cds is a good idea if you have lots of time or not much net worth then index funds are a better bet equity or dividend index funds are the way to go when you have 10 + years before you reach your goal cds major downside is that they do n't beat inflation 1 3 a year this is why you only use them when it 's absolutely critical you hold onto every penny of the principal the reason is because with cds your 10k is actually losing its value not the principal the longer you leave it in cds i generally would n't recommend cds unless you are in or approaching your 60s or have assets over 500k even still i would limit the use of cds to no more than 20 i would view them as catastrophic loss protection

a falling exchange rate is an indication of falling confidence in a currency   countries like iran or venezuela with a managed exchange rate set their exchange rates at a higher value than the market accepts such market expectations may be influenced by poor government management interventions into markets such as businesses or general instability scarcity the governments act to manage that uncertainty by limiting the availability of foreign exchange and pegging the exchange rate    since there is an inadequate supply of trusted foreign currency people turn to informal exchanges in order to hedge their currency risk   this creates a negative feedback loop   people in government who have access to foreign exchange start to trade on informal markets pocketing the difference in the official and unofficial rates   the increasing gap between the two rates drives increasing informal market exchange and can result in speculative bubbles driving instability or economic contradiction is that the massive and increasing difference between the official and market exchange rates becomes a powerful form of rent for government officials this drives further state led rent seeking behaviour and causes the economy to become even more unstable if you 're interested in a more formal academic study of how such parallel markets in currency arise zimbabwe ’s black market for foreign exchange by albert at the university of is a useful source

unfortunately where i live minimum wage is what is available to high school graduates   we have an abundance of minimum wage jobs looking to hire and no and few greater than minimum wage jobs for people right out of high school   and minimum wage is n't enough to support a person here   i think school costs have gone up for more than just loans for everyone   our colleges have administration bloat huge wages for the top few and are being run like businesses rather than schools profit over people   their educational license still stands but they work to increase their profit rather than increase their quality of education   i understand that there is a large blame game going on about why people are poor or undeserving   they are lazy they are drug addicts and   they are entitled   any excuse we can come up with to not help the other guy   the other issue is how we help the other guy   do we hand them money and say go out and succeed   that 's been our current method   but both of these issues again fall to education   if we can improve education so it teaches people how to have an impact on their world how to find something they can do well and how to succeed then we can resolve the other issues   right now our schools teach basic skills math science reading to the extent that the students can past the tests   but the world is not built on math science and reading   they are important but more important are social skills resource allocation and utilization self learning testing and verifying   teach them the basics   we need them   but teach them to be self controlling self responsible people   i know this is part of the third paragraph but i find on the outset we may seem like we have completely different views when in reality it is simply where we put the emphasis not the actual view itself that differs

actually yes two parties can write a contract and specify how money will change hands it 's called a swap it 's not unusual to write a contract that an existing financial instrument however there are disadvantages to both sides to trading a swap rather than a more standard liquid instrument so usually it wo n't happen unless there 's an excellent reason

scenario 1 assume that you plan to keep the parking space for the rest of your life and collect the income from the rental you say these spaces rent for $ 250 per month and there are fees of $ 1400 per year are there any other costs like would you be responsible for the cost of at some point but assuming that 's covered in the $ 1400 the net profit is 250 x 12 1400 = $ 1600 per year so now the question becomes what other things could you invest your money in and what sort of returns do those give if say you have investments in the stock market that are generating a 10 annual return and you expect that rate of return to continue indefinitely than if you pay a price that gives you a return of less than 10 i.e. if you pay more than $ 16,000 then you would be better off to put the money in the stock market that is you should calculate the fair price backwards what return on investment is acceptable and then what price would i have to pay to get that roi oh you should also consider what the occupancy rate on such parking spaces is is there enough demand that you can realistically expect to have it rented out 100 of the time when one renter leaves how long does it take to find another and do you have any information on how often renters fail to pay the rent i own a house that i rent out and i had two tenants in a row who failed to pay the rent and the legal process to get them evicted takes months i do n't know what it takes to evict someone from a parking space scenario 2 you expect to collect rent on this space for some period of time and then someday sell it in that case there 's an additional piece of information you need how much can you expect to get for this property when you sell it this is almost surely highly speculative but you could certainly look at past pricing trends if you see that the value of a parking space in your area has been going up by whatever say 4 per year for the past 20 years it 's reasonable to plan on the assumption that this trend will continue if it 's been up and down and all over the place you could be taking a real gamble if you pay $ 30,000 for it today and when the time comes to sell the best you can get is $ 15,000 that 's not so good but if there is some reasonable consistent average rate of growth in value you can add this to the expected rents like if you can expect it to grow in value by $ 1000 per year then the return on your investment is the $ 1600 in rent plus $ 1000 in capital growth equals $ 2600 then again do an roi calculation based on potential returns from other investments

the accounting equation in short is this can be further broken down into which can be further broken down into the gnucash equation is right though i would substitute the word equity in that equation with a more specific paid in capital equity is simply put made up of 2 parts shareholders equity and retained earnings shareholders equity is the amount invested by shareholders retained earnings is the amount earned by the business on behalf of the shareholders retained earnings is directly affected by your net income which is income minus expenses an increase in income will result in an increase in retained earnings this must be balanced somewhere usually an increase in an asset it may also be balanced by a decrease in equity likewise increase in expenses will result in a decrease in retained earnings which must also be balanced

a 401k plan will ask you to name a beneficiary who will receive the funds if you do n't withdraw them all before death usually a primary beneficiary and a secondary beneficiary is requested if you do n't specify a beneficiary your estate is the beneficiary by default   note that the name supplied to the 401k plan is who will get the money and you can not change this by the money in your will for example if you neglected to change the beneficiary upon divorce it is useless to say in your will that the money in the 401k plan goes to your new wife the 401k plan will give it to your ex wife who still remains the beneficiary of your 401k money in a 401k plan is what is called income with respect to a decedent   on which income tax is levied and it is also is part of your estate and thus liable to be subject to estate tax   the latter is true even if the 401k plan assets are not mentioned anywhere in your will and even if the assets got sent to your ex wife which is not what you wanted to have happen   there are various estate tax exceptions for spouse beneficiaries no   estate tax due now but will be charged when the spouse passes away with regard to income tax the beneficiaries of a 401k plan similarly iras 403b plans etc generally get to take the whole amount and pay the income   tax themselves edit in response to littleadv 's comments each 401k plan is different and some plans especially the smaller ones may prefer to distribute the   401k assets as a lump sum rather than allow the beneficiaries to withdraw   the money over several years and pay income tax on the amount withdrawn each year this is because there are far too many rules and regulations to trip over when making withdrawals over several years the lump sum distribution can be transferred into a newly established   inherited ira see the nolo article linked to in @littleadv 's answer for some details and some pitfalls to avoid and the income tax is thus deferred until withdrawals occur   spouse   beneficiaries are entitled to more generous rules than non spouse   beneficiaries if your heirs are otherwise well provided for and you are in a   philanthropic mood or you do n't want to give 'em a dime the who never call not even on father 's day one way of avoiding a   lot of tax is to make the beneficiary of your 401k be one or more of your favorite charities in fact if your testamentary inclination is to make some charitable as part of your will it is much more advantageous to give money from a tax deferred account to the charity size of estate is reduced no income   tax paid by anyone on amount given and assets in non retirement accounts to one 's heirs are not taxable income and heirs get a step up in basis for assets that have appreciated rather than the other way around heirs pay income tax as they withdraw the money from tax deferred   account estate planning is a complicated business and you really should talk to a professional about such matters and not rely on advice from an internet forum

and you have yet to explain how it would matter how they use the benefits they are entitled to    if they did n't spend any of the money they were given it would stay on their card   if they bought food and did n't eat it it would sit on their shelves   what if they bought food and let someone who was hungry eat it at their house     are these people abusing the system as well     what you do n't seem to understand is its their entitlement   they can do with it as they please it would be smart to use it to eat food but guess what some people have drug problems and or likely a mental issue   apparently in your worldview poor people do n't get to have freedom   these people would get it either way if they spent it on food or drugs   not to mention we are talking about a very small percentage of people and an even smaller pittance of money     we have thousands of tanks we paid hundreds of millions of dollars for each just sitting in the fucking desert that replaced the already working tanks we already had that we do not need   yet here you are concerned about some person at the lowest rank of society trading 15 dollars on a snap card for cigarettes

better in terms of what less taxes paid or more money to save for retirement in terms of retirement it would be better for you to keep the condo you currently have for at least two reasons you would n't incur the penalties and fees from buying and selling a home selling and buying a home comes with a multitude of fees and expenses that are n't included in your estimation you are n't saddled with a mortgage payment again you are n't paying a mortgage payment right now if you set aside the amount you would be paying towards that it more than covers your taxes with plenty left over to put towards retirement

no even worse most to let lenders will not lend if you are going to be living in the property     there are very few lenders that will touch something like this     it is likely you will also need to use bridging for the time the building work takes at something like 1.5 per month try posting the question to as there are a few uk mortgage experts on that site

a couple ways but its not a guarantee   you have to have special charts instead of each tick being 1 min 5 min or whatever it is a set number of trades say 2000 since retail investors only buy and sell in small amounts there will be small volume per tick an institutional investor however would have a much much higher trade lot size even if using an algo thus large volume spikes in such a chart would signal institutional activity over retail similarly daily charts showing average trade size can help you pick out when institutional activity is highest as they have much larger trade sizes you could also learn how the algos work and look for evidence one is being used ie every time price hits vwap a large sell order goes through would indicate an institutional investor is selling especially if it happens multiple times in a row

pros cons before the housing bubble the conventional wisdom was to buy as much home as you could afford thereby borrowing as much you can afford   because variable rates lead to lower mortgages they were preferred by many as you could buy more house    this of course lead to many people losing their home and many thousands of dollars a bubble is not necessary to trigger a chain of events that can lead to loss of a home   if an interest only borrower is late on a payment this often triggers a rate increase   couple that with some other things that can happen negatively and you are up $ hit 's creek imo it is not wise

i 'll speak for the person you replied to you have the right answer i 've experienced enormous success doing exactly as you suggest but you do n't have all the inputs fully understood   depression kills people and steals futures it 's not the same thing as when your cell phone breaks or your parents die as much as those suck too it 's far more serious and equally as difficult to understand without seeing it or experiencing it   i hope this person can find a path forward i 'm one of the lucky ones but it took a lot of hard the same type you are here   mental health is a jungle you have to fight your way out of some people assume the jungle never ends others die of exposure and those who do emerge are n't the same as when they went in but that 's ok life goes on you find a way to adjust the same way you might replace a broken cell phone i 'm gon na shut up now but there 's a lot that needs to be understood on what is one of the largest health issues in the world
