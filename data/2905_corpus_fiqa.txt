i think the right question you should ask yourself is can i work at home is it possible do i have a calm private place at home to work from what will be the motivation while working from if you got answers to these questions you will find if you can get money from home or not because any place you can do work from will give you money just work

i do n't mean to be rude but if you have to ask if you can earn a living from home the answer is probably not   most people are more financially productive at a traditional workplace otherwise more people would quit the jobs they hate and work at home or develop their hobbies into businesses    making a living from home requires being a self starter and finding clients customers who accept such arrangements first be assured no one earns a living stuffing envelopes being a mystery online shopper or selling low to moderate quantities of stuff to their circle of friends   a few earn a living flipping houses cars or shares or stuff on ebay but with considerable risk capital effort luck contacts and experience skill    a few more find success by inventing something or developing a business once again not as easy as it sounds    you can look for professional work freelancing or find grunt work on something like but these are easily as competitive as the job market perhaps moreso   in the case of you are competing against people in southern asia who almost surely can beat you on price

it completely depends on what type of work you intend to do are you intending to run setup your own business or stay with your current employer but work from home instead of going to the office if that s the case then yes it is a good idea since you will save on commuting costs amongst other things if you are asking about working from home under one of those work from home schemes i would be wary many of them require you do an insane amount of for literally peanuts so it might not be worth the effort since you could earn 2 3x as much in a supermarket shift of the same duration

a insured high interest savings bank account is both safe and liquid i.e. you can withdraw your money at any time   at present time you could earn interest of per year if you shop around if you are willing to truly lock in for 2 years minimum rates go up slightly but perhaps not enough to warrant loss of liquidity look at gic rates to get an idea any other investments such as mutual funds stocks index funds etfs etc are generally not consistent with your stated risk objective and time frame better returns are generally only possible if you accept the risk of loss of capital or lock in for longer time periods

do i need an investment adviser   no but you may want to explore the idea of having one is he going to tell me anything that my accountant ca n't   probably how much expertise are you expecting from your accountant here do you think your accountant knows everything within the of money from taxes insurance products investments and all your choices and what would work or would n't seems like it could be a tall order to my mind my accountant did say to come to him for advice on investment business    issues so he is willing but is he able not asking about his    competence but rather is there something that only an investment    adviser can provide by law that an accountant ca n't not that i know though do n't forget how much expertise are you expecting here from one person is this person intended to answer all your money questions but is n't that something that my accountant could should do perhaps though how well are you expecting one person to be aware of so much stuff i want you to know all the tax law so i can minimize taxes maximize my investment returns cover me with adequate insurance and protect my savings seems like a bit much to put on one entity do i need either of them wo n't the internet and sites like this one    suffice need no however how much time are you prepared to spend learning the basics of strategies that work for you how much money are you prepared to put into things to learn what works and does n't while it is your decision consider how to what extent do you diagnose your medical issues through the internet versus going to see a doctor be careful of how much of a do it yourself approach you want to go here and recognize that there are multiple approaches that may work the question is which trade offs are ok for you

yes the interest rate on a treasury does change as market rates change through changes in the price but once you purchase the instrument the rate you get is locked in the cashflows on a treasury are fixed so if the market rate increase the present value of those future cashflows decreases so the price of the treasury decreases if you buy the bond after this happens you would pay a lower price for the same fixed cashflows hence you will receive a higher rate note that once you purchase the treasury instrument your returns are locked in and guaranteed as others have mentioned also note that you should distinguish between treasury bills and treasury bonds which you seem to use interchangeably straight from the horse 's mouth treasury bills are short term securities with maturity up to a year treasury notes are medium term securities with maturity between 1 and 10 years and treasury bonds are anything over 10 years

one reason that a bond can be significantly less than face value is because people are seeking better investments elsewhere so for example if a bond does n't mature for another 10 years that 20 increase in face value is n't very attractive when compared to say leaving your money in the stock market for 10 years another reason could be that the credit worthiness of the issuer has collapsed and people expect that there is a fairly good chance they are not going to make the payment this could be what you would see if for example it was a one year time until maturity but it has a value of 40 of the face value there is a risk because they can simply not pay for example people who bought greek bonds

first of all i 've raised vc money before so i have experience in this area the other commenter who said they 'll only cause trouble is wrong as a general statement some may but that just means you 've chosen your investors poorly choosing an investor is a very important decision and you should choose someone who you think will be able truly add value to your business rather than just someone who is willing to write a check cultural alignment is important and having a shared set of goals and timelines for the business is important    that said no one here is going to be able to tell you how to structure your deal because it varies so much based on the business in general i think it 's a good idea to only take money when you need it and have a solid plan for how you 're going to use it every time you take money you 're diluting your ownership and reducing your long term upside keep in mind that as the other commenter said if you take a deal now that means that you maintain 51 and then you take more money in the future that 51 will be diluted further that said with more investors in the mix you still are likely to be the largest shareholder but again that depends on how the deals are structured    my advice seek out as much advice from as many sources as you can and hire a good law firm to handle your financing transaction because their advice is invaluable as you negotiate terms finally you should have more conditions than just retaining 51 ownership there are a lot of terms that get baked into these deals that have an impact on the long term upside learn those terms do a bunch of googling and a bunch of reading and ask for more advice

a qualifying distribution seems guaranteed to fall under long term capital gains but a disqualifying distribution could also fall under long term capital gains depending on when it is sold so what 's the actual change that occurs once something becomes a qualifying as opposed to a disqualifying distribution yes a qualifying distribution always falls under long term capital gain the difference between qualifying and disqualifying is how the bargain element of benefit is calculated in case of disqualifying distribution it is always the discount offered irrespective of the final sale price of the stock in case of qualifying distribution it is lower of actual discount or profit thus if you sell the stock at same price or slightly lower price than the price on exercise date your bargain element is less this is not the case with disqualifying distribution

agreed the mix is best at least as it has been done in northern europe in the u.s. not so much a success   the problems with capitalism are it does not scale well it political systems where the intent and desire is for a society to govern itself it willingly sacrifices any and all ethical considerations to the impulses of greed by the rich of the moment it has such a short term view of the future that nothing gets fixed or improved beyond more money for the rich of the moment which is usually referred to as progress   capitalism only works when it 's kept on a short completely transparent leash as soon as opacity and freedom to cheat are allowed everything else shortly goes to shit capitalism and governance are forces in opposition and as for allowing capitalists to govern well look at the u.s. these past few decades and you see the steady degradation of everything except the coffers of the extremely wealthy the final joke 's on them though wealth never out survives the source of it 's creation u.s. wealth will die with the u.s. or be stolen by the places where it 's hidden away

you should pay things off every month   you do n't want to be paying interest if you do n't have to   if you regularly use you card the credit agencies ca n't tell the difference   the way it works is that every month they send the credit agencies your current balance and if you paid the last bill on time   there is nothing that indicates if this is a standing balance or if you charged all of it since the last payment any business that you legitimately owe a debt to can report that to the credit agencies   not all of them do   this includes utilities cell phone companies landlords etc if any of them report overdue items it will show up on your credit report and your credit card company can use that to raise you interest rate some cards will automatically raise you credit limit   they are basically looking to make money fro you   if you often charge near the limit and pay the minimum balance each month they may raise your limit to get you to charge more and pay more interest   you can also call them and ask   they have some internal rules to decide if based on your history with them and your credit history if you are a good risk

this kind of questions keeps repeating itself on this site and the answer is generally it does n't matter as you said yourself there are costs either way and these costs are comparable generally merchant fees differ tremendously between the different kinds of merchants and while gas stations and video rentals may pay up to 5 and even more charitable organizations and community services are usually not considered as high fraud risk operation and are charged much lower fees either way paying employees managing cash check deposits or paying merchant fees is part of the charity operational expenses together with maintaining offices postal office boxes office supplies postage expenses and formal stationary and envelopes needed for physical donations handling i would guess that if the charity 's majority of donations come on line as credit card paypal payments check handling will be more expensive so i suggest you take the route you consider majority of donors pay that would be the cheapest for them to handle i would guess credit cards being the most convenient would be the way to go

change the password on your bank account immediately this is certainly a scam and while they have your login info they can cause you even bigger problems as soon as possible contact your bank and let them know what happened if you look at the links in the related list you 'll see that this is a fairly common scam it relies on the fact that some forms of fraudulent deposit take a while for the bank to detect sometime in the next month the bank is going to find out that the deposit of $ 2500 is bogus say from a bad check forged money order or some other fraudulent source when that happens the bank is going to undo the deposit and demand that you make good any of the deposit that has been spent including the $ 50 that has already gone to paypal the bank may also suspect you of being in cahoots with the depositor so you may find yourself talking to the local police accused of fraud you 've put yourself in a bad spot by giving your password out unless your can present other evidence the bank will have a strong assumption that any activity conducted via the login is performed by you this is why you should get in touch with your bank right away to build up some evidence of good will on your part more remote possibilities are that it is part of a long con where somebody is trying to find out how greedy you are this seems unlikely unless you are a target few con artists would want to risk as much as $ 2500 theoretically it could be some sort of money laundering set up but amounts involved seem too small for that to be likely

in the us pension benefits promised by employers are tightly regulated by a law called erisa one of the requirements is that money be deposited in a trust that is out of the reach of the employer and the employer 's creditors so even if the employer falls on hard times or goes bankrupt the money to pay the pensions is still there in addition the benefits are guaranteed by the federal government through the pension benefit guaranty corporation usually called the pbgc relative to most investments pensions are a safe bet

another option you might consider is rolling over some of that 401 k balance into a self directed ira or solo 401 k specifically one with checkbook privileges that would permit you to invest directly in a property via your k money without it being a loan and preserving the tax benefits you may not be able to roll over from your current employer 's 401 k while still employed   that said regarding your argument that your loan is paying interest to yourself while that is technically true that neglects the opportunity cost that money could potentially be earning a much higher and tax free return if it remains in the 401 k account than if you take it out and slowly repay it at a modest interest rate real estate can be a great way to diversify build wealth and generate income but a company match and tax free growth via an employee sponsored retirement account can be a pretty sweet deal too i actually recently wrote about comparing returns from having a tenant pay your mortgage on a rental property vs. saving in a retirement account on my blog in short tax free stock market level returns are pretty compelling even when someone else is paying your mortage before taking rather big steps like borrowing from a 401 k or buying a rental property you might also explore other ways to gain some experience with real estate investing such as the new crop of reits open to all investors under sec reg a+ some with minimums of $ 500 or less in my own experience there are two main camps of real estate investors 1 those that love the diversification and income but have zero interest in active management and 2 those that really enjoy real estate as a lifestyle and happy to deal with tenant screening and contractors etc you 'll want to be careful to be sure which camp you 're in before signing on to active investment in a specific property

do you think that publishers have n't thought this through pretty carefully already you ca n't easily make a thousand copies of a dead tree book and give it to all your friends or make it available to millions on the internet possible sure but not without a ton of work and hassle publishers rely on customers buying paper books for their personal consumption and figure that they might loan the book out once or twice big deal they still get paid   without drm publishers would basically be inviting the public at large to steal their e book product marginal costs to copying a book file are nothing unlike in the paper comparison so everyone would do it if they could sure the drm is easy to hack but the vast majority of the public is n't going to do that or know how just like for video games the publishers know some folks will do it but enough do n't that it makes the product profitable drm is what creates the whole business model for e books in the first place   by the way amazon 's drm does n't lock you into using the kindle the official kindle app for the ipad works just fine and i read many books with it

there are several paths of study you could undertake if you want to learn the fundamentals of the stock market and become a financial analyst then finance economics and accounting yes accounting are all good to study either on your own or in an institution furthermore if you want to study a specific industry it ca n't hurt to know a fair amount of the science behind that particular industry for example if you want to understand the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries knowledge of clinical trials the fda 's approval process in the us at least off label uses for drugs genetic engineering etc are all good to know you do n't have to become an expert but having a firm grasp on the science is extremely useful when evaluating a company 's prospects if you 're interested in becoming an algorithmic trader or a quant then physics certain fields of engineering signals processing applied math computer science or econometrics will get you much farther than a standard finance or accounting degree most people can learn the basics of finance not everyone can learn advanced mathematics a lot of the above applies to learning about the forex market as well economics is certainly helpful especially central bank policy but since the forex market is so massive and liquid many mathematical tools are necessary because algorithms play a key role as well per littleadv 's suggestion an mba with a concentration in finance may be an option for someone who already has a degree also an msf master of science in finance or a degree in financial engineering called an mfe or for operations research and financial engineering are other potentially better options for someone pursuing a more technical career a high trading firm may not care that you 've taken marketing and management classes they want to hire someone who can understand complex algorithms and design and implement new ones quickly   some msf programs are pre experience programs which means that in exchange for taking more time to complete they do n't expect you to have significant work experience in the financial industry an mba might require such experience however

your contributions that you 've already made are made and done and will not disappear what the windfall elimination provision does is make sure that people do not collect the subsidized low income payments while also collecting a full pension   people who did not pay anything into ss are able to collect money less but still something from the system   prior to this provision people on full pensions who were exempt from ss contributions such as teachers in many places were able to still collect those amounts which were never earned through contributions even though they had quite significant pensions that led to subsidies being given to people that did n't have as much need for them as opposed to the indigent people who did need them in your case earning for 20 + years and then presumably only earning a small pension you may be affected by this but not necessarily severely    first of all you are limited in how much your total reduction is to the lesser of a bit over $ 400 $ in 2015 or half your pension amount per month so if you earn a $ 200 in pension monthly your ss benefits are reduced by $ 100 monthly at most second your percentage and total cap is reduced if you have over 20 years of credited work at 62 by 10 per credited year and if you hit 30 years it 's eliminated   so if you have 25 years right now your total reduction is more like $ 200 at most you also have an option to keep earning via credited work   do some part time work or summer work for example   sell things online   whatever you need to do in order to get more years of credited work such that you end up with 30 years at 62   that will then increase your benefits back to the full amount this article published on nasdaq 's website explains how this works in detail including tables of benefit reductions   and log in to to check how many years of coverage you have and to see if you can get to 30 years and avoid any issues with this at all

to understand the answer we first have to understand what goodwill is goodwill in a companies balance sheet is an intangible asset that represents the extra value because of a strong brand name good customer relations good employee relations and any patents or proprietary technology an article from the economist explains this very well and actually talks about time warner directly the goodwill the bad and the ugly when one firm buys another the target ’s goodwill essentially the    premium paid over its book value is added to the combined entity ’s    balance sheet goodwill and other intangibles on the books of    companies in the s&p 500 are valued at $ 2.6 trillion or 10 of their    total assets according to analysts at goldman sachs as the economy and more firms trade down towards or even    below their book value empire builders are having to mark down the    value of assets they out on in times a recently    announced $ 25 billion goodwill charge is expected to push time warner    into an operating loss for 2008 for instance michael of    goldman sachs thinks such hits could amount to $ 200 billion or more    over the cycle investors have so far paid little attention to    intangibles but as write downs they are likely to become    increasingly wary of industries with a high ratio of goodwill to    assets such as health care consumer goods and telecoms how bad things get will depend on the american firms    used to be allowed to goodwill over many years since 2002    when an accounting rule change ended that practice goodwill has had    to be tested every year for impairment in this environment    with auditors than ever to avoid being seen to go easy on    clients companies are being told to mark down assets if there is any    doubt about their value the point out that this has no effect on cashflow since such    charges are non cash items moreover some investors take goodwill    write offs with a pinch of salt preferring to look past such    non recurring costs and accept the higher earnings    numbers to which managers understandably cling the largest companies    are thus able to survive blows that might otherwise floor    them such as the $ 99 billion loss that the newly formed but    ill conceived aol time warner as it then was reported for 2002 but    the impact can be all too real as write downs reduce overall book    value and increase leverage ratios a particular concern in these    debt averse times

it looks like your visa being refused is entirely irrelevant what happens in bankruptcy is that all the assets of the bankrupt entity are taken over liquidated and the proceeds are distributed to the creditors you 're one of the creditors and as you 've been told the proceeds are not enough to pay all the creditors in full this is quite common in bankruptcies what you can do is sue in court and demand priority over other creditors but a. you 're exactly the same as many other creditors rest of the students so why would you get a priority b. suing costs money and even if you get more you 'll pay way more for legal fees and expenses what else can you do if you paid with a credit card your credit card company may be able to reverse charges sometimes that works depending on how fast you move if you paid with a check your bank may similarly be able to stop payment on the check this provided it has n't been settled yet

on the other hand i 'd be contributing less than with a traditional    plan since it is taxed before being invested you got it backwards the effective limit is higher for a roth 401k than a traditional 401k the nominal limit is the same $ but an amount of money in a roth plan is equivalent to a greater amount of money in a traditional plan because money in a traditional plan is pre tax that will need to be taxed when taken out resulting in less post tax money conversely for a roth plan that is post tax money which came from a greater amount of pre tax money and it wo n't be taxed again so it is more money tax neutral comparison wise of course since you say that you wo n't hit the limit this consideration does n't matter anyway

i started looking at this yesterday after seeing a fb ad in reading the agreements it appears they are n't the fdic insured entity but rather they hold your money with an fdic bank who is their partner what i could n't tell is if they have one large account that they hold your money in commingled and i 'd suspect far exceeding the $ 250,000 fdic limit or if it 's individual accounts in your own name being held there and beam is the intermediary   what i 'm guessing is beam is actually owned by this partner bank and that bank is using this as a way to raise funds to fuel their loan growth in much higher rate areas such as commercial lending this is probably why they are capping the amount of new users so they can throttle the deposit influx until they 've lent it out the 2 rate paid to depositors is cheaper than going to the bond market

many of the major indices    today because of this news why how    do the rising budget deficits and debt    relate to the stock markets it does seem strange that there is a correlation between government debt and the stock market   but i could see many reasons for the reaction   the downgrade by s&p may make it more expensive for the government to borrow money i.e. higher interest rates   this means it becomes more expensive for the government to borrow money and the government will probably need to raise taxes to cover the cost of borrowing   rising taxes are not good for business   also many banks in the us hold us government debt   rising yields will push down the value of their holdings which in turn will reduce the value of us debt on the businesses balance sheets   this weakens the banks balance sheets   they may even start to unload us bonds why is there such a large emphasis on    the s&p rating i do n't know   i think they have proven they are practically useless   that 's just my opinion   many though still think they are a credible ratings agency what happens when the debt ceiling is    reached theoretically the government has to stop borrowing money once the debt ceiling is reached   if this occurs and the government does not raise the debt ceiling then the government faces three choices

with a check there are limits on cashing the stale check but that is set by the banks involved with a debit card transaction it will be up the the debit card company and your bank imagine a situation where a person finds an old check and tries to cash it at their bank if the bank considers the check stale they might reject it or put a longer hold on the check when the check writers bank gets the transaction they will also decide what to do if they reject it the first bank will reverse the transaction you ca n't count on a 90 day or 180 day limit most banks will ask you to put a stop payment on an old check that you do n't want cashed this is especially important step if you write a replacement check because there is no check number to put a stop payment on in fact the temporary hold will fall off after a few days there does n't appear to be a way to stop an old transaction be careful if you do contact the restaurant you could end up double paying for the meal if they swipe your card again   your best option may be just to keep the transaction as pending

the lead story here is you owe $ 12,000 on a car worth $ 6000   that is an appalling situation and worth a lot to get out of it   $ 6000 or a great deal more if the car is out of warranty and you are at risk of a major repair too   i 'm sorry if it feels like the payments you 've made so far are wasted often the numbers do work out like this and you did get use of the car for that time period now comes an who is threatening to the car away from you   i have to imagine they are emotionally motivated   how convenient let them take it   but it 's important to fully understand their motivations here   because financially speaking the smart play is to manage the situation so they take the car preferably that the car is upside down   whatever their motivation is give them enough of a fight keep them wrapped up in emotions while your eye is on the numbers   let them win the battle you win the war make sure the legal details put you in the clear of it   ideally do this with consent with the grandfather in response to his direct family 's wishes but keep up the theater of being really mad about it   do n't tell anyone for 7 years until the statute of limitations has passed and you ca n't be sued for it eventually they 'll figure out they took a $ 6000 loss taking the car from   you and want to talk with you about that   stay with blind rage at how they took my car   if they try to explain what upside down is ignorance and get even say they 're lying and they won why do n't they let it go   if they ask for money say they 're you forced me i did n't have a choice   which happens to be a good defense   they wanted it so bad they done their homework   since they were it 's not your job to disclose nor your job to even know   if they want you to take the car back say ca n't you forced me to buy another and i have to make payments on that one now

if you do n't intent to touch the money for 10 years or longer then dumping 100 into a low expense ratio index fund seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to do it is simple low maintenance and fairly mindless just remember to reinvest the dividends occasionally e.g. every 6 months   however if you are the kind of person who is going to lose their nerve when the market goes down 30 then putting some of your money into a bond index fund or even a treasury note fund would be better than selling stock in a down market just figure out how much of your portfolio you are comfortable losing and put that in stocks   then put the rest in some stable value fund and watch it 's value get slowly washed away by inflation while your stock investments rise through violent swings

you should contact the company and the broker about the ownership do you remember ever selling your position when you look back at your tax forms can you identify the sale it should have been reported to you and you should have reported it to the irs if not then you 're probably still the owner as to k-1 the income reported does n't have to be distributed to you partnership is a pass through entity and can not accumulate earnings for tax purposes everything is deemed distributed if however it is not actually distributed you 're still taxed on the income but it is added to your basis in the partnership and you get the tax back when you sell your position however you pay income tax on the income based on the kind of the income and on the sale at capital gains rates so the amounts added to your position will reduce your capital gains tax but may be taxed at ordinary rates get a professional advice on the issue and what to do next talk to a ea cpa licensed in new york

all transactions within an ira are irrelevant as far as the taxation of the   distributions from the ira are concerned you can only take cash from an ira and a cash distribution from a traditional ira is taxable as ordinary income same as interest from a bank say without the advantage of any of the special tax rates for long term capital gains or qualified dividends even if that cash was generated within the ira from sales of stock etc in short just as with what is alleged to occur with respect to las vegas what happens within the ira stays within the ira note some ira custodians are willing to make a distribution of stock or mutual fund shares to you so that ownership of the 100 shares of ge say that you hold within your ira is transferred to you in your personal non ira brokerage account but as far as the irs is concerned your ira custodian sold the stock as the closing price on the day of the distribution gave you the cash and you promptly bought the 100 shares at the closing price in your personal brokerage account with the cash that you received from the ira it is just that your custodian saved the transaction fees involved in selling 100 shares of ge stock inside the ira and you saved the transaction fee for buying 100 shares of ge stock in your personal brokerage account your basis in the 100 shares of ge stock is the cash that you received as a distribution from the ira so that when you sell the shares at some future time your capital gains or losses will be with respect to this basis the capital gains that occurred within the ira when the shares were sold by your ira custodian remain within the ira and you do n't get to pay taxes on that at capital gains rates that being said i would like to add to what told you in his answer your mother passed away in 2011 and you are now 60 years old so 54 or 55 in 2011 it is likely that your mother was over 70.5 years old when she passed away and so she likely had started taking required minimum distributions from her ira before her death so you should have been taking rmds from the inherited ira starting with year 2012 the rmd for 2011 if not taken already by your mother before    she passed away should have been taken by her estate and distributed to her heirs in accordance with her will or if she died in accordance with state law and/or probate court there would    not have been any 10 penalty tax due on the rmds taken by you on the grounds that you were not 59.5 years old as yet that rule applies to owners your mom in this case and not to beneficiaries you in this case so have you taken the rmds for 2012 2016 or were you waiting to turn 59.5 before taking distributions in the mistaken belief that you would have to pay a 10 penalty for early   the penalty for not taking a rmd is 50 of the amount not distributed yes 50 if you did n't take rmds from the inherited ira for years 2012 2016 i recommend that you consult a cpa with expertise in tax law ask the cpa if he she is an enrolled agent with the irs enrolled agents have to pass an exam administered by the irs to show that they really understand tax law and are not just blowing smoke and can represent you in front of the irs in cases of audit etc

yes the s corp can deduct up to the amount it actually incurred in expenses if your actual expenses to build the were $ 1000 then the $ 1000 would be deductible and your business should be able to show $ 1000 in receipts or inventory changes note you can not deduct beyond your actual expenses even if you would normally charge more for example suppose you invoiced the non profit $ 2000 for the and once the bill was paid you turned around and donated the $ 2000 back to the non profit in that case you would be deducting $ 1000 for your cost + $ 2000 donation for a total of $ 3000 but you also would have $ 2000 in income so in the end you would end up with a $ 1000 loss which is exactly what your expenses were to begin with it would probably be a good idea to be able to explain why you did this for free if somehow you personally benefit from it then it could possibly be considered income to you similar to if you bought a tv for your home with company funds it would probably be cleaner from an accounting perspective if you followed through as described invoice the non profit and then donate the payment back to them though not necessary it could lesson any doubt about your motives

the simple answer is that what you are doing is an incredible waste of time the normal process is to charge say in january the bill is cut at month end and due by the 15th of february no interest accrues as long as the credit line is sufficient for your monthly spending that 's it   now if you are watching your score closely utilization might become an issue if the statement amount is much over 20 there 's an impact to your score this is easily addressed with a second monthly payment made just before the bill is cut   keep in mind the phrase carrying a balance commonly means not paying the bill in full and letting interest accumulate i understand you did n't mean that the way you are paying your account is n't common and really serves no value

while i guess you can never tell for sure i think it is a potential problem why buy from you ship it from the us when probably a similar computer is available nearer to them   i mean this person is using a computer and the internet somewhere so it ca n't be that far to a new computer store   certainly somewhere in their province if not country or continent i suspect they will offer to pay with a cashiers check or a money order or something   then you will ship the item and the funds will be found out to be bogus a couple of months after you try to cash it   you have no computer and no money for it it really makes no sense for this person to go so far out of their way for your standard laptop unless they are trying to steal it

it 's always been that way   you are trying to bend the world around your own circumstances that 's not how it works     everything is consolidating to be more efficient with digital robots and globalization markets have reduced the need for u.s. manufacturing and that 's what a lot of small towns had going for them   it 's gone sitting around and wishing for the past to come back with something like the government to legislate it is wishful thinking   i highlighted the solution it 's to move where the money is or is going     people get when they have to give up a skill or trade or hometown they 've spent 10 20 30 years in i get it i 'm looking for ways to diversify my experience even having a job in tech because someday maybe it wo n't be here or it 'll be in india china russia the philippines latin america bulgaria or any of the numerous countries where the labor is cheaper and the supply is higher    it sucks but it 's also reality   if your hope is in voting for some sort of legislative change but it wo n't help   regulations will be issued and companies will push money to safe havens in ireland liechtenstein the caymans etc to avoid them   they 'll outsource more and layoff to compensate for the new expenses and generally find      add that to the rise of countries already benefiting from outsourcing and globalization maybe the us market is n't so important in 20 30 years   gives the government even less leverage on corporations

you have made the most important first step by starting to think about your money well done firstly pay of all credit cards as quickly as you can and start to live within your means   until you have paid of your credits cards do n’t spend any money of unnecessary items e.g. once your credit cards are paid off you can start living a more normal life   each time you spend money you need to ask yourself is this worth more to be then being    able to buy a new house in a few years    time you should be able to save at least half the amount you were paying of the credit card each mouth and still leave a reasonable life so setup a standing order at the start of the month to   your saving account given your age you are like to get promoted and hence have increased pay or get increments for each year of service   therefore every time your pay goes up set up a    standing order to transfer at least    half of the pay increases to a saving    account    you did not have this money    before so you will not miss it when     you save it in the long term you should be able to keep your car until it is about 15 years old so will not have the cost of buying another car   therefore once the car loan is over you can save that money as well

what you are suggesting would be the correct strategy if you knew exactly when the market was going to go back up this is called market timing   since it has been shown that no one can do this consistently the best strategy is to just keep your money where it is   the market tends to make large jumps especially lately   missing just a few of these in a year can greatly impact your returns   it does n't really matter what the market does while you hold investments   the important part is how much you bought for and how much you sold for   this assumes that the reasons that you selected those particular investments are still valid   if this is not the case by all means sell them and pick something that does meet your needs

you do realize the financial state of most older airliners or the top guys has dramatically decreased since 2001 in fact many are on the verge of collapsing all together american took a 3 4 drop to their overall gains this last quarter the security measures have in itself added another problem to the entire air industry and just created a larger stigma as to why flying in us airports is     if you think the us state department asked the airlines anything you must be a little off on your politics anything nsa has their hands on wo n't ever ask parties what they think which again has been a dramatic reason as to why so many security orientated implementations since 2001 have been nothing but an extreme drain on already financial situations    this tax could be the straw that breaks the back and some airliners may fold under or just stop going to those locations and charge more for international flights
# 427300
i think you may be confused on terminology here financial leverage is debt that you have taken on in order to invest it increases your returns because it allows you to invest with more money than what you actually own   example if a $ 1,000 mutual fund investment returns $ 60 6 then you could also take on $ 1,000 of debt at 3 interest and earn $ 120 from both mutual fund investments paying $ 30 in interest leaving you with a net $ 90 9 of your initial $ 1,000 however if the mutual fund takes a nose dive and loses money you still need to pay the $ 30 interest in this way using financial leverage actually increases your risk it may provide higher returns but you have the risk of losing more than just your initial principle amount in the example above imagine if the mutual fund you owned collapsed and was worth nothing now you would have lost $ 1,000 from the money you invested in the first place and you would also still owe $ 1,000 to the bank the key take away is that no risk and high returns do not go together safe returns right now are hovering around 0 interest rates if you ever feel you have a mix of options that leaves you with no risk and high returns check your math again as an addendum if instead what you plan on doing is investing say 90 of your money in money market type funds and 10 in the stock market then this is a good way to reduce your risk however it also reduces your returns as only a small portion of your portfolio will realize the typically higher gains of the stock market once again being safer with your investments leads to less return that is not necessarily a bad thing in fact investing some part of your portfolio in interest earning low risk investments is often advised 99 is basically the same as 100 however so you almost do n't benefit at all by investing that 1 in the stock market

strategy would be my top factor   while this may be implied i do think it helps to have an idea of what is causing the buy and sell signals in speculating as i 'd rather follow a strategy than try to figure things out completely from scratch that does n't quite make sense to me there are generally a couple of different schools of analysis that may be worth passing along fundamental analysis fundamental analysis of a business involves analyzing its financial statements and health its management and competitive advantages and its competitors and markets when applied to futures and forex it focuses on the overall state of the economy interest rates production earnings and management when analyzing a stock futures contract or currency using fundamental analysis there are two basic approaches one can use bottom up analysis and top down analysis the term is used to distinguish such analysis from other types of investment analysis such as quantitative analysis and technical analysis technical analysis in finance technical analysis is a security analysis methodology for forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data primarily price and volume behavioral economics and quantitative analysis use many of the same tools of technical analysis which being an aspect of active management stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory the efficacy of both technical and fundamental analysis is disputed by the efficient market hypothesis which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable there are tools like stock screeners that will let you filter based on various criteria to use each analysis in a mix   there are various strategies one could use   wikipedia under stock speculator lists several different types of stock trading strategies or approaches exist including day trading trend following market making scalping trading momentum trading trading the news and arbitrage   thus i 'd advise research what approach are you wanting to use as the make it up as we go along losing real money all the way would n't be my suggested approach there is something to be said for there being numerous and newsletter if you want other ideas but i would suggest having a strategy before putting one 's toe in the water

okay yes that would seem to make sense so something like a local vol model    in the context of term structure modelling you can also incorporate a volatility surface into the pricing of european and even exotic options e.g. through a sabr or an sabr for exotics which i suppose means by your criteria there are actually varying degree of arbitrage free when it comes to picking a model by that i mean there are varying degrees of what your model takes as given if it takes the market price of risk as given it 's an equilibrium model if it takes the observed term structure as given it 's an arbitrage free model if it takes the volatility structure as given it 's something else   and wrote a paper called a new of the dynamic term structure models in the journal of investment management that basically coincides with what we 're saying   so yes it sounds right to me

your understanding of the stock market is absolutely correct theoretically however there is a lot more to it a stock on a given day is effected by a lot of factors these factors could really be anything for example if you are buying a stock in an agricultural company and there was no this year there is a big chance that your stock will lose value there is also a chance that a war breaks out tomorrow and due to all the government spending on the war the economy collapses and effects the prices of stocks why does this happen this happens because bad or war can get people to lose confidence in a stock market on the other hand gdp growth and low unemployment rates can make people think positive and increase the demand in a stock driving the prices up the main factor in the stock market is people perceive certain news this causes a stock to rise or fall even before the event actually happens for weather pundits predicted good for next year that news is already known to people so if the weather was correct it might not drive the prices up however if the was way better than people expected it to be it would drive the price up and vice versa    these are just examples at a basic level there are a lot of other factors which determine the price of the stock the best way to look at my personal opinion is the way warren buffet puts it i.e. look at the stock as a business and see the potential growth over a long period of time   there will be unexpected events but in the long run the business must be profitable there are various ways to value a company such as price to earnings ratios peg ratios discounted cash flows and you can also create your own see what works best for you and record your success failure ratio before you actually put money in   good luck

it depends on how immediately you think you 'll need your emergency fund cash if you anticipate running into problems where you need cash right away e.g. you live paycheck to paycheck and your car breaks down a lot put it into a checking or money market account if you do n't think your emergencies will require immediate access to cash e.g. unemployment then put it in a savings account or cd if there is a lot of money in your accounts that goes unused and you want a bigger safety net then consider investing it though it 's generally a better idea to pay off debts at this point i think the best idea is to split your emergency fund between your checking and savings maybe 20 checking and 80 savings that way you have some extra cash on hand when you need it while most of your money is growing in savings

re   in retirement i do n't see how we can    be in a higher tax bracket than we are    now maybe than we will be if one of    us stops working we buy a house we    have a couple of kids etc that 's assuming tax rates remain the same   what if tax rates go up   consider the u.s. deficit and the debt and unfunded entitlement programs even though you may be in a lower bracket in retirement bracket as in ordered income ranges there 's still a possibility that at that later point in time tax rates in general could be higher than today   so even though you may find yourself in a lower bracket in retirement who is to say the tax rate for that bracket wo n't exceed what you pay today in the higher bracket do n't think switch   rather i 'd consider diversifying retirement savings across both pre tax and roth i.e. make contributions to each type of account so you 're not gambling 100 on which bracket you 'll be in what tax rates will be like in the future etc then you 'll at least have some money in a roth account that in retirement you can do with as you please without having a tax consequence assuming the u.s. government does n't get so desperate as to change the tax free nature of roth account withdrawals

it sounds like you are interested in investing in the stock market but you do n't want to take too much risk investing in an index eft will provide some diversification and can be less risky than investing in individual stocks however with potentially lower returns if you want to invest your money the first thing you should do is learn about managing your risk you are still young and you should spend your time now to increase your education and knowledge there are plenty of good books to start with and you should prepare an investment plan which incorporates a risk management strategy $ 1000 is a little low to start investing in the stock market so whilst you are building your education and preparing your plan you can continue building up more funds for when you are ready to start investing   place your funds in an high interest savings account for now and whilst you are learning you can practice your strategies using virtual accounts in fact the asx has a share market game which is held   2 or 3 times per year the asx website also has some good learning materials for and they hold regular seminars it is another good source for improving your education in the subject   remember first get educated then plan and practice and then invest

stock issuing and dilution is legal because there must be some mechanism for small companies to grow into big companies a company sees a great investment opportunity   it would be a perfect extension of their activities but they can not afford it to get the necessary money they can either take out a loan or issue shares taking a loan basically means that this is temporary but the company will go back to being small when the loan is paid back issuing new shares basically means that the board means that this growth is permanent and the company will be big for the foreseeable future it is utterly necessary that companies have this option for raising cash and therefore it is legal as detailed in the other answers you end up with a smaller percentage of a larger company usually ending up with more or less the same value

from the times a reader on g.m. ’s bankruptcy q. i own g.m. preferred shares should i be looking to sell them or    hold on i bought them at $ 25 a share when they were issued in late    2001 manhattan a. when a company files for bankruptcy its various stock and    bondholders essentially get in line the first investors to be repaid    are secured debt holders then senior bond investors followed by    subordinated debt holders preferred shareholders are next and    lastly holders of common stock in a bankruptcy preferred shares are usually worthless much like    shares of common stock but in the case of g.m. there may be some    good or at least somewhat better news most of g.m. ’s preferred    shares are actually senior notes or quarterly interest bonds which    means you will be treated as a bondholder according to cohen    president of envision capital management so you will be able to    exchange your for g.m. stock bondholders will receive 10    percent of the new company ’s stock it ’s not the best deal but it    beats the empty bag true preferred shareholders would have been left    holding of course this is just one example and you were hoping to get some larger picture the article stated in a bankruptcy preferred shares are usually worthless much like shares of common stock which at least is a bit closer to that if you accept usually as a statistic

the general discussion of inflation centers on money as a medium of exchange and a store of value it is impossible to discuss inflation without considering time since it is a comparison between the balance between money and goods at two points in time the whole point of using money rather than bartering goods is to have a medium of exchange having money you are interested in the buying power of the money in general more than the relative price of a specific commodity if some supply distortion causes a shortage of tobacco or gasoline or rental properties the price of each will go up however if the amount of circulating money is doubled the price of everything will be bid up because there is more money chasing the same amount of wealth the persons who get to introduce the additional circulating money will win at the expense of those who already hold cash most of the public measures that are used to describe the economy are highly suspect for example during the 90s the federal government ceased using a constant market basket when computing cpi allowing with this it was no longer possible to make consistent comparisons over time the so called core cpi is even worse as it excludes food and energy which is fine provided you do n't eat anything or use any energy therefore when discussing cpi it is important to understand what exactly is being measured and how most published statistics understate inflation

what is the probability of a real occasion meaning not just an example being exactly zero even if you have 0.1 you can still do the math also it is kind of depending on the occasion for example you want to calculate the roi of an investment for which you had zero capital and you made that investment with leverage meaning you got a loan in order to get that loan you should have provided a collateral so in this case as a starting sum you use the collateral in another example say eat it 's difficult to have exactly zero so in most cases you wo n't have to deal with zero values only positives and negatives

if you want to predict the the easiest solution is to get hold of a copy of last year 's tax forms and fill them in with estimated numbers   odds are that none of the more complicated deductions will apply to you this first time around so i 'd suggest just using the federal 1040ez and your state 's equivalent for this purpose if it turns out that you can claim anything more than the standard deduction that would reduce your taxes so this is leaning toward the safe side

the main risk i see to this plan is with a late payment to your credit card   for a variety of reasons some outside your control you could end up with a late payment on the cc and a + 18 interest rate making your arbitrage attempts unprofitable you sense that this is risky and it derives from placing short term risk on a long term asset    your interest rate is high for the current market   what kind of things can you do reduce that rate   what kind of things can you do to reduce your principle   those kind of things represent far less risk and accomplish the same goal

comparing index funds to long term investments in individual companies a counterintuitive study by jeremy siegel addressed a similar question would you be better off sticking with the original 500 stocks in the s&p 500 or like an index fund changing your investments as the index is changed the study long term returns on the original s&p 500 companies siegel found that the original 500 including spinoffs mergers etc would do slightly better than a changing index this is likely because the original 500 companies take on a value rather than growth aspect as the decades pass and value stocks outperform growth stocks index funds main strength may be in the behavior change they induce in some investors to the extent that investors genuinely set and forget their index fund investments they far outperform the average investor who mis times the market the average investor enters and leaves the market at the worst times underperforming by a few percentage points each year on average this buying high and selling low timing behavior damages long term returns paying active management fees e.g. 1 per year makes returns worse returns compound on themselves a great benefit to the investor fees also compound to the benefit of someone other than the investor paying 1 annually to a financial advisor may further dent long term returns but robert shiller notes that advisors can dissuade investors from market timing for clients who will always follow advice the 1 advisory fee is worth it

stocks as an asset represent the sum of the current market value of all of your holdings if your portfolio is showing unrealized gains and losses then that net amount is inherently reflected in the current market value of your holdings   that 's not to say cost basis is not important any closed trades realized gains or losses will of course have an impact on your taxable income so it could n't hurt to keep track of your cost basis from a tax standpoint but understand that the term asset refers to the current market values and does not consider base amounts taxes do perhaps consider making separate cells for cost basis but also bear in mind that most if not all of the major online discount brokers will provide transferring of cost basis information electronically to the major online tax service providers

since you seem to be interested in investing in individual stocks this answer will address that   as for the general question of investing the answer that @johnfx gave is just about as good as it gets investing in individual stocks is extremely risky and takes a lot of work to do right   on top of the fairly obvious need to research a stock before you buy there is the matter of keeping up with the stocks to know when you need to sell as well as myriad other facets of investing   paid professionals spend all day every day doing this and they have a hard time beating an index fund   unless you take the time to educate yourself and are willing to continually put in a good bit of effort i would advise you to stay away from individual stocks and rely on mutual funds

there is a subtle difference   in an fdic insured bank account you are guaranteed to get all of your money back out if you put $ 1000 into your bank account you are guaranteed to be able to get at least $ 1000 back out when you want the value of the account in dollars can never go down for any reason   when you put money into a brokerage account cash is typically invested in a money market fund money market funds are considered very safe investments with low risk of loss and a corresponding low rate of return   however it is possible for the value of a money market fund to go down and sipc insurance does not cover that   what sipc does cover is any sort of shenanigans that a broker might play on you if they screw up and delete your account or give your money to someone else or close up shop and head to grand cayman sipc ensures that you will get your money back but it does not cover investment losses

i used to work as a sale support for one of these companies as a sale support i did n't get commission from the sale but a sale manager did and he made good money however i ended up doing a lot of the sales myself and never got any commission for it even though the boss kept promising me that i would get them it 's relatively easy money but i felt like you have to sell your soul a little it 's hard to justify for yourself that a 30 interest for a 6 month term is a great deal so you can get your guests to take the loan most of the clients you will likely get are the ones who 1 have little knowledge about finance and/or 2 can not get a loan anywhere else nobody would get a loan with these companies if they have a better choice i also found it was borderline harassment for my clients because i was forced to constantly call them few times a day to get them into taking our loan offers i did end up leaving the company after three months because the boss was and thought he could do it all himself   back to your question it is not shady mostly because it 's definitely legal but the sales tactics can be that would depend on your management but i would say most companies probably employs similar tactics

assuming be a taxable account and you 're an above average wage earner the following seem to be biggest factors in your decision tax advantaged income w/o retirement account protection so i 'd pick a stock stocks or fund that 's designed to minimize earnings taxable at income and/or short term gains rates e.g. dividends declining risk profile make sure you periodically tweak your investment mix over the 2 3 year period   to reduce your risk exposure    you want to be near savings account risk levels by the end of your timeline   but make sure you keep 1 in mind so probably do n't adjust by selling anything until you 've hit the 1-year holding mark to get the long term capital gains rates in addition to tax sensitive stock bond funds at the major brokerages like fidelity i 'd specifically look at tax free municipal bond funds targeted for your state of residence since those generally pay better than savings on after tax basis for little increase in risk assuming you stick w/ higher rated municipalities

one thing i would like to clear up here is that black scholes is just a model that makes some assumptions about the dynamics of the underlying + a few other things and with some rather complicated math out pops the black scholes formula black scholes gives you the real price under the assumptions of the model your definition of what a real price entails will depend on what assumptions you make with that being said black scholes is popular for pricing european options because of the simplicity and speed of using an analytic formula as opposed to having a more complex model that can only be evaluated using a numerical method as dumbcoder mentioned should note that for many other types of derivative contracts e.g. american or style exercise the black scholes analytic formula is not appropriate the other important thing to note here is that the market does not necessarily need to agree with the assumptions made in the black scholes model and they most certainly do not to use it if you look at implied for a set of options which have the same expiration but differing strike prices you may find that the implied for each contract differ and this information is telling you to what degree the traders in the market for those contracts disagree with the distribution assumption made by black scholes implied vol is generally the thing to look at when determining cheapness of an option contract with all that being said what i 'm assuming you are interested in is either called a delta gamma approximation or more generally greek based profit and loss attribution in case you wanted to google some more about it here is an example that is relevant to your question let 's say we had the following european call contract popping this in to bs formula gives you a premium of $ delta of and gamma of let 's say you bought it and the price of the stock immediately moves to 55 and nothing else changes re evaluating with the bs formula gives whereas using a delta gamma approximation gives the actual math does n't work out exactly and that is due to the fact that there are higher order greeks than gamma but as you can see here clearly they do not have much of an impact considering a 10 move in the underlying is almost entirely explained by delta and gamma

this question can simply be answered with it depends but i am sure that is not the answer you want so here is all of the reasons why it depends the philosophy behind real time energy pricing is that   you pay for what it actually costs for the energy to be produced peak times costs the power company a lot of money to produce the power there are many reasons for this but the simplest reason is that at some point the company will have to build extra power plants in order to be able to provide for the peak demand while these plants will be widely during off peak times in the traditional flat rate charge per billing you had to be charged higher then it actually costs during the off peak hours in order for the power company to make sure they brought in enough money to cover the costs of the peak hours technology has now advanced enough that power company can charge you more directly of what it actually costs them potentially this could mean that you would pay more in electricity this can happen if you are a person who loves to use energy during peak hours do you like turning on all of your lights when you get home from work in the summer what about watching tv or what about cooking dinner or what about turning the ac down colder to overcome the heat produced by cooking dinner all of those things that you might be used to doing are actually costing the power company more money because they have to plan for those higher peak loads you can save yourself money if you are willing to shift your usage to other times of day such as cook later in the evening or decide to grill outside or wait to watch your tv show until later in the evening if you are someone who is stuck in your ways and does n't want to adjust the time of day that you do certain things doing real time pricing may end up costing you more some people could argue that it actually should cost you more why should someone who is saving the power company money have to pay extra for someone who is costing the power company more money all of this is viewed from the short term though you may save some money here or there or you may end up paying a little extra here or there but i truly believe that in the long run everything will equalize out such that you will be paying the same anyways or at least a small enough difference i would n't worry about it if you stick with the flat rate pricing they are already have to factor in you being a peak rate user when you might not actually be one   in short if you are willing to adjust your habits i will almost promise you that you will save money if you do n't want to change and especially like to use energy during summer you might want to just stay where you are at

it 's important because you may be able to reduce the total amount of interest paid by paying the loan faster but you can do nothing to reduce the total of your principal repayments the distinction can also affect the amount of tax you have to pay some kinds of interest payments can be counted as business expenses which means that they reduce the amount of income you have to pay tax on but this is not generally the case for money used to repay the loan principal

the implication is market irrationality is stronger than market rationality aka nothing makes sense when tsla climbs to $ 400 or when cmg rises to $ 750    i would n't say there is a systematic flaw in valuation i think there is just a lot of ignorance markets are more open to household investors than ever before you used to go to your broker and ask him what 's up and he 'd give you the inside scoop since you pay them money now you go onto marketwatch and get some random nobody 's opinion on everything and make stock selections based on that    but eventually the chickens come home to roost and things will correct itself big players will jump ship and cause signals to other traders to jump ship the public can pump stocks up pretty high but it does n't just go to infinity eventually someone will stop and say wtf is going on and start selling stocks are sold on a basis of a limit order book so it 's real prices that people are paying people do n't care about prices currently because most do n't have any finance knowledge but want to invest their own money   they just hear about tesla doing something amazing from some clickbait article or news outlet and ca n't stop thinking about buying tesla they go to chipotle and think wow this place is so good and hip they must be a great investment    the markets have been filled with more subjective analysis than ever before especially with so much low quality information at your equally ignorant people blogs about investment and personal finance being for other ignorant people in the end they all lose   people who this stock is going up to $ 250 easily with literally zero quantitative analysis or even a baseline reference point to back it up are prime examples of this    ignorance of markets and cheap money almost always lead to market runs that end dot com bubble 1929 market crash 2008 it 's always the same people who have no business taking loans out or buying on margin or leveraging positions with debt only to get fucked over once things are brought back down to earth after 2 runs of qe we now have cheap money and with everyone being a for their personal investment strategy we now also have rampant ignorance    i do n't expect things to last but no one can call the bottom or the top or else you 'd be very very rich have a safe portfolio do n't try to time the markets have a strategy that hedges against unexpected change do n't try to gamble on this change because it 's ultimately impossible to predict the movement of every single person on this earth that invests their money into markets so do n't try just be prepared      to expand further into valuation theory   at the end of the day people invest their money to make more money   it 's as simple as that   if your money does n't grow in an investment vehicle it 's ultimately a shit investment   but no one values intrinsic value of a company 's equity before they decide whether or not $ 380 for tsla is a good bad deal   as a result stocks can be pumped up way higher and people still see the gains on their stocks through capital gains fueled by other optimistic investors    non zero sum goes both ways   people can make shitloads of money on stock without an equitable loser people can also lose shitloads on stock without any real winner emerging from the   when this bubble bursts lots and lots of people will lose money on tsla when people 's expectations become rational and they stop paying $ 300 a share for a negative or 70 pe ratio   it 's insane what people will pay for these companies without even realizing the implication if you buy a share of a company with a pe ratio of 70 you just paid 70 times their earnings for a share   in an ideal world where they released every single penny of earnings as dividends it would take you 70 periods to reclaim your money on that share   this obviously does n't take into account capital gains but capital gains are n't supposed to be this irrational to where a stock can be pumped up into pe ratio in the first place   it 's a whole messed up web of confusion and irrationality and eventually something will a reaction   imagine a market where everyone just agreed to pump up a single stock to infinity and everyone just in shitloads of money   would this work   of course not   it 's literally a pyramid scheme that relies on future generations to constantly inject capital no real value is being created by this scheme   it requires constantly more future generations to continue adding money into the scheme and will crash once people stop pumping money into it   the same thing will happen here   everyone agreed to pump up tsla in a sense but eventually people will realize this is stupid as shit and the pyramid will come down because there is nothing they receive from this scheme other than the money from other people   it 's essentially moving money around making 0 use of it until people stop pumping money into the system and everyone realizes that nothing of real value had been produced through the use of this money   ultimately the only thing that creates real value is the money that is returned to shareholders from an outside party the company you 're invested in   real value is not created when people exchange stock and money   so why do these transactions create higher values in equity   the basis of equity valuation states that dividends are the only way for companies to raise the price of their stock going off the traditional dividend discount model   and theoretically that 's the only logical explanation   buying and trading stock does nothing for the company minus t stock they might own   ultimately the only party creating real value is the underlying company   if they are n't creating real value then their stock should not be increasing period   the way they create value is by efficiently utilizing assets to generate returns on investment which can be returned to investors through dividends   dividends can only be increased while maintaining an equitable payout ratio by generating more net income that can increase the actual pool of money that can be allocated back to investors   tsla does not do this   tsla regularly loses money and   there is no logical explanation for any of this except that everyone is irrational     obviously theory is not the same as in practice but the theory is important here because it 's really the basis for any investment at all   at the end of the day a share of stock is the right to a share of the company 's equity   people own equity in companies because companies generate money that it returns back to its owners   that 's what a company does   that 's what an owner does   if you own shares of a company you 're an owner   and if your company does not return more money back to you yoy then why are you invested in them     ultimately you 're riding a capital gains wave that will eventually once market irrationality to rationality   and it always does because the real value always catches up to the fake value that is caused by pumping and dumping stocks

you will often receive a lower bill if you simply wait for a second or third billing statement i was once given the advice to never pay a medical bill until after they had sent three notices because they will almost certainly reduce the amount due sounds crazy right i have excellent credit so the idea of risking it by ignoring bills disturbed me greatly and i at the advice   i then had a similar experience to you and decided to take the advice by the third statement the bill was reduced to less than half of the original with zero intervention on my part i then paid it without any impact to my credit whatsoever i 've since done that every time i receive healthcare services and the bill is always reduced on subsequent statements generally to less than half of the original bill sometimes it 's because insurance finally got around to paying sometimes a credit is mysteriously added sometimes line items disappear without explanation line items sometimes appear over time too but the overall balance generally goes down i do n't know the reason for it but it works this has happened with a variety of providers so it 's not just one company that does it granted i never called to negotiate the price so i ca n't say if i would've gotten a better deal by doing that i like it because it requires no time or effort on my part and it has greatly reduced my medical bills with zero impact to my credit i only have personal anecdotes to back it up but it 's worked for me

imo there are too many people expecting a correction for one to occur i hear both smart money and retail investors talking about raising cash for a correction that 's not usually when they occur in all actuality it should n't matter you should always invest expecting a correction the market could be another 20 higher before we get a correction or it could go down 10 and then another 10 from there if you ca n't weather the storms then stay out of the water

transactions cost is what kills you here the price of determining who gets what and then enforcing it    for example let 's say you invested in my electrical engineering class then when i get out of school i go to work at starbucks where i 'm applying literally none of that knowledge or experience and thus i signed a bad deal   or what if i change majors you still have a stake on my lifetime income but it wo n't be in the field you helped me into so college aged indecision would mean twice as much out of my take home income for life   or what if i 'd like to buy your percentage back from you what would be a fair price would there be a market to establish it   you should read the unincorporated man which has a system very similar to what you 're proposing    in this story education and subsistence investment have become expensive so in order to send a kid through college you 're actually purchasing shares of an individual 's future earnings like they 're a corporation parents get 10 when you 're born government gets 5 in lieu of taxes these shares have a market value based on income expenditures health etc pricing individuals just like you 'd price a company   in the story most individuals have sold over 50 of their shares meaning that they effectively do n't have controlling interest over their lives their jobs their homes all their major decisions are made by the shareholders so you might take a high risk job just because one of your biggest shareholders wants a payday   of course since it 's on the open market you can buy your shares back once you 're back over 50 you 're back in control of your life and the majority of your income the way the author it it 's a pretty comprehensive system and the book stays ambiguous as to whether it 's debt slavery or a new evolution of liberty   but again transactions costs think of six billion little corporations with all their vital stats and market data now imagine voting on the jobs and homes of the potentially hundreds of people in whom you have an interest it would simply be impossible to keep track of   honestly it 'd probably be more modest to just pay your student loans

there are many different things that can happen all or some taking russia and argentina as precedence you may not be able to withdraw funds from your bank for some period of time not because your accounts will be drained but because the cash supply will be restricted similar thing has also happened recently in cyprus however the fact that the governments of russia and argentina limited the use of cash for a period of time does n't mean that the us government will have to do the same it my choose some other means of restraint what 's for sure is that nothing good will happen nothing will probably happen to your balance in the bank although cyprus has shown that that is not a given either but i 'm not so sure about fdic maintaining it 's insurance if the bank fails meaning if the bank defaults as a result of the chain effect you may lose your money if the government is defaulting it might not have enough cash to take over the bank deposits after the default the currency value will probably drop sharply devaluation which will lead to inflation meaning your same balance will be worth much less than it is now so there 's something to worry about for everyone

some people believe that inflation is caused by an increase in the money supply when the banks engage in fractional reserve lending is this correct you are referring to the austrian school of thought the austrians define inflation in terms of money supply in other words inflation is defined as an increase in the aggregate money supply even if prices stay the same of fall this is not the only definition of inflation the mainstream defines inflation as a general increase in the prices of consumer goods based on the first definition then your supposition is correct by definition based on the second definition you can make a case that money supply affects prices but keep in mind it 's just one factor affecting prices furthermore economics is resistant to so it is difficult to establish causality austrian economists tend to approach the problem of proof using a tactic establish by explaining the mechanism then look for historical evidence to back up that explanation as i understand it when there is more available money in the market the price of goods will increase but will a normal merchant acknowledge the increase of money supply and raise prices immediately i posit that in the short run merchants wo n't increase prices in response to increased money supply so why does increased money supply lead to price inflation the simple answer in the austrian school of thought is that you have more money chasing the same amount of goods in other words printing money does n't actually increase the number of widgets made i believe the austrian school is consistent with your supposition that prices do n't increase in the short run in other words producers do n't increase prices immediately after observing an increase in the money supply specifically after the banks print more notes where will the money be distributed first   the austrian story goes as follows imagine that the first borrower is a home and he is borrowing freshly printed money to build new homes this will need to buy materials and hire labor to build homes and in doing so he will bid against other home the increased demand for lumber nails tools carpentry etc will ever so slightly increase the market prices for these goods and services so the money goes first to the borrower but then flows also to the people selling to the borrower and the people selling to the sellers etc it has a ripple effect who will be the first one to have a need to rise their price these producers wo n't need to increase their price but they will choose to do so if the believe that demand outstrips supply in other words if you have more orders than you can fill then you may post higher prices because you think consumers will tolerate the higher price   you might object that competition any one producer from unilaterally raising prices but in fact if all producers are failing to keep up with demand then you can unilaterally raise prices because other producers do n't have any excess inventory to undercut you with

you also want to make sure that the loan is being re amortized sometimes called recasting   without this you are still responsible for the interest payments according to the original amortization table   if you re amortize the loan with a principal that is lower than on the table you will reduce the amount of interest you owe each period which means that if you maintain the same payment you will pay less in total interest   it 's important to realize that most people re amortize to reduce the payment amount but not the term   also not all loans can be re amortized and some banks limit how often it can be done

you 're mostly correct although i think you 're missing something essential about no arbitrage versus an arbitrage argument   black scholes makes an arbitrage argument which is that the value of an option should be the same as any portfolio that has identical cash flows and this is generally a sound argument   notice however that bs is ultimately an equilibrium model it tells you the correct price of an option if the assumptions of bs hold and does n't necessarily match observed market prices   a no arbitrage condition or model deliberately incorporates observed prices or yields or whatever into the model so that there can not be an arbitrage opportunity implied by the model   this comes up a lot in term structure of interest rate problems where equilibrium models like or cox ross wo n't perfectly reproduce the current observed term structure and so imply an arbitrage opportunity   no arbitrage models like hull white specifically match the model 's term structure to observed yields prices so that there is no arbitrage opportunity between the observed term structure and your model of it   it 's important to note that this will still allow for arbitrage involving bonds that are not part of the observed term structure   as for equivalent martingale measures you might think about it more generally   the process involves changing the probability distribution from the actual which is hard to use for pricing to a different one that 's easier to use but will result in the same prices this is nearly always a risk neutral probability   you can think of equivalent martingale   pricing as asking how would this security behave and be priced in a world that is completely risk neutral and then making an argument that the prices are in fact equivalent   edit grammar

i 'm not sure if this answer is going to win me many friends on reddit but here goes   there 's no good reason why they could n't have just told him the current balance shown on their records but   there are some good reasons why they ca n't quote a definitive payoff balance to instantly settle the account   it 's very possible to charge something today and not have it show up on chase 's records until tomorrow or monday or later there are still places that process paper credit card transactions or that deal with 3rd party payment processors who reconcile transactions m f 9 and so on    most transactions these days are authorized the instant you swipe the card and the merchant wo n't process until they get authorization back from the cc company but sometimes those authorizations come from third party processors who do n't bill chase until later some of them might not process a friday afternoon transaction until close of business monday    also there are things like fares that might be collected when you exit the cab but the record exists only in the taxi 's onboard machine until they plug it into something else at the end of the shift    there are still some situations outdoor flea markets auctions etc where the merchant takes a paper imprint and does n't actually process the payment until they physically mail it in or whatever    some small businesses have information security routines in place where only one person is allowed to process credit card payments but where multiple customer service reps are allowed to accept the cc info write it down on one piece of paper then either physically hand the paper to the person with processing rights or deposit the paper in a locked office or mail slot for later processing this is obviously not an instant update system for chase believe it or not this system is actually considered to be more secure than retaining computerized records unless the business has very rigorous end to end info security    so there are a bunch of legit reasons why a cc company ca n't necessarily tell you this instant that you only need to pay $ x and no more to close the account although there is no good reason why they should n't be able to quote your current balance    what happens when you close an account is basically that they stop accepting new charges that were made after your notification but they will still accept and bill you for legit charges that you incurred before you gave them notice so basically they turn off the credit card but they ca n't guarantee how much you owe until the next billing cycle after this one closes   you notify them to close the account they stop authorizing new charges    their merchant agreements basically give the merchant a certain window to process charges the cc company process legit charges that were made prior to closing the account    the cc company sends you the final statement after that window for any charges has expired   when that final statement is paid or if it is zero that is when the account is settled and reported to equifax etc as paid    so it 's hard to tell from your post who was being overly semantic unreasonable if the cc company refused to tell the current balance they were just being but if they refused to promise that the current balance shown is enough to instantly settle the account forever they had legit reasons   hope that helps

i actually help companies start up for a living    here are some big parts you should do   1 post on craigslist for work   seems pointless but it helps a ton   you ll get potential new clients and it will help   do one ad every day under something specific   one day maybe dishwashers next garbage disposal next drain next water leaks   you get the point   this will help reach people after a specific thing   also it will help get your name out    2 post on your local news areas   for example your local papers website will have a section to add your business   also do a search for local forums around your area and post there    3 create a website   if you are short on cash get a site from a good name provider   do nt use go daddy as they are an evil company ha   find one local if you can and support your local economy   it might be a few dollars more but it helps everyone out and tell them how you are a new company   they might have friends and family members that can spread word of mouth   also ask them if they know of any local hosting providers   for your website i d say hire someone   it should be under 1500 for everything if its done well   if you are short on cash get wordpress and get a good blog style you like and go from there    update your blog once a week to start   this will help google see it as a site that s worth something and move you up   after 6 months you can post daily but do nt wait 5 months then post   oddly enough google will punish you at times for this   makes no sense but that s how the beast can work   your posts can be a new weekly deal   showing a new job you did   or maybe tricks that people can do themselves   while it seems that would be counter productive to business   when someone sees you as not trying to just sell something they trust you more    5 submit your site to the major search engines google it    6 post your company on local business pages   yelp google and others you have   lots of people use this   also after every job ask them to post a review on yelp and those other sites with a positive review   that might be the biggest helping factor    7 if you are in an older town just get a basic add in the yellow pages   its not hard and very helpful      8 go to your local fair events and do free contests   like a free hours worth of services   this can help you get a good rep from customers   as your company is going to live and die by word of mouth   your skills are not going to cost him much of anything except time and it will in the long run give a great rep    9 you can try mail flyers which at times can have some success but that depends on if you have an older clientele or not in your area   same goes for getting in the yellow pages   i personally am against it as most of the time these companies are scams trying to make an extra buck on you    10 call local organizations that might need you   boy scouts girl scouts and other programs   see if you can place a set of business cards at the counter at these places   this should help   this also goes for local business   auto shops and other small business tend to help each other when it comes to things like this      anyways i typed way too much but there is a great way to help

you can sell as many shares as you want the only issue will be the fees attached to low dollar trades i would recommend a site with no fee for the first 20 trades if you plan to be a frequent trader i would recommend getting a stable rate $ 10 for every transaction if your plan is to trade in low quantities then maybe a variable rate 1 of all fades might be better suited

you should check if your card issuer provides a bill pay service i have a capitalone card and i know they do n't but wells fargo may i do n't know however for that to work your biller must accept credit cards as payments at least that 's the restriction i have with such a feature on my card that means that if the company does n't accept credit cards directly they 're likely not to participate in the credit cards bill pay system as well some credit cards are actually mailing these balance transfer checks quite frequently trying to you into taking advantage of your available credit unless you really do n't have any other choice you should n't but if that 's the only way you have of paying go for it that not be treated as a cash advance but rather as balance transfer you can call the customer service and have them a check mailed to you you may want to consider talking to your bank and checking if they can give you a line of credit that would be similar to the credit card i.e. revolving credit line from your credit report score perspective but may have lower interest rates

if she is a legitimate owner you ca n't force her to sell her interest in the house you can communicate indirectly with her perhaps through a lawyer and see if she is willing to sign something authorizing you to sell unless she is mentally incompetent you will likely have a very difficult time of proceeding with a legal challenge at minimum she should be paying you rent if she is the sole and if she is unwilling to let you live in the house or pay you rent as co owners you could possibly proceed with a suit along those lines this is a good example of why it 's not ideal to co own a home with someone you are n't legally married to including a relative or someone you are dating because there is no relatively simple process similar to divorce which determines the allocation of property in the case of a serious dispute if living together it may be preferable to have one party own the home and rent it to another if inherited it may be preferable for one party to buy out the others and rent it back to them or arrange for a portion of any money made through the sale or rental of the home best of luck i hope you are able to reach an agreeable outcome

i 'm guessing since i do n't know the term but it sounds like you 're asking about the technique whereby a loan is used to gather multiple years gift allowance into a single up front transfer for the subsequent n years the giver pays the installments on the loan for the recipient at a yearly amount small enough to avoid triggering gift tax you still have to pay income tax on the interest received even though you 're giving them the money to pay you and you must charge a certain minimum interest or more accurately if you charge less than that they tax you as if the loan was earning that minimum historically this was used by relatively wealthy folks since the cost of lawyers and filing the paperwork and bookkeeping was high enough that most folks never found out this workaround existed and few were moving enough money to make those costs worthwhile but between the great recession and the internet this has become much more widely known and there are services which will draw up standard paperwork have a lawyer sanity check it for your local laws file the official mortgage lien not actually needed unless you want the recipient to also be able to write off the interest on their taxes and provide a payments processing service if you do expect part or all of the loan to be paid by the recipient or whatever subset of those services you need   i 've done this in my case it cost me a bit under $ 1000 to set up the paperwork so i could loan a friend a sizable chunk of cash and have it clearly on record as a loan not a gift the amount in question was large enough and the interpersonal issues tricky enough that this was a good deal for us obviously run the numbers family loan   will find much more detail about how this works and what it can and ca n't do along with services specializing in these transactions note if you are actually selling something such as your share of a house this dance may or may not make sense again run the numbers and if in doubt get expert advice rather than trusting strangers on the web go not to the internet for legal advice for it shall say both mu and ni

first of all congratulations on paying off $ 40k in debt in one year mathematically you 'd be better off making the standard car loan payments and putting your extra money toward the student loan however there are a few other things that you might want to consider over the last year you 've knocked out a whole bunch of different debts   feels pretty good does n't it   at your current rate you could knock out your new car loan in 6 months   then you 'd only have one debt left   if it sounds to you like it would be nice to only have one debt left then it might be worth the mathematical disadvantage you would get by paying off the car early instead of putting the money toward the last student loan the car loan is 0 but if you are late on a single payment they will take that opportunity to raise your interest rate to something probably higher than the interest rate of your student loan   for this reason you may decide it is not worth the hassle and you 'd rather just eliminate the car loan as quickly as possible either choice is fine in my opinion as long as you have a purpose behind the choice and you are committed to eliminating both debts as quickly as possible as an aside it is important to remember that even a 0 loan is not really free money and needs to be paid back   you know this of course but sometimes you see a 0 loan and it feels like free money   it 's not   you have probably already paid for the loan by forfeiting a rebate   so although at this point having already taken this loan and paying for it you will come out ahead by dragging out your car loan for the full term in the future do not think that you can make money by buying something at 0 interest

i think a labor management issue explains the high cost of popcorn some weeks theaters are loaded with patrons and other weeks there are many fewer patrons if popcorn were priced so that most patrons bought some the theater manager would have to have lots of employees to sell popcorn on the really busy days the manager would have to cover the cost of wages on the slow days a simple solution would be to adjust employee hours to a certain extent i suspect this is done if you look at the situation from the standpoint of the employee being sent home early or being told not to work tomorrow or perhaps for the next week because the theater has a bunch of bombs is not a good situation a job in popcorn sales is probably not a high paying job so the employees may just quit and they may do this not by giving notice but rather by not showing up for a scheduled shift the result of this is that managers determine the maximum number of employees they can hire if there theater has low drawing movies and they set the price of popcorn so that when the theater is filled this number of employees will not be overwhelmed by patron buying popcorn at least not to the extent that the start of the movie has to be delayed

johnfx and provide excellent answers researching prices others have paid being up front that you 'll go buy a junker car to hold you over if they wo n't meet your price and playing a few dealerships off of each other are all great tactics in addition i 've got a few points about timing your purchase if you 're not desperate for a car these can really help give you the upper hand in negotiations wait until the end of the month dealerships and individual salespeople usually have quotas that they 're trying to clear and the month is usually the standard cutoff the last time i bought a car the salesman made the mistake of mentioning i do n't usually work but i 'll be in this thursday thursday was the 31st i inferred from this information that he had n't made his quota for the month yet so i came back on the 31st to negotiate and managed to hammer out a pretty good deal wait until about an hour before the dealership closes to show up and shop this gives you enough time to not be obvious about the tactic but you 'll definitely be holding them past their normal quitting time if you do much negotiating the salesman will be   a little more inclined to make a deal so he can get home and have dinner bonus points if you can wait until a month that ends on a friday

whenever i 'm looking at whether i can afford a new fixed monthly cost i go over my account statement for the last three months or last three normal months in the event that there has been something unusual recently and list the items into four columns on an excel sheet   fixed essentials costs that happen every month and that have to happen stuff like rent utility bills insurance any loans or credit cards etc fixed niceties costs that happen every month but that i could cut if i needed to stuff like netflix spotify etc variable essentials costs that i incur on an basis but are essential i 'm talking things like food fuel etc variable niceties costs that i incur on an basis but could be cut if required things like buying dvds or games etc i sum up the essentials columns and divide by three to get a rough monthly average this is what i have to spend so i subtract this from my monthly income which tells me what i really have available to spend in any given month performing the same sum and divide by three operation on the niceties and subtracting that from my available to spend figure tells me what i have left on in an average month if this is greater than the new monthly cost i 'm considering allowing for some reasonable buffer as well you do n't want to be running to zero each month then i can afford the new cost and then i just have to weigh up whether i think it 's worth it or whether i 'd rather use that for something else if it 's not sufficient and i really want need whatever the new cost is then i can start looking at the fixed and variable niceties to see if i can make savings there if after trimming the niceties where i can i still ca n't afford it but still really want need it then i 'll start looking at the essentials to see if there are ways to reduce them through switching utility supplier or changing my shopping eating habits etc

on transactions the $ 100 limit applies per transaction and your daily withdrawal limit does n't usually apply it 's only for transactions and atm withdrawals and transactions are counted as credit transactions so really anything in your account is up for grabs there are a couple of options as i see it you should see if there 's a option to get an old style card with no visa mastercard scheme link you might need to push for it but you can probably do it failing that you could see if you can open a linked savings account with no card access and put most of your money in there and transfer what you need into your transaction account something that may also be of interest visa 's zero liability policy

not illegal with respect to littleadv response the printing of a check is n't illegal i can order checks from cheap check printers and they have no relationship to any bank so long as they have my routing number and checking account number they print   years ago 25 + i wrote my account details on a shirt in protest to owing the irs money and my bank cashed it they charged a penalty of some nominal amount $ 20 or so for non standard check format or something like that but in fact stupid young person rants aside you may write a check out by hand on a piece of paper and it should clear the missing factor is the magnetic ink but i often see a regular check with a strip to the bottom when the mag strip fails proving that bad ink will not prevent a check from clearing   so long as the person trying to send you the funds is n't going to dispute the transaction and the check is made out to you so i suppose they could n't even do that this process should be simple i see little to no risk so long as the image is n't intercepted along the way

how to use your shares if you own common shares in a company as opposed to a fund then you have the right but not the obligation to one vote per share on questions put before the shareholders usually this occurs once a year usually these questions regard approval of auditors sometimes they involve officers such as directors on the board you will be mailed a form to fill out and mail back in   preferred shares usually are not voting shares but common shares always are   by the way i do not recommend owning shares in companies i recommend funds instead either etfs or mutual funds owning shares in companies puts you at risk of a failure of that company owning funds spreads that risk around thus reducing your exposure   there are really two purposes for owning shares 1 owning shares gives you the right to declared dividends 2 owning shares allows you to sell those shares at some time in the future hopefully at a profit   one obscure thing you can do with owned shares is to write sell covered put options but options are not something that you need to concern yourself with at this point   you may find it useful to sign up for a free daily email from

nope anything is that has the required information is fine   at a minimum you need to have the routing number account number amount pay to line and a signature the only laws are that it ca n't be written on anything illegal like human skin and it has to be portable not carved on the side of a building for example that said the micr line and standard sizes will make things for they bank but are hardly required   you could write your check on notebook paper so long as it had the right information and the bank would have to cash it keep in mind that a check is an order to the bank to give your money to a person and nothing more you could   write it out in sentence form give bill $ 2 from account routing number signed and it would be valid in practice though it would be a fight mostly the bank would try to urge you to use a standard check or could hold the funds because it looks odd till they received the ok from the other bank but if you rant to fight that fight

the actual price is represented on charts and not the change in price as a percentage because it is the actual price which is used in all other parts of analysis both technical and fundamental and it is the actual figure the security is bought and sold at a change in price has to be relative to a previous price at a previous time and we can easily work out the change in price over any given time period i think what you are concerned about is how to compare a certain actual price change in low priced securities to the same actual price change in a higher priced securities   for example $ 1.00 rise in a $ 2.00 stock representing a 50 increase in price $ 1.00 rise in a $ 10.00 stock representing a 10 increase in price on a standard chart both of these look the same as they both show a $ 1.00 increase in price so what can we do to show the true representation of the percentage increase in price it is actually quite simple you view the chart using a log scale instead of a standard scale most charting packages should have this option what may look like a bubble on a standard scale chart looks like a healthy uptrend on a log scale chart and represents a true picture of the percentage change in price example of standard price scale vs log price scale on a chart standard price scale   on the standard scale the price seems to have very little movement from to and then the price seems to zoom up after to this is because a 4 increase for example of $ 0.50 is only $ 0.02 whilst a 4 increase of $ 7.00 $ 0.28 so the increases seem much bigger at the end of the chart log price scale   on the log chart however these price changes seem to be more evenly displayed no matter at what price level the price change has occurred at this thus give a better representation of how fast or slow the price is rising or falling or the size of the change in price
# 214710
i 'll answer your question but first a comment about your intended strategy   buying government bonds in a retirement account is probably not a good idea   government bonds generally are tax advantaged themselves so they offer a lower interest rate than other types of bonds   at no tax or reduced tax many people will accept the lower interest rate because their effective return may be similar or better depending for example on their own marginal tax rate   in a tax advantaged retirement account however you 'll be getting the lower interest without any additional benefit because that account itself is already tax advantaged buying bonds generally may be a good idea or not i wo n't comment on that but choose a different category of bonds for the general question about the relationship between the fed rate and the bond rate they are positively correlated   there 's not direct causal relationship in the sense that the fed is not setting the bond rate directly but other interest bearing investment options are tied to the fed rate and many of those interest bearing options compete for the same investor dollars as the bonds that you 're reviewing   that 's at a whole market level   individual bonds however may not be so tightly coupled since the creditworthiness of the issuing entity matters a lot too so it could be that bond rates generally are going up but some specific bonds are going down based on something happening with the issuer just like the stock market might be generally going up even as specific stocks are dropping also keep in mind that many bonds trade as securities on a secondary market much like stocks   so i 've talked about the bond rate   the price of the bonds themselves on the secondary market generally move opposite to the rate   the reason is that for example if you buy a bond at less than face value you 're getting an effective interest rate that 's higher because you get the same sized incremental payments of interest but put less money into the investment   and vice versa

as others have stated ceo 's often make more than 200 k and when they do they 're compensated with stock options and other lucrative bonuses and deals that allow them to build wealth above and beyond the face value of their salary however remember that having wealth makes it easier to build further wealth as victor pointed out having wealth allows you to increase your wealth in different kinds of investments also it gives you access to more human capital e.g. wealth management services at firms like northern trust a greater ability to diversify into investments like hedge funds more abilities to invest abroad through foreign trusts etc also you have to realize that wealthier people often pay a lower percentage in taxes than people who earn a salary in the us long term capital gains are taxed at a much lower rate than income so wealthy individuals who earn much of their money from long term investments wo n't pay nearly as high a rate in my case my current salary places me at the top of the 25 tax bracket in the us but if i earned all of my income through long term capital gains instead of salary i would only pay around 15 20 in taxes plus i could afford numerous tax accounting firms to help me find ways to pay fewer taxes it 's not altruism that causes ceos like steve jobs and mark zuckerberg to take a $ 1 salary   this is n't directly related to ceos and i 'm not leveling accusations of corruption against high net worth individuals but i remember spending a few months in a small town in a country known for its corruption the mayor had recently purchased a home worth the equivalent of several million dollars on his annual civil servant salary of approximately $ 20k. one of the students asked him how he managed to afford such a sizable property and he replied i live very frugally this is probably a relatively rare case i 'm sure it depends on the country but nevertheless it illustrates another way that some people build wealth

when you buy a stock you become a partial owner of the company that the stock is for as the company is valued at a higher or lower amount the stock will reflect that by gaining or losing value you still own that stock for example if you bought a stock for $ 10 per share and next week it is worth $ 8 dollars per share the only loss incurred is on paper you do not have to pay the difference which i think is what you are asking and will only physically lose that money if you sell at that point similarly if that stock becomes worth $ 12 you have only gained money on paper and can only physically see it if you sell at that point

when you initiate a chargeback the merchant has the right to dispute the chargeback   if they can provide proof that the purchase actually took place the chargeback will fail we do n't know all the details of your situation of course but it appears from what you have said that the tax chain probably has documents that you signed agreeing to the charges   they prepared your return even if they did a poor job and so from their perspective they have decided that they deserve to be paid   whether or not they did a good job is a matter of opinion of course their position might be that they did it correctly and the second business did it poorly    the chargeback is a powerful tool but it is not a magic button that makes a charge disappear   if the merchant can show that a sale did indeed take place and show that the proper amount was charged the chargeback will fail   for a service it is n't enough usually to simply state that you were unsatisfied if you received the service at the agreed upon price the charge is valid a chargeback is sort of a nuclear option when it comes to getting a refund   there are negative ramifications and expenses every time a merchant gets a chargeback even if they ultimately win and so often they will be willing to work something out to avoid a chargeback   you should go to the merchant first if you can and ask for a refund before considering the chargeback option   if you file a chargeback without even giving them the opportunity to work it out with you the merchant will usually want to fight back

cat has always had plants in il hq is in grew up there several members of my family work for them and plants all over the place canada probably had other things going against it at the time they pulled out depending on the timing it 's quite likely that the exchange rate had shifted such that even without a raise the workers were effectively costing the company considerably more   articles like that seem to leave out all sorts of details for instance i only saw one point where salary was increased and it was n't anywhere near a 60 increase more like 15 which is n't entirely unheard of there 's also what looks like a one time cash payment bonus for a good year 3 4x salary is n't unheard of in executive bonus land it 's also highly variable and not guaranteed year to year the rest would be in stocks and options the trick there is that the amounts of those were probably determined when he signed his contract the reason it makes for a big raise is because the stock price has gone up though it 's down nearly 20 over the last month may kinda sucked for the stock market   you also need to look at whether the profits are higher because of higher volume and possibly more workers better margins better deployment of capital etc and when there 's talk about asking worker to pay more for their health care is it more as a raw dollar amount or more as a percentage of the health care costs as to defined benefit pensions personally i 'd rather have a 401k the problem with defined benefit pensions is that you 're tied to that company for life put in your 40 years and then retire with 80 pay or whatever it is leave after 4 or 5 and you 've pretty much got nothing with a 401k leave after 4 or 5 and you have what you 've put away + what the company matched

stock splits are typically done to increase the liquidity of stock merely by converting every stock of the company into multiple stocks of lower face value for example if the initial face value of the stock was $ 10 and the stock got split 10:1 the new face value of the stock would be $ 1 each this has a proportional effect on the market value of the stock also if the stock was trading at $ 50 after the split the stock should ideally adjust to $ 5 this is to ensure that despite the stock split the market capitalization of the company should remain the same number of shares stock price = market capitalization = constant

i am perfectly qualified to not use an accountant   i am a business professor and my work crosses over into accounting quite a bit   i would certainly find a cpa that is reputable and hire them for advice before starting   i know a physicist who did n't do that and found they ended up with $ in fines   there are a number of specific things an accountant might provide that quickbooks will not   first and foremost they are an outsider 's set of eyes   if they are good they will find a polite way to say you want to do what   if they are good they wo n't fall out of their chair their jaw wo n't drop to the floor and they wo n't until they get home a good accountant has seen around a hundred successful and unsuccessful businesses   they have seen everything you may have thought of   intelligence is learning from your own mistakes wisdom is learning from the mistakes of others   accountants are the of wisdom an accountant can point out weaknesses in your plan and help you shore it up   they can provide information about the local market that you may not be aware of   they can assist you with understanding the long run consequences of the legal form that you choose   they can assist you in understanding the trade offs of different funding models   they can also do tasks that you are not talented at and which will take a lot of time if you do it and little time if they do it there is a reason that accountants are required to have 160 semester hours to sit for the cpa   they also have to have a few thousand field hours before they can sit for it as well there is one thing you may want to keep in mind though   an accountant will often do what you ask them to do so think about what you want before you visit the accountant   also remember to ask the question is there a question i should have asked but did n't

there are definitely ways to retroactively consolidate medical bills there 's an entire industry of companies offering debt consolidation many of which are scummy predatory be careful see and some decent articles at and in general what you are looking to do is take out a loan possibly at a better interest rate than whatever you are being charged currently and pay off the medical bills if you are not paying interest on the medical bills and are just being allowed to spread out the payments you are already golden and should just put up with the ups and downs if you have any equity in a home take out a home equity loan or line of credit pay off your medical bills rates are still great right now even if you have no home equity to tap if you have a steady job you might be able to get a nice small loan from a local bank or peer to peer lending site do your homework and only work with reputable companies especially if doing things online

holy shit man you must have some deep seated issues to get this bent out of shape about the way people choose to buy their mattress   fyi most of the major online mattress companies offer something like a 100 day no questions asked return policy which is a hell of a lot longer than the minute or so people usually spend on the in store models let me name you a few reasons why this know nothing millennial purchases their mattress online   you do n’t have to deal with annoying sales people you can actually read the good and bad customer reviews about the product you are about to spend 1/3 if your life on you do n’t have to deal with annoying uninformed money grabbing sales people consumer reports has a review for the exact model you intend to buy online versus whatever 12 in store mattress are the flavor of the month   you can get a very comfortable mattress for 2/3 or 1/2 the price of an in store mattress did i mention that you do n’t have to deal with cost inflating so they get a bigger bonus sales people

from my knowledge credit card balance can not be transfered like that on the other hand debit card balance can all banks have an online portal where you can log in and see all of your accounts another options is to call or go to the bank and go through the same process to transfer to banks in other countries you need both their account details person 's name account number and the bank 's international identifiers exact name swift number if you have that information you can simply transfer the money and then your parents or you can use it to pay the debt another option would be to assign yourself as the debt payer if the bank allows it and other options would be simple money lending services like for example western union also be sure that your bank will know all the possible ways you could proceed hope this helps robert

it seems like there are   a few different things going on here because there are multiple parties involved with different interests the car loan almost surely has the car itself as collateral so if you stop paying the bank can claim the car to cover their costs   since your car is now totaled however that collateral is essentially gone and your loan is probably effectively dead already   the bank is n't going let you keep the money against a totaled car   i suspect this is what the meant when he said you can not keep the car because of the loan the insurance company sounds like they 're going to pay the claim but once they pay on a totaled car they own it   they have some plan for how they recover partial costs from the wreck   that may or may not allow you or anyone else to buy it from them   for example they might have some bulk sale deal with a salvage company that does n't allow them to sell back to you they may have liability issues with selling a wrecked car etc   whatever is going on here should be separate from your loan and related to the business model of your insurance company   if you do have an option to buy the car back it will almost surely be viewed as a new purchase by the insurances company and your lender as if you bought a different car in similar condition

a tip i tend to put in here that does n't directly relate to student loan payments but does matter do n't focus so much on student loan payments that you find yourself needing to tap short term credit sources to make ends meet making a $ 100 payment on a 6 interest student loan and then needing to charge a $ 100 car repair on your 19 interest credit card is not a sound financial move

it very much depends on whether you want to drive around in an expensive car or whether you want an expensive car parked on your driveway and whether you want to buy a new car or a used one and whether you know a reliable garage that does n't rip you off or not   for example if my wife who drives maybe 5,000 miles a year wanted a 5 series bmw we could buy a five year old one with 120,000 miles for about £ 120 per month purchase price if it lasts 6 years 11 year old and 150,000 miles should be no problem for that kind of car so that 's quite affordable for me driving 25,000 miles a year the numbers are quite different   fact is if you drive around in my wider neighbourhood you will sometimes see very expensive cars parked in front of very rundown houses some people find it more important to drive around in an expensive car than to live in a nice place that 's priorities many people can afford expensive cars if they their priorities and i 'm not saying it 's a good thing   ps if you want to be seen in an expensive car for example you take your wife out you can always rent a car for a day or two

generally if you have a loan you have a credit score but since you have never had a loan before then it is likely that you do not have a credit score you should not be worried if you are n't planning on applying for credit and/or loans if you are wanting to purchase a house car or even just having a credit card you should work on obtaining a secure loan so then you can establish history   most of the time you have to pay to view your credit score by law you can obtain a free copy of your credit report which it sounds like you have at annualcreditreport.com which only shows your payment history but in order to view your credit score you generally have to pay for it

you should really talk to a lawyer about criminal concerns there may be some does usa credit score transfer to other countries the usa does n't do anything with credit scores in the usa credit records are maintained by private companies who provide the information to your creditor there 's no legal limitation for the creditors to be within usa only that you allow access so bottom line technically it is possible for foreign creditors to get that information if you do n't have local credit score it is likely that they will will someone come after me depends on the loan managers civil suite is possible since you can not discharge student loans in bankruptcy how likely is it probably not very likely could i be only if a criminal complaint is filed and the country you 're at has an agreement with the us would i be arrested if i ever came back to visit a family member i 'm not sure on this i believe it is possible for a lender to have your passport taken by a court but i do n't think you can be actually arrested unless there 's a criminal charge but as i said i believe your passport may be taken away from you when you come to the us to prevent you fleeing without paying the debt would someone go after my family to collect the debts can they do that unless they co signed or they have control over your assets unlikely could the usa somehow garnish my pay in another country yes if a court decides so that would have to be a court in that country though in addition the us can freeze your assets abroad if you keep them in a fatca compliant institution which is almost any bank nowadays also when you die the us may and probably will demand a portion of your estate to pay the debt talk to a lawyer about additional issues and concerns

etfs are a type of investment not a specific choice in other words there are good etfs and bad what you see is the general statement that etfs are preferable to most mutual funds if only for the fact that they are low cost an index etf such as spy which reflects the s&p 500 index has a annual expense vs a mutual fund which average a full percent or more   is n't wrong i just have a different spin to offer you given a long term return of say even 8 note this question is not a debate of the long term return and i purposely chose a low number compared to the long term average closer to 10 and the current cd rate of < 1 a 1 hit for the commission on the buy side does n't bother me the sell wo n't occur for a long time and $ 8 on a $ 10 k sale is no big deal i 'd not expect you to save $ 1k yr in cash cds for the years it would take to make that $ 8 fee look tiny not when over time the growth will this   one day you will be in a position where the swings in the market will produce the random increase or decrease to your net worth in the $ 10s of thousands do you know why you wo n't lose a night 's sleep over this because when you invested your first $ 1 k and started to pay attention to the market you saw how some days had swings of 3 or 4 and you built up an immunity to the day to day noise you stayed invested and as you gained wealth you stuck to the right rebalancing each year so a market crash which took others down by 30 only impacted you by 15 20 and you were ready for the next move to the upside and you also saw that since mutual funds with their 1 fees never beat the index over time you were happy to say you lagged the s&p by or 1 over 11 year 's time vs those whose funds had some great years but lost it all in the bad years   and by the way right until you are in the 25 bracket roth is the way to go when you are at 25 that 's the time to use pre tax accounts to get just below the   last welcome to se     edit see 's answer below i agree i missed the cost of the bid ask spread going with the lowest cost index funds may make better sense for you   to clarify points out that etfs trade like a stock a commission and a bid ask both add to transaction cost so agreeing this is the case an indexed based mutual fund can provide the best of possible options reflecting the s&p for example less a small expense .1 or less

you also need to remember that stock options usually become valueless if not exercised while an employee of the company   so if there is any chance that you will leave the company before an ipo the effective value of the stock options is zero   that is the safest and least risky valuation of the stock options    with a google or facebook stock options can be exercised and immediately sold as they are publicly traded   in fact they may give stock grants where you sell part of the grant to pay tax withholding   you can then sell the remainder of the grant for money at any time even after you leave the company   you only need the option grant to vest to take advantage of it   valuing these at face value current stock price makes sense   that 's at least a reasonable guess of future value    if you are absolutely sure that you will stay with the company until the ipo then valuing the stock based on earnings can make sense   a ten million dollar profit can justify a hundred million dollar ipo market capitalization easily   divide that by the number of shares outstanding and multiply by how many you get   if anything that gives you a conservative estimate    i would still favor the big company offers though   as i said they are immediately tradeable while this offer is effectively contingent on the ipo   if you leave before then you get nothing   if they delay the ipo you 're stuck   you ca n't leave the company until then without sacrificing that portion of your compensation   that seems a big commitment to make

i would not recommend borrowing your 401(k money to buy a house for two reasons when you borrow money from your 401(k it is no longer invested yes you pay yourself interest but you miss out on the investment gains for the life of the loan   if you leave your job the loan is due in full shortly thereafter if you do not pay it back you are hit with taxes and penalties   if i were you i would roll it over into an ira for the reasons you mentioned

note that many credit unions participate in a branch exchange program which lets you access you cu 's accounts and services thru the offices of the others my cu is two states away   but there has been only one case where i felt a need to drive back there find out if your has joined this network and encourage them to do so if they have n't yet it makes credit unions fully competitive with interstate banks   the shared branch cu locations may not be convenient but more keep joining and the most common transactions can be done by mail or atm anyway the biggest advantages of a local cu or bank are that they know the local rules for mortgages and they may have safe deposit boxes for rent   that and having a place to unload the pocket change that piles up are why i 've got an account with a small local bank a few blocks from my house as well though i keep thinking about joining my alma mater 's credit union and will if the ever get on the shared branch system

to play devil ’s advocate to much of what has been written before it 's also worth noting that this is quite an important quote for a sort of reverse reason to what has been discussed before us that of that fact that virtually every economic situation is different as it 's such a problem each and every set of exact circumstances is always different from before technology radically changes monetary policy and economic thinking shift social needs and market expectations change and thus change the very fabric of markets as they do it 's only in its most basic miss projections of growth that economics repeats and much like warfare has constant shifts that radically change the core assumptions about it and do create completely new circumstances that we have to struggle to deal with predicting people betting on the endless large scale warfare between western powers continuing post nuclear weapons would have been very very wrong for example that time it actually was different and this actually happens with surprisingly often in finance in ways people quickly bury in the memories and adopt to the new norm remember when public ownership of stock was n't a thing when bonds did n't exist no mortgages pre insurance these are all inventions and changes that did change the world forever and were genuinely different and have been ever since creating huge structural changes in economies growth rates and societies interactions   as the endless aim of the game is predicting growth well we often see people groups over extend on one new thing and/or under extend on another as they struggle to model these shifts and step changes   talking as if the fact that people do this consistently as if it is some kind of obvious thing we can easily learn from or easily take advantage of in the context of such a vague and complex problem could be argued to be highly naïve and largely useless this time it is different last time it was too

the investments offered in 401 k are usually limited to a selection of mutual funds offered by a 401 k provider   the 401 k providers and the mutual funds charge fees   the mutual fund industry has a lobbying group that will push for increased 401 k contributions to direct money into their mutual funds to collect fees   the top 401 k provider in 2005 was fidelity   it managed $ billion in 401ks of which $ 334 billion was directed into mutual funds although i would have to use some of the same providers to open an ira i would not have to invest in the providers mutual funds when i open an ira   i can buy a stock and hold onto it for 10 20 50 years inside of my ira   thus the only fee the investment company would collect from me would be from when i purchased the stock and when i sold the stock   not nearly as profitable as mutual fund fees

when dividend is announced the stock and option price may react to that news but the actual payout of the dividend on the ex dividend date is what you probably are referring to the dividend payout affects the stock price on the ex dividend date as the stock price will drop by the amount of paid out dividend not taking into account other factors this in turn drives the prices of all options   the amount of change in the option price for this event is not only dependent the dividend payout but also on how far these are in our out of the money and what there time to expiration is the price of a call option that is far out of the money would react less than the price of a put that would be far in the money therefore i would argue that these two will not necessarily offset each other

in my experience in the us the main draw of check cashing businesses like is that they will hold your check for a certain period of time   this is also known as a payday loan   rather than bringing them a check someone else has written you you write them a check yourself and they pay you the amount on the check less their fees and agree not to cash the check until a future date   so if you do n't have the money right now but you need it before your next payday you visit a check cashing business and get the money and it 'll be withdrawn from your account after your next paycheck

one way to analyze the opportunity cost of using a 401 k loan would be to calculate your net worth after using a 401 k loan   if your net worth increases then the 401 k loan would be advisable   note that the calculations provided below do not take into account tax considerations a net worth calculation is where you add all your assets and then subtract all your liabilities   the resulting number is your net worth first calculate the net worth of not taking the loan and simply paying the credit card interest   this means you only pay the interest on the credit card   in addition to the parameters identified in your question two additional parameters will need to be considered cash and the market rate of return on the 401k. scenario 1 only pay credit card interest after 12 months all you have paid is the interest on the credit card   the 401 k balance is untouched so it will hopefully grow   the balance on the credit card remains at the end of 12 months scenario 2 use 401 k loan to pay credit card balance you borrow $ 5,000 from your 401 k to pay the credit card balance   you will have to pay $ 5,000 plus the 401 k interest rate back into your 401 k account use the following equation to determine when scenario 2 increases your net worth more than scenario 1 thus if your credit card interest rate is greater than the rate you can earn on your 401 k then use the 401 k loan to pay off the credit card balance another scenario that should be considered borrow money from somewhere else to pay off the credit card balance scenario 3 external loan to pay credit card balance you borrow $ 5,000 from somewhere besides your 401 k to pay off the credit card balance the following is used to determine if you should use an external loan over the 401 k loan this means you should use an external loan if you can obtain an interest rate less than the rate of return you can earn on your 401k.   the same methodology can be used to compare scenario 3 to scenario 1

in a similar situation i wrote about how i made $ 4,000 + on a cash back credit card offer the total was actually $ and was from an insane offer from a new credit card my bank advertised 10 cash back on all spending during the first 90 days i wondered if gift card purchases counted and more than store cards i saw that visa gift cards with a $ 500 value sold for a $ 4.95 fee a 1 hit   it would have been foolish to load up and realize that they were somehow excluded so i bought 2 and followed the transaction on line when i saw the 10 credit i went full steam and bought these $ 2000 at a time as that was the limit cvs imposed in the end i stopped at $ 50,000 and the bank killed the online offer about $ 25 k into this but still honored my 90 days yes i had to make payments mid cycle to avoid the card limit $ 20 k but in the end the bit of effort paid off it took a bit over a year and a half to burn through them in hindsight i 'd do it for $ 100 k if the opportunity came up cash in the bank is earning near zero     tl dr make a small purchase and confirm your card gives you the bonus you expect

gt;no system is going to be perfect especially one that is totally inflexible   certainly but you come right back to the need for good wise management   and part of that is constructing a system that does n't have obvious and blatant loopholes   it is a lot easier to say no to someone when you can back it up by saying i think this is going to take 2,000 hours and the ceo has only granted you 1,000 hours figure out what you can live without and get back to me   and you have just given an example of a very bad unwise management system and likely entirely arbitrary budgets does the ceo know his arse from a hole in the ground   why was 1,000 hour budgeted how many departments are going to be allocated 1,000 hours and yet have little or no use for them but of course as will all budgeting systems those hours are probably use it or lose it so the department head of dept a will be deprived because of the arbitrary past weighted allocations and the head of dept b will end up wasting 1,000 hours on crap just to make sure he gets 1,000 hours again next year   bad management tends to build management systems that are even worse than their original management   and if you lived under your budgeted hours system for a couple of years you 'd be back here bitching about how stupid that system is

you appear to be thinking of option writers as if they were individuals with small holdings and a particular view on what the underlying is going to do   this is not the best way to think about them option writers are typically large institutions with large portfolios and that provide services in all sorts of different areas at the same time as they are writing calls on a particular stock they are writing puts on it and options on other stocks   they are buying and selling the underlying and all kinds of different derivatives   they are not necessarily writing the option because they are expecting or hoping to benefit from a price move   it 's just small part of their business   they write the option if the option price is good enough that they think they are selling it for very slightly more than it 's worth    asking why an option writer creates a call is like asking why a grocery store keeps buying groceries from their distributors   do n't they know the price of food may not always rise   sure but their business is selling the food for slightly more than they pay for it not speculating on what will happen to its price   most option writers are doing the same thing except what they are buying and selling is sets of cash flows and risk    as a general rule the business model of option writers is to profit from the few cents of spread or mispricing not from aggregate changes in the price of the underlying   they should and often do maintain balanced portfolios so their option writing activities do n't expose them to a lot of risk also note that there could be lots of reasons for writing options even if you do have a particular view   for example perhaps the option writer thinks volatility of the underlying will decrease   writing a call could be part of an overall strategy that profits from this view

what said i think of each strategy in terms of capital at risk car it 's a good thing to know when considering any position and then conveniently the return is always profit with covered calls it 's pretty easy pay $ 1000 for stock receive $ 80 in premium net car is $   if you own the stock and write calls many times that expire worthless or you that you buy back there are two measurements to consider first treat every covered call as a buy write even if you already own the stock disregard the real cost basis and calculate from the moment you write the call using the stock price at that time the second measure is more complicated but involves using something like the xirr function in a spreadsheet this tracks the series as a whole even accounting for times where there is no written call outstanding for the written put even though your broker may only require 30 collateral in a margin account mentally treat them as cash secured strike less premium is your true if the stock goes to zero by expiration that 's what you 're on the hook for you could just compute based on the 30 collateral required but in my view that confuses cash collateral needs with true risk note a written put is exactly identical to a covered call at the same strike if you tend to favor puts over ccs ask yourself why just like a loaded gun leverage is n't inherently bad but you sure want to know when you 're using it

as stated tracking fractional transactions beyond 8 decimal places makes no sense in the context of standard stock and mutual fund transactions   this is because even for the most expensive equities those fractional shares would still not be worth whole cent amounts even for account balances in the hundreds of thousands of dollars one important thing to remember is that when dealing with equities the total cost number of shares and share price are all 3 components of the same value   thus if you take 2 of those values you can always calculate the third price shares = cost cost price = shares etc   what you 're seeing in your account 9 decimal places is probably the result of dividing uneven values such as $ invested in a commodity which trades for $ results in shares   most brokerages will round this value off somewhere yours just happens to include more decimal places than your financial software allows since your brokerage is the one who has the definitive total for your account balance the only real solution is to round up or down whichever keeps your total balance in the software in line with the balance shown online
