are you planning to not pay taxes any time someone has income in the u.s. it is subject to u.s. taxes you must file tax returns and pay taxes if necessary if you have income above a certain threshold regardless of whether you 're not authorized to work or not if you plan to intentionally not pay taxes then that 's a whole other matter from working without authorization working without authorization is an immigration issue it probably violates the conditions of your status which will make you to automatically lose your status that may or may not affect when you want to want to visit to or get other immigration benefits in the u.s. in the future and at worst you may be deported it 's a complicated topic but not really relevant for this site

this article has a section titled do you need an umbrella policy to cover your personal liability risks that says if you have young children for example you might need a policy    because they have lots of friends these little might get into    some and hurt themselves at your home if so you ’re at risk    of being sued do you have people over often do you drive like a or a    do you have firearms on your premises do you have gardeners    and on the grounds all these are reasons why you might    want to own an umbrella policy although many people in the us are homeowners parents drivers etc not everyone falls into these categories for some people as low as the premiums for such a policy might be   the expected cost outweighs the expected benefit the cost of a lawsuit may be extremely high but someone may feel that the chance of a lawsuit being filed against them is low enough to be safely ignored and not worth insuring against i 'm probably not a great example but i 'll use my own situation anyway even though a liability policy probably would n't cost me too much i 'm almost certain that i would n't derive any benefit from it i live alone without children or firearms pet tigers gardeners etc in a 520 sq ft apartment so the probability that something bad would happen to someone on the small bit of property that i rent and that they would file a sizable lawsuit against me is small enough that i choose to ignore it

the strategy is right as pointed out by you will the volatility cause the premium on the price of the options to be too high to make this worthwhile this is subjective and depends on how the markets feels about the volatility and the trend ie if the market believes that the stock will go up the option at 45 would cost quite a bit less however if the market believes the stock would go down the option at 45 would be quite high and may not even be available    there is no generic right or wrong the strategy is right with out without putting dividend into equation it depends what options are available at what prices

especially considering it has a mortgage on it technically a home    equity loan on my primary residence i 'm not following does it have a mortgage on it or your primary residence a different property was used as a security for the loan if it is heloc from a different property then it is really your business what to do with it you can spend it all on casinos in vegas for all that the bank cares is this a complicated transaction any gotchas i should be aware of    before on it obviously you should talk to an attorney and a tax adviser but here 's my two cents do n't fall for the incorporate in nevada delaware wyoming some other lie trap you must register in the state where you live and in the state where the property is incorporating in any other state will just add complexity and costs and will not save you anything whatsoever 2.1 state taxes some states tax llcs for example in california you 'll pay at least $ 800 a year just for the right of doing business if you live in california or the property is in california you will pay this if you decide to set up an llc 2.2 income taxes make sure to not elect to tax your llc as a corporation the default for llc is disregarded status and it will be taxed for income tax purposes as your person i.e. irs does n't care and does n't know about it and most states as well if you actively select to tax it as a corporation there 's such an option it will cost you very dearly so do n't and if someone suggest such a thing to you run away from that person as fast as you can mortgages it is very hard to get a mortgage when the property is under the llc if you already have a mortgage on that property the property is the one securing the loan it may get called once you transfer it into llc since from bank 's perspective that would be transferring ownership local taxes transferring into llc may trigger a new tax assessment if you just bought the property that will probably not matter much if it appreciated you may get hit with higher property taxes there are also many little things once you 're a llc and not individual you 'll have to open a business bank account will probably need a new insurance policy etc etc these do n't add much to costs and are more of an occasional nuisance

most basic tip   do n't go to the grocery store hungry what we do to minimize food waste on sunday when my wife and i go grocery shopping we figure out what meals we are going to have for dinner that week and we only buy what we need for those meals we also try to decide in advance what we are going out for dinner for example we know we have to take the in laws out for dinner on wednesday so we do n't buy a dinner for that night as part of our weekly planning we figure out the lunches we will take to work based on our dinners   for example if we plan to make a big pot of pasta for dinner one night we know we 'll have leftovers for lunch so we wo n't buy a lunch for the following day basically we try to match our food purchasing to our food consumption during the week we generally try to cook the dinner that uses the most perishable items first   if we buy seafood that will be monday night 's dinner   the frozen pizza can wait until the end of the week my wife an i both have to deal with the occasional unexpected late night at work which can mess up our cooking plans   as a result it is not uncommon for us to be too tired to cook so we skip a dinner   it is less wasteful to do that with something frozen preserved also we try to consider cooking time vs our work schedule   we do n't pick a complex dinner for a night that we know in advance will be a long work day

yeah i was a libertarian until they said they want to end the federal reserve i 'm more of a conservative    your point that a minimum wage at a major metropolitan area is often not a livable wage is irrelevant wages are a   fee given to employees for their work the way an employee earns a high wage is by providing value that is greater than that wage if the value an employee brings to an employer is less than the wage he 's paid an employer will lay off that individual because the employee costs the employer money therefore setting a minimum wage simply means you ban certain individuals usually first time workers or otherwise unskilled from the workforce because they currently do not have the skills and/or experience to justify that wage furthermore the higher you set the minimum wage the more people you deprive of jobs

the strategy has intrinsic value which may or may not be in practice by details mentioned in other answers tax and other overheads regulation risk john bensin says that as a general principle if a simple technical analysis is good then someone will have implemented it before you that 's fair but we can do better than an existence proof for this particular case we can point to who is doing approximately this market makers are already doing this with different numbers they quote a buy price and a sell price on the same stock so they are already buying low and selling high with a small margin if your strategy works in practice that means you can make low risk money from short term volatility that they 're missing out on by setting your margin at approximately the daily price variation instead of the current bid offer spread but market makers choose their own bid offer spread and they choose it because they think it 's the best margin to make low risk money in the long run so you 'd be relying that

how does this get any business you 'd be surprised on how much profit these type of businesses can bring in and the number of people who cash their checks this way they make profit off people who want their checks cashed asap usually cheques written to cash or something can just be cashed for    free at the bank right yes most banks cash your check for free some may not cash it right away and may require a few days to process some charge a small fee if the check is not from the same bank some personal checks may not even be processed the same day as well would n't the only cheques that people would cash at these places be    bad cheques yes and no yes because it may be easier to try to cash a fraudulent check at these type of check cashing places however some places may only cash business checks and require your id in which they write down the information in order to possibly track you down in the future also some places only cash a check to a certain amount   and would n't this mean that the business will lose a lot of money    since it pays out cash but then has the cheque bounce   of course the business loses money if the check bounces or is fake that is why they try to minimize their losses with certain requirements that needs to met before the check can be cashed who uses these services exactly just about anyone who needs their check cashed asap or like stated in his answer is trying to keep their money on the low there is a demand for this service even though it may seem shady to you

you need to find out exactly   how the two accounts are titled if an account   is an ugma uniform gifts to minors act account that is in your name with your mother father as custodian then you are entitled to all the money in the account when you become an adult if the account is indeed a ugma account   the bank is supposed to not let the custodian operate the account once the   child becomes an adult but this does not always happen   there was a   question earlier on money se which i can not find at this time in which   the 25-year old person asking the question claimed that   his father was still buying and selling shares in his ugma brokerage   account and the irs was asking why the profits and losses from these transactions were not being reported on the 25-year old 's tax return money in an ugma account is not supposed to be used for payment of household expenses food etc which is the parent 's responsibility during the minority but this can well be abused as to whether money was taken out and then restored or possibly not restored as you seem to suspect it is possible to sue the custodian for improper handling of the ugma account and recover the funds but whether one wants to sue a parent over what might be a relatively small sum is another matter consider whether most of what is recovered might go to pay legal fees or other costs of the recovery process and will likely ruin a family relationship if the accounts are titled as joint accounts then either party can empty the account without informing the other but doing so would need information about the account number etc which you may not have for tax purposes there is also the issue of whose social security   number is listed on the account yours or your parent 's see also this answer   for a view of what happens from the other side

having gone though this type of event a few times it wo n't be a problem on a specific date they will freeze your accounts then they will transfer the funds from custodian x to custodian y. it should only take a day or two and they will work it around the so that by the time the next paycheck is released everything is established in the new custodian   long before the switch over they will announce the investment options in the new company they will provide descriptions of the options and a default mapping s&p 500 old company to s&p 500 new company international fund old company to international fund new company   if you do nothing then on the they will execute the mapped switches if you want to take this an an opportunity to rebalance you can make the changes to the funds you invest in prior to the switch or after the switch how you contributions are invested will follow the same mapping rules but the percentage of income wo n't change again you can change how you want to invest your contributions or matching funds by altering the contribution forms but if you do n't do anything they will just follow the mapping procedures they have defined   loans terms should n't change   company stock will not be impacted the only hiccup that i would worry about is if the old custodian had a way for you to transfer funds into any fund in their family or to purchase any individual stock the question would be does the new custodian have the same options if you have more questions ask hr or look on the company benefits website all your funds will be moved to the new company and none of these transfers will be a taxable event edit february 2014 based on this question what are the laws or rules on 401(k loans and switching providers i reviewed the documents for the most recent change february 2014 the documents from the employer and the new 401 k company say there are no changes to the loan balances terms and payment amounts although there is a 2 week window when no new loans can be created all employees received notice 60 days prior to the regarding new investments options blackout periods

i think that westerners often overestimate how much influence the west has over developing countries like those in africa and that there are a million other factors that most of the western public simply does n't see    yes agricultural production has increased significantly because of western and eastern demand which calls more children into laboring in those fields because that 's just how it 's always been done in those cotton producing countries of course more business also means more income for those farmers who you can bet your bottom dollar would ask consumers to buy more of their cotton and not less   higher incomes leads to many other positives for the local and national economy families individuals and yes those children that 's not to say that schooling would n't be preferable to child labor but 1 that 's not ultimately our decision and 2 that makes a quite questionable assumption that decent affordable accessible schooling even exists there    so my assessment is that western demand for cotton is a positive for the kids in what 's more i will guarantee you that even with all the failings and unpleasant parts of the world cotton commodity trade cotton farmers would agree

let me run some simplistic numbers ignoring inflation you have the opportunity to borrow up to what matters and varies is your salary case 1 you make 22 k after graduation you pay back 90 a year for 30 years paying off at most 2700 of the loan in this case whether you borrow or 28,000 makes no difference to the paying off you would do best to borrow as much as you possibly can treating it as a grant case 2 you make 100 k after graduation you pay back over 7 k a year if you borrowed the full 51 after 7 or 8 years it would be paid off yeah yeah inflation interest but maybe that might make it 9 years in this case the more you borrow the more you have to pay back but you can easily pay it back so you do n't care invest your and savings into something long term since you know you wo n't be needing to draw on them case 3 you make 30 k after graduation here the payments you have to make actually impact how much disposable income you have you pay back a year and over 30 years that 's about 25 k of principal it will be less if you account for some even most of the payment going to interest not principal anything you borrow above 25 k or the lower more accurate amount is free if you borrow substantially less than that by using your sponsorship savings and summer job you may be able to stop paying sooner than 30 years but even if you borrow only 12 k or half the more accurate number it will still be 15 years of payments running slightly more realistic versions of these calculations where your salary goes up and you take interest into account i think you will discover for each possible salary path a number that represents how much of your loan is really loan everything above that is actually a grant you do not pay back the less you are likely to make the more of it is really grant on top of that it seems to me that no matter the loan grant ratio   borrow as much as you can from this rather bizarre source appears to be the correct answer in the cases where it 's all loan you have a lot of income and do n't care much about this loan payment borrowing the whole 51 k lets you invest all the money you get while you 're a student and you can use the returns on those investments to make the loan payments

you should really be talking to a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state about taxes and to a lawyer about the liability protection you wo n't find answers from neither of theses here besides the liability protection how do these 2 options affect taxes there 's no liability protection difference between the two talk to a lawyer to verify since you 'll be cosigning them personally either way in the first case loan to the llc everything goes on the 1065 and you get the bottom line on k-1 which transfers to you own tax return in the second case the loan interest is your personal investment expense schedule a deduction while the loan proceeds you moved to the llc add to your basis i 'd suggest getting the loan directly in the llc name if you can however the lawyers seem to agree that this would void the mortgage    because of the due on sale clause in mortgage loans due on sale may or may not be but that 's a risk you 'd be taking yes llc is a separate legal entity as opposed to a living trust to which your second quote seems to be referring so it is definitely a possibility for a lender to call on the loan if you re title it

you should know when to sell your shares before you buy them this is most easily done by placing a stop loss conditional order at the same time you place your buy order there are many ways to determine at what level to place your stop losses at the easiest is to place a trailing stop loss at a percentage below the highest close price so as the price reaches new highs the trailing stop will rise if looking for short to medium term gains you might place your trailing stop at 10 below the highest close whilst if you were looking for more longer term gains you should probably place a 20 trailing stop another way to place your stops for short to medium term gains is to keep moving your trailing stop up to just below the last trough in an existing uptrend

a subsidy is a payment made by a group usually the state to individuals or corporations in order to shift the balance if the rational economic decision for the individual would be detrimental to the group as a whole otherwise for example if there are different quality kinds of crops that can be planted for example a gm that brings in high yields but can only be processed to high corn syrup or a naturally bred corn that brings lower yields but tastes well enough for direct consumption then if demand for both exceeds supply the economic choice for the individual farmer is to plant the former if the claims that contribute to obesity are founded then it is in the public interest to produce less of it and more alternative foods given that a market rather than a planned economy is desired this can not be achieved by decree but rather money is used as an incentive in the long term this investment may very well pay off through reduced health care costs so it is a rational economic decision from the state 's point of view in a world where all actors make decisions that are fully in their self interest in principle subsidies would not be needed as consumers would demand healthy rather than cheap foods and market mechanisms would provide these

envelope budgeting is pretty simple it 's easy enough that you can teach it to children and flexible enough you can use it as an adult    the general idea is that you take your cash money no bank accounts involved in the simple version and stick it in envelopes marked for what it 's supposed to be for so for example you get paid you cash your paycheck and you put $ 100 in an envelope marked food   now when you go out to eat you go get the money out of your food envelope and spend it on food   when your food envelope is empty you go hungry    in the simple version you have envelopes for things like food candy toys games etc simple version is usually taught to kids   so you want a $ 60 game and your game envelope only has $ 5 well you ca n't get the game you need to add more money to the game envelope you need to eat so you have to put money there but maybe you do n't need toys so you can divert some incoming money from toys to games sure it 's still going to take a while to get to $ 60 but now with some simple kid friendly math you can see how long and more importantly you can make decisions on what is more important candy or toys in the adult version things are much the same we just have more envelopes we have rent car payment gas food electric then we need some envelopes for savings and retirement etc now when you get your paycheck you prioritize your money and you stuff it in the envelopes how much you put in each envelope is easy enough to pay for that thing savings and retirement meet different goals you want $ 6,000 savings well just like that game in the kid version you 're not going to get there all at once   but you can see and make decisions on what is most important you want $ 1,000,000 to retire on sure but that envelope is going to take a while to fill up   at it 's core the important parts are that let me explain the rent example as it 's the   you get $ 500 a week and you need $ 1000 for rent   this means you 're spending from your envelopes during week 1 and 2 you 're spending last months week 3 and 4   you do not do this is important because if you lose your paycheck in week 3 or 4 you are homeless   finally in general you stick stuff in savings envelope and you want to reach a savings envelope goal of 6 months of your average pay checks once you reach this goal then you 're in good shape and a job loss does n't mean you 're homeless you can always just pull from savings   it 's important when using these envelopes to understand that you only make the decision of what is more important when you 're sticking money in not when you 're taking money out and that you only work with the money you have right now today in your hand now what you think you 're going to get tomorrow   money in the bank can be split into virtual envelopes money in savings can be in any vehicle but generally you want a short term emergency envelope savings account and a long term envelope cds for example take a look at they used to provide free lessons in using their software to manage an envelope system   and the i know it 's going to get comments section   the rent homeless is a real example you should not take money from say the food envelope to cover the rent this may seem silly but if you 're doing that then you made poor decisions when deciding where the money goes use the emergency fund envelope to cover the rent and next time put less money into food it 's this rule that makes envelope budgeting work well you may be homeless but you can eat drive to work put gas in your car and pay your bills taking money from different envelopes usually results in a spiral where you attempt to do the sensible thing but in the end you 're worse off   migrating to envelope budgeting in the strict sense is hard the best way i have taught people to do it is to only envelope budget an increasing part of their income until their envelopes are full enough for one month that means that you might only envelope budget 10 of your income at first but unless your situation is such that you can cover all your bills with one paycheck it 's not going to be possible to transition without breaking the do n't take money from other envelope rules

its worse than wo n't create jobs   it will destroy jobs   the main reasoning is partly in the article   tax rates do n't matter if an investment is a good idea   job destruction occurs because there is less of a tax deduction for spending     executive assistants newer computers phones and company cars conferences in hawaii are all non essential spending that when there is less of a tax deduction for that spending get cut   normally investments are risky   paying for a google ad if it fails at least gives a tax deduction   lower tax rates means failures cause all of that investment to be lost

prices are adjusted for return and not payout   so if you take the ratio of the close price and the adjusted close price it should remain constant the idea behind a total return is to give you a feeling how much money you would have needed back then to reach the price today under the premise that all distributions dividends spin offs etc are reinvested instantly and that reinvestment does n't cost anything

what does this mean and how do you do it consider that there are may be more than a few different objectives when it comes to investing each of these is a different objective that can have different timelines objectives for the money as well as possible accounts and investment choices in a sense the question could be stated as how much money do you need and when do you need it is it trying to figure out how much money you hope to have for    retirement or does it include short term expenses the objective could be retirement but does n't have to be the short term expenses can be included in various ways the retirement funds could include what kind of method would be used to make sure expenses can be met as if one is looking at retirement just a few years away the short term expenses may come up as part of the retirement living

your biggest concern will be what happens during the transition period in the past when my employer made a switch there has been a lockout period where you could n't move money between funds then over a weekend the money moved from investment company a to investment company b. all the moves were mapped so that you knew which funds your money would be invested in then staring monday morning you could switch them if you did n't like the mapping no money is lost because the transfer is actually done in $ 's imagine both investment companies had the same s&p 500 fund and that the transfer takes a week if when the first accounts are closed the s&p500 fund has a share value of $ 100 your 10 account has a value of $ 1000 if the dividend capital gains are distributed during that week the price per share when the money arrives in the second investment company will now be $ 99 so that instead of 10 shares $ 100 you now will buy shares $ 99 no money was lost you want that lookout period to be small and you want the number of days you are not invested in the market to be zero the lockout limits your ability to make investment changes if for instance the central bank raises rates the number of days out of the market is important if during that period of time there is a big price increase you would n't want to miss it of course the market could also go lower during that time

dividends are declared by the board of directors of a corporation on date a to stock holders of record on date b a later date these stockholders then receive the declared dividend on date c the so called payment date all of these dates are announced on the first declaration date if there is no announcement no dividend will be paid the stock typically goes down in price by approximately the amount of the dividend on the   date it goes ex   but then moves in price to reflect other developments including the possibility of another declaration payment three months hence dividends are important to some investors especially those who live on the income they are less important to investors who are out for capital gains and who may prefer that the company reinvest its money to seek such gains instead of paying dividends in actual fact dividends are one component of total or overall return the other component is capital gains and the sum of the two represents your return

this was a huge question for me when i graduated high school should i buy a new or a used car i opted for buying used i purchased three cars in the span of 5 years the first two were used first one was $ 1500 honda reliable for one year than problem after problem made it not worth it to keep second car was $ 2800 subaru had no problems for 18 months then problems started around 130k miles $ 1800 fix fixed it and it still burnt oil i stopped buying old after that finally i bought a nissan for $ 5500 30,000 miles private owner over 5 years i found that the difference between your typical car for $ 1500 and the typical car you can buy for $ 5500 is actually a pretty big difference   things to look for low mileage one owner recent repairs search google known issues for the make and model based on the mileage of the car your reviewing receipts clean interior buying from a private owner getting a deal where they throw in winter tires for free so you already have a set are all things to look for with that said buying new is expensive for more than just the ticket price of the car if you take a loan out you will also need to take out full insurance in order for the bank to loan you the car this adds a lot to the price of the car monthly depending on your views of insurance and how much you 're willing to risk buying your car outright should be a cheaper alternative over all than buying new save save save its very probably that the hassles of repair and surprise break downs will you enough to buy new or newer at some point but like the previous response said you worked hard to stay out of debt i 'd say save another grand buy a decent car for $ 3000 and continue your wise spending habits try to sell your cars for more than you bought them for look for good deals buy and sell work your way up to a newer more reliable car good luck

quote from the article the banks achieved this gigantic rip off by secretly colluding to rig the public bids on municipal bonds a business worth $ 3.7 trillion   please explain to me how you read that and why you think it is correct does it read as the banks made 3.7 t are the values of the banks 3.7 t did they steal 3.7 t did the bonds return 3.7 t or is it just that the total value of the bonds over many many more years than this entire fraud took place total to 3.7 including the value that really was owned by bond holders and had nothing to do with the profits or theft   hint 1 3.7 trillion is not the worth of any of those businesses not even the sum of all their market caps probably reaches that value hint 2 matt taibbi is smart enough to know this yet writes it that way anyways because sloppy thinkers will buy his crap find that the value of an entire class of assets is 3.7 t even though it is not the value of any business it 's like saying citibank is worth the sum of all the deposits it holds when that is nonsense

jurisdictions will vary but i can imagine calculation methods for child support where the raise could become significant in the present with long future ramifications as well even if the job is temporary or the parent wanted to step away from working full time to attend school the timing of the raise might coincide with disclosure of income to an ex spouse or to the court related and it might be preferable to postpone the increase of course the court would probably frown on declining the raise for only these reasons if it found out it might the higher income anyway and i 'm not suggesting that people dodge responsibility for their kids we 've all seen those cases where child support is not particularly equitable between the two parties and/or the kids do not necessarily benefit by the transfer of money i would n't blame a parent for and considering this type of second order effect and consulting an attorney as with so many other financial implications of divorce regardless of personal moral objections it 's certainly an answer to the question in technical terms that somebody somewhere has taken into account

an experienced individual would n't ask such questions   i do n't say this to take a at you but to provide context   the matter is much more complicated than a simple answer to your question could accomplish the short answer is no not necessarily but it depends on the details generally if the employer matches it 's suggested that you take advantage of the match   it 's free money   that said it comes with some strings attached like a vesting schedule   it 's not yours right away necessarily   choices are limited in a 401k but we should still come out ahead with that free money the investment choices available in a 401k are also a part of the details   if they meet your needs you should certainly consider the 401k even if the employer does n't match there is also the matter of one 's particular tax situation which is certainly an involved matter   a 401k can certainly be a part of judicious tax planning   it 's a matter of working out the details continuing this theme of details and coming back to the employer match if the employer does n't i would make sure that i 'm maxing out an ira before considering the 401k   if the employer matched i would probably contribute to take advantage of that match   however it quickly becomes complicated here   i 'm accustomed to employer matching up to some percentage of pay which typically works out to be less then the contribution limits for a 401k   so i my plan for such a situation is to contribute up to the employer match in the 401k then max out an ira and then return to the 401k to finish contributing up to its yearly maximum there is plenty for you to consider in order to come up with a plan of action   while it 's certainly complicated it 's accessible to most people   you do n't have to be a genius   in fact are regularly by the markets

in an ideal world say on 24th july the share price of apple was $ 600 everyone knows that they will get the $ 2.65 on 16th august there is not other news that is affecting the price you want to go in and buy the shares on 16th morning at $ 600 and then sell it on 17th august at $ 600 now in this process you have earned sure shot $ or in an ideal world when the announcement is made on 24th july why would i sell it at $ 600 when i know if i wait for few more days i will get $ so i will be more inclined to sell it at $ so on 16th aug after the dividend is paid out the share price will be back to $ in a real world dividend or no dividend the share price would be moving up or down notice that the dividend amount is less than 1 of the stock price stock prices change more than this percentage so if you are trying to do what is described in paragraph one then you may be disappointed as the share price may go down as well by more than $ 2.65 you have made

no the language in the constitution is not mandatory the grant of power to congress is mandatory shall but nowhere does it say congress shall must etc establish a post office the same clause also says that the government can establish post roads but those roads no longer exist having been folded into other road systems must congress also maintain a separate post road network by your logic it must but that is clearly an absurd result    maintain is only used for the navy which was always expected to exist continuously congress can also raise and support armies language reflecting the expectation that there would be no standing army but neither maintain nor support are used for the post office    congress has the power to create the post office and post roads bit it does n't have to it certainly does n't have to maintain them nor is there any reason to think that establishing the post office and privatizing it is since it follows the dictate of the clause even if it were unconstitutional what is the relief who could sue who to have what done

in the us and in most other countries dividends are considered income when paid and capital gains losses are considered income loss when realized this is called in accounting recognition we recognize income when cash reaches our pocket for tax purposes so for dividends it is when they 're paid and for gains when you actually sell assuming the price of that fund never changes you have this math do to when you sell of course the capital loss gain may change by the time you actually sell and realize it but assuming the only price change is due to the dividends payout it 's a wash

the truth is anyone can sue anyone for anything   so yes you could be sued but the more important part to measure is the probability of success    while this is probably more of a legal stack exchange question in order for a successful suit there has to be proven at least some negligence on your part in the situation you cite   the very fact that the landlord is not willing to turn on the heat is probably enough to absolve you from any liability   once you go down to a local store and purchase a certified heater then a suit would have a very low probability of success    perhaps a case could be made if you made your own heater and it burned down the house   but that would require finding a jury that is sympathetic to landlords that will not provide heat for their tenants highly unlikely could the landlord sue the heater company   yes and would likely receive an out of court settlement    even in the case that liability can be proven on your part it is very unlikely you would be targeted   these type of suits target deep pockets or those with wealth   unless something is specifically known about you having a high level of net worth a civil suit will not be brought against a room renter because of the lack of funds   people in your demographic tend not to have a lot of money   no offense intended i was there myself once   in the case that you do have a high net worth then get renters insurance and possibly an umbrella policy   it is a small price to pay to protect a significant amount of assets    if i was in your shoes here is what i would do

this question has the united kingdom tag so the information about usa or other law and procedures is probably only of tangential use except for understanding that no this is not something to ignore it may well indicate someone trying to use your i d fraudulently or some other sort of data processing foul up that may adversely impact your credit rating the first thing i would do is phone the credit card company that sent the letter to inform them that i did not make his application and ask firmly but politely to speak to their fraud team i would hope that they would be helpful it 's in their interests as well as yours added later by the way do not trust anything written on the letter it may be a fake letter trying to lure or panic you into some other sort of scam such as closing your compromised bank account and transferring the money in it to the fraud team for safety yes it sounds stupid but con men are experts at what they do and even finance industry professionals have fallen victim to such scams so find a telephone number for that credit card company independently for example google and then call that number if it 's the wrong department they 'll be able to transfer you internally if the card company is unhelpful you have certain legal rights that do not cost much if anything this credit company is obliged to tell you as an absolute minimum which credit reference agencies they used when deciding to decline your application yes you did not make it but it was in your name and affected your credit rating there are three main credit rating agencies and whether or not the bank used them i would spend the statutory £ 2 fee if necessary with each of them to obtain your statutory credit report which basically is all data that they hold about you they are obliged to correct anything which is inaccurate and you have an absolute right to attach a note to your file explaining for example that you entries x y and z were fraudulently caused by an unknown third party trying to steal your id they may be factually correct e.g. credit search on so it 's possible that you can not have them removed and it may not be in your interests to have them removed but you certainly want them flagged as unauthorized   if you think the fraudster may be known to you you can also use the data protection act on the company which write to you requiring them to send you a copy of all data allegedly concerning yourself which it holds this costs £ 10 in particular you will require sight of the application and signature if it was made on paper and the ip address details if it was made electronically as well as all the data content and subsequent communications you may recognise the but even if not you then have documentary evidence that it is not yours as for the ip address you can deduce the internet service provider and then use the data protection act on them they may decline to give any details if the fraudster used his own credentials in which case again you have documentary evidence that it was not you and something to give the police and bank fraud investigators if they get interested i suspect they wo n't be very interested if all you uncover is   fraudulent applications that were declined however you may uncover a successful fraud i.e. a live card in your name being used by a criminal or a store or phone credit agreement in which case obviously get in touch with that company to get it shut down and to get the authorities involved in dealing with the crime in general write down everything you are told including phone contact names and keep it confirm anything that you have agreed in writing and keep copies of the letters you write and of course the replies you receive you should n't need any lawyer the uk credit law puts the onus very much on the credit card company to prove that you owe it money and if a random stranger has stolen your i d it wo n't be able to do that in fact it 's most unlikely that it will even try unless you have a criminal record or a record of financial delinquency but it may be an awful lot of for years to come if somebody has successfully stolen your id so even if the first lot of credit reference agency print outs look clean check again in about six weeks time and yet again   in maybe 3 months finally there is a scheme that you can join if you have been a victim of id theft i 've forgotten its name but you will probably be told about it your credit reference files will be tagged at your request with a requirement for extra precautions to be taken this should not affect your credit rating but might make obtaining credit more hassle for example requests for additional id before your account is opened after the approval process oh and post a letter to yourself it 's not unknown for fraudsters to persuade the post office to redirect all your mail to their address

as out by inflation figures are almost always quoted as a comparison of prices last month and prices a year ago last month   so 10 inflation in august means that things cost 10 more than they did in august a year ago   this can lead to some perverse conclusions consider an imaginary economy where prices stay constant over years   annualized inflation is zero then something happens on january 2nd 2018   some crop fails a foreign cheap source of something becomes unavailable whatever   prices rise permanently as more expensive sources are used this is the only disruption to prices nothing else goes wrong so in february 2018 the authorities find that prices in january 2018 rose by 1 over january 2017 inflation politicians pontificate economists wring their hands etc in march again prices for february 2018 are found to be 1 higher than for february 2017   more this goes on for months   every month inflation year over year is unchanged at 1   everyone has a theory as to how to stop it finally in february 2019 there 's a change   prices in january 2019 were the same as in january 2018   zero inflation   everyone takes credit for bringing down inflation

my answer has nothing to do with tax brackets or mathematics i 'm taking advantage of the leeway your question allowed but rather it has to do with career goals and promotion   large companies often have large policies procedures to go with them   one policy that sometimes exists which would make it a bad idea to accept a raise is employee can not be given more than one    salary increase in a 12-month period this means that if you accept a standard of living or merit increase of say 2 or 3 in april and then you apply for a job that would otherwise warrant a pay grade increase you may be forced to wait until the following year to get bumped to the proper pay grade of course this totally depends on the company but it would be advisable to check your company 's h.r. policy on that if you 're considering a move even a lateral one in the future

i 've had the same thoughts recently and after reading investing at level 3 by james i believe his thesis that for the passive investor you 're giving up too much if you 're not 100 in equities he is clear to point out that you need to be well aware of your withdrawal horizons and has specific tactics for shifting the portfolio when you know you must have the money in the next five years and would n't want to pull money out when you 're at a market low the kicker for me was shifting your thought to a plotting a straight line of reasonable expectations on your return then you do n't worry about how far down you are from your high or up from your low but you measure yourself against the expected return and you 'll find some real grounding you 're investing for the long term so you 're going to see 2 3 bear markets that is n't the the time to get cold feet and react stay put and it will come back the market gets back to the reasonable expectations very quickly as he confirms in all the bear markets and recessions of any note he gives guidelines for a passive investing strategy to leverage this mentality and talks about into an active strategy but does n't go into great depth so if you 're looking to invest more passively this book may be enough to get you rolling with thinking differently than the traditional 70/30 split

putting middlemen into the equation is never going to reduce costs but this is what the u.s. did in the 1970s when they made it much easier for new to be established and grow now the middlemen insurance companies and their paid political have almost the market to death and they have no incentive to release their death grip because the status quo is profitable for them the only way out is the single payer solution and everyone business government individuals benefits from this except the middlemen and their bought and paid for representative politicians   this situation of barely functional health care in the u.s. is the perfect example of what happens when politicians are manipulated to make policy based on who gives them the most money and until the money profit element is removed from governance it is only going to get worse   wealth as free speech yelling fire in a packed theater is free speech too but we do n't allow it and for good reason

it looks like fair market value when you receive your virtual currency is counted as income and you 're also subject to self employment tax on that income here 's an faq from the irs does a taxpayer who mines virtual currency for example uses    computer resources to validate bitcoin transactions and maintain the    public bitcoin transaction ledger realize gross income upon receipt    of the virtual currency resulting from those activities yes    when a taxpayer successfully mines virtual currency the fair market    value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible    in gross income see publication 525 taxable and nontaxable income    for more information on taxable income is an individual who    mines virtual currency as a trade or business subject to    self employment tax on the income derived from those activities    if a taxpayer ’s mining of virtual currency constitutes a trade or    business and the mining activity is not undertaken by the taxpayer    as an employee the net earnings from self employment generally    gross income derived from carrying on a trade or business less    allowable deductions resulting from those activities constitute    income and are subject to the self employment tax see    chapter 10 of publication 334 tax guide for small business for more    information on tax and publication 535 business    expenses for more information on determining whether expenses are    from a business activity carried on to make a profit you 'd of course be able to offset that income with the expense of mining the virtual currency depreciation of dedicated mining equipment electricity not sure what else edit here 's a good resource on filing taxes with bitcoin filling in the 1040 income from bitcoins and all crypto currencies is    declared as either capital gains income or ordinary income for    example from mining income ordinary income will be declared on either    your 1040 line 21 other income for an individual or within your    schedule c if you are self employed or have sole proprietor business    capital gains capital gains income or losses are declared on    schedule d. since there are no reported 1099 forms from bitcoin    exchanges you will need to include your totals with box c checked for    short term gains and with box f checked for long term gains interesting notes from that article your first example could actually be trickier than expected if you started mining before there was a monero to usd exchange also there can also be capital gains implications from using your virtual currency to buy goods which sounds like a pain to keep track of

as someone with a lot of student loan debt i can relate the first thing you should do is read the promissory note on your current loans there might be information there you can use   for govt loans stafford etc made after july 1 2006 the interest rate is going to be fixed and even a federal direct consolidation is not going to lower the rates themselves   if anything consolidation will just increase the repayment period which means you 'll end up paying more in the long run    most private loans usually offer variable interest rates which today are quite low but unless your financial situation is very comfortable and stable consolidating out of federally guaranteed loans into private loans might not be the best path   you might lose options like deferment forbearance and maybe even things like a death benefit if you die your loans die with you related if you have a co signer you do n't get that death benefit but refinancing into a variable rate private loan is going to push a lot of risk to you in terms of interest rate inflation etc most financial professionals will agree that interest rates can only go up in the long run keep in mind student loans are completely unsecured meaning lenders are taking a fairly large risk in loaning money and probably why the fed govt has to guarantee most of them   i 've heard of people borrowing against their home equity to pay down student loan debt but i ca n't think of a reason you 'd want to substitute secured for unsecured debt and possibly lose the loan interest tax deduction   the bottom line is you 're unlikely to find an alternative lending source at a lower interest rate for an unsecured student loan   another option may be the income based repayment plan if you qualify it caps student loan monthly payments at 15 of your discretionary income discretionary is your income minus whatever the poverty threshold income amount is and if that 15 does n't even cover the interest on the loans the govt picks up the tab for the difference for up to 3 years you have to re qualify every year by sending in all sorts of documentation but if you somehow stay on for 25 years your loans are then forgiven obviously the downside here is that you are probably paying little to no principal but if you do the math and determine that your payment would be next to nothing and your current situation is barely paying interest only well maybe is n't a bad thing for a couple of years or 25 if you think you will never have a larger income    personally i went through all these options as well and decided that my best option was to just earn more money a 2nd job or side project here and there helps me pay down the debt faster and with less risk than moving to private variable rate loans

i assume by that you mean gradually buying the same mix of funds over time   if that 's the case there is no rational reason to do this    dollar cost averaging is an artifact of the way most people fund their 401(k   i would not consider it a viable strategy   neither does wikipedia   let 's say you have $ 100,000 that you add $ 10,000 at a time   when you add money one of three things can happen since you ca n't predict the future there 's no mathematical justification for buying in segments   there 's just as much chance that your funds will be worth more or less so on average it should make little to no difference    in fact given the time value of money there is a slight   advantage to investing it all now so you can capture any future returns   you can always rebalance later to capture gains on some funds and purchase funds that are down to hopefully catch them on a rebound

to me the simple answer might be to tap the equity in the $ 400k home you owe $ on and use the proceeds to purchase the new retirement home even if you were to do that you 'd still have almost $ 100k in untapped equity in the existing home no mortgage on the retirement home nothing out of pocket other than refi fees and probably no more of a mortgage payment than you already have on the house with equity   i do n't see any reason why the bank would n't go for that especially if you 've got a good payment history on your existing mortgage i hope this helps good luck

you 're doing great   i 'd suggest trying get putting 5 10 towards your retirement and the balance to the student loans you are a little weak in retirement savings but you have $ house with 20 equity that you bought at the bottom of the market that 's a smart investment imo and in my mind compensates somewhat for your low 401k balance if i were you i would retire the student loans asap to reduce the money that you have to shell out each month that way you have the option of scaling back you or your wife 's work somewhat to avoid paying thousands for child care in my mind less debt = = more options and i like options

when you send money with western union it is essentially a cash transaction   you supply western union with the name of the recipient and a location   your recipient then shows up at a western union office shows some identification and receives cash   at this point the transaction is over   it is impossible to retract it at this point because western union has already handed out cash and they have no way of contacting the recipient any longer this is the reason why you might want to legitimately use western union   it is an instant way to send cash to anyone anywhere in the world   let 's say that your best friend is stuck in a foreign land and desperately needs money   you can give him cash just as fast as each of you can get to a western union office and you do n't even need a local bank account to do so unfortunately however the nature of the service also makes it useful for scammers   you should never use this service to pay for something from someone you do n't know because there are absolutely no safeguards as mentioned by in the comments you can indeed cancel a western union money transfer if you do so before the money is picked up by the recipient   but after they pick it up the cash is gone

if you have been putting savings away for the longer term and have some extra funds which you would like to take some extra risk on then i say work yourself out a strategy plan get yourself educated and go for it if it is individual shares you are interested then work out if you prefer to use fundamental analysis technical analysis or some of both you can use fundamental analysis to help determine which shares to buy and then use technical analysis to help determine when to get into and out of a position you say you are prepared to lose $ 10,000 in order to try to get higher returns i do n't know what percentage this $ 10,000 is of the capital you intend to use in this kind of investments trading but lets assume it is 10 so your total starting capital would be $ 100,000 the idea now would be to learn about money management position sizing and risk management there are plenty of good books on these subjects if you set a maximum loss for each position you open of 1 of your capital i.e $ 1,000 then you would have to get 10 straight losses in a row to get to your 10 total loss you do this by setting stop losses on your positions i 'll use an example to explain say you are looking at a stock priced at $ 20 and you get a signal to buy it at that price you now need to determine a stop price which if the stock goes down to you can say well i may have been wrong on this occasion the stock price has gone against me so i need to get out now i put automatic stop loss conditional orders with my broker you may determine the stop price based on previous support levels using a percentage of your buy price or another indicator or method i tend to use the percentage of buy price lets say you use 10 so your stop price would be at $ 18 10 below your buy price of $ 20 so now you can work out your position size the number of shares to buy your maximum loss on the position is $ 2 per share or 10 of your position in this stock but it should also be only 1 of your total capital being 1 of $ 100,000 = $ 1,000 you simply divide $ 1,000 by $ 2 to get 500 shares to buy   you then do this with the rest of your positions with a $ 100,000 starting capital using a 1 maximum loss per position and a stop loss of 10 you will end up with a maximum of 10 positions if you use a larger maximum loss per position your position sizes would increase and you would have less positions to open i would not go higher than 2 maximum loss per position if you use a larger stop loss percentage then your position sizes would decrease and you would have more positions to open the larger the stop loss the longer you will potentially be in a position and the smaller the stop loss generally the less time you will be in a position also as your total capital increases so will your 1 of total capital just as it would decrease if your total capital decreases using this method you can aim for higher higher return investments and reduce and manage your risk to a desired level one other thing to consider do n't let tax determine when you sell an investment if you are keeping a stock just so you will pay less tax if kept for over 12 months then you are in real danger of increasing your risk considerably i would rather pay 50 tax on a 30 return than 25 tax on a 15 return

in theory when you obtained ownership of your usd cash as a canadian resident resident for tax purposes which is generally a quicker timeline than being resident for immigration purposes it is considered to have been obtained by you for the cad equivalent on that date   for example if you on dec 31 2016 and carried $ 10k usd with you when the rate was then canada deems you to have arrived with $ cad if you converted that cad to usd when the rate was 1.39 you would have received cad a gain of $ 400 to show as income on your tax return   receiving the foreign inheritances is a little more complex those items when received may or may not have been taxable on that day however whether or not they were taxable you would calculate a further gain as above if the fx rate gave you more cad when you ultimately converted it if the rate went the other way and you lost cad value you may or may not be able to claim a loss if it was a small loss i would n't bother trying to claim it due to hassle if it 's a large loss i would be very sure to research thoroughly before claiming because something like that probably has a high chance of being audited

the price of a share has two components bid the highest price that someone who wants to buy shares is willing to pay for them ask the lowest price that someone who has a share is willing to sell it for the ask is always higher than the bid since if they were equal the buyer and seller would have a deal make a transaction and that repeats until they are not equal for stock with high volume there is usually a very small difference between the bid and ask but a stock with lower volume could have a major difference when you say that the share price is $ 100 that could mean different things you could be talking about the price that the shares sold for in the most recent transaction and that might not even be between the current bid and ask or you could be talking about any of the bid the ask or some value in between them if you have shares that you are interested in selling then the bid is what you could immediately sell a share for if you sell a share for $ 100 that means someone was willing to pay you $ 100 for it if after buying it they still want to buy more for $ 100 each or someone else does then the bid is still $ 100 and you have n't changed the price if no one else is willing to pay more than $ 90 for a share then the price would drop to $ 90 next time a transaction takes place and that s what you would be able to immediately sell the next share for

this is actually to me an interesting point to note   while the answer is that 's what congress wrote there are implications to note first for many the goal of tax deferral is to shift 25 or 28 income to 15 income at retirement with long term gains at 15 simply investing long term post tax can accomplish a similar goal where all gain is taxed at 15   looking at this from another angle an ira or 401(k for that matter effectively turns long term gains into ordinary income   it 's a good observation and should n't be ignored

you are not interpreting the table correctly the $ 20 k base rate that you think should have been eliminated is in fact the total tax for the whole bracket you only dipped partially into the bracket and the $ 3 k reduction accounts for that look at the table again what it means is that if you earn $ 100 k you will pay $ + 25 of 100000 = $ if you earn $ you 'll pay $ + 0.28 = $ so why the difference between $ and $ that 's exactly 25 of $ which is the difference between $ and $ the whole value of the bracket

all for us yes you will have a realized long term capital gain which is taxable long term gains including those distributed by a mutual fund or other and also qualified dividends both not relevant here are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income but are still almost not quite like ordinary income not always 15 specifically if your ordinary taxable income after deductions and exemptions equivalent to line 43 minus ltcg ends in the 25 to 33 brackets your ltcg income is taxed at 15 unless the total of reaches the top of those brackets then any remainder at 20 these brackets depend on your filing status and are adjusted yearly for inflation for 2016 they are single 37,650 to married joint or to head of household to special married separate 37,650 to which i 'd guess covers at least the middle three quintiles of the earning population   otoh if your ordinary income ends below the 25 bracket your ltcg income that fits in the lower is taxed at 0 not at all and only the portion that would be in the ordinary up brackets is taxed at 15 if your ordinary taxable income this year was below those brackets or you expect next year it will be possibly due to status exemption deduction changes as well as income change then if all else is equal you are better off realizing the stock gain in the where some or more of it fits in the 0 bracket if you 're over about $ 400k a similar calculation applies but you can afford more reliable advice than potential dogs on the internet update near dupe found see also how are long term capital gains taxed if the gain pushes income into a new tax bracket   also a warning on estimated payments in general you are required to pay most of your income tax liability during the year not wait until april 15 if you underpay by more than 10 or $ 1000 whichever is larger you usually owe a penalty computed on form 2210 whose name is frequently and for most people whose income is mostly from a job this is handled by payroll withholding which normally comes out close enough to your liability if you have other income like investments as here or self employment or pension retirement disability etc you are supposed to either make estimated payments each quarter the irs quarters are shifted slightly from everyone else 's or increase your withholding or a combination for a large income lump in december that was n't planned in advance it wo n't be practical to adjust withholding however if this is the only year increased there is a safe harbor if your withholding this year 2016 is enough to pay last year 's tax 2015 which for most people it is unless you got a pay cut this year or a filed status change like or having a child you get until next april 15 or next business day in 2017 it is actually april 18 to pay the additional amount of this year 's tax 2016 without underpayment penalty however if you split the gain so that both 2016 and 2017 have income and thus taxes higher than normal for you you will need to make estimated payment(s and/or increase withholding for 2017 ps congratulations on your gain and on the patience to hold anything for 10 years

index funds are good for diversifying risk for people who do n't have a large sum of money to invest holding all the different types of stocks in the index is both very expensive and not practical because you incur too many transaction costs for an index funds the main advantages are that costs are pooled and investors can invest a smaller amount that they would if they bought all the different stocks individually naturally if you wanted to figure out the percentage composition of the index and invest directly it would be possible albeit tedious

the other answers have offered some great advice but here is an alternative that has n't been mentioned yet i 'm assuming that you have an adequately sized emergency fund in savings and that your cars are your only non mortgage debt since you still have car debt you probably do n't have anything saved for buying a new car when your current cars are at the end of life consider paying off your car loans early then begin saving for your next car having cash in the bank for a car is very freeing and it changes your mindset when it comes time to purchase a car as it is easy to waste a lot of money on something that depreciates rapidly when you are n't paying for it immediately   this approach might be counterintuitive if your car loan interest rate is less than your mortgage rate but you will probably need another car before you need another house and paying cash for a car is worth doing

# 566205
i 'm not a financial expert but saying that paying a $ 1 dividend will reduce the value of the stock by $ 1 sounds like awfully simple minded reasoning to me it appears to be based on the assumption that the price of a stock is equal to the value of the assets of a company divided by the total number of shares but that simply is n't true you do n't even need to do any in depth analysis to prove it just look at share prices over a few days you should easily be able to find stocks whose price varied wildly if say a company becomes the target of a federal investigation the share price will plummet the day the announcement is made did the company 's assets really disappear that day no what 's happened is that the company 's long term prospects are now in doubt or a company announces a promising new product the share price shoots up they may not have sold a single unit of the new product yet they have n't made a dollar but their future prospects now look improved many factors go into determining a stock price sure total assets is a factor but more important is anticipated future earning i think a very simple case could be made that if a stock never paid any dividends and if everyone knew it would never pay any dividends that stock is worthless the stock will never produce any profit to the owner so why should you be willing to pay anything for it one could say the value could go up and you could sell at a profit but on what basis would the value go up why would investors be willing to pay larger and larger amounts of money for an asset that produces zero income update i think i understand the source of the confusion now so let me add to my answer suppose that a company 's stock is selling for say $ 10 and to simplify the discussion let 's suppose that there is absolutely nothing affecting the value of that stock except an expected dividend the company plans to pay a dividend on a specific date of $ 1 per share this dividend is announced well in advance everyone knows that it will be paid and everyone is extremely that in fact the company really will pay it they wo n't run out of money or any such then in a pure market we would expect that as the date of that dividend approaches the price of the stock would rise until the day before the dividend is paid it is $ 11 then the day after the dividend is paid the price would fall back to $ 10 why because the person who owns the stock on the dividend day will get that $ 1 so if you bought the stock the day before the dividend the next day you would immediately receive $ 1 if without the dividend the stock is worth $ 10 then the day before the dividend the stock is worth $ 11 because you know that the next day you will get a $ 1 refund if you buy the stock the day after the dividend is paid you will not get the $ 1 it will go to the person who had the stock yesterday so the value of the stock falls back to the normal $ 10 so if you look at the value of a stock immediately after a dividend is paid yes it will be less than it was the day before by an amount equal to the dividend plus or minus all the other things that affect the value of a stock which in many cases would totally mask this effect but this does not mean that the dividend is worthless just the opposite the reason the stock price fell was precisely because the dividend has value but it only has value to the person who gets it it does me no good that you get a $ 1 dividend i want me to get the money so if i buy the stock after the dividend was paid i missed my chance so sure in the very short term a stock loses value after paying a dividend but this does not mean that dividends in general reduce the value of a stock just the opposite the price fell because it had gone up in anticipation of the dividend and is now returning to the normal level without the dividend the price would never have gone up in the first place imagine you had a company with negligible assets for example an accounting firm that rents office space so it does n't own a building its only tangible assets are some office supplies and the like so if the company liquidates it would be worth pretty much zero everybody knows that if liquidated the company would be worth zero further suppose that everyone somehow knows that this company will never ever again pay a dividend maybe federal regulators are shutting the company down because it 's products were declared hazardous or the company was built around one genius who just died etc what is the stock worth zero it is an investment that you know has a zero return why would anyone be willing to pay anything for it it 's no answer to say that you might buy the stock in the hope that the price of the stock will go up and you can sell at a profit even with no dividends why would anyone else pay anything for this stock well unless their stock certificates are pretty and people like to collect them or something like that otherwise you 're supposing that people would knowingly buy into a pyramid scheme of course in real life there are usually uncertainties if a company is dying some people may believe rightly or wrongly that there is still hope of it etc do n't confuse the value of the assets of a company with the value of its stock they are related of course all else being equal a company with a billion dollars in assets will have a higher market capitalization than a company with ten dollars in assets but you ca n't calculate the price of a company 's stock by adding up the value of all its assets subtracting liabilities and dividing by the number of shares that 's just not how it works long term the value of any stock is not the value of the assets but the net present value of the total future expected dividends subject to all sorts of complexities in real life

the answer to question 1 is yes you can always reduce your loan when you remortgage by introducing additional funds there is some possibility a relatively small charge might be applicable for managing the marginally more complex transfer but it should n't be too much the answer to question 2 is none of your over payment amounts would have gone on interest but you might incur penalty charges interest is only charged on the outstanding loan amount i.e. £ 100 k initially reducing to £ 85 k over 2 years in your example at the interest rate determined by your mortgage agreement there is no paying off interest as such over payments are essentially all capital payments reducing the principal loan amount so no additional interest would be paid if you opted for over payments if you used your £ 10 k to made the over payments throughout the 2 year fixed period you would in fact have paid less interest by the end of the 2 years because you would be reducing the loan amount at a quicker rate and thus the interest you pay each month based on the lower outstanding loan at that time would be lower but over payments might have attracted over payment penalties typically a percentage of the amount you pay and these penalties often mean it 's not worth doing most fixed term mortgages have such penalties but it depends on the agreement and many mortgages also allow you to make over payments up to a certain amount each year before you get hit edit additional suggestion if the example you provide is one based on what you expect might happen to you over the next couple of years something you could consider is an offset mortgage here your £ 10 k that you accumulate reduces your interest through the 2 years but you keep it in savings where you can access it if you need to accessing it will then cause a corresponding rise in interest payments but to no higher level than you would have been paying if you had nothing in the savings in the first place you usually pay a slightly higher interest rate for these sort of mortgage so it 's impossible to know if it would be more economical and how appropriate it would be for you in other respects depends on many factors

  yes lithium is not a rare metal but when demands rise very fast supply tend to lag this is why oil price hikes happened historically   eventually it would even put but if the production rose as quickly as you describe we would be having lithium shortage which would translate into price hikes which would then lower to demand of such cars using those batteries

that 's incredible i 'm a second year college student taking macro economics class a lot of these technical things are all news to me    thank you for the wealth of information    1 that 's an interesting thought does that basically translate to less tax on poor wealthy since there are a lot more of them in numbers to promote entrepreneurship    2 someone pointed that very thing out rich using money to grow their own wealth but would n't that mean as a byproduct jobs will be made i probably made another dangerous assumption here    3 i do n't think i understand this one at all what is compensation will you rephrase it for me   4 i hear that effective tax rate can be very misleading to the general public i learned how to calculate the average tax rate a few weeks ago and understood what the folks were talking about i did hear from my professor and the educational videos he had shown us that the capital   tax is one of the highest among the other oecd nations my question for that would be why ca n't we just close loop holes instead of choosing to slash capital tax i feel like the majority will be more than okay with closing the loopholes   5 i think citizens of the country aligning with the county 's companies without asking questions is a terrible and a dangerous idea asian depression in the mid 90 's really it for me since our family was practically evicted from korea major conglomerates held all the power and the federal government was really just a puppet i think it 's in each company 's best interest to further their own agenda and that agenda usually means bad for the majority let me know if i 'm way off base here but one person 's spending is another 's income so using that logic the company ca n't make money unless i spend money so we have a conflict of interest here because as a consumer i want to get the best deals be thrifty company wants to charge me as much as they can to maximize profits    thank you in advance for your time

i do n't see how you could have this conversation without also including mention of the labor participation rate if the unemployment rate is low but there is still a huge pool of workers trying to get back into the workforce then you still have high competition for positions which would depress the wage rate this has been my experience looking for work in the last 12 months linkedin tracks applications and it is routine to see 100 300 applicants for entry level business analyst positions that are only a week or two old does that seem like low unemployment low competition for work hell no i bet most employers are still flooded with applications and can be as picky as they want and can lowball applicant wages

thanks for your additional comments sam that is helpful here is an overview of what you can and can not do with an fsa as it applies to your situation the government intends that a general health fsa be used to cover expenses that are usually out of pocket when you are covered by a qualifying health plan it is funded with pre tax dollars and is on a use it or lose it basis however an hsa is itself a form of health coverage that is tax advantaged and the balance can be invested because of this an hsa is not considered by the government to be a health plan that qualifies for use with a general health fsa however this means that a given covered person can not have both of these simultaneously in your wife 's case if you have an hsa and she has traditional health benefits with an fsa this is not considered a problem since she can only use the fsa money for expenses incurred by members of your family on her plan however if she were to join you on the hsa which sounds like it could be a good idea overall she would need to wind down her fsa and would not be able to fund it for the next year this could be a problem if you have a lot of money in the fsa that she is n't able to spend prior to joining the hsa the reason why the government does n't want one given person covered by both an hsa and given access to an fsa at the same time is that they are both tax advantaged what they intend is that people can set aside money pre tax which they will use to pay their non covered health expenses if someone had both there would be two potential problems if you do ultimately want your wife to be on the hsa see if you can spend what is left in her fsa as it will end when she ends her health coverage with her employer if the amount you stand to lose is significant you may need to wait another year until your next open enrollment period or life event such as the birth of a child to enroll her on your hsa it is also likely that her premium on the hsa will be lower which could impact the effect of ending her fsa recently there has also been a rule change regarding what is called a limited use fsa these are fsas that are used for qualifying expenses such as dental and vision that can be used together with an hsa this may be something that is helpful to you and/or your wife on the hsa if your employer offers this as a possibility please note that unlike retirement accounts you can not rollover funds between fsa plans offered by two different employers as each fsa is a separate benefit fund that is on a use it or lose it basis again because the government wants to restrict tax advantaged contributions to what you are likely to spend you may also find the article here helpful to learn more about fsa hsa combinations and limited use fsas i hope this helps

the market maker will always compare the highest bid and the lowest ask a trade will happen if the highest bid is at least as high as the lowest ask adding one share or a million shares at a higher asking price here $ 210 instead of $ 200 will not have any effect at all nobody will buy the share   adding a bid for one share or a million shares at a higher bid price will trigger a sale if you bid $ 210 for one share you will pay $ 210 for one of the shares that were offered at $ 200 if you have $ 210 million in cash and add a bid for 1,000,000 aapl at $ 210 you will pay $ 210 for all shares with an ask of $ then $ then $ until you either bought all shares with an ask up to $ 210 or until you bought a million shares   with aapl you probably bid the price up to $ 201 with a million shares so you made lots of people very happy while losing about 10 million dollars so let 's say this is a much smaller company   you have driven the share price up to $ 210 but there is nobody else bidding above $ 200 so nobody is going to buy your shares until some people think there is something going on and enter higher bids but then some people will take advantage of this and ask lower than your $ 210 and there will be more people trying to make cash by selling their shares at a good price than people tricked into bidding over $ 200 so it is most likely that you lose out   this completely ignores legality attempting to do this would be market manipulation and in many countries illegal i do n't know if losing money in the process would protect you from criminal charges

it has been hinted at in some other answers but i want to say it explicitly volatility is not risk volatility is how much an investment goes up and down risk is the chance that you will lose money for example stocks have relatively high volatility but the risk that you will lose money over a 40 year period is virtually zero in particular if you invest in index funds bonds on the other hand have basically no volatility their cash flow is totally predictable if you trust the future of your government but there is a significant risk that they will perform worse than stocks over a longer period so volatility equals risk only if you are day trading a 401(k is literally the opposite of that for further reading never confuse risk and volatility also investing is not gambling gambling is bad because the odds are stacked against you you need more than average luck to actually win and the longer you play the more you will lose investing means buying productive capital that will produce further value the odds are in your favor even if you do a moderately bad job at investing the longer you stay the more you will win

this question is predicated on the assumption that investors prefer dividends as this depends on who you 're speaking to   some investors prefer growth stocks some which do n't pay dividends so in this case we 're covering the percent of investors who like dividend paying stocks it depends on who you ask and it also depends on how self aware they are because some people may give reasons that make little financial sense   the two major benefits that i hear are fundamentally psychological dividends are like mini paychecks   since people get a from receiving a paycheck i would predict the same holds true for receiving dividends   more than likely the brain feels a reward when getting dividends even if the dividend stock performs lower than a growth stock for a decade the experience of receiving dividends may feel more rewarding plus depending on the institution they may get a report or see the tax information for the year and that also feels good some value investors do n't reinvest dividends as they believe the price of the stock matters stocks are either cheap or expensive and automatic reinvestment to these investors implies that the price of a stock does n't matter so dividends allow them to rebuild their cash after a buy   they can either buy more shares if the stock is cheap or keep the cash if the stock is expensive   think about warren buffett here he purchased $ 3 billion worth of shares of wells fargo at approximately $ 8 12 a share in 2009 from my memory as people were shocked that be bought into a bank when no one liked banks   consider how much money he makes from dividends off that purchase alone and if he were to currently believe wells fargo was overpriced he could keep the cash and buy something else he believes is cheaper   in these cases dividends automatically build cash post buying and many value investors believe that one should always have cash on hand this second point is a little tricky because it can involve risk assessment some investors believe that high dividend paying stocks like mo wo n't experience the huge declines of indexes like the spy   mo routed the spy in 2009 29 vs. 19 and these investors believe that 's because it 's yield was too desired it feels safer to them the index side would argue but what happens in the long run   the problem i have with this argument which is frequent is that it does n't hold true for every high yield stock though some high yield stocks do show strong resistance levels during bear markets

great question there are several reasons i 'm going to list the few that i can think of off the top of my head right now first even if institutional bank holdings in such a term account are covered by deposit insurance this as well as the amount covered varies geographically the amount covered is generally trivial when seen in the context of bank holdings an individual might have on the order of $ 1,000 $ 10,000 in such an account for a bank that 's basically chump change and you are looking more at numbers in the millions of dollars range sometimes a lot more than that for a large bank even hundreds of millions of dollars might be a relatively small portion of their holdings the 2011 goldman sachs annual report i just pulled a big bank out of thin air here no affiliation with them that i know of states that as of december 2011 their excess liquidity was million us dollars over 170 billion dollars with a bottom line total assets of $ million a shade under a trillion dollars book value good luck finding a bank that will pay you 4 interest on even a fraction of such an amount gs income before tax in 2011 was a shade under 6.2 billion dollars 4 on 170 billion dollars is 6.8 billion dollars that is the interest payments at such a rate on their excess liquidity alone would have cost more than they themselves made in the entire year which is completely unsustainable government bonds are as guaranteed as deposit insurance covered bank accounts it 'll be the government that steps in and pays the guaranteed amount quite possibly issuing bonds to cover the cost but assuming the country does not default on its debt which happens from time to time you will get back the entire amount plus interest for a deposit insured bank account of any kind you are only guaranteed to the extent that one can guarantee anything the maximum amount in the country 's bank deposit insurance i believe in most countries this is at best on the order of $ 100,000 if the bank where the money is kept goes bankrupt for holdings on the order of what banks deal with you would be extremely lucky to recover even a few percent of the principal government bonds are also generally accepted as collateral for the bank 's own loans which can make a difference when you need to raise more money in short order because a large customer decided to withdraw a big pile of cash from their account maybe to buy stocks or bonds themselves government bonds are generally liquid that is they are n't just issued by the government held to maturity while paying interest and then returned electronically these days in return for their face value in cash government bonds are bought and sold on the secondary market as well where they are traded in very much the same way as public company stocks if banks started simply depositing money with each other all else aside then what would happen keep in mind that the interest rate is basically the price of money supply and demand would dictate that if you get a huge inflow of capital you can lower the interest rate paid on that capital banks do n't pay high interest and certainly would n't do so to each other because of their good will they pay high interest because they can not secure capital funding at lower rates this is a large reason why the large banks will generally pay much lower interest rates than smaller niche banks the larger banks are seen as more reliable in the bond market so are able to get funding more cheaply by issuing bonds individuals will often buy bonds for the perceived safety depending on how much money you are dealing with sold a large house recently it is quite possible even for individuals to hit the ceiling on deposit insurance and for any of a number of reasons they might not feel comfortable putting the money in the stock market buying government bonds then becomes a relatively attractive option you get a slightly lower return than you might be able to get in a high interest savings account but you are virtually guaranteed return of the entire principal if the bond is held to maturity on the other hand it might not be the case that you will get the entire principal back if the bank paying the high interest gets into financial trouble or even bankruptcy some people have personal or systemic objections toward banks limiting their willingness to deposit large amounts of money with them and of course in some cases such as for example retirement savings it might not even be possible to simply stash the money in a savings account in which case bonds of some kind is your only option if you want a purely interest bearing investment

i think swenson 's insight was that the traditional recommendation of 60 stocks plus 40 bonds has two serious flaws 1 you are exposed to way too much risk by having a portfolio that is so strongly tied to us equities especially in the way it has historically been recommend 2 you have too little reward by investing so much of your portfolio in bonds if you can mix a decent number of asset classes that all have equity like returns and those asset classes have a low correlation with each other then you can achieve equity like returns without the equity like risk this improvement can be explicitly measured in the sharpe ratio of you portfolio the vanguard risk factor looks pretty and lame to me the book the the ivy portfolio does a great job at covering the swenson model and explains how to reasonably replicate it yourself using low fee etfs

there are normally three key factors that define different kinds of loans these factors affect the risk that the lender takes on and so the interest rate the interest rate on any loan is linked to market interest rates the lender should n't be able to receive a higher rate of interest for lending the money at no risk and the level of risk that the lender believes the borrower to have the three features of a particular loan are these reduce the risk of complete or total non payment default of the principal or any missed interest payments taken in order here some of the monthly payment pays a proportion of the underlying principal of the loan this reduces the amount outstanding and so reduces the capacity for default on the full principal as part of the principal has already been paid security in a secured loan there is an asset such as a car house boat gold shares etc that has a value on resale that is held against the loan the lender may repossess the security if the borrower defaults and recover their money that way this also acts as a stick using the loss of property to convince the borrower that it is better to keep paying the interest the future value of the security will be taken into account when deciding how much this reduces the interest rate guarantor a guarantor to a loan guarantees that the borrower will repay the loan and interest in full and if the borrower does not fulfil that obligation the lender is able to seek legal from the guarantor for the borrower 's debts each of these reduce the risk of the loan as detailed and so reduce the interest rate the interest rate then is made up of three parts the market interest rate m plus the interest rate premium for the borrower 's own credit worthiness c minus the value of the features of the loan that help to reduce risk l the interest rate of the loan r is as r = m + c l. credit ratings themselves are an science and even when two lenders are looking at the same credit score for the same person they will give a different interest rate premium this is mostly for business reasons and the shape of their loan book that are too tedious to go through here all in all the different types of loan give flexibility at the cost of a different interest rate if you do n't want the chance of your car being repossessed you do n't take a secured loan if you have a family member who can help and does n't mind taking on your risk take a guaranteed loan

assuming the numbers work out roughly the same and you can frankly whip up a spreadsheet to prove that out a defined benefit scheme that pays out an amount equal to an return from a 401(k is better   the reason is not monetary it is that the same return is being had at less risk put another way if your defined benefit was guaranteed to be $ 100/month and your 401(k had a contribution that eventually gets to a lump sum that if for the same life expectancy gave you $ 100/month the db is better because there is less chance that you wo n't see the money or put even simpler which is more likely that new york goes bankrupt and is relieved of all pension obligations or the stock market underperforms expectations   neither can be ruled out but assuming even the same benefit lower risk is better now the complication in your scenario is that your new job pays better   as such it is possible that you might be able to accumulate more savings in your 401(k than you might in the db scheme   then again even with the opportunity to do so there is no guarantee that you will   as such even modelling it out really is n't going to dismiss the key variables as such can i suggest a different approach   which job is going to make you happier now   part of that may be money part of that may be what you are actually doing   but you should focus on that question the marginal consideration of retirement is really moot in theory an ira contribution can be made that would equalize your 401(k negating it from the equation   grant you there is very slightly different tax treatment and the phaseout limits differ but at the salary ranges you are looking at you could in theory make decisions that would have the same retirement outcome in any event the real question is then not what is the effect in 20 years but rather which makes you happier now

well if you worked in the united states you have social security and medicare and medicaid in most cases as well   so you have a small amount of income to spend every month to cover your most basic living expenses as well as your basic medical expenses   at least that 's the idea in reality it probably is n't anywhere near enough money for most to live comfortably   also there is a real fear that the us will have to inflate itself out of its debt to some extent in the future   this theory implies that the money retired individuals have saved or are receiving down the road could buy significantly less in the future than they expect if you have the ability to put money away into an ira or 401 k early in your life it will be greatly beneficial to do so   however that is another issue i wo n't begin to discuss fully here edit since your question was restated after i typed my initial response the final answer is   you will receive some assistance from social security medicare and medicaid   you will most likely need to either continue working draw on savings such as an ira or 401k or will need assistance from others   if none of those are options you would most likely end up living in poverty or worse

yes if the deceased owned the policy the proceeds are considered part of the estate in the specific case where the estate is worth this year 2011 more than $ 5 m there may be estate taxes due and the insurance would be prorated to pay its portion of that estate tax bill   keep in mind the estate tax itself is subject to change i recall when it was a simple $ 1 m exemption and if i had a $ 1 m policy and just say $ 100 k in assets there would have been tax due on the $ 100k. in general if there 's any concern that one 's estate would have the potential to owe estate tax it 's best to have the insurance owned by the beneficiary and gift them the premium cost each year

the way to resolve your dilemma is to consult the price to rent ratio of the property according to the price to rent ratio is a measure of the relative affordability of renting and buying in a given housing market it is calculated as the ratio of home prices to annual rental rates so for example in a real estate market where on average a home worth $ 200,000 could rent for $ 1000 a month the price rent ratio is that ’s determined using the formula $ 200,000 ÷ 12 x $ 1,000 also goes on to give a table comparing different cities price to rent ratio and then claim that the average price to rent ratio is currently if your price to rent ratio is lower than then yes your rents are more expensive than the average house claims that a high price to rent ratio is an argument in favor of tenants renting properties while a low price to rent ratio favors people buying either to live in the property or to just rent it out to other people so let 's apply the price to rent ratio formula towards the properties you just quoted there 's a specific house i could buy for 190 perhaps even less that rents for exactly 2000 month 12 = there 's a house for sale asking 400 been on the market 2 yrs could probably get for 350 which rents for 2800   12 = 12 = one can quite easily today buy a house for that would rent out for 1700 2100 month   lower bound 12 = upper bound 12 = even so the rental returns here seem ridiculously high to me based on other markets i 've noticed considering how the average price to rent ratio is and your price to rent ratio ranges from to you are indeed correct they are indeed ridiculously high qualification i was involved in real estate and used the price to rent ratio to determine how long it would take to recover a person 's investment in the property keep in mind that it 's not the only thing i care about and obviously the price to rent ratio tends to expenses involved in actually owning properties and trying to deal with periods of vacancy there 's also the problem of taking into account demand as well according to detroit mi has the lowest price to rent ratio with which should suggest that people should buy properties immediately in this city but that 's probably more of a sign of people not wanting to move to detroit and bid up the prices of properties edit i should also say that just because the properties are ridiculously expensive right now does n't mean you should expect your rents to decrease rather if rents keep staying at their current level i 'd predict that the property values will slowly increase in the future thereby raising the price to rent ratio to non ridiculous mode

accrued interest generally means interest that is earned but not received   this is the interest that is added on top of the amount that was originally agreed upon because your friend missed some months she will have gained 3 interest on top of the original loan amount for every month that she did n't pay   the interest even applies to the increased loan amount so it will increase exponentially for every month that she does not make a payment   for example if the loan amount was for $ 1,000 and she missed the payment the first month the 3 accrued interest will raise that loan amount to $   if she misses the second month then the loan amount will become $ and so on this means that it will take her more months to pay the loan in its entirety arrears are the overdue payments that she had not made so the sentence with payments paying the arrears before being applied to the current month 's payment means that she must pay the overdue debt from the previous months first before she can even make the payment for the current month

rent the property is that a possible solution since selling the house is not an option and living in it is n't either then perhaps renting it is the way to go since no explanation for the sister 's motives is given i 'd speculate it is a mixture of emotional and financial concerns maybe mostly emotional i imagine letting go of the one physical thing that has memories of you and your parents attached to it is very difficult i do n't think getting a lawyer or doing what 's convenient for only your boyfriend is the way to go but that 's my own personal opinion clearly he only has one close family member left alive creating permanent wounds in that relationship will cost more along the way and quite frankly if the house is owned 50 50 do n't you need both owners to sign the deed to sell the house anyways if renting is not an option then maybe refinancing the mortgage to lower payments or airbnb it only half the time or rent it out for events to help with payments or ask the sister for a little money not for half the mortgage but at least a few hundred dollars to maintain the house and heat if she is indeed concerned with the property then maintaining it to prevent serious is in her interests no matter her income

there 's already an excellent answer here from but i wanted to expand a bit on types of investments with some additional actionable information you can invest in stocks bonds mutual funds which are simply    collections of stocks and bonds bank accounts precious metals and    many other things discussing all of these investments in one answer    is too broad but my recommendation is this if you are investing for    retirement you should be investing in the stock market however    picking individual stocks is too risky you need to be diversified in    a lot of stocks stock mutual funds are a great way to invest in the    stock market so how does one go about actually investing in the stock market in a diversified way what if you also want to diversify a bit into bonds fortunately in the last several years several products have come about that do just these things and are targeted towards newer investors these are often labeled robo advisors most even allow you to adjust your allocation according to your risk preferences here 's a list of the ones i know about while these products all to achieve similar goals of giving you an easy way to obtain a diversified portfolio according to your risk they differ in the buckets of stocks and funds they put your money into the careful investor would be wise to compare which specific etfs they use e.g. looking at their expense ratios capitalization and spreads

in summary you are correct that the goal of investing is to maximize returns while paying low management fees   index investing has become very popular because of the low fees   there are many actively traded mutual funds out there with very high management fees of 2.5 and up that do not beat the market   this begs the question of why you are paying high management fees and not just investing in index funds consider maxing out your tax sheltered accounts 401(k and roth ira to avoid even more fees on your returns also consider having a growth component of your portfolio which is generally filled with equity along with a secure component for assets such as bonds   bonds may not have the exciting returns of equity but they help to smooth out the volatility of your portfolio which may help to keep peace of mind when the market dips

why should a bank get into construction specifically lots of business opportunities require capital conceivably banks could build factories develop consumer electronics complete with spacex etc it 's all capital in profits out with varying levels of risk and returns there 's nothing special about constructing apartments the reason banks do n't run businesses is because there are plenty of private firms that compete with each other for business what 's the chance that a bank with all its bureaucracy can deliver cheaper apartments than an apartment developer pretty low in fact and that 's why they would rather lend to an apartment developer rather than building the apartments themselves banks are in the business of competing with other banks the main work they do is to sort out good investments from poor ones and if they can do that just a bit more efficiently than their competitors they make big bucks for example it might only take a few additional hours to better vet a deal worth millions whereas with an apartment building you would n't be able to make that amount of money per hour even if the materials and labor cost you nothing

in some cases it might be rational to pay low interest debt first because the consequences of defaulting on that debt are worse    consider this simplified example   suppose you have two debts a low interest mortgage secured by your house and a high interest unsecured credit card debt both of which are within a few years of being paid off   there is a chance that sometime between now and then something will happen to disrupt your income e.g. medical problems and it wo n't be possible to make the payments on either loan    defaulting on the credit card loan will result in a lower credit score and calls from collection agencies   defaulting on the mortgage will result in the foreclosure or forced sale of your house at best forcing you to move and at worst leaving you homeless at a time when you are also facing other e.g. medical problems   so you might rationally judge that losing your house is much worse than bad credit   therefore you might rationally conclude that it would be better to direct extra income toward paying down the mortgage to increase the chances that if and when an income disruption might occur the mortgage would already be paid off   in other words you shorten the window of time where income disruption results in foreclosure you might decide that this increased security is worth the extra interest you will pay compared to the strategy where you pay the high interest loan first this is a fairly special situation but you asked why might it be a good idea to do this and i am just giving an example where it could rationally be considered a good idea    of course in a real life version of this example there might be other options available such as refinancing the mortgage   if you like you could imagine a more extreme example where the lower interest debt is owed to the who will come and break your if you miss a payment

the lifetime limit would be very peculiar the question for the irs is whether this is a gift of some sorts which is why they become interested at some point in the us you as the would have to pay the taxes the bank might inquire too due to money laundering issues the bank will anyhow report transactions above a certain size to the irs as long as you are sending money to yourself you should be fine as this is clearly not a gift if you send it to 3rd person then this is either for a service in this case you need a bill or is a gift in which case you require to pay gift taxes

says who or is this just something you think makes sense because on first glance it does many studies show privatizing basic government functions like waste removal prisons etc to contractors ends up costing the government more   recent study that shows that its more expensive   specifically on government military private contractors via this link bottom of the page   steven   professor the george washington university law school expert on government contracting   i do n't think there 's any question that no one knows whether it 's cheaper or not one of the best studies we 've seen on whether outsourcing saves money is the rand study which is now a few years old and what the rand study says is there 's the potential for immense cost saving in outsourcing but it has n't been proven yet   there 's a number of studies since but there has not been a compelling case made that government outsourcing particularly this type of outsourcing saves money   full interview   he makes your point however that the savings is thought to come from savings in paying someone before and keeping them on payroll when we 're not in a military activity that requires their services no pension after no payroll before thus the increase in compensation is a lot higher however it does n't mean its conclusive to show that it money

gt there are plenty of people that consistently beat the market if the market were truly efficient then everyone should just passively invest which would make the market inefficient leading to active investment   passive investing   a. does n't mark the market less efficient i do n't know how you came to that conclusion   b. there is not a big group of people who consistently beat the markets there 's a tiny tiny sliver of a fraction of a portion of a group of people that beat the market over any ten year period which is consistent with pure randomness you 're statistically likely to say those kinds of anomalies in fact it 'd be stranger if we   c. the markets are n't truly efficient they ca n't there 's imperfect information the point is the potential exploits can not 1 be exploited on scale because that creates market efficiency and can not 2 be public because that also creates efficiency as more and more exploits are found we 're eliminating all these black if you compare all 400 professionally managed mutual funds only 2 have ever beaten the market and by less than 50 basis points that 's 0.5 that 's not even consistent with randomness that 's worse than random it goes to show how few and far between any potential exploits exist it 's simply not worth your time as an investor because if giant firms employing hundreds can not find them a handful of people wo n't be able to find them by anything other than chance it 's almost always better to passively invest   you can read more about this because while intuitively you may feel active investment can be better the numbers do n't lie and i promise you you 're very wrong

yes this is definitely possible you can optimize your credit worthiness within 18 months you would first start with a secured credit card just to establish a little bit of credit history and then use that as a jumping point 6 months later to do several unsecured credit card applications as a student your primary limiting factor will be your truthful income when you apply for the cards resulting in low limits where using less than 30 of those limits is not a useful amount of money your credit scores can be looked at as a spendable balance new inquiries spend some of that balance low utilization earns you more of the balance they will trend upwards with the right approach and you can use the balance at their highs to time more inquiries note my answers typically differ in that i narrowly tailor my answers to the question asked and do n't or acknowledge the idea of advice impulsive spenders with credit have bad credit i can live with that

when you sell a stock that you own you realize gains or losses short term gains realized within a year of buying and selling an asset are taxed at your maximum or marginal tax rate long term gains realized after a year are taxed at a lower preferential rate the first thing to consider is losses losses can be cancelled against gains reducing your tax liability losses can also be carried over to the next tax year and be redeemed against those gains when you own a bunch of the same type of stock bought at different times and prices you can choose which shares to sell this allows you to decide whether you realize short- or long term gains or losses this is known as lot matching or order matching you want to sell the shares that lost value before selling the ones that gained value booking losses reduces your taxes booking gains increases them if faced with a choice between booking short term and long term losses i 'd go with the former since net short term gains are taxed at a higher rate i 'd want to minimize the short term tax liability before moving on to long term tax liability if my remaining shares had gains i 'd sell the ones purchased earliest since long term gains are taxed at a lower rate and delaying the booking of gains converts short term gains into long term ones if there 's a formula for this i 'd say it 's   profit loss x tax bracket = tax paid

interest rates are market driven they tend to be based on the prime rate set by the federal reserve bank because of the tremendous lending capacity of that institution and that other loan originators will often fund their own lending at least in part with fed loans however there is no mandatory link between the federal reserve rate and the market rate no law stipulates that rates can not rise or fall they will rise and fall as lenders see necessary to use their capital though a lender asking 10 interest might make no loans when others are willing to lend for 9 the only protection you have is that we are mostly economically free as a borrower you are protected by the fact that there are many lenders likewise as a lender because there are many borrowers stability is simply by virtue of the fact that one market participant with inordinate pricing will find fewer counterparties to transact

you may also want to consider delaware and nevada as possible corporate homes   they are common choices for out of state corporations   you may find that they are better options    will earnings prior to forming the llc have to be claimed as self employment income if so would it be easier to wait until the next calendar year to form the llc earnings after forming the limited liability corporation llc will probably have to be claimed as self employment income   see how llc members are taxed for more discussion   in particular read the section on self employment taxes    the current rule is that any owner who works in or helps manage the business must pay this tax on his or her share rightful share of profits however owners who are not active in the llc that is those who have merely invested money but do n't provide services or make management decisions for the llc may be exempt from paying self employment taxes on their share of profits the regulations in this area are a bit complicated but if you actively manage or work in your llc you can expect to pay self employment tax on all llc profits allocated to you as i read it you actively work in the llc so it is unlikely that you can avoid paying self employment taxes   so it should n't make any difference when you officially start an llc   you 'll have to pay self employment taxes before and after creating the llc regardless    if you do n't want to pay self employment taxes you may want to consider forming a subchapter c corporation   they do n't have the same tax structure as subchapter s corporations or llcs   you would be paid some kind of wage salary or commission and the corporation would pay the employer 's side of the payroll taxes    note that subchapter s corporations and llcs exist because they usually pay less in tax than subchapter c corporations do   even including the self employment taxes that you owe    a cpa should be able to guide you in making these decisions and help you with setup    the one time that i started a corporation i just paid a few hundred dollars to a service and they filed the paperwork for me   that included state fees and notice costs   the cpa probably has a service association already

there still is some buying and selling to do in a passively managed fund   the stocks might pay dividends   if the fund manager did n't reinvest these dividends the fund would begin to accumulate a cash position which would cause it to stray from being an index fund   stocks come and go from an index as well if the fund is to maintain a composition that matches a particular index this must be taken into account as well the role of the manager is to ensure that the fund maintains the composition that it was intended to replicate   it does n't involve as much stock picking that active managers do   the manager has less leeway as to what s he buys and sells but there still is work involved

i think you 're on the wrong track   getting more and more samples from the real world does not make your backtest more accurate it just confirms that your strategy can withstand one particular sample path of a stochastic process the reason why you find it simple to incorporate fees commissions taxes etc is because they 're a static and constant process well they might change over time but most definitely uncorrelated to the markets modelling overnight returns or the top levels of the order book the next day is serious work   first you have to select a suitable model that 's mostly theoretical work but experience can help a lot   then in order to do it data driven you 'd have to through thousands of days of sample data on a set of thousands of instruments to get a feeling aka significant model parameters    data mining i think excel might be the wrong tool for the job   data even just the first 10 levels is a massive   for example the nyse historical data weighs in at a massive 15 tb compressed 74 tb for the last 10 years and costs usd 200k   anyway as for other factors to take into account so how to account for all this in a backtest   personally i would put in some penalty terms as on a return basis for every factor you want to consider do n't them   you can then run a stress test by exploring these parameters i.e. assign some values in the range of 0 to whatever fits   explore them individually only set one penalty term at a time to get a feeling how the strategy might react to stress from that factor   then you can run the backtest with typical or observed combinations of penalty factors and slowly stress them altogether edit just to avoid confusion about terminology   a backtest in the strict sense had i implemented this strategy x years ago what would have happened wo n't benefit from any modelling simply because the real world does the sampling for us however to evaluate a strategy 's you should account for the additional factors and run some stress tests   if the strategy performs well in the real world or no stress scenario but produces losses once a tiny slippage occurs every now and again you could conclude that the strategy is very fragile   the key is to explore the maximum stress the strategy can handle by whatever measure if a lot you can call the strategy robust the latter is what i personally call a backtest the first procedure would go by the name extension towards the past or so some lightweight literature

qe2 will mean that there are about $ 500 billion dollars in existence which were n't there before these dollars will all be competing with the existing dollars for real goods and services so each dollar will be worth a little less and prices will rise a little this is inflation you can probably expect annual inflation for the us dollar over the next several years the market certainly does in the aggregate anyway this is in terms of us based goods and services qe2 will also reduce the amount of other currencies you can get for the same dollar amount the extent to which this will occur is less clear in part because other currencies are also considering quantitative easing your long term savings should probably not be in cash anyway because of the low returns this will probably affect you far more than the impact of quantitative easing as for your savings which do remain in cash what you should do with them depends on how you plan to dispose of them the value of a currency is usually pretty stable in terms of the local economy 's output of goods and services it 's the value in international trade which tends to fluctuate wildly if you keep your savings in the same currency you plan to spend them in they should be able to maintain their value decently well in the intermediate term

at this particular time i would strongly suggest holding on and not bailing   i 've been following this sector pretty closely for 10 + years now   it has taken an absolute beating since 2011 up to 90 down in many areas and has been in a slow downward grind all year   given the cyclical nature of the markets you 're far far closer to a long term bottom and have a much better risk reward outlook now vs say four or even two years ago   personally i 'm planning on jumping into the sector heavily as soon as i see signs of a wash out desperation low where people like yourself start selling in panic and frustration   i may very likely start cost averaging into it even now although i personally feel we may get one more major bottom around the spring 2016 time frame coupled with a general market deflation scare which might surprise many by its severity   but at the same time the sector might turn up from here and not look back since i think many share my view and are just patiently waiting and with so many buyers waiting in support it may never crash hard    in any case i personally feel that we 're approaching the cheap buying opportunity of a lifetime in this sector within the next year precious metals miners that is base metals may still falter if the economy is still iffy and just look at the dry index as an indicator of world trade and productivity not looking so hot   if you 've suffered this long already and it is just a small portfolio portion just keep hanging in there   and by next summer if we get a confirmed panic low and a subsequent strong high volume consistent bounce pattern up past summer 2015 levels then i 'd start adding even more on dips and enjoy the ride

i 've got £ but the maximum house price is £ 450,000 what    happens to the £ 26,000 does it stay there with ~6 interest and no bonus of course and would be available when i retire at around 75 there would be about £ by then yes anything you do n't withdraw for your house purchase stays in the lifetime isa and keeps growing there also you do keep the bonus on it which was paid at the time you subscribed unless you make a withdrawal before age 60 after age 60 you can withdraw and keep the bonus note that you need to be buying with a mortgage to be allowed to use the lifetime isa money without penalty this is mentioned on the gov.uk website as well as in the actual regulations that establish lifetime isas search for first time residential purchase and look at clause 6 that would mean you 'd need to withdraw even less than the £ 450 k and artificially borrow the rest all that said i suspect the £ 450 k limit would be raised by given inflation can i buy a house and quickly sell it again to simply access the money the regulations say that on completion of the purchase you must occupy the land as their only or main residence there are a few exceptions such as if it 's still being built or if you are at the time posted abroad by the government but essentially you have to move in as soon as possible there 's no time limit stated in the regulations so in theory you could move in and then sell quite fast but personally i 'd be nervous about this being seen as not genuinely intending it to be my main residence in theory you could be prosecuted for fraud if you claimed a valid withdrawal when it was n't though given the wording of the regulations it looks like you 'd be complying with the letter of the law

one reason that a bond can be significantly less than face value is because people are seeking better investments elsewhere so for example if a bond does n't mature for another 10 years that 20 increase in face value is n't very attractive when compared to say leaving your money in the stock market for 10 years another reason could be that the credit worthiness of the issuer has collapsed and people expect that there is a fairly good chance they are not going to make the payment this could be what you would see if for example it was a one year time until maturity but it has a value of 40 of the face value there is a risk because they can simply not pay for example people who bought greek bonds

i think what you really want to look into is put options you can essentially replicate the same thing without worrying about margin calls check out this site a quick glance seems to show it to be pretty good   the way you would limit downside risk is to buy a put option allowing you to sell anytime within the next n months for the current price assuming american this will allow you to limit downside risk however potential profits do go down due to fees as another answer suggests this could be cost prohibitive this type of strategy is also known as a protective put if you wanted to be more refined you could use 's bands although you have to be looking for that specific outcome also due to complexity this can become a taxing in terms of time invested and risky if you are wrong investment either way i think you need to study payoff curves a little more

never trust a single source to give you a fair price especially if they are not in competition moreso if they know that 's the case   i would want to get a quote from at least one other broker in terms of what they feel they can sell the bonds for   and let them know they are not the only one you are getting a quote from   to start with you need information such as when is the last time a bond like the ones you have traded and what did it sell for also sources for where you can sell the bonds and more info on the entire subject the securities industry and financial markets association has a pretty helpful website called   i find it has a wealth of information and is relatively free of bias on the municipal markets at a glance page you can get history for various bonds if you have the pronounced que sip numbers for the bonds if these bonds are as good as the advisor is telling you they are then they should be selling for a premium and the recent sales history would reflect that   i 'd find one or two other potential sellers and get prices from each of them compare that against recent history and go with whichever one seems to be offering you the best deal in terms of choosing someone and how to go about selling bonds the same website has some excellent information and guidance on buying and selling bonds and how to choose an investment professional which includes how to check up on them to see if they have ever faced action etc   i would also consider any gains you might have to declare if you sell these for more than face value and if that would be taxable etc i would also question your too safe judgement   just because something is safe i would not necessarily throw it out   you need to look at the return relative to the risk and if you are not investing in a tax sheltered account the affect of taxes on your net return   if these are earning a really good return for fairly low risk they might be worth keeping especially if in today 's market you need to take substantially more risk to get a comparable return   taking more risk to get nearly the same return is n't very wise since an aspect of the risk is perhaps not getting any return or losing money    in a volatile market there can be a substantial benefit to having a lower risk foundation that you build upon with more risky investments in order to provide some risk diversity in your portfolio you might want to consider for example how these bonds have done over the last 13 years compared to a similar investment in the type of less safe vehicles you are considering   perhaps you 'd be better off just holding these to maturity instead of gambling on something with a lot more risk that could go south on you

insurance is for events that are both and unexpected and for many people catastrophic events are for example sickness disability death car accidents house fires and for which you may buy health disability life auto home and renter 's insurance   it may be catastrophic for a family relying on a very old earner for that earner to die and you can buy life insurance up to a very old age but the premiums will reflect the likelihood of someone of that age dying within the covered period   the more expected an event is the more anything referred to as insurance is actually forced savings health insurance with no copays on regular checkups expects the insured to use them so the cost of those checkups plus a profit for the insurance company is factored into the premiums ahead of time   a wooden pencil breaking may be unexpected regardless of no one buys insurance on wooden as the loss of a pencil is not catastrophic what is catastrophic can be context dependent health care needs are typically as you do n't know when you 'll get sick for a billionaire needing health care while the situation would not be catastrophic and the billionaire can easily self insure his or her health to the same extent as most caps offered by health insurance companies if you 're on a fixed budget buying a laptop if it unexpectedly failed that would be catastrophic to you so budgeting in the cost of insurance or an extended warranty while buying your laptop would probably make sense especially if you need that $ 2000 laptop spending an extra 17.5 would safeguard against you having to come out of pocket and depleting your savings to replace it even though that brings you to a grand total of $ before taxes however if you 're in that tight of a situation i would strongly recommend you to find a less expensive option that would allow you to self insure if you found a used laptop for much less i can even see apple selling macs for less than $ 1000 you might decide that your budget allows you to self insure and you could profit from being careful with your hardware and resolving to cover any issues with it yourself

okay yes that would seem to make sense so something like a local vol model    in the context of term structure modelling you can also incorporate a volatility surface into the pricing of european and even exotic options e.g. through a sabr or an sabr for exotics which i suppose means by your criteria there are actually varying degree of arbitrage free when it comes to picking a model by that i mean there are varying degrees of what your model takes as given if it takes the market price of risk as given it 's an equilibrium model if it takes the observed term structure as given it 's an arbitrage free model if it takes the volatility structure as given it 's something else   and wrote a paper called a new of the dynamic term structure models in the journal of investment management that basically coincides with what we 're saying   so yes it sounds right to me

i think this is possible under very special conditions   the important part of the description here is probably retired and rich   the answers so far apply to people with normal incomes both in the sense of not rich and in the sense of earned income if you sit at the top tax bracket and get most of your income through things like dividends then you might be able to win multiple ways with the strategy described   first you get the tax deduction on the mortgage interest which everyone has properly noted is not by itself a winning game you spend more than you save    but there are other factors especially for the rich and those whose income is mostly passive i 'm not motivated enough on the hypothetical situation to come up with a detailed example but i think it 's possible that this could work out   in any case the current answers using normal sized incomes and middle tax brackets do n't necessarily give the insight that you might hope if the tax payer really is unusually wealthy and retired

there is a difference between an owner and a signer an owner is the legal owner of the funds a signer has access to withdraw the funds in most cases when a new personal account is opened the name is added as an however that is not always the case a person could be an owner but not a signer in a custodial arrangement for example a minor child may be an owner only on their account with a custodial parent listed as a signer the minor could not withdraw from the account a person could be a signer but not an owner in a business or estate trust account the business or estate would be the owner with individuals listed as signers only the business employees do not own the funds they are only allowed to withdraw and disburse the funds on behalf of the company the creditor can only garnish withhold funds that are owned by the indebted if the second person on the account is only a signer those funds can not be withheld as part of a judgment against the second person they do n't own those funds however simply the second person as a signer only is not sufficient if you share access with the second person and allow them to spend the money for their own benefit they are no longer just a signer they have become an owner because you are sharing your funds with them think of the business relationship as an example the employee is a signer so they can withdraw funds and pay business expenses like the electric bill if the employee withdrew funds and bought herself a new dress she is stealing because she does not own those funds if the second person on the account buys things for themselves or transfers some of the money into their own account they are demonstrating that more than a signer only relationship exists a true signer only relationship is where the individual can only withdraw funds on the owner 's behalf for example the owner is out of town and needs a bill paid the signer can write a check and pay the bill for the owner a limited power of attorney may be worth looking into with a limited poa the owner can define the scope and expiration of the power of attorney with this arrangement the second person becomes an executor of the owner under certain circumstances for example you could write a power of attorney that states something like john smith is hereby granted the limited power to withdraw funds from account on deposit at bank for the purpose of paying debts and obligations and otherwise maintain my estate in the event of my or inability to attend to my own affairs this power of attorney shall expire on it 's fifth anniversary unless renewed if the person you have granted the power of attorney abuses their access you could sue them and you would only have to demonstrate that they the scope of their power

there are basically two ways to get value out of an appreciating asset such as a home a sell it and take the profit in the case of a home you presumably still have to live somewhere so unless you buy a cheaper home to replace it this does n't get you anywhere if you can get another house that is just as nice and in just as nice a location whatever you consider nice to be than this sounds like a winning option if it means moving to a less desirable home then you are getting the cash but losing the nice home you 'll have to decide if it 's worth it b use it as collateral for a loan in this case that means a second mortgage home equity loan or a home equity line of credit but this can be dangerous house prices are very volatile these days if the value of the house falls you could be stuck with debts greater than your assets in my humble opinion you should be very careful about doing this borrowing against your house to send the kids to college or pay for your spouse 's life saving operation may be reasonable borrowing against your house to go on a fancy vacation is almost surely a bad idea the vacation will be over within a couple of weeks but you could be paying off the debt for decades

i disagree sponsorship is the problem or more specifically where it comes from with of advertising what happens is that any small player with a keyboard can become a news source lowering the bar on what we consider news though this goes for all content really in turn this makes good content providers have far more competition and essentially lowers the bar for all sources because most people will not pay a premium for great content in the case of news how does a news agency with researchers fact checkers and overhead compete with a guy in his bedroom if clicks and eyeballs are the only source of comparison    the buying of content or native advertising as its being called is a direct byproduct of this slippery slope and the ultimate desire of each person or entity to be successful which in some cases means offering new this is nothing new but has just grown exponentially as the barriers to entry have all but been removed   at the end of the day this goes back to trust if consumers put a premium on trusted content and channels because they want something like facts vs. and echo chamber to reinforce a particular mindset then it would be a different situation free is what everyone one wants but they forget one important thing if your not paying for something then your not the consumer your probably the product obviously this in turn means it ’s less important to get the reader real content vs. content that will keep them on site just a little longer than their competitors for which they are rewarded   so going back to the millennials good for them for apparently being among the first group to collectively realize that they need to question everything and rely on their own research they are natives of the misinformation age

technically yes in most cases you 'll probably get all the amt you pay for exercising in the money incentive stock options isos credited back to you practically however inflation could significantly reduce the value of the money when you get it back remember you can only recover the differential between regular income tax and the tentative minimum tax each year depending on your situation that could be a few thousand dollars or less in which case $ 50k of amt credit would take a while to use up however as you point out if you end up selling your shares you 'll likely use up all your amt credit that year so yes you 'd probably get your $ 50k of amt back but a lot of people do n't have that much to tie up in taxes for an extended period of time

a stock insurance company is structured like a normal company it has shareholders that are the company 's investors who elect a board of directors who select the senior who manage the people who run the actual company the directors and thus the executives and employees have a legal responsibility to manage the company in a way which is beneficial for the shareholders since the shareholders are the ultimate owner of the company a mutual insurance company is similar except that the people holding policies are also the shareholders that is the policyholders are the ultimate owners of the company and there generally are n't separate shareholders who are just investing in the company these shareholders elect the board of directors who select the senior who manage the people who run the actual company in practice it probably does n't really make a whole lot of difference since even if you 're just a customer and not an owner of the company the company is still going to want to attract customers and act in a reasonable way toward them also insurance companies are generally pretty heavily regulated in terms of what they can do because governments really like them to remain solvent it may be comforting to know that in a mutual insurance company the higher ups are explicitly supposed to be working in your best interest though rather than in the interest of some random investors some might object that being a shareholder may not give you a whole lot more rights than you had before see for example this article from the boston globe at mutual insurance firms big money for insiders but no say for policyholders it has grown into something else entirely an opaque poorly understood and often immensely profitable world in which some executives and insiders operate with minimal scrutiny and no coincidence often reap maximum personal rewards policyholders despite their status as owners have no meaningful oversight of how mutual companies spend their money whether to lower rates pay dividends or fund executive salaries and perks and few avenues to challenge such decisions another reason that one might not like the conversion is the specific details of how the current investor shareholders are being paid back for their investment in the process of the conversion to mutual ownership and what that might do to the funds on hand that are supposed to be there to keep the firm solvent for the policyholders from another boston globe article on the conversion of sbli to a mutual company insurer sbli wants to get banks out of its business professor robert wright is cautiously optimistic but wants to ensure the prior shareholders are n't overpaid robert wright a professor in south dakota who has studied insurance companies and owns an sbli policy said he would prefer the insurer to be a mutual company that does n’t have to worry about the short term needs of shareholders but he wants to ensure that sbli does n’t overpay the banks for their shares it ’s fine as long as it ’s a fair price he said that article also gives sbli 's president 's statement as to why they think it 's a good thing for policyholders if the banks remained shareholders they would be likely to demand a greater share of the profits and eat into the dividends the insurance company currently pays to the policyholders about half of whom live in massachusetts said jim morgan president of based sbli we ’re trying to protect the policyholders from having the dividends diluted morgan said i 'm not sure there 's an obvious pros cons list for either way but i 'd think that i 'd prefer the mutual approach just on the principle that the policyholders ought to be the owners because the directors and thus the executives and employees are then legally required to manage the company in the best interest of the policyholders i did cast a yes vote in my proxy on whether sbli ought to become a mutual company i 'm a sbli term life but policy terms are n't changing and it 'd be hard to tell for sure how it 'd impact any dividends i assume the whole life policies must be the ones to pay dividends or company solvency either way since it 's not like we 'll get to run a scientific experiment trying it out both ways i doubt you 'd have a lot of regrets either way whether it becomes a mutual company and you wish it had n't or it does n't become one and you wish it had

not an amazon fanboy by any means but part of their philosophy is basically that if we do n't sell low somebody else will the low prices and service are the advertising and the volume helps them push efficiencies further there is n't anything stopping them from raising prices but its sort of runs counter to their whole business mantra

it 's not a withholding tax it 's a withholding tax amount that is they are not taxing you but they are holding back some of your withdrawal and sending it to the government to cover any taxes you will need to pay on the withdrawal same as your employer withholds some of your salary and sends it to the government for you you wo n't claim it as a deduction but it will go at the end along with tax withheld from your salary or anything else so if you owe $ 10,000 of tax but various entities have already sent the government $ 11,000 on your behalf you will get a $ 1,000 refund

one of the more subtle disadvantages to large credit card purposes purchases besides what the other answer mentions is that it makes you less prepared for emergencies if you carry a large balance on your credit card with the idea that your income can easily handle the payments to beat the no interest period you never know when you 'll have an unexpected emergency and you 'll end up having to pay less miss the deadline and end up paying huge interest even if you are about saving and budgeting what if your family comes under a large financial burden just as one possible example

you are n't getting a straight answer because nobody knows why those regulations are the way they are everyone has to give this information to open the brokerage account or for any access to the us financial system whether it is with a bank account or a brokerage account everyone also typically gives this information to their employer to be employed at all for irs regulations the sec is n't going to do anything with the data unless you do something illegal related to the stock market then they will know who you are the irs is n't going to do anything with the data unless you are in paying taxes then they will know who you are

there is a large market where notes bills bonds are traded so yes you can sell them later   however if interest rates go up the value of any bond that you want to sell goes down because you now have to compete with what someone can get on a new issue so you need to discount the principal value of your bond in order for someone to want to buy it instead of a new bond that has a higher interest rate the reverse applies if interest rates fall although it 's hard to get much lower than they are now   so someone wanting to make money in bonds due to interest rate changes generally wants to buy at higher interest rates and then sell their bonds after rates have gone down   see my answer in this question for more detail why does interest rate go up when bond price goes down to answer is that good the answer depends on perspective

bhp has room to answer as commodities debt notes in part there has been speculation that the company could cut its shareholder    dividend while capital analyst richard has suggested    bhp might look to raise as much as $ billion $ billion in    new equity capital if the dividend is cut you wo n't see 11 and the share price may well decline further there is a possibility of big losses here given the change in the prices of the products the company sells to add from another source the only reason bhp trades on a yield of more than 8 is because the    market is pricing in a cut to the dividend according to consensus    earnings estimates for 2016 and 2017 earnings per share will be $    and $ respectively dividends per share forecasts are $ and    $ respectively

gt you know there is a heading in big bold text that says my budding product empire that conveniently links to actual products that make money for said author   it 's 2/3 of the way down the page in the same colour and format as the rest of the text it 's very poorly displayed any product or service should be prominently featured   gt i think you have a problem with the whole way the author markets herself but i obviously it works   that 's not obvious no anyone can make vague boasts about how much money they make especially if those claims are aimed at attracting more business the ones who brag the loudest are usually the ones with the biggest shortfall to make up   gt also i do n't feel like it 's bragging it 's more like sharing the wealth    sharing what wealth as i said anyone can make hollow claims about how much money they make it all sounds too much like those self help books

you can see some irs info on distinguishing a business from a hobby here   nolo also has some info the upshot is that you can only deduct losses if your activity is in the judgement of the irs a for profit endeavor   you do n't have to make a profit right away or make a profit every year for it to be a for profit endeavor but you have to be able to convince the irs that you 're doing it in order to eventually make a profit not just for fun   you ca n't just keep deducting the losses year after year if as in the worst case you suggest it never makes a profit and does n't seem to have any chance of doing so

a government is there to serve the people under this logic a government is doing a disservice to its people by allowing a to have a lower tax rate in relation to the value a would gain from doing business in that country    for all i know starbucks would only do business in the uk if the value it sees from doing business there is at the tax rate it is paying out now however like a testing the markets for price the uk government is doing a disservice to its own people for not doing its own research on the value starbucks is seeing

look here 's a graph of the s&p 500 it 's up 1200 since the start of the 70 's our late recession notwithstanding you 're not going to get that kind of return on bonds or commodities or savings accounts maybe real estate stands a chance if your real estate was n't in say detroit it 's not as easy to diversify real estate people in their 20 's who have plenty of time before they need to spend their retirement money invest in the stock market exactly because they 're long term and can withstand these dips just by waiting them out and earn a ton of money people approaching their 60 's transition their portfolio to bonds so that a market crash wo n't wipe them out

if i buy vusa from one exchange can i sell it in a different exchange assuming my brokerage account lets me trade in both exchanges or is it somehow tied to the exchange i bought it from this does n't happen for all securities and between all stock exchanges so that is dependent on broker and country i checked for vusa with they categorically refused allowing me to trade in vusa in different exchanges i can only buy and sell in same currency only albeit in the same exchange where i from should be the same behaviour for all brokers for us mere mortals if you are a bank or a millionaire than that might be a different question   the vusa you quote is quoted in gbp in lse and in eur in and the etf has been created by an irish entity and has an irish isin   as chris mentioned below happens between us and canadian exchanges but not sure it happens across all exchanges you can not deal in inter listed stocks in lse and nyse since it 's the same asset its value should not vary across exchanges once you compensate for exchange rates right yes else it opens up itself for arbitrage profit without any risk which everybody wants so even if any such instance occurs either people will exploit it to make the arbitrage profit zero security reflects the equilibrium price or the profit from such transaction is so less compared with the effort involved that people will tend to ignore it anyways arbitrage profit is very difficult to garner nowadays considering the super computers at work in the market who exploit these discrepancies the moment they see them and bring the security right to the zero arbitrage profit point if there 's no currency risk because of 2 what other factors should i consider when choosing an exchange to trade in liquidity something else time difference by the time you wake up to trade in japan the japanese markets would have closed tax implications across multiple continents law of the land providing protection to investors finding a broker dealing in markets you want to explore or dealing with multiple brokers regulatory headaches

fyi during the housing boom here in the us many people spoke about ever increasing home prices   many thought home prices could never go down   until they did if it seems like it is impossible for home prices to continue to go up then they probably will stop going up at some point although the rising prices can continue for a lot longer than you think possible i 'm wondering if malaysia is feeling the effects of the us fed which flooded the market with us dollars after the crisis   the malaysian central bank holds us dollars as its foreign exchange reserves   in order to keep the from rising against the dollar the malaysian central bank will print up to purchase dollars which the value of the   this has the effect of artificially lowering interest rates as become readily available leading to a boom the boom being in real estate   just a hunch is the in getting much attention in malaysia   this is starting to make a little news here

yes you can use a post office box as a business address but not as an address for your registered agent   using your home address as the address of the business does not to my knowledge create a legal issue if you are sued   your home is a personal asset not one that belongs to the llc so it would not be subject to seizure or forfeiture as part of any lawsuit against the business itself every state requires an llc or corporation to have a registered agent which according to wikipedia is in united states business law a registered agent also known as a resident agent or statutory agent is a business or individual designated to receive service of process when a business entity is a party in a legal action such as a lawsuit or summons you can be your own registered agent if you like   companies that provide incorporation services will usually offer to act as a registered agent for your new business for a fee but it 's really no big deal i would recommend that you go to the web site section about forming an llc and take a look at their resources to help you through this   you need to do it right so understand what you need to do for the state you live in and take your time   if you rush it and screw it up then you might regret it later i hope this helps good luck

they help fund road projects that would otherwise require an increase in the fuel tax a large enough project like a new limited access will cost hundreds of millions to construct so they float some bonds that will be paid off with toll revenue lots of times after the bonds have been paid off the state has the options to remove the toll and put the road back   in the pool with all the other roads of course governments very rarely voluntarily a revenue stream   for example here in georgia we only have one toll road wiki in atlanta despite having 10 million residents how do you justify increasing fuel taxes on residents hundreds of miles away on the coast for a transportation project that only benefits atlanta commuters you can not thus tolls

it 's extra work for you to purchase a vehicle that has an outstanding lien on it it 's not uncommon but there are things to take care of and watch out for really all it means is that the vehicle you 're trying to purchase has n't been paid for in full by the current owner where things can get dodgy is ensuring that all outstanding debts are paid against the vehicle at the time you take ownership of it otherwise the owners of those debts could still reclaim the vehicle   here 's a good article about making this kind of purchase

the big difference for me under the high deductible plan has been that instead of paying the co pay now i am now responsible for the negotiated rate until i reach the deductible limit the hsa is only a way to funnel medical payments through a tax free account the insurance company and the doctor do n't care about the hsa if we go out of network then i am responsible for the full rate but they only count the negotiated rate as a credit against the out of pocket deductible this big difference makes it very important to pick a doctor in network for your example i would have paid $ 50 under the ppo but $ 200 under the high plan if i go out of network i would have to pay whatever the doctor want me to pay but the insurance company would only credit me $ 200 against my deductible i can pull the extra $ 350 from the hsa it is hard to get good pricing information from some doctors but the price difference for me has been so large that in network is the only way to go for prescriptions the high deductible plan has been worse because we pay the full price with no discounts for the medicine until we reach the plan deductible that makes the cost of the prescriptions as much as 10x 's more expensive in fact the annual cost of our prescriptions all but guarantees that we hit the deductible each year

i disagree   first off the sec is under funded anyhow and most economists agree that there needs to be better regulation of the exchanges ya know since it can fucking crash our economy and send us into   secondly it 's a flat transaction tax much like any other state sales tax   state sales tax is arguably the most successful form of taxation there is b c it 's so damn easy to implement and so damn easy to audit   you 're blowing this thing way out of proportion   they require the markets to charge a transaction tax and then they do periodic audits to ensure each exchange is doing it   the rates go up or down based on the previous quarters number of hfts   outside of said formula this transaction rate can be altered by a meeting of a few sec heads and approved when approved by the appropriate congressional body   kills 2 birds with one stone   more money to the underfunded sec lessens the impact of hfts and turns the markets back into a market instead of a casino   it will have minimal effects on buy amp hold traders since they typically research for a long time then buy amp hold stock for many months     it will mainly affect those who buy amp unload several times per day     ps   if you think that letting a market die and having new ones pop up periodically is a good idea then holy shit   financial markets need stability amp regulation   finance does n't like uncertainty   crash amp burn marketplaces will help no one and will raise uncertainty which we all know investors hate

and how is that even an argument    so the fed needs to raise rates is what you seem to be saying i 'm not sure that now is the time for that considering the weak jobs numbers recently but it 's possibly a good idea for them to announce that a hike will come soon instead of actually raising the rate    either way to say that having a low interest rate for a decade is a bad thing sort of a harsh reality it 's certainly not something that you want but what 's the alternative would the us have been better off without the feds balance sheet expansion very few economists would say yes    in fact that exact line of thought likely turned a financial crash into the great depression of the 30 's
