keep in mind that many checks are being cashed via scanner or photo these can be home based business based or atm based systems the key requirement is that the software has to be able to distinguish the written parts from the background parts if the image does n't have enough contrast for the edge detection to work the check ca n't be easily processed in that case a human looks at the image and the image and processes the transaction the image is not in color   many businesses scan the check and hand the original back to you after having the point of sale system process the image post 2001 the checks in the united states are no longer moved through the banking system only their images with the roll out of these image based systems in the future almost no physical checks will be seen by banks therefore the actual ink color is not important only the result

it seems you understand the risks it seems like a fine enough idea   hopefully it works out for you however you may want to talk to a few local banks about getting a short term home equity loan   i know someone who was able to do this getting a very low rate for 7 years   at the time of the loan the prevailing rate for a 15 year was 3.25 but they were able to get the at 2.6 fixed   there was no closing costs the best part about it was the payment was not that much more   while going from to is a 50 increase it was not that much in dollars in relationship to his household income    note that i did not say home equity line of credit which are rates and amount borrowed

yes there are a lot of places you can research stocks online google finance yahoo finance reuters etc it 's important to understand that the price of the stock does n't actually mean anything   share price is just a function of the market capitalization divided by the number of shares outstanding   as an example take two companies that are both worth $ 1 million but company a has issued 10,000 shares and company b has issued 100,000 shares   company a has a share price of $ 100 while company b has a share price of just $ 10   comparing share price does nothing to indicate the relative value or health of company a versus company b.    i know there are supposed to be no product recommendations but the dictionary area of investopedia.com is a good source of beginner investing information   and as joe points out below the questions here with the stock tag would also be a good place to start   and while i 'm on a roll the book a random walk down wall street is a good starting point in investing in the stock market

there s some major logic missing from this report it did nt mention how technology is disrupting how everything is being distributed as businesses become more efficient with technological advances and less dependent on human capital then so must humans become more efficient and less dependent upon an expected level of income what s the demand to keep a human alive and well versus the demand for needing a well paid human laborer if you are easily then your value to the company is simply cheap labor best example is walmart the wealthiest family the largest employer whose many employees require gov assistance to live due to low wages the only way this business could even exist is with from the goverment to support its workers so where do these tax subsidies come from the article responded with a great point there will never be piles and piles of valuable goods laying around with no one to enjoy them whoever said that has never been to walmart with no money i suppose there will always be someone around to enjoy them but will there also be less and less people who can afford to enjoy such things walmart has already shown what happens this article points out the old ways of doing things economically but ignores the fact technology creates abundance not scarcity were not currently using that abundance to directly improve humanity on a large scale level but rather the opposite to control supply or scarcity aka profits when the demand to maintain amp control financial power the desire to care amp provide for your neighbor then the rise of inequality and options appear this buying power is the component of influence to being able to survive very well or simply even remain alive if my daily wage does nt provide for my daily needs then how can i use technology to stay alive how efficient can we all become before we start to share in the abundance of life together

i did a rough model and in terms of total $ $ paid interest + penalty alternative investment income both options are almost the same with the paying it all upfront being perhaps a $ 300 or so better $ vs $ however that does n't factor in inflation or tax considerations personally i 'd go with the no penalty scenario since you have more flexibility and can adjust along the way if anything else comes up in the meantime

the ownership of the house depends on what the original deed transferring title at the time of purchase says and how this ownership is listed in government records where the title transfer deed is registered hopefully the   two records are consistent   in legal systems that from british common law including the us the two most common forms of ownership are tenancy in common meaning that unless otherwise specified in the title deed each of the owners has an equal share in the entire property and can sell or his her share without requiring the approval   of the others and joint tenancy with right of survivorship meaning   that all owners have equal share and if one owner   dies the survivors form a new spouses generally own property   especially the home in a special kind of called tenancy by the entirety on the other hand the rule is that unless explicitly specified otherwise tenancy in common with equal shares is how the owners hold the property other countries may have different default assumptions and/or have multiple other forms of ownership see e.g. here for the intricate rules applicable in india mortgages are a different issue most mortgages state that the are jointly and liable for the mortgage   payments meaning that the mortgage holder does not care who makes the payment but only that the mortgage payment is made in full if one owner refuses to pay his share the others can not send in their shares of the mortgage payment due and tell the bank to sue the co owner for his share of the payment everybody is liable and can be sued for the unpaid amount and if the bank forecloses everybody 's share in the property is seized not just the share owned by the person   it is of course possible to for different co owners to have separate mortgages for their individual shares but the legalities including questions such as whose lien is primary and whose secondary are complicated with regard to who paid what over the years of ownership it does not matter as far as the ownership is concerned if it is a tenancy in common with equal shares the fact that the various owners paid the bills mortgage payments property taxes repairs and maintenance in unequal amounts does not   change the ownership of the property unless a new deed is recorded with the new percentages   now the co owners may decide among themselves as a matter of fairness that any money realized from a sale of the property should be divided up in accordance with the proportion that each contributed during the ownership but that is a different issue if i were a buyer of property titled as tenancy in common i or the bank who is lending me money to make the purchase would issue separate checks to each co seller in proportion to the percentages listed on the deed of ownership and let them worry about whether they should transfer money among themselves to make it equitable careful here gift taxes might   well be due if large sums of money change hands

the short answer is that you can use student loans for living expenses   joe provides a nice of loans   i would just add that some loans are not only guaranteed but also subsidized   essentially the government buys down the rate of the loan the mechanics are that a financial aid package might consist of grants work study job subsidized and guaranteed loans   one can turn down one or more of the elements of the package   all will be limited in some form the work study will have a maximum number of hours and generally has low pay   many find better deals working in the businesses surrounding the college or starting their own services type business   the grants rarely cover the full cost of tuition and books   the loans will both be limited in amount   it mainly depends on what you qualify for and generally speaking the lower the income the more aid one qualifies for now some students use all their grant all their loan money and buy things that are not necessary   for example are you going to live in the $ dorm or the new fancy apartments that are running $ 800/month   are you going to use the student loan money to buy a car   will it be a new bmw or a 8 year old i see this first hand as i live near a large university   the pubs are filled with college students not working but drinking and eating every night   many of them drive very fancy cars the most onerous example of this is students at the military   attendees have their books and tuition completely paid for   they also receive a stipend and more money can be earned over the summer   they also all qualify for a 35 k student loan in their junior year   just about every kid takes this loan   most of those use the money to buy a car   i know a young lady who did exactly that and so did many of her friends so kids with a starting pay of 45 k also start life with a   buying a nice car in the military is especially silly as they can not drive it while deployed and they are very likely to be deployed   at least however they are guaranteed a starting job with a nice starting pay and upward potential college kids who behave similarly might not have it as good   will they even find work   will the job have the ability to move up   how much security is in the job   one might say that this does not apply to engineers and such but i am working with a fellow with a computer science degree who can not find a job and has not worked in the past 6 months   this even though the market is super hot right now for computer engineers so in a word be very careful what you borrow

first off your commitment to paying down debt and apparent strong relationship with your brother is admirable however i think you are your situation and potentially your relationship by attempting to combine debts in this way you could consider a simple example where you have interest bearing at 5 and your brother has interest bearing debt at 10 if you both pay down his higher interest debt first and then both pay down your debt after then clearly you will have paid less interest combined but by waiting to pay off your debt until later you have accrued more interest yourself so who has saved money by doing this your brother you will have paid let 's say without getting into balances $ 50 extra interest to save your brother $ 70 in interest so why would you want to give your brother $ 50 total interest savings between both of you in this simplified example are $ 20 so in theory your brother could pay you $ 60 after the fact effectively meaning you end up $ 10 ahead and your brother ends up $ 10 ahead here you end up in a position where you could still say in theory we both came out ahead but what if your brother loses his job while you 're both paying off your debt and he ca n't help any more does he accrue some type of calculated interest until he pays you back what if he 's off work for 2 years and still owes you 30k what if he just never makes his payments to you on time at what point do you resent your brother for failing to uphold his end of the deal money and friends do n't mix money and family mixes even worse in rare circumstances where you absolutely must mix family and money get everything in writing get it signed make it legal outline all details of the transaction including interest rates and examples of how the balances calculate in 5 years when things go following the letter of the law is what will keep you from becoming enemies but with family often people have an expectation that while we agreed i would pay x he 's my brother so he should take pity on me and allow me to pay only y if i need to finally to your question about how to calculate amounts to pay it will be very complicated you will need to track minimum balance payments interest rates and even potentially the lost income which one of you gives up to pay down the other 's debt you could do these things in a simplified way close to what i 've set out above but then ultimately one of you will lose out if you pay down your debts first how can you calculate the lost living potential for your brother who might want to buy a house but ca n't save for a down payment for an extra year what if he has to move and without sufficient down payment he needs to pay extra mortgage insurance on his loan from the bank will you compensate him for that my recommendation if you have n't caught it yet is do not do this your potential savings are not going to be worth the potential of breaking your relationship with your brother   instead look at joining your minds not your money set goals for yourselves individually and hold each other accountable make this an open conversation between yourselves as it can be difficult to talk about finances with other people your support will help the other person and hopefully help keep you on track as well to provide numerical context for potential savings which you appear to still want consider the numbers you 've provided you have 40k debt at 10 your brother has 20k of debt at 5 let 's assume you each can pay up to 20k against the principal of your loans each year finally assume for simplicity that you also have enough to pay off interest as it gets charged so no compounding and you pay in even instalments each year mathematically that means your interest each year is equal to your interest rate your average annual balance if you each go alone then you will accrue 10 on an average balance of = 30k per year which equals 3,000 in interest in year 1 then = 10k .10 = 1,000 interest in year 2 total interest for you = 4,000 your brother will accrue = 10k .05 = 500 in interest in total total interest for both of you combined would be 4,500 if you pool your debt snowball then you will clear your debt first so the interest on your debt would be = 20k .1 = 2,000 your brother 's debt would fully accrue 5 of interest on the full balance in year 1 so interest in year 1 would be 20k .05 = 1,000 in year 2 your brother 's debt would be cleared half way through the year interest charged would be = 10k .05 50 = 250 you would then owe your brother 10k which you would pay him over the remainder of year 2 his total interest paid to the bank would be 1,000 + 250 = 1,250 total interest for both of you combined would be   in a simplified payment example using your numbers maximum interest savings would be about $ 1,250 combined how you allocate those savings would be pretty subjective assuming a 50:50 split this yields $ in savings to each of you if you are n't able to each save 20k per year then savings would be greater for snowballing because otherwise it will take you even longer to pay off your high interest debt this is similar to your brother loaning you 20k today that you can use to pay off your debts after which you pay him back so he can pay off his because you will owe him 20k for 2 years but an average of at any one time because he slowly advances it to you today and you slowly pay him back until the end of year 2 at $ 650 in benefit passed to your brother this is roughly equivalent to him loaning you money at 6.5 interest

not sure how this has got this far with no obvious discussion about the huge tax advantages of share buy backs vs dividend paying   companies face a very simple choice with excess capital pay to shareholders in the form of a taxable dividend invest in future growth where they expect to make more than $ 1 for every $ 1 invested or buy back the equivalent amount of stock on the market thus concentrating the value of each share the equivalent amount with no tax issues of these dividends are often by far the worst choice virtually all sane shareholders would just rather the company put the capital to work or concentrate the value of their shares by taking many off the market rather than paying a taxable dividend

gt if you have five to eight dictators fighting at once    you will quickly see these 5 to 8 dictators mutually come to the conclusion that it is not in their interests to fight it out but rather support each other and prevent new or you will see mergers as we saw in the accounting and banking fields you both knock out a competitor and increase your market share in the process    this becomes similar to a government sanctioned monopoly but instead of one firm you have 6 or 8 each recognizing that they 've got a great position as gatekeepers and rent seekers    this is similar to how the healthcare and insurance companies really do n't do very much except extract money they over bill the hospitals then over bill the customers and profit the huge margins   or how the government used to do student loans then instead outsourced to the big banks to do it then recently they determined that big banks were taking tens of billions of dollars in profit for running the program that 's tens of billions of dollars of wealth simply extracted from our taxes    this is why the government under obama decided to kick out the banker middle men and simply issue the exact same loans with the exact same rules a ll by themselves why outsource to a middleman when you can run the exact same program with tons less overhead   it 's also the reason single payer healthcare is tons more efficient over the current model and would save our country trillions over the term    not to mention the of currency you envision is truly a mirage the firms the government chooses as suited enough to pay taxes basically means the government still has the final decision on which currency bonds to accept what if the government then decides only one corp is suited to do this job or only two then it 's functionally no different than teh current situation    right now the world buys usd bonds at extremely low interest rates and this helps fund our government and keeps our nations costs very low under your scenario the government is saying we accept bonds from x y or z and so instead the world runs out to buy xyz bonds at extremely low interest rates   instead of giving our country the funding it needs we 're actually giving xyz corps the low interest rates   this is basically the same downfall of letting the big banks run the student loan program   it gives the firms more power the government less power costs us more tax dollars and gives those firms an undeserved higher place on the food chain    i quite simply disagree with it i would rather our government print the bonds themselves and take the benefit of the low cost of borrowing rather than giving xyz corps more favorable funding to continue world wide expansion and takeover    furthermore if xyz corps are approved by the government for paying tax dollars what do we do in the case of a fiscal emergency such as 2007 when aig basically went bankrupt in a period of only a few months of course this would be sure to happen only right after tax day after the entire country buys aig bonds pays the government in aig bonds and the executives of aig pay themselves huge bonuses then they go bankrupt and the government is left holding all the iou 's which are worthless    and of course traders goldman sachs etc would all know aig was about to get fucked and would make trillions while the us gov received all tax receipts in worthless paper   the fact is with the speed big companies can fall down under the weight of their own the danger is all too real that a full year of tax receipts simply disappears

thanks for your additional comments sam that is helpful here is an overview of what you can and can not do with an fsa as it applies to your situation the government intends that a general health fsa be used to cover expenses that are usually out of pocket when you are covered by a qualifying health plan it is funded with pre tax dollars and is on a use it or lose it basis however an hsa is itself a form of health coverage that is tax advantaged and the balance can be invested because of this an hsa is not considered by the government to be a health plan that qualifies for use with a general health fsa however this means that a given covered person can not have both of these simultaneously in your wife 's case if you have an hsa and she has traditional health benefits with an fsa this is not considered a problem since she can only use the fsa money for expenses incurred by members of your family on her plan however if she were to join you on the hsa which sounds like it could be a good idea overall she would need to wind down her fsa and would not be able to fund it for the next year this could be a problem if you have a lot of money in the fsa that she is n't able to spend prior to joining the hsa the reason why the government does n't want one given person covered by both an hsa and given access to an fsa at the same time is that they are both tax advantaged what they intend is that people can set aside money pre tax which they will use to pay their non covered health expenses if someone had both there would be two potential problems if you do ultimately want your wife to be on the hsa see if you can spend what is left in her fsa as it will end when she ends her health coverage with her employer if the amount you stand to lose is significant you may need to wait another year until your next open enrollment period or life event such as the birth of a child to enroll her on your hsa it is also likely that her premium on the hsa will be lower which could impact the effect of ending her fsa recently there has also been a rule change regarding what is called a limited use fsa these are fsas that are used for qualifying expenses such as dental and vision that can be used together with an hsa this may be something that is helpful to you and/or your wife on the hsa if your employer offers this as a possibility please note that unlike retirement accounts you can not rollover funds between fsa plans offered by two different employers as each fsa is a separate benefit fund that is on a use it or lose it basis again because the government wants to restrict tax advantaged contributions to what you are likely to spend you may also find the article here helpful to learn more about fsa hsa combinations and limited use fsas i hope this helps

i do this often and have never had a problem   my broker is td ameritrade and they sent several emails and even called and left a message the week of expiry to remind me i had in the money options that would be expiring soon their policy is to automatically exercise all options that are at least $ .01 in the money   one email was vaguely worded but it implied that they could liquidate other positions to raise money to exercise the options   i would have called to clarify but i had no intention of exercising and knew i would sell them before expiry in general though much like with margin calls you should avoid being in the position where the broker needs to or can do anything with your account as a quick aside   i ca n't think of a scenario where you would n't be able to sell your options but you probably are aware of the huge spreads that exist for many illiquid options   you 'll be able to sell them but if you 're desperate you may have to sell at the bid price which can be significantly 25 lower than the ask   i 've found this to be common for options of even very liquid underlyings   so personally i find myself adjusting my limit price quite often near expiry   if the quote is say 3.00 i 'll try to sell with a limit of and hope someone takes my offer   if the price is not moving up and nobody is biting move down to 3.20 etc in general you should definitely talk to your broker like others have suggested   you may be able to request that they sell the options and not attempt to exercise them at the expense of other positions you have

andrew has a likely scenario for when greece defaults on its sovereign debt what happens when greece defaults    here are a few things every bank in greece will instantly go insolvent the greek government will every bank in greece the greek government will forbid withdrawals from greek banks to prevent greek depositors from rioting on the streets    when the    president had to flee by    helicopter from the roof of the    presidential to evade a mob of    such depositors the greek government    will declare a perhaps even    general martial law greece will all its debts into new drachmas or whatever    it calls the new currency this is a    classic ploy of countries defaulting the new drachma will devalue by some 30 70 per cent probably around 50 per    cent though perhaps more    effectively defaulting 50 per cent    or more of all greek euro denominated    debts as says there 's more at the link all depressing i think you 're focusing too much on greece leaving the euro and not enough on why greece would leave the euro greece would leave the euro precisely so that it could pay back its debt in a new currency worth less than valuable euros the new currency will devalue since that 's the point of leaving along the way the government forces its citizens to take the new currency the money they have in greek banks will be converted to the new currency the citizens do n't have a choice to keep their euros

is it true that due the to the increase in interest rates that inflation is likely to increase as well it is typically the reverse where inflation causes interest rates to rise interest rates fundamentally reflect the desire for people to purchase future goods over present day goods   if i loan money to someone for 5 years i lose the ability to use that money   in order to entice me to loan the money the borrower would have to offer me an incentive that is they would have to give me additional money at the end of that 5 years   this additional money is the interest rate and it reflects the desire of people to spend money in the future versus the present day   if offered the same amount of money today versus 5 years from now almost everyone would chose to take the money now   money in the present is more valuable than the same amount of money in the future interest rates would still exist even with a currency that could not be printed i would still prefer to have the currency today than in the future if the currency is continually devalued i.e. the issuer is printing more of the currency than borrowers may charge additional interest to compensate for the loss in purchasing power when they make a loan also it is hard to compare interest rates and inflation   inflation is very difficult to calculate new products and services as well as ever changing consumer desires continually change the mixture of goods in the market so it is nearly impossible to compare a basket of goods today to a basket of goods 5 10 20 or 30 years ago

a paper ee series us savings bond is what is called a zero coupon bond you buy it at a discount from the face value 50 discount for us savings bonds and it earns interest though you do n't get the interest as cash that you could invest elsewhere instead the interest earned increases the   redemption value of the bond the money that you will receive if you take the bond to your bank to cash it in before the maturity date when the bond finally matures its redemption value has increased to the full face value   the maturity date for paper ee series us savings bonds issued in may 1995 is 17 years now with zero coupon bonds in general the irs requires that the interest earned each year be reported as interest income even though you did not receive any cash income and tax is due on the interest unless it is a tax free municipal bond or the bond is held in a tax deferred investment such as an ira or 401(k plan however there is a special exemption for ee series us savings bonds in that the owner has the option of not declaring the interest each year but instead reporting all the accumulated interest as interest income in the year of redemption most people choose this option it is not capital gains as you would like to be    so if your grandfather paid $ for ee series us savings bonds in may 1995 the face value of the bonds he received was $ 22 k and assuming that your grandfather followed typical practice the bonds were worth $ 22 k in may 2012 and $ 11 k interest income needed to be declared that year   this matches up pretty well with the amount the irs told him was interest income on which he had to pay income tax though the year is off by 3   now your grandfather died in 2008 and what happened to the bonds depends on in whose the bonds were registered e.g. was your father named as the survivor on the bond or if your grandfather was the sole owner how your grandfather 's estate was handled the interest accrued till your grandfather died belonged to the estate note also that ee series bonds continue to earn interest in years 18 through 30 after they mature but at maturity the interest rate is reset by the treasury usually to the long term interest rate which has been very small over the past many years so the interest earned in 2012 2015 when your father effectively redeemed the bond is small enough that the approximately $ 11 k could be construed as covering $ k consisting of $ 11 k of interest before maturity and $ 300 interest at about 1 per annum over the three year post maturity period the $ 100 interest earned by you for the current year sounds about right too all in all it might be the case that your grandfather bought the bonds in his name your father 's name and your name were you very young in 1995 your father and you inherited the bonds in 2008 and then your father removed your grandfather 's name from the bonds in 2015 thus transferring the bonds to his name and yours in 2015 and soon thereafter removed his name transferring the bonds into your name alone as to why 2015 and not 2008 when your grandfather passed away did you turn 21 in 2015 twenty years after the bonds were bought

the rule that i know is six months of income stored in readily accessible savings e.g. a savings or money market account    others have argued that it should be six months of expenses which is of course easier to achieve   i would recommend against that partially because it is easier to achieve   the other issue is that people are more prone to underestimate their expenses than their income   finally if you base it on your current expenses then budget for savings and have money left over you often increase your expenses   sometimes obviously e.g. a new car and sometimes not e.g. more restaurants or clubs   income increases are rarer and easier to see    either way you can make that six months shorter or longer   six months is both feasible and capable of handling difficult emergencies   six years would n't be feasible   one month would n't get you through a major emergency    examples of emergencies    your savings can be in any of multiple forms   for example someone was talking about buying real estate and renting it   that 's a form of savings but it can be difficult to do withdrawals   stocks and bonds are better but what if your emergency happens when the market is down   part of how emergency funds operate is that they are readily accessible    another issue is that a main goal of savings is to cover retirement   so people put them in tax privileged retirement accounts   the downside of that is that the money is not then available for emergencies without paying penalties   you get benefits from retirement accounts but that 's in exchange for limitations    it 's much easier to spend money than to save it   there are many options and the world makes it easy to do   emergency funds make people really think about that portion of savings   and thinking about saving before spending helps avoid situations where you savings    let 's pretend that retirement accounts do n't exist perhaps they do n't in your country   your savings is some mix of stocks and bonds   you have a mortgaged house   you 've budgeted enough into stocks and bonds to cover retirement   now you have a major emergency    as i understand your proposal you would then take that money out of the stocks and bonds for retirement   but then you no longer have enough for retirement   going forward you will have to scrimp to get back on track    an emergency fund says that you should do that early   because if you 're used to spending any level of money cutting that is painful   but if you 've only ever spent a certain level not increasing it is much easier   the longer you delay optional expenses the less important they seem    beforehand also helps avoid the situation where the emergency happens at the end of your career   it 's one thing to scrimp for fifteen years at fifty   what 's your plan if you would have an emergency at sixty five   or later   then you 're reducing your living standard at retirement    now maybe you save more than necessary   it 's not unknown   but it 's not typical either   it is far more common to encounter someone who is n't saving enough than too much

i do n't think there exists a guaranteed 5 investment vehicle you have to decide how much risk you 're willing to take splitting your $ 200k between cd 's and stocks or whatever higher yield investment vehicle you 've found is a way to get a higher rate without risking it all for example if you 've got a cd at 3 and let 's say best case is 10 average annual return on stocks after 10 years here are potential results using various splits from 100 cd to 100 stock    the best case based on 10 average stock return and 3 cd return is the total line for each split the worst case would be the cd amount only reality could be almost anywhere but not below the cd amount

the tax court ruling todd mentioned was that you can only do one roll over in a period i.e. if you have already done a roll over even if it is between different accounts you can not do it again between any of your ira accounts for 12 months so for the loan trick to work you must ensure that you have n't done a roll over within the last 12 months and you 're not going to do a roll over within the next 12 months note that the tax court took into the consideration that the irs pub 590 was explicitly saying that you can do multiple roll overs as long as different accounts are involved the court ruled that the irs instructions are not a legal authority i.e. the irs can write in the instructions whatever they want but if it contradicts the law as it did in this case the law always prevails this is only for indirect rollovers where you actually get the money and then re deposit it within 60 days trustee to trustee rollovers are not limited this limitation is codified in 26 u.s. code

it has little to do with money or finance   it 's basic neuroscience   when we get money our brains release read your money and your brain and receiving dividends is getting money   it feels good so we 're more likely to do it again what you often see are because the above explanation sounds irrational so many people want to make their behavior look more rational   ceteris paribus a solid growth stock is as good as a solid company that pays dividends in value investing terms dividend paying stocks may appear to give you an advantage in that you can keep the dividends in cash and buy when the price of the security is low underpriced   however as you realize you could just sell the growth stock at certain prices and the effect would be the same assuming you 're using a free brokerage like robin hood you can easily sell just a portion of the shares periodically to get a    stream of cash like dividends that presents no problem whatsoever    so this can not be the explanation to why some people think it is    smart to be a dividend investor yes if you 're using a brokerage like robin hood there may be others but i think this is the only one right now then you are right on

i sell gas to gas stations your profit is n't much in gas it 's in the convenience store so if you 're going to do it focus on your store here in the midwest we have a brand of stations called everyone loves these gas stations and will go out of their way if they need gas because they 're very clean and the workers are friendly   do n't build a branded station right now branded gas is cheaper than wholesale in a lot of markets but that 's not usually typical it 's better to have options and not be locked into a bp station where you can only buy their gas no matter the price additives are bs it 's a commodity    operating capital will be fairly high   roughly per truck at say 3.00 cents gal is about $ 22,500 in a high traffic area you could be pulling 1 truck per day to keep supply full this is an assumption based on what we sell to customers do some math and that 's quite a bit of operating capital can you finance that we set credit limits on our customers but they 're not high think 50 100k for small stations which is only a couple truck loads   i do n't think it 's a terrible business to be in but i would almost rather own the trucks hauling gas to your station and charging on the gallon or on the supply side of the equation where gas is more profitable

any accounting software should be able to handle this   when you invoice them set the invoice date to the date of the event   then receive a partial payment against that invoice   this will cause your accounting software to display the service income in the correct period as well   so if you sent them invoice for august 7 2014 event on may 5th 2014 and they gave you $ 500 due you would see this income in august $ 500 on cash basis $ 1000 on accrual basis   when you received the other $ 500 in august you would see $ 1000 for both methods   you would not see any income in may when you created the invoice   this is better for revenue matching with the correct period when you send them same invoice say 30 days before the event set the software to show payments already received   it seems that most online accounting software will do this by default   here is an example in     here is an example in xero   seems they both display information on when you can expect payment on the their respective    in the desktop version of quickbooks which i use a lot it will not show the balance of the customer by default on an invoice   you will have to modify the invoice template   there are more details on that here   in desktop version of quickbooks you can look at cash flow forecast report to see the expected amount coming in    i hope that helps and good luck

kid you need to start thinking in thresholds there are several monetary thresholds that separate your class from a more well funded class 1 you can not use margin with less than $ 2000 dollars brokers require that you have at least $ 2000 before they will lend to you 2 in 2010 congress banned under 21 year olds from getting access to credit unless they get cosigned this means that even if you have $ 2000 no broker will give you margin unless you have a good credit history already there was a good reason for this but its based on the assumption that everyone is stupid not the assumption that some people are objective thinkers 3 the brokers that will open an account for you have high commissions the commissions are so high that it will destroy any capital gains you may make with your $ 1000 for the most part 4 the pattern day trader rule you can not employ sophisticated risk management while being subject to the pattern day trader rule it basically limits you from trading 3 times a day its more complicated than that read it yourself if you have less than $ 25,000 in one account 5 non trade or stock related investments buy municipal or treasury bonds they will give you more than a savings account would and are tax free this is n't exactly what i would call liquid though ie if you wanted to access your money to invest in something else on a whim 6 what are you studying if its anything technical then you might get a good idea that you could risk your money on to create value but i would stick to high growth stocks before blowing your $ 1000 on an idea that s not exactly what i would call access to capital 7 arbitrage lets say you know a friend that buys the trendy collectors shoes at discount and sells them for a profit he might do this with one $ 200 pair of tennis shoes and then use the $ 60 profit different to go buy video games for himself if he wanted to scale up he could n't because he never has more than $ 200 to play with in comparison you could do 5 pairs $ 200 x 5 and immediately have a larger operation than him making a larger profit $ 60 x 5 = $ 300 now you have $ 1300 and could do it again with 6 pairs to make an even great er profit not because you are better or worked at it but solely because you have more capital to start with keep an eye out for arbitrage opportunities usually there is a good reason they exist if you notice it the market is too small and illiquid to scale up with or the entire market will be saturated the next day efficient market theory learn about it 8) take everything i just taught you and make a small investor newsletter website with subscribers online sites have low overhead costs

the deadline for roth conversions is december 31st   more precisely roth conversions are considered to have happened in the tax year the distribution was taken this creates a kind of loop hole for people who do an ira rollover not a trustee to trustee transfer technically you can take money out of your traditional ira on december 31st and hold it for 60 days before deciding to roll it over into either another traditional ira or a roth ira if you decide to put it in another traditional account it is not a taxable event   but if you decide to put it in a roth account the conversion is considered to have happened in december unfortunately non trustee rollovers are tricky for one the source trustee will probably take withholding that you will have to make up with non ira funds and rollovers are to a certain number per year also if you miss the 60-day deadline you will have to pay an early withdrawal penalty with some exceptions if you really want to push the envelope you could try to do this with a 60-day rule extension but i would n't try it source oddly basically reverse roth conversions have a deadline of october 15th of the year after the original roth conversion it is reversing so you could do the conversion in december then you have up to 10 months to change your mind and undo the conversion with a recharacterization again this is tricky business at the very least you should be aware that the tax calculations for recharacterization are different if you convert the funds into a new empty roth account vs an existing roth account with a previous balance honestly if you want to get into the recharacterization business you can probably save more on taxes by converting in january before stock market climb rather than simply converting in the year your tax brackets are low that is the typical recharacterization strategy source

if you exceed the income limit for deducting a traditional ira which is very low if you are covered by a 401(k then your ira options are basically limited to a roth ira the cramer person probably meant to compare 401(k and ira from the same tax so i.e. traditional 401(k vs. traditional ira or roth 401(k vs. roth ira comparing a roth investment against a traditional investment goes into a whole other topic that only confuses what is being discussed here so if deducting a traditional ira is ruled out then i do n't think cramer 's advice can be as simply applied regarding a traditional 401(k however by that logic and since most people on 401(k have traditional 401(k and if you are covered by a 401(k then you can not deduct a traditional ira unless you are super low income that would mean cramer 's advice is not applicable in most situations so i do n't really know what to think here
# 312600
if you hold stock in a traditional ira and sell a covered call against that stock the premium received for writing that call belongs to the ira just as would any other gain dividend or interest   it is not a contribution but simply adds to the balance in the ira   the nature of the gain capital or ordinary is not relevant since all parts of the ira balance are treated the same when funds are eventually withdrawn

standard markowitz 's portfolio optimization takes trend into account not mean reversion otherwise since a portfolio is a linear combination of your individual assets you could 1st model them separately and than establish a second layer criteria for weighting for the 1st layer mean reversion as well as trend of returns can be captured with a model and for the 2nd layer you could use the kelly criterion for instance a more direct approach to mean reversion portfolio selection is working with pairs trading i 'm not linking any materials as those topics are plentiful on the web if that 's still not the answer you 're looking for the problem with predicting economic cycles is that they are long and we hardly have a sufficient measured history to forecast anything reliable in order to predict the mean reversion of a stock or bond market cycle you 've got to measure their long term mean first and there you 'll have disagreements right on the start some researchers see jeremy siegel have tried to measure the long term mean of returns for various asset classes some argue that stocks are the long run winners and that capm explains that but others say that 's just questionable since measurements go just as far as the western countries us uk etc have thrived other countries have much more recent economic records

forgive me as i do not know much about your fine country but i do know one thing   you can make 5 risk free guaranteed   how from your link if you make a voluntary repayment of $ 500 or more you will receive a bonus of 5 per cent this means your account will be credited with an additional 5 per cent of the value of your payment i 'd take of that amount saved and pay off her loan tomorrow and increase my net worth by i 'd also do the same thing for your loan   in fact in it is more important to pay off your loan first    as i understand it you will eventually have to pay your loan back once your income rises above a threshold   psychologically you make attempt to retard your   future income in order to avoid payback   those decisions may not be made overtly but it is likely they will be made so by the end of the day or as soon as possible i 'd have a bank balance of and no student loan debt   this amounts to a net increase in net worth of 1900 it is a great safe first investment

it is unlikely that the plan is worth doing given the numbers you have used however your thinking is correct that given enough of a rate differential it could be worth doing consider that for each $ 100k of your mortgage and i assume your limit for an unsecured personal loan is likely far less than 100k you would save only $ by taking out a personal unsecured loan of 3 and paying off your mortgage instead such low unsecured rates may be a signal that it would be worthwhile for you to renegotiate your mortgage you will likely need to pay a fee but the savings could be significant   for each $ 100k of mortgage a 1 rate change from your current rate saves you 1k per year so if you can get a mortgage rate of 2 which may be possible if an unsecured loan costs you 3 compare the initial administrative fee against those savings over the course of the term of the ie $ 300k saves you 9k over 3 years so would be well worth even an initial $ 3k admin fee

other answers are already very good but i 'd like to add one step before taking the advice of the other answers if you still can switch to a 15 year mortgage and figure out what percentage of your take home pay the new payment is   this is the position taken by dave ramsey and i believe this will give you a better base from which to launch your other goals for two reasons since you are then paying it off faster at a base payment you may then want to take mrchrister 's advice but put all extra income toward investments feeling secure that your house will be paid off much sooner anyway and at a lower interest rate dave 's advice is n't for everyone because he takes a very long term view   however in the long term it is great advice   see   here for more joetaxpayer is right you will not see anything near guaranteed yearly rates in mutual funds so make sure they are part of a long term investing plan you are not investing your time in learning the short term stock game so stay away from it   as long as you are continuing to learn in your own career you should see very good short term gains there anyway

if human beings were i.e. textbook rational and self interested economic minded beings as opposed to simply human then yes simple advice like just stay out of debt and your credit score will take care of itself could work   your simplification would be very persuasive to such a being however people are not perfectly rational   we buy something we should n't have we charge it on a credit card we ca n't afford to pay it off at the end of the month   we lose our job   our furnace breaks down or our roof leaks and we did n't anticipate the replacement cost   some of this is our fault some of it is n't basically shit happens and we get into debt   maybe even knowing all the while we should n't have our credit history and score takes a hit   only then do we find out there are consequences our interest rates go up our insurance companies raise premiums our prospective new employers or landlords run credit checks and either deny us the job or the apartment telling a person who asks for help about their credit history score that they should n't have taken on debt in the first place is like telling the farmer he should have kept the barn door shut so the horse would n't run out   while it is not bad advice it 's not the only kind of advice to offer when somebody finds themselves in such a situation adding advice about actions is more helpful   the person probably already know that they should n't have overspent in the first place and got into debt   yes remind them of the value of being sensible about debt in the first place it 's good reinforcement but add some helpful advice to the mix   e.g. so you 're in debt   you should n't have lived beyond your means   but now that you are in this mess here 's what you can do to improve the situation

through that link what exactly do you want me to read   the changes to inflation under clinton were made to made to more accurately account for inflation so if anything things are more accurate now than in 1950 the precise details of the changes are documented on the bls website somewhere but the short of it is that the old inflation definition had the problem where if prices went up or down and then back to original you would still have inflation which is incorrect the changes lessen this effect many independent groups like the billion price project agree that the current bls methods for measuring inflation is more correct than the older methods and match actual pricing better note that the billion prices index does not include hedonics as far as i know and in practice the amount of goods to which hedonics applies in the cpi basket is so small as to not matter much anyways finally the idea is sound one should account for to products as adding value so comparing a 20 tv from 1970 to one today needs more than merely retail price to evaluate price increases certainly gets more tv than back then   if you have claims otherwise i 'd like to hear them until then i suspect we more accurately measure gdp and inflation than in 1950 not less accurately   all this still does not show there is more of the numbers than in 1950 and the poster above you said it seems he 's making excuses to obtain an he desires rather than the correct approach which is to measure carefully and then think what it means   and no one here said gdp was a universal measure of economic health

in the u.s. there are laws that protect both employees and employers ask for proof of overpayment and time to respond if you feel you have a case consult a lawyer that specializes in wage disputes otherwise let them have their money out of your last check if necessary you do n't want to have to go to court if you really do owe them if you tell them a lawyer has accepted your case based on evidence they may choose to settle out of court to avoid public embarrassment and legal fees since if you win they also have to pay your court fees and legal fees plus possible punitive damages conversely if you go to court but you owe them you 'll be subject to pay back what you owe plus their legal fees which will be far more than you intend to pay them or even what you 'd get if you won losing would cost you dearly nobody can tell you what the outcome of your specific case will be but unless the sum is significant i would recommend that you accept the losses and walk away while i know this can be hard as someone who also lives the middle class paycheck to paycheck life you probably ca n't afford to lose and your company has expensive lawyers losing a few thousand dollars is easier than losing tens of thousands or more in a court battle you can always seek assistance such as unemployment welfare utility assistance and other government programs to get back on your feet if you owe them more than you can actually repay try to negotiate you want to stay out of court if at all practical their lawyers run hundreds of dollars per hour so if they choose to they can bury you financially if they have a case

so if a country forces their savings onto another country say the u.s. the u.s. would have to absorb those savings somehow if there were enough productive investments available then this would be a good thing but if there are n't enough productive investments available but the savings are still forced upon the u.s. it would seem that it would inevitably lead to some kind of a debt bubble for the u.s.

i own a non union company in the construction industry and my employees are harassed weekly at home by phone on jobs all the time they keep raising pay rates around $ + $ 30/hr in benefits now but no one is working because clients are at the union prices we pay well give good benefits and are really low pressure in the last 7 years we have not had a single employee switch over i think that makes the union more annoyed than anything

an llc does not pay taxes on profits as regards tax a llc is treated as a partnership but instead of partners they are called members the llc is a passthrough entity as in partnerships members can have a different percentage ownership to the share of profits the llc reports the share of the profits of the members then the members pay the tax as an individual the profit of the llc is deemed to have been transferred to the members regardless of any funds transferred this is often the case as the llc may need to retain the profits for use in the business late paying customers may mean there is less cash in the llc than is available to distribute   the first answer is wrong only a c corporation files a tax return all other corporate structures are passthrough entities the c corporation pays corporation tax and is not required to pass any funds to the shareholders if the c corporation passes funds to the shareholders this is a dividend and taxable to the shareholder hence double taxation

comission is a must when doing sales that is the best and only good incentive to sell more how much you want to give all depends on margins the salary level that is accepted in your state country and what sellers you have young or old   salary costs at 30 35 of total order value is normal including salary tax and all tax oriented costs around that employee    there are 2 ways of doing it only high commission and fixed salary + lower commission even if you use fixed salary + commission you can have restrictions so they have to sell above a certain level to get that commission that means that you do n't take any risks    an example of a salary model that i found was popular the numbers are just made up according to what is normal to have in sweden it 's a step model if you sell for   step 1 0 $ 3000 you get high commission 20 of everything you sell   step 2 $ 3000 $ 4000 you get fixed salary of $ 1000 + 10 commission   step 3 $ 4000 $ 6000 you get fixed salary of $ 1700 + 15 commission   and so on   your weakest points are when going to a higher step you have to change the steps so it works with your salary statistics so you have most people under a step to motivate them to go to the next instead of having them exactly above one step as you can see with a step model you just put a on the commission model but make it more attractive what the seller think is that they have a fixed salary if a seller is happy he she is selling a lot     i have also had a criteria saying that if you can keep at 1 step for more than 3 months you will start there each month then it 's up to the team leader to warn if that seller is good or just lucky

there are certain allowable reasons to withdraw money from a 401k.   the desire to free your money from a bad plan is not one of them    a rollover is a special type of withdrawal that is only available after one leaves their current employer   so as long as you stay with your current company you can not rollover   exception if you are over age   59.5 one option is to talk to hr see if they can get a expansion of offerings   you might have some suggestions for mutual funds that you would like to see   the smaller the company the more likely you will have success here   that being said there is some research to support having few choices   too many choices people it 's quite popular to have target funds   that is funds that target a certain retirement year   being that i will be 50 in 2016 i should invest in either a 2030 or fund   these are a collection of funds that rebalances the investment as they age   the closer one gets to retirement the more goes into bonds and less into stocks    however i think such rebalancing is not as smart as the experts say   imho is almost always better off heavily invested in equity funds   so this becomes a second option   invest in a target fund that is meant for younger people   in my case i would put into a 2060 or even target as joetaxpayer pointed out even in a plan that has high fees and poor choices one is often better off contributing up to the match   then one would go outside and contribute to an individual roth or ira income restrictions may apply then back into the 401 k until the desired amount is invested    you could always move on to a different employer and ask some really good questions about their 401k.   which leads me back to talking with hr   with the current technology shortage making a few tweaks to the 401 k is a very cheap way to make their employees happy if you can score a 1099 contracting gig you can do a sep which allows up to a whopping 53 k per year   no match but with typically higher pay sometimes overtime and a high contribution limit you can easily make up for it

back end fees should not really matter much in dca vs va as they are both ways of deploying money in the markets and back end fees happen when selling not deploying   the only difference i can think of would be if the back end fees have a holding period and if you need to take the money out before that period end some money may be subject to a higher fee   the difference should not generally be large and since it is largely random whether dca or va the capital more quickly it makes little difference on a related note dca or va makes little difference and when transaction fees are significant or time frames are long retirement generally on average both lose to lump sum investing finally as chris mentioned mutual funds with load fees especially back end but even front end are considered poor investment choices as the vast majority do n't give excess returns that justify the heavy fee load

it would be incredibly unusual for the same institution to offer checking and savings accounts with exactly the same features benefits including interest etc the reason is that in the usa anyways the fed makes banks keep a certain percentage of their total assets called the reserve requirement in house checking account deposits can not be re loaned of the money you put in your checking account must be held by the bank in its vaults savings accounts are not limited in this way so logic dictates that if depositing into one type of account is better for the bank than the other ie they can use more of the money to make money they will reward people for using the one that is more beneficial to their bottom line i 'm this from college finance 101 so i may be slightly mis remembering things but i 'm 99.99 sure that this is the primary reason you see checking accounts with lower interest rates banks would prefer you to use savings accounts and set up incentives so that you will sorry i know this does n't really answer your question but i think it may help you understand your options a little better i hope

i had about $ 16k in student loans i defaulted on the loans and they got   > passed to a collection type agency   these guys are as legitimate as a collection agency can be one thing that i feel is very sketchy is when they were verifying my identity they said does your social security number end in is your birthday month day year   that is not sketchy it would be sketchy for a caller to ask you to give that information that 's a common scheme for identity theft are following the rules on this one my mom suggested i should consider applying for bankruptcy wo n't help student loans ca n't be discharged in bankruptcy you have the bankruptcy reform act passed during the bush 43 regime for that the loan itself is from school what school contact them and ask for help they may have washed their hands of your case when they turned over your file to then again they may not it 's worth finding out    also name and shame the school future applicants should be warned that they will do this   what can i do to aid in my negotiations with this company do n't negotiate on the phone you 've discovered that they wo n't honor such negotiations ask for written communications sent by postal mail keep copies of everything including both sides of the canceled checks you use to make payments during the six months and in the future keep making the payments you agreed to in the conversation six months ago do not ever ignore a letter from them do not ever skip going to court if they send you a summons to appear they count on people doing this they can get a default judgement if you do n't show up then you 're well and truly screwed what do you want you want the $ 4 k fee removed if you want something else figure out   what it is here 's what to do write them a polite letter explaining what you said here the conversation you had with their telephone agent where they said they would remove the $ 4 k fee if you made payments   the later conversation if possible give the dates of both conversations and the names of the both agents    explain the situation completely do n't assume the recipient of your letter knows anything about your case include evidence that you made payments as agreed during the six months if you were late or something do n't withhold that   ask them to remove the extra $ 4 k from your account and ask for whatever else you want send the letter to them with a return receipt requested or even registered mail that will prevent them from claiming they did n't get it and it will show them you 're serious write a cover letter admitting your default saying you relied on their negotiation to set things straight and saying you 're they are n't sticking to their word the cover letter should ask for help sorting this out send copies of the letter with the cover letter to be sure to mark your letter to cc all these folks so they know you are asking for help it ca n't hurt to call your congressional representative 's office and ask to whom you should send the letter and then address it by name this is called constituent service and they take pride in it if you send this letter with copies you 're letting them know you intend to fight   the collection agency may decide it 's not worth the fight to get the $ 4 k and decide to let it go    again if they call to pressure you say you 'd rather communicate in writing and that they are not to call you by telephone then hang up   should i hire a lawyer   yes but only if you get a court summons or if you do n't get anywhere with this you can give the lawyer all this paperwork i 've suggested here and it will help her come up to speed on your case this is the kind of stuff the lawyer would do for you at well over $ 100 per hour is bankruptcy really an option certainly not unfortunately never forget that student lenders and their collection agencies are dangerous and clever predators you are their lawful prey they look at you lick their chops and think food watch john oliver 's of that industry   good luck and stay safe

the idea is that the premiums or costs associated with the plan are a business expense you know that already   the distinction here is that employees do n't pay premiums they elect to contribute the company sponsors a plan the employees then choose to accept less salary in order to participate in the employer 's plan   the idea is that you 're foregoing income why is the employee not taxed on this cost   one major reason is that the employee has no say in and often no idea what the gross costs are some find out if they ever receive cobra election paperwork there are more benefits than strict healthcare that are section 125 eligible   the government has a vested interest in keeping the population healthy and when the erisa laws and section 125 were written it was and still is a pretty low friction way to get health insurance out to more people   at this point taking away the tax break from the employees would be a huge government take away from most of the population   try to get a politician to take something away from taxpayers why does n't the deduction exist in kind to people buying individual coverage   ask your legislators   there are thousands of preferential tax treatment where some industry will get some sort of benefit or break   i 'm not sure what leads you to think there needs to be some supremely logical reason for this to exit

i 'm not a financial expert but saying that paying a $ 1 dividend will reduce the value of the stock by $ 1 sounds like awfully simple minded reasoning to me it appears to be based on the assumption that the price of a stock is equal to the value of the assets of a company divided by the total number of shares but that simply is n't true you do n't even need to do any in depth analysis to prove it just look at share prices over a few days you should easily be able to find stocks whose price varied wildly if say a company becomes the target of a federal investigation the share price will plummet the day the announcement is made did the company 's assets really disappear that day no what 's happened is that the company 's long term prospects are now in doubt or a company announces a promising new product the share price shoots up they may not have sold a single unit of the new product yet they have n't made a dollar but their future prospects now look improved many factors go into determining a stock price sure total assets is a factor but more important is anticipated future earning i think a very simple case could be made that if a stock never paid any dividends and if everyone knew it would never pay any dividends that stock is worthless the stock will never produce any profit to the owner so why should you be willing to pay anything for it one could say the value could go up and you could sell at a profit but on what basis would the value go up why would investors be willing to pay larger and larger amounts of money for an asset that produces zero income update i think i understand the source of the confusion now so let me add to my answer suppose that a company 's stock is selling for say $ 10 and to simplify the discussion let 's suppose that there is absolutely nothing affecting the value of that stock except an expected dividend the company plans to pay a dividend on a specific date of $ 1 per share this dividend is announced well in advance everyone knows that it will be paid and everyone is extremely that in fact the company really will pay it they wo n't run out of money or any such then in a pure market we would expect that as the date of that dividend approaches the price of the stock would rise until the day before the dividend is paid it is $ 11 then the day after the dividend is paid the price would fall back to $ 10 why because the person who owns the stock on the dividend day will get that $ 1 so if you bought the stock the day before the dividend the next day you would immediately receive $ 1 if without the dividend the stock is worth $ 10 then the day before the dividend the stock is worth $ 11 because you know that the next day you will get a $ 1 refund if you buy the stock the day after the dividend is paid you will not get the $ 1 it will go to the person who had the stock yesterday so the value of the stock falls back to the normal $ 10 so if you look at the value of a stock immediately after a dividend is paid yes it will be less than it was the day before by an amount equal to the dividend plus or minus all the other things that affect the value of a stock which in many cases would totally mask this effect but this does not mean that the dividend is worthless just the opposite the reason the stock price fell was precisely because the dividend has value but it only has value to the person who gets it it does me no good that you get a $ 1 dividend i want me to get the money so if i buy the stock after the dividend was paid i missed my chance so sure in the very short term a stock loses value after paying a dividend but this does not mean that dividends in general reduce the value of a stock just the opposite the price fell because it had gone up in anticipation of the dividend and is now returning to the normal level without the dividend the price would never have gone up in the first place imagine you had a company with negligible assets for example an accounting firm that rents office space so it does n't own a building its only tangible assets are some office supplies and the like so if the company liquidates it would be worth pretty much zero everybody knows that if liquidated the company would be worth zero further suppose that everyone somehow knows that this company will never ever again pay a dividend maybe federal regulators are shutting the company down because it 's products were declared hazardous or the company was built around one genius who just died etc what is the stock worth zero it is an investment that you know has a zero return why would anyone be willing to pay anything for it it 's no answer to say that you might buy the stock in the hope that the price of the stock will go up and you can sell at a profit even with no dividends why would anyone else pay anything for this stock well unless their stock certificates are pretty and people like to collect them or something like that otherwise you 're supposing that people would knowingly buy into a pyramid scheme of course in real life there are usually uncertainties if a company is dying some people may believe rightly or wrongly that there is still hope of it etc do n't confuse the value of the assets of a company with the value of its stock they are related of course all else being equal a company with a billion dollars in assets will have a higher market capitalization than a company with ten dollars in assets but you ca n't calculate the price of a company 's stock by adding up the value of all its assets subtracting liabilities and dividing by the number of shares that 's just not how it works long term the value of any stock is not the value of the assets but the net present value of the total future expected dividends subject to all sorts of complexities in real life

is there anything here i should be concerned about i do n't see anything you should be concerned about unless your career outlook is very poor and you are making minimum wage if that is the case you may struggle for the next 10 years are these rates considered super high or manageable the rates for the federal loans are around twice as high as your private loans but that is the going rate and there is nothing you can do about it now 6.5 is n't bad on what is essentially a personal loan 2 3 are very manageable assuming you pay them and do n't let the interest build up   what is a good mode of attack here i am by no means a financial adviser and do n't know the rest of your financial situation but the most general advice i can give you is pay down your highest interest rate loans first and always try to pay more than the minimum in your case i would put as much as you reasonably can towards the federal loans because that will save you money in the long run what are the main takeaways i should understand about these loans the main takeaway is that these are student loans and they can not be discharged if you were to ever declare bankruptcy pay them off but do n't be too concerned about them if you do apply for loans in the future most lenders wo n't be too concerned about student loans assuming you are paying them on time and especially if you are paying more than the minimum payment   what are the payoff dates for the other loans the payoff dates for the other loans are a little hard to easily calculate but it appears they all have different payoff dates between 8 and 12 years from now this part might be easier for someone who is better at financial calculations than me why do my citi loans have a higher balance than the original payoff amounts your citi loans have a higher balance probably because you have not payed anything towards them yet so the interest has been accruing since you got them

there is one edge case that may be of value to you if you declare a bonus probably to yourself given a very small company you can deduct it from your year and then have up to 6 months to actually write the cheque and give it to the person say your year end for the corporation is july 31st you could declare the bonus july 30th and deduct it from that year lowering your corporate tax you could then wait until january 30th to actually write the bonus cheque the person would then have that taxable income in a later calendar year deferring paying the tax depending on the size of the bonus this would possibly matter although if you did large bonuses every year it would only matter the first time the other issue is the availability of your bookkeeper or accountant they are sometimes very busy during personal income tax season they often like a vacation immediately after that they may go away in the summer when their kids are out of school the nice thing about a july 31st year end is that you can probably count on a quick turnaround from your accountant in september the possible downside is that you wo n't enjoy reconciling your credit card statements and the like in august as part of getting your year end stuff together you can avoid that by keeping your books in a decent shape all the time

first it sounds like you are already making wise choices with your cash surplus you 've looked for ways to keep that growing ahead of inflation and you have made use of tax shelters so for the rest of this answer i am going to assume you have between 3 6 months expenses already saved up as a rainy day fund and you 're ready for more sophisticated approaches to growing your funds to answer this part are there any other ways that i can invest that i am not currently doing yes you could look at for example 1 peer to peer these services let you lend to a basket of borrowers and receive a return on your money that is typically higher than what 's offered in cash savings accounts examples of peer to peer networks are zopa and this involves taking some risks with your money zopa 's lending section explains the risks 2 structured deposits these are a type of cash deposit product where in return for locking your money away for a time typically 5 years you get the opportunity for higher returns e.g. 5 + year your deposit is usually guaranteed under the fscs financial services compensation scheme however the returns are dependent on the performance of a stock market index such as the ftse 100 being higher in x years from now also structured deposits usually require a minimum £ 3,000 investment 3 index funds you mention watching the stock prices of a few companies i agree with your conclusion i would n't suggest trying to choose individual stocks at this stage price history is a poor predictor of future performance and markets can be volatile to decide if a stock is worth buying you need to understand the fundamentals be able to assess the current stock price and future outlook and be comfortable accepting a range of different risks including currency and geographic risk if you buy shares in a small number of companies you are concentrating your risk especially if they have things in common with each other index funds while they do carry risks let you pool your money with other investors to buy shares in a basket of stocks to replicate the movement of an index such as the ftse all share the basket of stocks approach at least gives you some built in diversification against the risks of individual stocks i suggest index funds as opposed to actively managed funds where you pay a management fee to have your investments chosen by a professional who tries to beat the market because they are low cost and easier to understand an example of a very low cost index fund is this ftse all share tracker from on the hargreaves lansdown platform general principle on investing in stock market based index funds you should always invest with a 5 + year time horizon this is because prices can move up and down for reasons beyond your anticipation or control volatility time can smooth out volatility generally the longer the time period the greater your likelihood of achieving a positive return i hope this answer so far helps takes into account the excess funds so to answer the second part of your question   or would it be best to start using any excess funds to pay off my student loan quicker your student loan is currently costing you 0.9 interest per annum at this rate it 's lower than the last 10 years average inflation one argument if you repay your student loan this is effectively a 0.9 guaranteed return on every pound repaid this is the equivalent of on a cash savings account if you 're paying basic rate tax on the interest an opposing argument 0.9 is lower than the last 10 years average inflation in the uk there are so many advantages to making a start with growing your money for the long term due to the effects of compound returns that you might choose to defer your loan repayments for a while and focus on building up some investments that stand a chance to beat inflation in the long term

whether or not uber lyft are taxi services only matters to determine if they need to follow taxi regulations which are meant to protect customers from looking at uber and lyft 's performance however they provide better service at a better price than taxis so what are those regulations actually protecting us from    this is n't about these guys trying to get around the law anymore the business model has been shown to be highly effective and the laws need to be changed to allow for this new model that benefits consumers more than what we had before the hurdle now is that the taxi companies have an interest in keeping the barrier to entry high to prevent competition and that means preventing uber and lyft from getting around those barriers

the article is filled with terrible arguments    the entire point of corporate tax reform is to stop having a situation where startups and small businesses which are net job creators are paying 40 corporate tax rates whereas large established businesses which tend to be net job pay 6 effective tax rates due to the tax advantages of debt the author simply glosses over this and keeps repeating corporations already pay 20 and no new jobs are created    then the author also tries to point towards tax deals as evidence that tax reform is n't needed when that 's exactly why it is needed high corporate taxes result in a situation where large companies can lobby for lower taxes for themselves but smaller companies lacking political influence are stuck paying the high rates illinois is a great example of this phenomenon their corporate taxes are sky high so large companies just threaten to move every time they want lower taxes so you end up with the large company tax which may be like 2 and the small company tax which may be something like 8    overall it 's clear the author has absolutely no understanding whatsoever of the issues involved with corporate tax reform the us corporate tax system is terrible precisely because it rewards debt driven growth and cronyism while punishing real economic growth

this is of course a perfectly normal thing to happen people trade up to a bigger house every day when you 've found a bigger house you want to move to and a buyer for your existing one you arrange closing dates for both i.e. the date on which the sale actually happens usually you make them very close either on the same day or with an overlap of a few weeks you use the equity i.e. the difference between the house value and the mortgage in the old house as the down payment on the new house you ca n't of course use the part of the old house that is mortgaged if the day you buy the new and sell the old is the same your banks and lawyers do everything for you on that day if there is an overlap then you need something called bridge financing to cover the period when you own two houses banks are used to doing this and it 's not really that expensive when you take into account all the other costs of moving house talk to them for details as a side note it is generally not to be worth buying a house if you only intended to live there one or two years the costs involved in the process of buying selling and moving usually outweigh any gains in house value you may find yourself with a higher down payment if you rent for a year or two and save up a down payment for your bigger house instead

if your savings are in usd and will be making purchases using usd then it will no longer go as far as it used to i assume most americans currently have their savings accounts in usd so the value of those accounts will decrease if you have investments in stocks or foreign currencies your exposure may be less but it depends for example stocks in companies that hold a lot of usd will also be hit hard as will be currencies of nations that are still holding a lot of usd if the value of the usd is crashing   if you have a lot of debt measured in usd while have a lot of assets that have nothing to do with usd then you might make out like a bandit since if you assume the value of the usd is falling then it would become easier to sell off your other assets to pay off the debt

there is more than one kind of tax it is a little confusing because in reality the tax revenues collected by the government are n't earmarked to a particular usage based on where they came from usually well the gov't often claims they do but for all practical matters it all goes in a big bucket so just because a business or individual is n't paying income taxes does n't mean they are n't paying anything for the use of government furnished infrastructure services you are limiting the scope of your question to income taxes which are taxes paid on profits to a business or individual it makes perfect sense that you would n't pay a tax on something you did n't get however you are n't considering taxes that are being paid even by a company that is n't profitable for example consumption taxes employment taxes and other fees that same company paid sales tax on all the supplies it purchased and probably collected paid sales taxes on anything it sold to take one of your examples it paid for its share of using the roads through government imposed taxes on fuel   do n't worry about the government they know how to get theirs they might not pull it from your right pocket but they will make sure to get it from the left

the focus of this article is n't on tax revenue the author is discussing income disparity    the laffer curve does n't tell the whole story you are correct a higher tax rate does not imply higher tax revenue and a lower tax rate does not imply less revenue changing tax rates is n't going to significantly affect tax revenue however there are a broad range of other effects when changing tax rates in evaluating adjustments to tax rates our focus needs to be on these secondary effects    we are taxed on income not   when i sell you a $ 10 widget that i paid a worker $ 2 to produce from $ 5 of materials i pay taxes on the $ 3 net income not the $ 10 revenue i received from you     the main way businesses avoid high marginal tax rates is by increasing deductible expenses such that their net income after these expenses keeps them below their desired tax bracket   it is far better to spend that money on something that can benefit the business than simply give it to the government any businessman would rather keep his earnings if possible if that is not possible he 'd prefer to spend them on something that can help him rather than squandering it on junk or giving it away to the government    for most businesses the largest deductible expense is payroll any decent employer would prefer to pay out a christmas bonus instead of giving that same amount to uncle sam any businessman would prefer to pay for additional advertising or a charitable donation to a worthy cause rather than paying the irs    run up the top tier tax rate and suddenly businessmen feel a compelling need to lower their prices and pay their workers more run up the tax rate and income disparity shrinks   run up the tax rate and you put more money in the hands of consumers

one overarching thing to keep in mind is that wherever you go with finance if you work hard enough and climb the ladder you can make decent money i know cio 's market and even cfo 's portfolio managers and cpa 's that all live extremely comfortably and all of them work outside of the ib industry basically ib is n't the end all for making large sums of money the main reason why it pays so much upfront is that of the hours you have to work if you look at their salary at an hourly rate it 's around 10 12 bucks an hour    definitely think about the double major thing though or potentially just doing a minor it would definitely look good on a resume especially if it 's something you also enjoy but you 've got ta keep that gpa high and getting a 4.0 in cs is quite a challenge to begin with   pretty much any of the series certifications can help you depending on where you want to go career wise obviously for some positions have certain series certifications wo n't be useful at all it 's also worth looking into the cfa program if you plan on doing financial analysis but you 'll need a sponsor for this just like the series certifications   happy to help man if you 've got any other questions feel free to reach out i 'm in the same boat just trying to figure out what i want to do with my life to make decent money so i can take care of my friends and family and live life to the fullest

you can think of the situation as a kind of equilibrium   if the market values stock based on the value of the company then from an individual point of view it makes sense to value stock the same way as an illustration imagine that stock prices were associated with the amount of at the company 's location rather than the assets of the company   in this imaginary stock market it would not benefit you to buy and sell stock according to the company 's value   instead you would profit most from buying and selling according to the weather like everyone else   whether this system or the current one   would be stable in the long term is another matter entirely

the us customs and border protection website states that there is no limit to the amount of currency that can be brought into or taken out of the us    there is no limit on the amount of money that can be taken out of or brought into the united states however if a person or persons traveling together and filing a joint declaration cbp form have $ 10,000 or more in currency or negotiable monetary instruments they must fill out a report of international transportation of currency and monetary instruments fincen 105 former cf the cbp site also notes that failure to declare currency and monetary instruments in excess of $ 10,000 may result in its seizure further the site states that the requirement to report currency on a fincen 105 does not apply to imports of gold bullion   however the legal website the law dictionary includes details of how money laundering laws may come into play here as part of the war on terror and the war on drugs u.s. law enforcement agencies have significantly increased their over money laundering to this effect travelers who carry large amounts of cash without supporting documentation of its legitimate source may be subject to secondary inspections and seizure of funds in some cases law enforcement may confiscate cash in excess of $ 10,000 until supporting documents are produced so far i have described the official position   however reading between the lines i think it is fair to say that in the current climate if you show up at an entry point with a suitcase full of a large amount of cash you would face considerable scrutiny regardless of any supporting documentation you may present if you fail to present supporting documentation then i think your cash would certainly be seized   if you are a us resident then you would be given the opportunity to obtain satisfactory documentation   if you did present documentation then i think your cash would be held for as long as it would take to verify the validity of the documentation   failure to present valid documentation would result in money laundering charges being brought against you and the matter would rest before the courts if you are not a us resident then failing to produce supporting documentation would mean your cash being seized and entry into the us would almost certainly be denied   you would then have to deal with the situation from outside of the us   if you did produce supporting documentation then again i suspect the cash would be held for as long as it takes to verify the validity of the documentation   whether or not you were allowed to enter the us would depend on what other documentation you possess

i think the biggest reason is price it 's a lot cheaper now than it was to offer these   that 's because for the most part when you get a credit score for free you 're not getting a true fico score   you 're getting instead a vantagescore vantagescore was created by the three credit bureaus and as such they can offer it without paying fair isaac a licensing fee   that makes it a lot cheaper to offer and while it 's not absolutely identical to fico or more accurately to any of the fico provided scores it 's close enough for most peoples purpose and of course undoubtedly fair isaac has some price pressure on their side now that vantage is big enough that many people see them as fungible   as such they 've had to make it easier or they 'd lose business no longer being a monopolist the other relevant piece here is that probably in many of these cases they 're really just offering you what experian would give you directly so it 's just a cross marketing thing where experian or perhaps another bureau gets access to you as a customer so they can up sell you id theft insurance and whatnot while the bank gets to offer the free score

excellent question though any why question can be challenging to answer because it depends on the financial products in question   at least i have n't seen many target date retirement funds that include a high percent of foreign stocks so below explains the ones i 've seen which are primarily us stocks the united states before the last twenty years has been seen as a country of stability   this is not true anymore and it 's difficult for my generation to understand because we grew up in the u.s.a being challenged and tend to think that china and india have always been powers but when we read investors like benjamin graham who had significant influence with warren buffett we can see this bias the u.s.a to them is stable and other countries are risky   again with the national debt and the political game in our current time it does not feel this way   but that bias is often reflect in financial instruments the us dollar is still the reserve currency though it 's influence is declining and i would expect it to decline   contrary to my view because i could be wrong here is mish who argues that no one wants to have the reserve currency because having a reserve currency brings disadvantages see here bogus threats to us reserve currency status no country really wants it i present this to show that my view could be wrong finally there tends to be the go with what you know   many of these funds are managed by u.s. citizens so they tend to have a u.s. bias and feel more comfortable investing their money at home in fact a famous mutual fund manager peter lynch had a similar mentality buy the company behind the stock and what company do we tend to know best   the ones around us one final note i 'm not saying this mentality is correct just what the attitude is like   i think you may find that younger mutual fund managers tend to include more foreign stocks as they 've seen that different world

patience is the key here i hate to say there are five factors to fico credit scores   payment history is adversely affected by late payments so always pay on time otherwise your report will be for seven years credit utilization has to do with how much of your available credit is currently in use lower is better but 0 is n't good either because they want to see that you 're using credit 10 or less is a good goal and try to keep any single card balance to 30 or less when its statement close date rolls around credit history is based on the average age of all of your accounts cards or otherwise the older the better do n't close either of your other cards because that would cause your average account age to fall and make sure to use the store card at least occasionally because lenders sometimes decide to close unused lines of credit credit mix has to do with the different types of credit you hold and is why your bank 's website suggested taking out a loan it also has to do with the number of accounts overall i 've never found a satisfactory answer for what the sweet spot is but i suspect it 's in the 6 12 range you would n't want to get several new ones at the same time because new credit is affected by the credit inquiries hard pulls that occur when you apply for new cards or loans inquiries stay on your report for two years before falling off this is almost certainly where your score dropped you also mentioned not knowing if some hospital bills are still affecting your score you 'll want to review your credit reports and find out plus checking your credit reports regularly is a really great habit to get into because errors and fraud can and do happen there are three credit reporting agencies experian equifax and transunion and you 'll want to review all three you can get one free report from each of them every year it can take a couple of months for a new credit account to show up on your credit report so your score should recover and go even higher once that happens sit tight as annoying as that is

yes   the investment world is extremely fast paced and competitive there are loads of professional traders with working day in and day out to make smarter faster trade decisions than you if you try to compete with them there ’s a better than fair chance you ’ll lose precious time and money which kind of defeats the purpose a good wealth manager in short they can save you time and money and help you take the most advantage of your current savings or you can think about it in terms of cost most wealth managers charge an annual fee as a of the amount invested for their services this fee can range anywhere from close to zero to 0.75 depending upon how sophisticated the strategy is that the money will be invested in and what kind of additional services they have to offer investing in the s&p500 on the behalf of the investor should n’t need a fee but investing in a smart beta or an alpha strategy that generates returns independent of the market ’s movement and certainly commands a fee but how does one figure if that fee is justified it is really simple what is the risk adjusted performance of the strategy what is the sharpe ratio large successful funds like renaissance technologies and citadel can charge 3 in addition to 30 of profits because even after that their returns are much better than the market i have this rule of thumb for money management fees that i am willing to pay

here 's the purely mathematical answer for which fees hurt more you say taking the money out has an immediate cost of $ 60,000 we need to calculate the present value of the future fees and compare it against that number let 's assume that the investment will grow at the same rate either with or without the broker that 's actually a bit generous to the broker since they 're probably investing it in funds that in turn charge fees we can calculate the present cost of the fees by calculating the difference between as it turns out this number does n't depend on how much we should expect to get as investment returns doing the math the fees cost 1 = $ that is the cost of the fees is comparable to paying nearly $ 100,000 right now nearly half the investment if there are no other options i strongly recommend taking the one time hit and investing elsewhere preferably in low cost index funds details of the derivation for simplicity assume that both fees and growth compound continuously the growth does compound continuously we do n't know about the fees but in any case the distinction is n't very significant fees occur at a continuous rate of rf = which is negative and growth occurs at rate the ops current principal is p and the present value of the fees over time is f. we therefore have the equation p = p f t solving for f we notice that the components cancel and we obtain f = p p t = p p t = p p 1 t

as said the way to make money is to be there when large amounts of money are changing hands and take a little for yourself they 'll never notice that 's what transaction costs are when a fund buys or sells stocks a bit of the money goes to the folks who handle the transaction when you personally buy or sell stocks a bit of the money goes to the broker in the form of a fee and no no fee brokers do n't work for free they just hide the fee by not getting you the best possible price so frequent transactions i.e. higher portfolio turnover mean that those little bits of money are going to the intermediaries more often that 's what higher transaction costs refers to the costs are higher than in a fund that buys and sells less often in short those higher transaction costs are a consequence of higher turnover nothing nefarious there

make sure to check the language describing the discount the company may be matching your contribution by 5 instead of a discount   you will likely be taxed on the match as compensation and your benefit would net to less than 5    the next risk is that you 've increased your exposure if your company does poorly   in the worst case scenario you could lose your wages to a layoff and your portfolio to a falling share price   investing in other companies will diversify this risk as for benefits you get the 5 less taxes for free which is n't a bad thing in my book just do n't put everything you own into the stock   it should be part of your overall investing strategy

the third friday of each month is an expiration for the monthly options on each stock   stock with standardized options are in one of three cycles and have four open months at any give time   see in addition some stocks have weekly options now   those generally have less interest because they are necessarily short term   anything expiring on april 8 and 22 fridays this year but not third fridays of the month are weeklies the monthly options are open for longer periods of time so they attract more interest over the time that they are open   they also potentially attract a different type of investor due to their length of term although as it gets close to their expiration date they may start to behave more like weeklies

when you refinance there is cost guess around $ to cover lawyers paperwork surveys deed insurance etc etc etc someone has to pay that cost and in the end it will be you even if you get a no points no cost loan the cost is going to be hidden in the interest rate that 's the way transactions with knowledgeable companies works they do business because they benefit profit from it the expectation is that what they need is different from what you need so that each of you benefits but when it 's a primarily cash transaction you ca n't both end up with more money so unless value will be created somewhere else from the process and do n't include the + cash because that ends up tacked onto the principle this seems like paying for financial entertainment and there are better ways to do that

some lenders want to discourage the borrower from making these additional payments because they want to sell this as a service they might set this up for you or they have a contract with a 3rd party to set it up these services generally charge you to initiate the process and may have a recurring fee they take 1/2 a payment every 2 weeks then forward the money on the first of the month to the lender once a year they will send in the 13th monthly payment this gives them control of up to a months payment per account   there is no law that says they have to accept early payments so check the documents to make sure it is allowed for that mortgage then send in a test payment directing that the excess funds go to pay down principal verify online that the extra funds were credited correctly even it works once the borrower will have to keep checking to make sure it is handled correctly each month

this is fine and can definitely be done the bank will be perfectly fine with it since you 're paying interest on the money as long as they 're confident that you can repay the whole growing balance of course there 's the issue of the credit limit which you 'll eventually reach and then you wo n't be able to pull this off any longer problems start when the bank either loses that confidence or the credit line is term limited like heloc for example and comes to term in either case you 'll be required to cover the balance and especially in the first case as a balloon payment if they call on you when you do that you will most likely go bankrupt and the longer you keep doing it the higher are the chances of that happening

yes you should invest and yes you should save for the house down payment these should be two separate pools of money and the goals and time frames for them are different with a 3 year time frame for the down payment on the house the risk you should accept should be essentially zero that means it is less of an investment and more plain vanilla savings account or maybe a higher interest account or a cd the worst thing to have happen would be to try and save for the house while the value of your investment keeps dropping   you have to decide how to allocate your income between retirement accounts and saving for the house while still meeting all your other obligations the exact balance depends on how much you need to save for retirement and things such as rules for the company match

yes if the deceased owned the policy the proceeds are considered part of the estate in the specific case where the estate is worth this year 2011 more than $ 5 m there may be estate taxes due and the insurance would be prorated to pay its portion of that estate tax bill   keep in mind the estate tax itself is subject to change i recall when it was a simple $ 1 m exemption and if i had a $ 1 m policy and just say $ 100 k in assets there would have been tax due on the $ 100k. in general if there 's any concern that one 's estate would have the potential to owe estate tax it 's best to have the insurance owned by the beneficiary and gift them the premium cost each year

if your payment schedule would have you pay the car off after 11 months then you might be best served by leaving a small final payment for july   the loan will appear on your credit for 7 years but the bump to your score will be reduced more after 2 years if you pay it off in less than 12 months    if you would have several payment left after you have the ability to pay it off then just pay it off   the reduction is not severe or worth the price of interest unless you have < 1 unused credit has an attrition factor   if you continue to use your credit in a healthy way > 0 < 20 balance no late payments long term accounts then you should not even realize much of a negative change

working for a lot of startups i have seen this cycle really it has little to do with making the ipo look good because of number of employees and is more about making the ipo look good because of planning for the future many times an ipo is released it will be valued at $ 1.00 made up and the market will soar and spike now stock shares are valued at $ 3.00 great till after the dust settles a bit and stocks are valued at $   this is normal and good   it would be better if the stocks ended a little higher than their initial value but such is life   now the initial value of the stock is made up of basically the value of the company 's assets and employees are part of those assets and its earning power they are also a liability but that has less impact on initial value than assets sales right after ipo are based on how well a company will do part of that is growth so it looks nicer to say we have 500 employees and have been growing by 20 per month than to say we have 100 employees in other words before ipo employees may be hired to make the company look like it is growing they may be hired because the budget is projected based on expected growth and expected valuation   after ipo you get a concrete number you have your budget it may be more than you thought or it may be less in our example the real budget from capital is only 28 of the entire projected budget and 85 of the initial value it 's time to make some budget cuts   also normally there is a period of adjustment company wide as a company goes from vc funding here have as much money as you want to real world funding with stricter limits and less wiggle room

generally a diversified portfolio will give you a better overall return couple of factors that may address what you are looking at 1 correlation the correlation between your two funds is still very high it 's partially a function of how global economies are related and many companies are now multi national   it may help if you diversified into other types of products    2 diversification following up from before you may want to also look into diversifying into some bonds commodities reits etc   they will have a much smaller correlation with a total domestic stock fund 3 returns i 'm not sure if by dominate you mean that it has better overall returns but the point of diversification is to to get you the highest returns   it 's really the ability to limit the risk for the returns this really translates to limiting the volatility   this may mean that overall your max returns could be ie maybe vtsax   gives potential average returns between   a diversified portfolio may give you potential average returns of   a similar article debating the merits of smart beta etfs if you are curious hope that helps

first of all to answer the basic question is one method correct might it depend on local laws yes it does depend on local laws because ultimately the business will have to file forms with the county city   these forms are going to ask for the total sales based on the tax category tax free x% y% each transaction could have parts that fall into each category the local taxing authority decides what goes into each category the local taxing authority also determines how often the business needs to submit the taxes they can even decide to base the rates used by where the customer lives   a business is not required to charge directly for sales tax that is why frequently at sporting events the price on the menu notes that all sales taxes are included i suppose not directly charging a sales tax makes the monthly calculation harder but the state will still get their money rounding up at the end of the entire transaction is enough to make sure they collect enough taxes so they do n't have to dip into their profits

if possible i would disable online payment on the card immediately reduce the limit of online payment to zero i think you should also demand the photocopy back immediately it is tad and maybe he did get it without any ill will but even in this case he should be made aware of the fact that this is wrong note that if he genuinely did it with ill will he will have likely made multiple copies who knows how many so it will not really protect you from fraud in this case then you should call or e mail the card company and/or your bank and tell them what happened i think they would consider the card stolen and maybe advise you on what you should do next note that if he uses the card you might and should try to chargeback the money through the card company but it might be argued that you did not sufficiently protect the details of your card and even if you succeed the process can be long and you will not have access to your money in the meantime this is one of the downsides of a debit card vs credit card you may also consider moving away the money from the associated bank account so that there 's not much to steal of course the situation on that front gets more complicated if account overdrawing is enabled in your account

i think what you really want to look into is put options you can essentially replicate the same thing without worrying about margin calls check out this site a quick glance seems to show it to be pretty good   the way you would limit downside risk is to buy a put option allowing you to sell anytime within the next n months for the current price assuming american this will allow you to limit downside risk however potential profits do go down due to fees as another answer suggests this could be cost prohibitive this type of strategy is also known as a protective put if you wanted to be more refined you could use 's bands although you have to be looking for that specific outcome also due to complexity this can become a taxing in terms of time invested and risky if you are wrong investment either way i think you need to study payoff curves a little more

they already do it is just sneaky how it is done   they have created a system with healthcare where we pay up to three times more per capita than any other western country   they do this by setting up particular legislation and shutting down public options and anything else that might cut out administration and executive profits   they do n't need to directly tax us in order to keep an unreasonable amount of money flowing to corporate executives and wealthy share holders   that is without even getting into and prohibition legislation   one way they could easily keep money flowing to hollywood would be an additional tax refund that applies to legitimate entertainment costs   or perhaps doing as canada does and adding taxes to storage media   they can also continue to cut web freedom options and bandwidth   every bit of legislation i see come down the pipe with only a couple of notable exceptions such as has been about protecting profits for the top of the economic pile at the expense of everyone else   edit   i would also like to mention that our taxes already fund healthcare and in fact we pay so much that we could have a universal system already just with the money we spend via taxes   it is so hyper inflated because of the vast amount of profit built into the system at all levels     we have to cut out admin and profits to the hyper wealthy if we wish to have a reasonable healthcare system   this chart in particular shows the problem     this was just in 2008 costs have increased since then at the accelerated rate   so yes the oligarchy has ways of making us pay without introducing specific new taxation

no it is n't generally believed that inflation is caused by individual banks printing money   governments manage money supply through central banks which may or may not be independent of the state there are a number of theories about money supply and inflation from monetarist to keynesian and so on the quantity theory of inflation says that long term inflation is the result of money supply but short term inflation is related to events local conditions short term inflation is a symptom of economic change   it 's like a cough for a doctor   it simply indicates an underlying event when prices go up it encourages new producers to enter the market create new supply which will then act to lower prices   in this way inflation is managed by ensuring that information travels throughout the economy   if prices go up for specific goods then all things being equal supply should go up since the increase implies increasing demand   if prices go down then this implies demand has gone down and so producers will reduce supply obviously this is n't a perfect relationship   there is which can be caused by a whole bunch of market conditions from banning of short selling to of demand supply your question is n't about quantitative easing which is a state led way of increasing money supply and which could increase inflation but is hoped to increase expenditure and investment so i wo n't cover that here the important take away is that inflation is an essential price signal to investors and business people so that they can assess market cycles   without it we would end up with vast or under supply and much greater economic disruption

short answer liquidity well you have to see it from an exchange 's point of view   every contract they put up is a liability to them   you have to allocate resources for the order book the matching engine the clearing etc   but only if the contract is actually trading they start earning the big money now for every new expiry they engage a long term commitment and it might take years for an option chain to be widely accepted and hence before they 're profitable   compare the volumes and open interests of big chains versus the weeklies and you 'll find that weeklies can still be considered illiquid compared to their monthly cousins having said that like many things this is just a question of demand   if there 's a strong urge to trade july weeklies one day there will be an option chain   but personally i think as long as there are the summer there will be no rush to ask for jul and aug chains

borrowing to invest is almost always a bad idea   you 'd have to take out an unsecured loan which has a higher interest rate or a secured loan and put at risk whatever you are securing the loan with you need some means to make payments on the loan or if interest is being added to the balance then take the compounding effect into account with regards to the cost of the money and how much you will really end up owning in order to come out ahead you need to invest in something that will yield a return that is higher than the cost of borrowing the money such high yields always come with higher risk meaning that you will actually get that return is less and less of a sure thing so now you are talking about the chance to make money or a chance your investment could fail perhaps badly   meaning you could well do nothing but end up in debt with little to nothing to show for it if someone claims to have a sure thing and is encouraging you to borrow money to invest in it i 'd be checking their back for a fin and remembering the when the shark bites start to spread

first of all think of anyone you know in your circle locally who may have gotten a mortgage recently   ask him her or them for a recommendation on what brokers they found helpful and most of all priced competitively second of all you may consider asking a real estate agent   note that this is generally discouraged because agents sometimes and sometimes justifiably get a bad reputation for doing anything to get themselves the highest commission possible and so folks want to keep the lender from knowing the agent   yet if you have a reputable trustworthy agent he or she can point you to a reputable trustworthy broker who has been quoting your agent 's other clients great rates third of all make sure to check out the rates at places you might not expect for example any credit unions you or your spouse might have access to   credit unions often offer very competitive rates and fees   after you have 2 3 brokers lined up visit them all within a short amount of time edit courtesy of the below comments which show that 2 weeks has been quoted but that it may be less   the reason to visit them close together is that in the pre approval process you will be getting your credit hard pulled which means that your score will be dinged a bit   visiting them all close together tells the bureaus to count all the hits as one new potential credit line instead of a couple or several and so your score gets dinged less ask about rates fees they are required by law to give you what is called a good faith estimate of their final fees if pre payment of the loan is allowed required to re finance or for paying off early alternative schedules such as bi weekly or what a 20 year mortgage rate might be the amortization schedule for your preferred loan and ask for references from past clients pick a broker not only who has the best rates but also who appears able to be responsive if you need something quickly in order to close on a great deal

you have to look at stocks just like you would look at smaller and more illiquid markets stock trade in auction markets these are analogous to ebay or craigslist just with more transparency and liquidity there is no guarantee that a market will form for a particular stock or that it will sustain   when a stock sells off and there are no bids left that means all of the existing bidder 's limit orders got filled because someone sold at those prices there is nothing fishy about that it is likely that someone else wants to sell even more but could n't find any more bidders if you put a bid you would likely get filled by the shareholder with a massive position looking for liquidity you could also buy at the ask

interestingly enough strategic default seems to be more common than one might think in california and there is actually a lot of information available on it to include a calculator that breaks down the numbers for you although affiliated with a law office speaking from a purely financial standpoint walking away only makes sense if it puts you in a better financial position than you were before while you had the mortgage if you look at the downsides of walking away the issues with the credit rating are will known but you need to take into account any open lines of credit you currently have as well as any need you might have to open a line of credit in the future if you currently have credit cards will the rates go up after the hit on the housing side of things you mortgage payment is currently a known quantity that will not change for the duration of the mortgage unless you do something to change it however it is fairly rare for rents to not change between years and if you want an apartment or house similar to what you currently have you might find that the rent will fluctuate quite a bit between years and in the long run the rent might run higher than your current mortgage payment likewise in the shorter term if the landlord runs a credit check they might adjust what the rent is or deny you the apartment on the basis of the black mark on your history for reasons that other have mentioned another item to take into account is if you need to get a job in the future depending upon what you do for a living this might be a non issue however if you are in a position of trust walking away from a mortgage payment will reflect negatively upon your character unless you have a very good reason for it this can lead to a loss of employment opportunities next if you walk away from the mortgage you are walking away from the current value of the home and any future value that the home might have if you like where you are living and are n't planning on moving to another part of the country you are gambling that the market will not recover or that you would reach parity with what you owe by the time you need to sell the house if you do plan on staying where you are and the house is in good repair then in the long run you might be giving up quite a bit of money by walking away these are a lot of factors to take into account though so its really hard to say one way or another if a strategic default is a good idea in the long run you might come out ahead but knowing when that date is can be difficult to calculate likewise in the long run it might adversely affect you and you might come to regret the decision   if the payments themselves are a bit too high perhaps you can refinance or negotiate with the bank for a lower payment if you get a better rate but keep your monthly payments the same then you might reach parity with the mortgage much faster which would also be to your advantage

happened to my girlfriend at a non profit that had really generous maternity leave she had been in a manager esque position there for something like 5 years at that point and had been far too generous with her commitment for being an hourly employee she really was n't a manager but she picked up the slack for other people and was generally considered second in command boss leaves for another opportunity recommends her for his job she thinks she is set instead they hire someone outside on who only has slightly more experience    the day the new girl starts she tells them she is pregnant she works for literally a week before going on maternity leave for six months meanwhile my gf has already been taking over all management duties as an hourly employee with no pay improvement for the six months to fill the position and now has to do the same work for six more months no increased compensation no salary i told her to straight up quit and leave them in a bind

trusts are a way of holding assets with a specific goal in mind at its simplest a trust can be used to avoid probate a sometimes lengthy process in which a will is made public along with the assets a trust allows for fast transfer and no public disclosure depending on the current estate tax laws the death tax a trust can help preserve an estate exemption e.g. say the law reverts back to a $ 1 m exemption note this is $ 1 m per deceased person not per beneficiary my wife and i happened to have assets of exactly $ 2 m and i die tomorrow now she has $ 2 m and when she passes the estate has that $ 2 m and estate taxes are based on this total $ 1 m fully taxed but if we set up trusts that first million can be put into trust on my death the interest and some principal going to the surviving spouse each year but staying out of the survivor 's estate second spouse dies little or no tax due   this is known as a bypass trust another example is a trust say hypothetically my sister in law ca n't save a nickel to save her life spends every dime and then some so the best thing my mother in law can do to provide for her is to leave her estate in trust with specific instructions on how to distribute some percent each year this is not a tax dodge of any kind it 's strictly to protect the daughter from her own irresponsibility   a medical needs trust is a variant of the above it can provide income to a disabled person without impacting their government benefits adversely   this scratches the surface illustrating how trusts can be used there are more variation on this but i believe it covers the basics with the interest in this topic i 'm adding another issue where the trust can be useful in my article on my death please take a breath i described how an inherited ira was destroyed by ignorance the beneficiary fearing the stock market withdrew it all and was nailed by taxes he was on social security and no other income so by taking small withdrawals each year would have had nearly no tax due and could have avoided market risk by selling within the ira and buying treasuries or cds   he did n't need a trust of course just education the deceased his sister might have used a trust to manage the ira and enforce limited withdrawals mixing iras and trust is complex but the choice between a $ 2000 expense to create a trust or the $ 40 k tax bill he got is pretty clear to me he took pride in having sold out as the market soon tanked but he could have avoided the tax loss as well he was confusing the account in this case an ira but it could have been a 401(k or other retirement account with the investments it contained one can and should keep the ira in tact and simply adjust the allocation according to one 's comfort level   note inheritance tax laws change frequently and my answer above was an attempt to be generic the current 2014 code allows $ m to be left by one decedent with no estate tax

the total limit book is a composite of all the orders on all of the exchanges while it 's uncommon for a limit order posted beyond the nbbo to fill outside of the nbbo it does occur for example the best ask may be on exchange x but for some reason the smart order routing algorithm may select exchange y if it judges the net trade to be less costly etc and hfts will immediately arbitrage the order between two exchanges or the best order on exchange x disappears causing the order to fill above the nbbo the system is n't perfect because there are multiple exchanges but that eventuality is extremely rare with equities since nearly every exchange will have orders posted at the nbbo because exchange equity fee and rebate schedules are extremely competitive nearly identical   it is however more common with options since less exchanges as a percentage of the total will have orders posted at the nbbo because of very wide exchange rebate and fee schedules how a single exchange handles a new order that crosses an existing limit order is already addressed here how do exchanges match limit orders

in the current system it would be irresponsible to pay more than they have to but if corporations get to be amoral people they need tighter regulation because what 's good for maximizing profits is rarely good for people if you want to argue that businesses are more important than people then perhaps profits should receive favorable treatment to people but i highly doubt lincoln was talking about walmart when he was talking about a government by the people and for the people there 's plenty of businesses out there charging a fair markup for a quality product or service and paying a fair wage it 's not highly profitable but i think we 've been watching the race to the bottom by publicly traded companies maximizing quarterly returns at the expense of literally anything and everything else something 's got ta give   also your argument implies that you 're ok subsidizing walmart 's profit margin with your tax money their employees are receiving government benefits because walmart does n't pay them well enough to afford it on their own figure $ split 190 m ways we us workers all gave walmart a little over $ 30 each

credit cards and debit cards make up the bulk of the transactions in the us   visa and mastercard take a percentage of each credit card transaction   for the most part this fee it built into the price of what you buy   that is you do n't generally pay extra at the grocery store if you use a credit card gasoline purchases are a notable exception here if you were getting something like 2 of a third of all the retail transactions in the us you 'd probably not want to rock the boat too much either   since there is little fraud relative to the amount of money they are taking in and it can often be detected using statistical analysis they do n't really stand to gain that much by reducing it through these methods   sure they can reduce the losses on the insurance they provide to the credit card consumer but they risk slowing down the money machine   these companies want avoid doing something like reducing fraud by 0.5 revenues but causing purchases with the cards drop by 1   more security will be implemented as we can see with the slow introduction of chip cards in the us but only at a pace that will prevent disruption of the money machine   emv will likely cause a large drop in cc fraud at brick and mortar stores but wo n't stop it online   you will likely see some sort of system like you describe rolled out for that eventually

excellent question for a six year old actually a good question for a 20 year old   one explanation is a bit more complicated your son thinks that after the christmas season the company is worth more for example they might have turned $ 10 million of goods into $ 20 million of cash which increases their assets by $ 10 million and is surely a good thing however that 's not the whole picture before the christmas season we have a company with $ 10 million of goods and the christmas season just ahead while afterwards we have a company with $ 20 million cash and nine months of slow sales ahead   let 's say your son gets $ 10 pocket money every sunday at 11 am five minutes to 11 he has one dollar in his pocket five minutes past 11 he has 11 dollars in his pocket is he richer now not really because every minute he gets a bit closer to his pocket money and five past eleven he is again almost a week away from the next pocket money on the other hand on monday he loses his wallet with $ 10 inside he is now $ 10 poorer or his neighbour unexpectedly offers him to wash his car for $ 10 and he does it he is now $ 10 richer   so if the company got robbed in august with all stock gone no insurance but time to buy new stock for the season they lose $ 10 million the company is worth $ 10 million less and the share price drops if they get robbed just before christmas sales start they do n't make the $ 20 million sales so they are $ 10 million poorer but they are $ 20 million behind where they should be the company is worth $ 20 millions less and the share price drops twice as much on the other hand if there is a totally unexpected craze for a new toy going on from april to june and then it drops down and they make $ 10 million unexpectedly they are worth $ 10 million more expected $ 10 million profit = no increase in share price unexpected $ 10 million profit increase in share price   now the second totally different explanation the share price is not based on the value of the company but on what people are willing to pay say it 's november and i own 100 shares worth $ 10 if everyone knew they are worth $ 20 in january i would hold on to my shares and not sell them for $ 10 it would be very hard to convince me to sell them for $ 19   if you could predict that the shares will be worth $ 20 in january then they would be worth $ 20 now the will not go up or down if something good or bad happens that everyone expects it only goes up or down if something happens unexpectedly

because it takes 3 business days for the actual transfer of stock to occur after you buy or sell to the next owner your cash is tied up until that happens this is called the settlement period therefore brokers offer margin which is a form of credit or loan to allow you to keep trading while the settlement period occurs and in other situations unrelated to the presented question to do this you need a margin account you currently have a cash account the caveat of having a retail margin account distinct from a professional margin account is that there is a limited amount of same day trades you can make if you have less than $ 25,000 in the account this is called the pattern day trader rule you do n't need $ 25k to day trade you will just wish you had it as it is easy to get your account frozen or downgraded to a cash account the way around that is to have multiple margin accounts at different brokerages this will greatly increase the number of same day trades you can make many brokers that offer a solution to to people that do n't have 25k to invest are offering professional trading accounts which have additional fees for data which is free for retail trading accounts this problem has nothing to do with   so be careful of the advice you get on the internet it is mostly white noise feel free to verify

banks are businesses and as such should have the right to refuse service so they should probably be able to choose one customer over another at will    i say should because business owners protecting themselves against litigation related to discrimination could restrict their freedom as business owners however banks are businesses and if the customers are identical both will be approved or not according to credit records   does not make sense to approve one person with a given credit record and refuse someone with a similar record   unless they barely qualify   since no two credit histories are identical there are surely edge cases finally if a customer is a long term customer with large deposits and/or significant amounts of business with the bank the bankers will likely be inclined to do more business

growth in a 401k taxes which means more of the gains get reinvested effectively it 's a boosted return rate like any investment a 401k can lose value during the period before retirement lower stock and bond prices actually help you buy more shares than you could if prices were high so the real question is what the funds are doing at the time you start pulling money back out that concern is why investors generally not just 401k investors should change their investment mix over time to balance risk against time to recover and possible reward   and if your employer matches 401k contributions to any degree that too improves your effective gains and buffers you against some of risk hence the general advice that if you do n't fund your 401k at least enough to max out the company match you 're leaving free money on the table

you can take a queue from any sales opportunity and position it in ways that will still appeal to someone who intends to continue working perpetually here are some of the points i would make 401k matching funds are free money that you will have access to in ~20 years whether you retire or not long term savings that grow in the stock market turn into residual income that will add to your standard of living whether you retire or not there are tax advantages to deferring income if you are in a high tax bracket now you will have flexibility to withdraw that money in future years where you might have lower earnings for example in a future year you could take a sabbatical trip to europe for a few months without pay and draw on your savings during that time that you are not making money even if you do n't invest in a 401k you and max out hsa accounts if you are eligible and position that as money for medical expenses if you never have medical reasons to spend that money you can still withdraw at retirement age like a 401k or ira though it gets taxed as income if not used for qualified medical purposes at retirement time with an unwilling partner it 's difficult to make a lot of progress but if you have matching funds from your employer do make sure that you are getting at least those for yourself ultimately if he does n't want to save for himself you should for yourself there are no guarantees in life if he dies or leaves you must be prepared to take care of your own needs

what you are describing does not sound like an investment it sounds like a loan an investment involves you putting up a stake and sharing in the profits or losses of the business there is no guarantee you will get your money back a loan involves you putting up money for which you will receive interest and principal repayment in accordance with an agreed schedule you get this irrespective of how the business is performing also is the arrangement with your friend or his company they are different legal entities and your risk profile is different in both cases whatever the arrangement you need to sign a contract which details all the terms and conditions how much you will pay to whom and when how much you will get back from whom and when a method for resolving disputes what happens in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy what happens if someone breaks the terms of the contract if your payout depends on the value of the business at some future date how it is to be valued etc etc two points i am not a lawyer i am not your lawyer

debt increases your exposure to risk   what happens if you lose your job or a major expense comes up and you have to make a hard decision about skipping a loan payment   being debt free means you are n't paying money to the bank in interest and that 's money that can go into your pocket debt can be a useful tool however   it 's all about what you do with the money you borrow   will you be able to get something back that is worth more than the interest of the loan a good example is your education   how much more money will you make with a college degree   is it more than you will be paying in interest over the life of the loan   then it was probably worth it instead of paying down your loans can you invest that money into something with a better rate of rate of return than the interest rate of the loan   for example why pay off your 3 student loan if you can invest in a stock with a 6 return   the money goes to better use if it is invested   note that most investments count as taxable income so you have to factor taxes into your effective rate of return the caveat to this is that most investments have at least some risk associated with them   stocks do n't always go up   you have to weigh this when deciding to invest vs pay down debts   paying down the debt is more of a sure thing another thing to consider if you have a long term loan several years paying extra principal on a loan early on can turn into a huge savings over the life of the loan due to power of compound interest   extra payments on a mortgage or student loan can be a wise move   just make sure you are paying down the principal not the interest   and check for early repayment penalties

major things to consider if you 're expecting to look at the property market it might prove to be sensible to start doing it now since the market is just recovering and imho warning not a professional investor just a random guy on the internet prices still has n't caught up with value fundamentals   check out cash isa 's for a 24 36 month timeframe most do a reasonable 3 4 with the current inflation rate being around 4 this will at the very least make sure your money does n't loose it 's purchasing power finally a word of caution have a rather rubbish rates this by itself would n't be much of a problem on a 30 40 years timeframe but keep the current and historically strictly increasing 4 inflation rate in mind this implies the purchasing power of any money tied in these vehicles will   loose it 's purchasing power in a compounding manner hope this helps let me know if you have any questions

a strategy of rebalancing assumes that the business cycle will continue that all bull and bear markets end eventually   imagine that you maintained a 50 split between a us treasury bond mutual fund and an s&p 500 stock mutual fund vfinx beginning with a $ 10,000 investment in each on january 1 2008 then on the first of each year you rebalanced your portfolio on the first of january we can pretend the markets are open that day the following table illustrates the values in each of those funds with the rebalancing transactions this second table shows what that same money would look like without any rebalancing over those years obviously this is cherry picking for the biggest drop we 've recently experienced but even if you skipped 2008 and 2009 the increase for a rebalanced portfolio from 2010 2017 is 85 verses 54 for the portfolio that is not being rebalanced in the same period this is also a plenty conservative portfolio you can see that a 100 stock portfolio dropped 40 in 2008 but the combined portfolio only dropped 18 a 100 stock portfolio has gained 175 since 2009 compared to 105 for the balanced portfolio but it 's common to trade gains for safety as you get closer to retirement you did n't ask about a 100 stock portfolio in your initial question these results would be repeated in many other portfolio allocations because some asset classes outperform others one year then underperform the next you sell after the years it outperforms then you buy after years that it underperforms

it is typically possible to sell during a crash because there are enough people that understand the mechanics behind a crash generally you need to understand that you do n't lose money from the crash but from selling every single crash in history more than recovered and by staying invested you would n't have lost anything this assumes you have enough time to sit it out it could take several years to recover on the other side of those deals are people that understand that and make money by buying during a crash they simply sit the crash out and some time later they made a killing from what you panic sold when it recovers its value

different stocks balance dividend versus growth differently some have relatively flat value but pay a strong dividend utility stocks used to be examples of that model and bonds are in some sense an extreme version of this some especially startups pay virtually no dividends and aim for growth in the value of the stock and you can probably find a stock that hits any point between these this is the growth versus income spectrum you may have heard mentioned in the past investors took more of their return on investment as dividends conceptually a share of the company 's net profits for the year reflecting the share 's status as partial ownership if you wanted to do so you could use the dividend to purchase more shares via a dividend reinvestment plan or not but that was up to you these days with growth having been strongly hyped many companies have shifted much more to the growth model and dividends are often relatively essentially this assumes that everyone wants the money reinvested and will take their profit by having that increase the value of their shares of course that 's partly because some percentage of stockholders have been demanding growth at all costs not always realistically   to address your specific case no you probably are n't buying microsoft because you like its dividend rate you 're buying it in the hope it continues to grow in stock value but the dividend is a bit of additional return on your investment and with other companies the tradeoff will be different that 's one of the things along with how much you believe in the company that would affect your decision when buying shares in specific companies personally i mostly ignore the whole issue since i 'm in index funds rather than individual stocks picking the fund sets my overall preference in terms of growth versus income after that it 's their problem to maintain that balance

a simple and low interest loan is probably the least likely to cause aside from a direct gift you seem to be describing an equity stake in their house where some portion of the appreciation in value accrues to you relative to your initial investment   an equity stake in their house probably does n't make much sense   you sound as though you 're not going to do any of the work aside from the contribution of money   equity might make sense as a way to reward you for efforts such as home design or renovation that increase the value of the home   you probably do n't want to be in a position where you are together improving the property and your payback only comes when she sells for more money   what if you have different ideas of how to do it   she has to live there and may want improvements for her needs rather than for buyers   what if she asks you to pay for a portion of the improvement costs or you not offering   what if she does n't want to sell for some reason so your money is locked up with her family choices   renovations can often be stressful so these decisions may be made at difficult times either a gift or a low interest family loan may be simpler for your needs   you can just set the loan terms you want say payoff over 10 years or a deferred payment schedule   if she gets in trouble you could perhaps delay or forgive payments   i do n't know the uk tax consequences of a loan of this nature if any as a general proposition it 's best to set clear and simple expectations at the beginning and avoid agreements that require multiple decisions to be made in the future possibly during a time of stress

as it stands equity contracts in startups are by default structured differently the standard equity is shares or convertible notes   having equity that 's structured in the way you propose is a bad idea for both sides vc do n't like equity that 's not done with standard equity contracts if the lawyer of the vc has to review your equity document and understand how the exact terms work that makes it more complicated to invest money into the startup on your end it might not be fair because a company does n't need to make any income to be successful various companies manage to reduce their tax burden to next to nothing by clever accounting that results in having no taxable income uber brought the domain name with 2 equity at the beginning so there are certainly deals that get made with equity there are also other kinds of deals where domain names do n't get sold for a one time payment but with regular payment for 8 years where the domain names goes back to the seller if the company folds or otherwise does n't want to pay anyone

if you mean if i invest say $ 1000 in a stock that is growing at 5 per year versus investing $ 1000 in an account that pays compound interest of 5 per year how does the amount i have after 5 years compare then the answer is they would be exactly the same   as kent anderson says compound interest simply means that as you accumulate interest that for the next interest cycle the amount that they pay interest on is based on the previous cycle balance plus the interest for example suppose you invest $ 1000 at 5 interest compounded annually after one year you get 5 of $ 1000 or $ 50 you now have $ 1050 at the end of the second year you get 5 of $ 1050 not 5 of the original $ 1000 or $ so you now have $ etc stocks tend to grow in the same way but here 's the big difference if you get an interest bearing account the bank or investment company guarantees the interest rate unless they go bankrupt you will get that percentage interest but there is absolutely no guarantee when you buy stock it may go up 5 this year up 4 next year and down 3 the year after the company makes no promises about how much growth the stock will show it may show a loss it all depends on how well the company does

do you plan a monthly budget at the beginning of each month   this might seem counter intuitive but hear me out doing a budget is of course critically important for those who struggle with having enough money to last the month   having this written spending plan allows people struggling with finances to control their spending and funnel money into debt reduction or saving goals   however budgeting can also help those with the opposite problem there are some like you perhaps that have enough income and live frugally enough that they do n't have to budget   their money comes in and they spend so little that the bank account grows automatically   it sounds like a good problem to have but your finances are still out of control just in a different way   perhaps you are simply because you do n't know if you will have enough money to last or not by making a spending plan you set aside money each month for various categories in three broad areas since you have plenty of money coming in generously fund these spending categories   as long as you have money in the categories when you go to the store you can feel comfortable splurging a little because you know that your other categories are funded and the money is there to pay those other bills   create other categories such as technology or home improvement and when you need an app or have a home improvement project you can confidently spend this money as it has already been allocated for those purposes if you are new to budgeting software such as ynab can make it much easier

it 's a deal and i bet that trump wins in 2020 and hillary rots in jail way before that   gt i 'm not saying the email thing would n't have lost some people their jobs and brought on possible charges but it 's not a super serious crime   people went to jail for taking a picture not shared with anyone of a secret place   but just the fact that sleazy hillary with fake news cnn to cheat on debate questions something that my son would be expelled from school if he cheat like that on his test something that never ever happened before and there was no need for it it 's just debate questions the trump handled very well all this to show you how corrupt evil untrustworthy and conspiring is the dnc and hillary true or false

the way to think about this is what would happen to the family if stay at home mom were to die you obviously ca n't do anything about the loss grief and trauma but think about the financial implications assuming that dad continues to work and that the child is young you are going to have to find someone to take care of him her if you have relatives willing to step in that may be fine but if not you will have to pay for daycare an expense you do n't now have that 's going to get less as the child goes to school but not go away until he she is old enough to look after themselves bringing up a child as well as working a full time job is pretty demanding you may find that you do n't have as much time for cleaning the house cooking or other chores having a sum of money which can be used to hire help or pay for a few meals out can be very useful in these cases here is an article which places a value on the work done by a stay at home mom you might not need to pay for all of those services but it gives you an idea of what the extra expenses might be   think about what extra money you might need to spend and arrange for life insurance to cover it

for each class a share googl there 's a class c share goog hence the missing half in your calculation the almost comes from the slightly higher market price of the class a shares due to them having voting powers over class c which have no voting powers there 's also class b share which is owned by the founders larry sergei eric and perhaps some to stanford university and others and differs from class a by the voting power these are not publicly traded

a huge part of the problem is that low income people have been very heavily marketed to by the online and for profit colleges because they were eligible for financial aid mainly loans and were seen only as a straw through which to suck money out of the government by these schools because they were only interested in the money there was no attempt to qualify students in many of these schools or provide any support to them when students dropped out their counselors would keep signing them up for classes that they did n’t know about or attend    because a lot of the schools are bullshit schools with either no reputation or a poor one even those who finished were largely not able to get the high paying jobs they were promised in order to lure them in this goes for low income students especially ones whose families have no previous experience with post high school education across the board and all of this group is far more likely to default because they were basically ripped off got nothing useful from these bogus schools and were often outright defrauded and do not have the income they were told they would have when agreeing to the loans but because there is a higher percentage of minorities among this group they are more likely to be but our student loan system does n’t differentiate between loans for real and loans for these rip off schools so you are still 100 on the hook regardless even if they signed you up for several more worth of classes after you withdrew   it ’s a lot like the mortgage collapse desperate to keep making money the lenders targeted increasingly less qualified people who were also naive about the entire system and sold them terrible loans sometimes talking them out of more reasonable options and then when the whole thing starts to fail it ’s all because the government made the banks give mortgages to poor black people   the institutions suck up the money and leave bewildered poor people holding the bag now even poorer with nothing to show for the debt they will literally be digging out of forever    the obama administration finally took some steps to control the predatory for profit institutions and try to sort out who had been ripped off vs people who had genuinely received any useful education but of course the new sec of education is doing her best to roll all that back   and most of the victims are n’t teens either they are adults with kids who were trying to do something to better themselves and their lives and got screwed over some of these middle aged people will literally be having their social security garnished to pay for these loans it ’s disgusting and even more so to say it ’s all affirmative action

you can often convert the outstanding balance of a heloc into a fixed rate home equity loan generally with the same bank   doing this can open possibilities to extend the term allowing for lower monthly payments but resulting in a larger overall payoff cost most helocs allow for an interest only payment or in some cases no payment at all if you still have unused available credit not advising that you do this if you are struggling with the size of the payment converting to a fixed rate fixed term loan may be what you need the key will be getting the term such that you can manage both the principal and interest that will be included in the payment

to your first comment yup to your second comment a = l + e. if e goes down and l goes up the net effect is 0 then if l goes down and a goes up the net effect is 0 and we are balanced once again there is no rebalancing equity you just have to make sure that at the end of your journal entries the accounting equation holds   it 's a very concept to wrap your head around but spend some time mapping out the flow of various journal entries once it clicks you 'll really understand the logic

i 'm not sure how this gets entered in turbotax but this income from the company should be included in the schedule c or c ez line 1 gross receipts total along with all of your 1099-misc income from your business and any other income that your business took in you do n't need a 1099 from them and the irs does n't care at least from your perspective if you got a 1099 or not in fact they probably expect you to have some income   we do n't know why the company chose not to issue 1099 forms but luckily it is n't your concern you can fill out your tax return properly without it   note this answer assumes that you did n't have any tax withheld from your checks from this company if you did have tax withheld you 'll need to insist on a 1099 to show that

1.45 and 1.40 are the last trade prices   the last trade 1.45 for the 27 strike call must have occurred earlier than the last trade 1.40 for the 26 strike call   these options have low liquidity and do n't trade very often   you have to look at the bid and ask prices to see what people are currently bidding and asking for those options   as you can see the premium based on the bids and asks does decrease the further you go out of the money

i moderate in r finance and this is completely on the they should disallow purposefully inflammatory nonsense this would prevent the r politics bleed over and might help this place become    the best part is that the second bullet on the sidebar is /r business is not the place for stories about the government 's economic policies or corporate corruption yet there are constantly links about so and so ceo fiddling with his compensation or shareholders fraud etc

this will end badly the only question is how long it will take performing bank transfers is not difficult and there is no way a 3rd party would be paying her large sums of money to perform these transfers unless the purpose was illegitimate and they were taking advantage of her   in my experience it is as simple as entering the target bank account routing and account entering the name this is not double checked by the bank to associate with the target account entering a dollar amount and then agreeing to the terms of the transfer there are not people out there who have a lot of money but would rather pay somebody $ 2000 + to do 2 minutes of work in an unofficial capacity instead of just doing it themselves unless they are trying to hide something and/or take advantage of a mark

is likely reserve based lending which is a type of asset based financing in world where debt is secured by oil reserves   presumably context is that have an company that the analyst thinks should be acquiring other companies   to fund that the analyst is saying the parent company should borrow money against their reserves should be relatively inexpensive capital b c asset backed and then using it to fund acquisitions   for the target 's capital structure those amounts are equity infused by the parent even though the parent got the money by borrowing it   the target can then borrow money against its own operations this borrowed money will gear up the target gearing is just a term for leverage typically specifically debt to equity ratio   so to fund the acquisition the parent is 1 going to borrow using a on parent 's assets to come up with equity to put into target and 2 going to borrow against target 's business   presumably today target is relatively debt free or even cash heavy

this is why minimum wage has not gone up   its a fallacy way of thinking   your business will be required to do one of 4 things   raise prices fire employees remove pointless expenses or you take a hit   more than likely you will attempt to do situation 1 because you need all your employees you currently have   if you could work with less employees as a business owner you would of already had done that   the next part is you will find things that are pointless   why are you paying for a certain type of yeast when you found out you can get the same type from someone else cheaper   finally you may have to take the hit to yourself   the market will balance itself out   however this is the big part people do nt understand   the larger companies like to dick people over as much as possible   you think walmart which already uses illegal workers on their farms has everything made in china is going to raise prices the exact same amount   of course not   they will raise prices but nothing like that and the only people who will be hurt is the companies profit sheets and the ceo pay   that is nothing that will ruin a company   furthermore that person who was making around 7 dollars an hour will have a higher income to spend and instead of purchasing crap bread from walmart they will now splurge sometimes and purchase higher end bread from such as yourself   i think people do nt understand that companies will do and always done everything they can to save money   walmart will have no choice but to either raise prices or not make as large of a profit as they once made   the company wo nt fail the economy will also continue but the wealth is now going to spread out more   i wish i could make more people understand this but alas they will believe that you ca nt raise prices because it will ruin the economy   what s ruining the economy is actually letting the min wage stay so low   it basically turns most people into indentured servants because they can barely afford to live   does that make sense

sorry for the late reply   gt different erp systems have different mappings but there are no unlimited amount of erp systems   it 's actually close to unlimited reasons   1 even if two customers use the same erp system each implement their erp in a different way   2 even if they implement the erp system exactly the same way the edi is done by an edi and each customer will implement edi in a different way   3 even if it 's the same edi system and map each customer may have different meaning to the same data field for example one customer definition for due date is the date the vendor needs to ship the goods to me while the other customer says it 's the date i want the goods delivered to my warehouse   4 even if all the fields have the exact same definition the values may be different between the 2 customers classic example while customer a use sku for a certain widget made by the vendor the other customer may use sku   5 it 's even worse than you think if say a huge company like wal mart implemented edi orders in its specific way wal mart has 100,000 suppliers so each of those suppliers have to implement the wal mart way of edi orders   6 even worse when wal mart make a change to their edi orders e.g. add a new type of data 100,000 suppliers have to change their system support the new data requirements   do me a favor i only addresses one statement you made can you cut and paste your whole message and post it again in /r edi this is the right subreddit for this discussion you should join it and several people can reply to you   thanks

i 'd say that it can not be meaningfully calculated or measured because the two are just too different in every way poker stock trading i guess the last point that someone relying on luck is in poker but not in stock trading could be interpreted as stock trading being based more on luck while the second and third points indicated that poker has more true randomness and is thus based more on luck something both have in common is that people who have been losing money are often tempted to take stupid risks which lose them everything
