the accounting equation in short is this can be further broken down into which can be further broken down into the gnucash equation is right though i would substitute the word equity in that equation with a more specific paid in capital equity is simply put made up of 2 parts shareholders equity and retained earnings shareholders equity is the amount invested by shareholders retained earnings is the amount earned by the business on behalf of the shareholders retained earnings is directly affected by your net income which is income minus expenses an increase in income will result in an increase in retained earnings this must be balanced somewhere usually an increase in an asset it may also be balanced by a decrease in equity likewise increase in expenses will result in a decrease in retained earnings which must also be balanced

if your income stream goes up it would usually increase both your income term and your assets term since that money sits in your bank account as an asset even more likely a combination of assets and expenses go up if you have cost associated with the increase in income   in this case they balance in the equation and your equity does n't change the question as you posed it is true mathematically but the paradox happens because you 're not taking into account where the money form the increased income falls in other terms of the equation

equity is the term to make things balance in a simple transaction you get $ 100 paid to you income goes up by $ 100 and the asset of whatever bank account or petty cash drawer you put it into also goes up by $ 100 equity is unchanged if for some reason you had to take some income into your books but no asset increased no debt decreased and you had no way to take an offsetting expense into your books then this would lower your equity how else to explain having earned $ 100 but having nothing to show for it

the money you invested in your roth was taxed as income when you filed your income tax    a roth contribution is post tax as opposed to a standard ira or 401k contribution which are pre tax pre tax contributions lower your taxable income for the year in example you had income of $ 100,000 and made a standard ira contribution of $ 5000 your taxable income would be $ 95,000 in the case of a roth contribution the same $ 5000 investment would not reduce your taxable income for the year

in the case of a vehicle with a lien there is a specific place on the title to have a lien holder listed and the holder of the lien will also hold the title until the lien is cleared usually this means you have to pay off the loan when you purchase the vehicle if that loan is held by a bank meet the seller at the bank and pay the loan directly with them and have them send the title directly to you when the loan is paid this usually involves writing up a bill of sale to give to the bank when paying the loan the only thing you 're trying to avoid here is paying cash to the seller who then keeps the cash without paying the lien holder who then keeps the title and the motorcycle do n't pay the seller if they do n't have the title ready to sign over to you

behind the scenes mutual funds and etfs are very similar   both can vary widely in purpose and policies which is why understanding the prospectus before investing is so important since both mutual funds and etfs cover a wide range of choices any discussion of management assets or expenses when discussing the differences between the two is inaccurate   mutual funds and etfs can both be either managed or index based   high expense or low expense stock or commodity backed method of investing when you invest in a mutual fund you typically set up an account with the mutual fund company and send your money directly to them   there is often a minimum initial investment required to open your mutual fund account   mutual funds sometimes but not always have a load which is a fee that you pay either when you put money in or take money out an etf is a mutual fund that is traded like a stock   to invest you need a brokerage account that can buy and sell stocks   when you invest you pay a transaction fee just as you would if you purchase a stock   there is n't really a minimum investment required as there is with a traditional mutual fund but you usually need to purchase whole shares of the etf   there is inherently no load with etfs tax treatment mutual funds and etfs are usually taxed the same   however capital gain distributions which are taxable events that occur while you are holding the investment are more common with mutual funds than they are with etfs due to the way that etfs are structured   see fidelity etf versus mutual funds tax efficiency for more details   that having been said in an index fund capital gain distributions are rare anyway due to the low turnover of the fund conclusion when comparing a mutual fund and etf with similar objectives and expenses and deciding which to choose it more often comes down to convenience   if you already have a brokerage account and you are planning on making a one time investment an etf could be more convenient   if on the other hand you have more than the minimum initial investment required and you also plan on making additional regular monthly investments a traditional no load mutual fund account could be more convenient and less expensive

i would not concede your money to your dad if he is really you and we need much more detail to tell   this is the first lesson in life that actually following up on wrong things will save you thousands of dollars throughout your adulthood   it is really easy to turn the other way and be out a few thousand dollars   then the hospital you and you let it go and so on   follow up it is your money the laws behind this are pretty cut and dry   basically if you put money into one account and only your money was touching the account then it is your money   as a minor this is an expectation and once your turn 18 in the us you have a right to your money   that is given that the money was in the account at 18 so if your dad truly did not touch the account and withdraw the money before you turned 18 it is cut and dry   if your dad took money out before 18 or added his own money to the account it gets rather fuzzy since it is easy for dad to say that i took money out for your expenses as for this being nuclear as keshlam suggests he is right   his advice is fine but sets you up for people taking advantage of your throughout your life especially your family   in fact the situation is already nuclear but you were the only thing the bomb hit    so talk to your dad   explain that you will have to go and file a small claims trial if he does not agree to give you the money   if your situation is already over the top i would bring the paperwork with you filled out   a person at your local clerk 's office will help you find the right forms you on the other hand better weigh this conversation   we internet peoples are only hearing one side of the story   we do not understand your situation at your home   we do n't understand who pays for your car gas clothes and room and board   you are 18 so there is no obligation for parents to pay for these things    if i had an 18 year old that had 3 k in the bank under my name and they had n't helped around the house in a year did n't buy their car had a poor attitude and so on i would probably have the same action as your dad   yea it 's your money but is it really   when i was 18 i bought all my clothes bought my car bought my gas insurance and so on   i paid for my toothpaste   if this is where you are at and you help out around the house like an adult would then you have solid ground to stand on if not i would laugh if i were your dad   my first thought would be you want your money that is fine   but you are paying rent   car is gone get your own   you would be paying for everything   but you would have your money   so you have some pros and cons to weigh here and taking the money could cost you a ton of money in the future   however if your dad is just being a pure jerk i kind of doubt this but who knows then you have an obligation to fight for what is yours note that the end goal of any meeting like this in your life should n't be court   it should be an agreement so that the right action is taken and both parties are happy   it could be very well that your dad would be happy with something that has nothing to do with the money   also there are people with really really bad situations at their homes   a controlling parent is a pretty good bad situation and an easy one to solve at 18 move out   if you do n't want to move out then accept your family members not complain about them   no matter how controlling your dad is your question of teenager   i am sure you are n't that bad and i am sure your dad is n't that bad and another note   in no way shape or form am i suggesting you drop the money issue   there is nothing worse than not talking about it even if you think your dad will kick you out of the house   resentment building up in yourself or family is the worst possible thing   this needs to be dealt with

if this is your friend and he that convinced he will get rich from this then there 's really nothing you can do   you 've obviously done your best to explain the situation to him but he 's been caught up in their sales pitch and that 's more convincing to him i worked in sales for many years and the answers he gives you the one about not needing to know the details of how your smartphone works is a classic variation of typical objection handling that salespeople are taught proves that he has been sucked in by their scheme at this stage all you 're going to do is ruin your friendship with him if you continue to press the matter because he has made it clear he ca n't be convinced that this is anything other than legitimate   the reality is he is probably in too deep at this stage to just walk away from it so he has to convince himself that he made a wise choice schemes like this use a scarcity approach there 's only so much to go around and if you do n't get yours now then someone else will get it coupled with ego boosting boy mr. prospect this is such a great opportunity and you 're one of only a few who are sophisticated enough to understand and take advantage of it to get people to lower their guard and not ask a whole lot of probing questions nobody wants to feel stupid and they do n't want others to think they 're stupid so these schemes will present the information in such a way that ordinarily prudent questions come across as sounding dumb making the questioner seem not so smart   rather than walking away from it peoples pride will sometimes make them double down on it and they 'll just go along with it to come across as though they get it even when they really do n't the small payouts at early stages are a classic sign of a ponzi scheme   your friend will never listen to you as long as those little checks continue to come in because to him they 're absolute proof he 's right and you 're wrong   it 's those checks or payouts however they 're doing it that will make him step up his efforts to recruit other people into the scheme or worse yet invest more of his own money into this keep in mind that in the end you really have no power to do anything in this situation other than be his friend and try to use gentle persuasion   he 's already made it clear that he is n't going to listen to your explanations about why this is a scam for a couple reasons   first and probably greatest it would be an admission that he 's dumb or at least not as smart as you and who wants that   second he continues to get little checks that reinforce the fact this must be real or why else would he be getting this money   third he has already demonstrated his commitment to this by quitting his job so from his point of view this has become an all or nothing ticket to wealth    the bottom line is these schemes work because the sales pitch is powerful enough to overcome ordinary logic for people who think there just has to be an easy way to easy street all you can do is just be there as his friend and hope that he sees the light before the damage to himself and anyone else gets too great   you ca n't stop him from what he 's doing any more than you can stop the sun from rising as long the message and checks he 's getting from other people keep him convinced he 's on the right path edit after reading the comments posted in this thread i do want to amend my statements because many good points have been raised here   you obviously ca n't just sit by and do nothing while your friend talks others into taking the same or worse risks that he is   that 's not morally right by any measure at the same time however be very careful about how you go about this   your friend as you stated sounds pretty much like he 's all in with this scheme so there 's definitely going to be some serious emotional commitment to it on his part as well   anyone and everything that threatens what he sees as his ticket to easy street could easily become a target when this all comes crashing down as it inevitably will   you could very well be the cause of that in his eyes especially if he knows you 've been discouraging people from buying into this nightmare people are not rational creatures when it comes to money losses   it 's called costs where they 'll continue to chase their losses on the rationale they 'll make up for it if they just do n't give up   the more your friend committed to this the worse his about losing so he 'll do whatever he has to in order to save his position   this is what gamblers do and why the house does so well for itself some have suggested making anonymous flyers or other means of communicating that do n't expose you as the person spreading the message and that 's one suggestion   however the problem with this is that since the receiver has no idea who sent the message they 're not likely to give it the kind of credibility or notice that they would to something passed to them by a person they know and trust and your anonymous message will have little weight in the face of the persuasive pitch that got your friend to commit his own money and future another problem as you 've noted is that you do n't travel in the same circles as the people he 's likely to recruit so how would you go about warning them   how would they view their first contact with you when it comes with a message not to trust what someone else they already know is about to tell them   would they write it off as someone who 's   hard to tell another huge ploy of these schemes is that they tend to preemptively strike at what you propose doing that is warning people to stay away   they do this by projecting the people giving the warnings as losers who did n't see the opportunity for themselves and now want to keep others away from their own financial success   they 'll portray you as someone who is n't smart enough to see this huge opportunity and since you ca n't understand it you do n't think anyone else does either   they 'll point out that if you were so good with finances why are n't you already successful these guys are very good and they have an answer for every objection you can raise whether its to them or to someone else   they 've spent a long time honing their message which makes it difficult for anyone to say something persuasive enough to sway others away from being duped   this is a hard path no doubt i hope you are able to warn others away   just be aware that it may come at a cost to you as well and be prepared for what that might be i hope this helps good luck

as i stated in my comment options are futures but with the twist that you 're allowed to say no to the agreed on transaction if the market offers you a better deal on whatever you had contracted to buy or sell you have the option of simply letting it expire options therefore are the insurance policy of the free market you negotiate a future price actually you usually take what you can get if you 're an individual investor the institutional fund managers get to negotiate because they 're moving billions around every day then you pay the other guy up front for the right of refusal later how much you pay depends on how likely the person giving you this option is to have to make good on it if your position looks like a sure thing an option 's going to be very expensive and if it 's such a sure thing you should just make your move on the spot market it 's thus useful to track futures prices to see where the various big players are predicting that your portfolio will move a put option which is an option for you to sell something at a future price is a hedge against loss of value of your portfolio you can take one out on any single item in your portfolio or against a portion or even your entire portfolio if the stock loses value such that the contract price is better than the market price as of the delivery date of the contract you execute the option otherwise you let it expire a call option which is an option to buy something at a future price is a hedge against rising costs the rough analog is a pre order in retail but more like a holding fee they 're unusual in portfolio management but can be useful when moving money around in more complex ways basically if you need to guarantee that you will not pay more than a certain per share price to buy something in the future you buy a call option if the spot price as of the delivery date is less than the contract price you buy from the market and ignore the contract while if prices have soared you exercise it and get the lower contract price stock options offered as benefits in many companies are a specific form of call option with very generous terms for whomever holds them a swaption basically a put and a call rolled into one allows you to trade something for something else call it the free market 's exchange policy for a price if a security you currently hold loses value you can exchange it for something else that you predicted would become more valuable at the same time one example might be airline stocks and crude oil when crude spikes airline stocks generally suffer and you can take advantage of this if it happens with a swaption to sell your airline stocks for crude oil certificates there are many such closely related inverse positions in the market such as between various currencies between stocks and commodities gold is inversely related to pretty much everything else and even straight up cash for bad debt arrangements credit default swaps which we heard so much about in 2008

it depends a large part on your broker 's relationship with the issuing bank how early you can participate in the ipo round but the nature of the stock market means the hotter the stock and the closer to the market away from the issuing bank you have to buy the higher the price you 'll pay the stock market is a secondary market meaning the only things for sale are shares already owned by someone as a result for a hot stock the individual investor will have to wait for another investor not the issuing bank to trade sell the stock

disallowed losses due to the wash sale rule are added to the basis of the repurchased shares   in your example on day two you paid $ per share then the disallowed $ 0.30 loss from the previous day gets added to the basis making your total basis $ 1.00 per share when you sell at the end of the day for $ 1.00 per share your net gain loss is zero furthermore you can recapture disallowed losses by selling the last lot of abc completely yourself of all holdings in abc for at least 31 days even if that last lot was a loss when taking into account the increased basis from previously disallowed wash sale losses you can claim the loss fully on this last non wash sale

rent does n't give you any ownership in a property so is largely irrelevant here if you were paying rent after the death of your parents that money would go to the owners of the house which may include you similarly whether or not someone was evicted is completely irrelevant if the will specifies how the estate should be divided that 's what 's relevant here you seem to imply that the house was left to 10 people barring specific other arrangements the most likely case is that the house will be sold by the and the proceeds divided evenly between all ten people again though it 's going to depend on the specifics of the will there are many possible cases where you may end up with nothing for example if there are a lot of debts these must be paid off before dividing up the money from the sale of the house if you are not getting the answers you need from the you need to consult a lawyer

i would n't advocate it but one reason to pay a lower interest rate is if you have $ 990 on a $ 1000 limit credit card with 6 interest and $ 5000 on a $ 15k limit card at 10 interest having $ 500 to pay in a month and putting it on the lower interest would free up a greater percentage of credit on that card and could potentially help your credit rating i believe i think having $ 1000 on 10 different credit cards w/ $ 15k limit reflects better than $ 10k on one $ 15k card regardless of interest rates personally i think that 's dumb b c having the extra credit available is an opportunity to get into trouble a lot easier

i would n't worry about it probably would n't be best time for withdrawal aspect too much   with a bit of planning and organization you could cash out investments held in one country and have them reinvested in another one in a matter of days if not less your time out of the market   if the markets are cheap when you sell the chances are you 'll be able to buy in again at much the same price   there 's a small chance you miss out on the markets upwards but you might just as easily miss out on a fall and come out ahead   old saying time in the market is more important than market timing tax it 's hard to discuss without mentioning specific countries   e.g if you were resident in the uk you 'd probably want to invest within an isa tax free wrapper gains are tax free and there 's no penalty for withdrawing when you leave   no idea what equivalents there are around europe interestingly there seems to be some recognition by the eu that this sort of thing is an issue for an increasingly mobile workforce was recently some news of plans for a pan european pension savings vehicle

i 'm far from certain but i 'll take a swing at it   equilibrium term structure models predict a term structure that we do n't observe and no arbitrage models correct prediction to match reality   an analogous place to look would be implied volatility surfaces   black scholes predicts a specific implied volatility surface or rather it assumes the surface is flat   so i think a hull white style no arbitrage model might work by addressing the difference between predicted and actual surfaces   like term structure models you 'd take a set of observed volatilities and somehow plug them into bs so that the bs price did n't imply arbitrage opportunities within the observed set of options   i 'm not at all certain that i 'm being clear and there 's a distinct possibility that i 'm saying thinking something stupid

when you buy a futures contract you are entering into an agreement to buy gold in the future usually a 3 month settlement date   this is not an option but a contract so each party is taking risk the seller that the price will rise the buyer that the price will fall   unlike an option which you can simply choose not to exercise if the price goes down with futures you are obligated to follow through or sell the contract to someone else or buy it back   the price you pay depends on the margin which is related to how far away the settlement date is but you can expect around 5 so the minimum you could get into is 100 troy ounces at todays price times 5   since we 're talking about 100 troy ounces that means the margin required to buy the smallest sized future contract would be about the same as buying 5 ounces of gold   roughly $ 9 k at current prices if you are working through a broker they will generally require you to sell or buy back the contract before the settlement date as they do n't want to deal with actually following through on the purchase and having to take delivery of the gold   how much do you make or lose lets deal with a smaller change in the price to be a bit more realistic since we are talking typically about a settlement date that is 3 months out and to make the math easy lets bump the price of gold to $   that means the price of a futures contract is going to be $ 10 k    lets say the price goes up 10   well you have basically a leverage since you only paid 5 so you stand to gain $ 20,000 sounds great right   wrong because as good as the upside is the downside is just as bad   if the price went down 10 you would be down $ 20000 which means you would not only have to cough up the 10 k you committed but you would be expected to top up the margin and throw in   another $ 10,000 as well   and if you ca n't pay that up your broker might close out your position for you oh and if the price has n't changed you are mostly just out the fees and commissions you paid to buy and sell the contract   with futures contracts you can lose more than your original investment   not for the faint of heart or the casual investor   not for folks without large reserves who can afford to take big losses if things go against them   i 'll close this answer with a quote from the site i 'm linking below the large majority of people who trade futures lose their money    that 's a fact they lose even when they are right in the medium term    because futures are fatal to your wealth on an and    temporary price blip now consider that especially the bit about price blip and then look at the current volatility of most markets right now and i think you can see how futures trading can be as they say fatal to your wealth man i love that phrase what a great way of putting it   this site has a pretty decent primer on the whole thing their view is perhaps a bit biased due to the nature of their business but on the whole their description of how things work is pretty decent   investopedia has a more detailed and perhaps more objective tutorial on the futures thing   well worth your time if you think you want to do anything related to the futures market

california bankruptcy law requires disclosure of any gift made by the person declaring bankruptcy in the past 12 months and any asset transfers in the past 2 years with a couple of minor exceptions this would most certainly include the car if it is back to you such a claim would likely be considered fraudulent though this would be a matter for the lawyers and bankruptcy trustee in question there 's a blog which you may wish to check out the california bankruptcy blog which has a specific entry on gifts now there is a specific exemption for automobiles but only up to a total of $ legally i believe there 's nothing you can do here if the $ 10 k was a loan it will be discharged in bankruptcy if it was a gift it 'll have to be declared and the car will have to be sold if or transferred it must be declared and will likely but not definitely be determined as an invalid disposal of assets either you or your family member will have to discuss this with a bankruptcy lawyer i 'm sorry your generous act is likely to get tangled up here

normally yes kind of i do n't personally think in terms of generating profit when making business it purchasing decisions i merely think in terms of adding value    but in the context of the article    you buy a technology consider well whether it is going to increase your revenues or decrease your costs if it would not then there is no point buying it       a dr bc facility will never generate profit it will hopefully allow you to continue generating the profit you were generating any way should shit go bad but even then your costs are likely to go up    so when i say kind of i mean you 're right in that profit can mean more than numbers on a balance sheet but the writer of the article seems to present profit in those black and white terms the article appears to advocate something that is not particularly good practice but deems to call it so

first thing i 'd say is do n't start with investing the foundation of solid finances is cash flow making more than you spend reliably knowing where your money goes having a system that works for you to make sure you make more than you spend until you have that your focus may as well be on getting there because you ca n't fix much else about your finances until you fix this a number you want to know is your percentage of income saved and a good goal for that is about 15 with 10 12 going to retirement savings and the rest to shorter term goals and emergency fund and so forth of course the right percentage here depends on your goals and situation but for most people this is a kind of minimum savings rate to be in good shape focus on your savings rate this is your profitability if you view yourself as a business if it 's crappy or negative your finances will be a mess two ways to improve it are to spend less or to improve your earnings power doing both is even better the book your money or your life by and robin is good for showing how to focus on cash flow even though you may not share their for early retirement a simpler exercise than what they recommend take 3 months of your checking and credit card statements go through each expenditure and put them in a spreadsheet column sum that column then add up 3 months of after tax paychecks divide both numbers by three and compare the 3 months is to average out your spending which probably varies a lot by month after positive cash flow and savings rate the next thing i 'd go through is insurance risk management for what you have this can include checking you have all the important insurance coverages renter 's auto potentially umbrella term life disability and of course health insurance are some highlights and also adjusting all your policies to be most cost effective which usually means raising the deductible if you have a good emergency fund often you can raise the deductible on policies you have and use the savings to add more catastrophe coverage such as term life if you did n't have it or boosting the liability protection on your homeowner 's or whatever remember cover catastrophes as cheaply and comprehensively as possible but do n't worry about reimbursement for non catastrophic expenses i like this book smart and simple financial strategies for busy people by jane because it covers all the main personal finance topics not just investing and because it is smart and simple all the main stuff to think about is in the one book and the advice is solid and investing can truly be dead easy most people would be fine with this advice honestly i do micro optimize and undermine my investing and i 'm guessing most people on this forum do but it 's not something i could defend objectively as a good use of time it probably is necessary to do some reading to feel financially literate and confident in an investment plan but the reading is n't really because a good plan is complicated it 's more to understand all the complicated things that you do n't need to do since that 's how you 'll know not to do them especially when salespeople and publications and tv are telling you over and over and over that you need to know a bunch of crap and do a bunch of things people who have a profitable business of me are the ones who end up with a lot of money not people who spend a lot of time screwing with investments people who get rich investing invest professionally as their business of me they do n't goof around with their 401k after work financial security is all about your savings rate i.e. your personal profitability no shortcuts other than lotteries and rich

you 'd need to test the assumptions here in effect you 're saying that in 15 years your account will have a balance 10x your income but normally you 'd expect your income to grow over the years e.g. promotions and so you 'd hope that your income in 15 years would be significantly larger than what it is now    but even in the case where your account eventually does grow to 10x your salary at that time it may still be worth continuing to contribute in effect adding a further 1 to your account is boosting the compounding return on your account by 1 after fees and risk free this additional 1 return in effect makes your retirement plan safer you either get a higher total return for the same investment mix or you can get the same total return for a slightly safer investment mix in effect you 're treating your salary as a safe annuity and each year putting 10 of the return from that into your more risky retirement account

you can look at the company separately from the ownership the company needs money that it does n't have therefore it needs to borrow money from somewhere or go bankrupt   and if they ca n't get money from their bank then they can of course ask people related to the company like the two shareholders for a loan it 's a loan like every other loan that needs to be repaid how big the loan is does n't depend on the ownership but on how much money each one is willing and capable of giving the loan does n't give them any rights in the company except the right to get their money back with interest in the future   alternatively such a company might have 200 shares and might have given 75 to one owner and 25 to the other owner keeping 100 shares back in that case the shareholders can decide to sell some of these 100 shares i might buy 10 shares for $ 1,000 each so the company has now $ 10,000 cash and i have some ownership of the company about and the 75 and 25 shares have gone down because now they own 75 out of 110 or 25 out of 110 shares i wo n't get the $ 10,000 back ever it 's not a loan but the purchase of part of the company

learn something new every day i found this interesting and thought i 'd throw my 2c in good description i hope from short selling what is short selling first let 's describe what short selling means when you purchase shares of stock in purchasing stocks you buy a piece of ownership in the company you buy sell stock to gain sell ownership of a company when an investor goes long on an investment it means that he or she has bought a stock believing its price will rise in the future conversely when an investor goes short he or she is anticipating a decrease in share price short selling is the selling of a stock that the seller does n't own more specifically a short sale is the sale of a security that is n't owned by the seller but that is promised to be delivered   still with us here 's the skinny when you short sell a stock your broker will lend it to you the stock will come from the brokerage 's own inventory from another one of the firm 's customers or from another brokerage firm the shares are sold and the proceeds are credited to your account sooner or later you must close the short by buying back the same number of shares called covering and returning them to your broker if the price drops you can buy back the stock at the lower price and make a profit on the difference if the price of the stock rises you have to buy it back at the higher price and you lose money so what happened the plan the reality lesson i never understood what shorting a stock meant until today seems a bit risky for my blood but i would assume this is an extreme example of what can go wrong this guy literally chose the wrong time to short a stock that was in all visible aspects on the decline   how often does a large company or individual buy stock on the decline and send that stock soaring how often does a stock go up 100 in 24 hours 600   another example is recently when bought 10 of weight watchers and caused the stock to soar 105 in 24 hours you would have the day you shorted that stock on that particular day if you believed enough to gamble on it going down in price

in the us we have social security taxes where for a full time employee the company pays half and the employee pays half   when you work as a business what we call 1099 for the form that the wages are reported on then the contractor pays the full amount of social security tax there are times when a contractor can negotiate a higher rate because the company does not have to pay that tax   however most of the time the company just prefers to negotiate the rate based on your value   if you are a 60 k year guy then that is what they will pay you   from the company 's perspective it does not matter what your tax rate is only the value you can bring to the company   if you can add about 180 k to the bottom line then they will be happy to pay you 60 k and you should be happy to get it here in the us a contractor can expect to make about 7.5 more of an equivalent employee because of the social security tax savings to the company   however not all companies are willing to provide that in compensation   some companies see the legal and administrative costs of employees as normal and the same costs with contractors as extra so they do n't perceive a cost savings   there are other things that would preclude employers from giving the bump although it is logical to do so first you will really have to feel out your employer for the attitude on the subject   then i would make a logical case if they are open to providing extra compensation in return for tax savings   if i am an employee at 60 k you would also have to pay the government   how about you pay me 75 k as a contractor instead that would be a great deal for all in the us

many people assume that if the price of something is $ 10 and they have 1,000 of that thing they should expect to be able to sell them for something around $ 10,000   such an assumption may hold much of the time but it does n't always   worse the cases where it fails to hold are often those where it would be relied upon most heavily   such an assumption should thus be considered dangerous in a liquid market the quantity of a something that people would be willing to buy at something close to the market price will be large relative to the quantity that people would seek to sell in the short term   if at some moment in time one person in the market was willing to immediately buy 500 shares at $ 9.98 and another was willing to immediately buy 750 at $ someone seeking to sell 1,000 shares could immediately receive $ for them selling 500 to the first person and 500 to the second who would then be ready to buy 250 more from the first person who was willing to sell for $   such behavior would be in line with what many people 's assumptions in an illiquid market however the quantity of something that people would be willing to buy near market price could be surprisingly low   this is more often a problem in the marketplace of things like collectibles than of stocks but the same thing can happen in the stock market   if there 's one potential buyer for a stock who thinks it 's overpriced but has potential and would be worth $ 9.50 but that person only has $ 950 to spend and nobody else thinks the stock would be worth more than $ then until people sold a total of 100 shares the price would be $ 9.50 but after that the price would drop instantly to $ 0.02   there would be no of the fall   if the person with 1,000 shares was first in line he 'd get to sell 100 shares for $ 950 to the aforementioned seller but would be unable to get more than $ 18 for the remaining 900 a major danger with markets is that markets which are perceived as liquid attract people to the buying side while those which are seen as illiquid people   the danger in the latter is obvious having people flee a seemingly illiquid market will reduce its liquidity further but the former is just as bad   having people flock to a market because of its perceived liquidity will increase its liquidity but can also create a false price floor causing demand to appear much stronger than it actually is   unless real demand increases to match the false price floor the people who buy at the higher price will never be able to recoup their investment

yeah i was a libertarian until they said they want to end the federal reserve i 'm more of a conservative    your point that a minimum wage at a major metropolitan area is often not a livable wage is irrelevant wages are a   fee given to employees for their work the way an employee earns a high wage is by providing value that is greater than that wage if the value an employee brings to an employer is less than the wage he 's paid an employer will lay off that individual because the employee costs the employer money therefore setting a minimum wage simply means you ban certain individuals usually first time workers or otherwise unskilled from the workforce because they currently do not have the skills and/or experience to justify that wage furthermore the higher you set the minimum wage the more people you deprive of jobs

when property changes hands the sale prices may or may not be used to determine the appraised value of the property and they may or may not be used to determine the appraised value of other properties because of the nature of the transaction you already have an existing business relationship the local government is likely to ignore the data point provided by your transaction when determining values of similar properties they have no idea if there was some other factor used to determine the price they will also not include in the calculation transactions that are a result of foreclosure becasue the target price is the loan value not the true value   california and some other jurisdictions do add another wrinkle you will need to determine if the transaction will trigger a of the property value in some states the existing laws of the state limited the annual growth of the assessment but that could now be recaptured if the jurisdiction rules that this is a new ownership california board of equalization change in ownership frequently asked questions how does a change in ownership affect property taxes each county assessor 's office reviews all recorded deeds for that    county to determine which properties require under the    law the county assessors may also discover changes in ownership    through other means such as taxpayer self reporting field    inspections review of building permits and newspapers once the    county assessor has determined that a change in ownership has    occurred proposition 13 requires the county assessor to reassess the    property to its current fair market value as of the date ownership    changed since property taxes are based on the assessed value of a property at    the time of acquisition a current market value that is higher than    the previously assessed proposition 13 adjusted base year value will    increase the property taxes conversely if the current market value    is lower than the previously assessed proposition 13 adjusted base    year value then the property taxes on that property will decrease only that portion of the property that changes ownership however is    subject to for example if 50 percent of the property is    transferred the assessor will reassess only 50 percent of the    property at its current fair market value as of the date of the    transfer and deduct 50 percent from any existing proposition 13 base    year value in most cases when a person buys a residence the entire    property a change in ownership and 100 percent of the    property is to its current market value

from your description it seems that you should have $ 75k of basis i.e. after tax amount in your traditional ira as others have mentioned in comments you might have had to report this in the year it was rolled over i will assume that you will have figured this out having after tax amounts in a traditional ira is tricky as you usually ca n't choose to take out only the after tax portion withdrawals as well as conversions to roth ira must be pro rata which means that the amount of pre tax and post tax money in the withdrawal or conversion follows the same proportion as in the ira overall so say 7.5 of your traditional ira is after tax and the other is pre tax that means any withdrawal will consist of pre tax and post tax in those proportions so e.g. if you withdraw or convert $ 1000 $ 75 will be post tax and $ will be pre tax so any withdrawal or conversion will consist overwhelmingly of pre tax amounts which will be taxed and you may not want that at this time there is one way to separate the pre tax and post tax amounts in a traditional ira but it involves having an active 401(k which i doubt you have at this point as you 're retired some 401(k plans allow people to rollover funds from traditional ira into it if they allow this then you can use it to siphon only pre tax money from the traditional ira as irs does not allow rollover of post tax money into a 401(k this way you can rollover the entire pre tax amount of the traditional ira into the traditional 401(k leaving behind only after tax money in the traditional ira which you can immediately convert to roth ira with no tax

the standard interpretation of can i afford to retire is can i live on just the income from my savings never touching the principal to estimate that you need to make reasonable guesses about the return you expect the rate of inflation your real costs remember to allow for medical emergencies major house repairs and the like when determining you average needs not to mention taxes if this is n't all tax sheltered and then build in a safety factor you said liquid assets and that 's correct you do n't want to be forced into a reverse mortgage by anything short of a disaster an old rule of thumb was that properly invested you could expect about 4 real return after subtracting inflation that may or may not still be correct but it makes an easy starting point if we take your number of $ 50k year today 's dollars and assume you 've included all the tax and contingency amounts that means your nest egg needs to be or $ i 'm figuring i need at least $ 1.8 m liquid assets to retire the $ 1.5 m you gave would under this set of assumptions allow drawing up to $ 60k year which gives you some hope that your holdings would mot just maintain themselves but grow giving you additional buffer against emergencies later having said that some folks have suggested that given what the market is currently doing it might be wiser to assume smaller average returns or you may make different assumptions about inflation or want a larger emergency buffer that 's all judgement calls based on your best guesses about the economy in general and your investments in particular   a good financial advisor not a broker will have access to better tools for exploring this using techniques like monte carlo simulation to try to estimate both best and worst cases and can thus give you a somewhat more reliable answer than this rule of thumb approach but that 's still probabilities not promises another way to test it find out how much an insurance company would want as the price of an open ended inflation adjusted $ 50k a year annuity making these estimates is their business if they ca n't make a good guess nobody can admittedly they 're also factoring the odds of your dying early into the mix but on the other hand they 're also planning on making a profit from the deal so their number might be a reasonable one for self insuring too or might not or you might decide that it 's worth buying an annuity for part or all of this paying them to absorb the risk in the end ya pays yer money and takes yer

the risk reward relation depends on what you are changing in the most cases people ask about it is not linear but i will give examples of both nonlinear case 1   as you diversify your portfolio the firm specific risks of various stocks cancel each other out without necessarily affecting the expected return of the portfolio   reduction in risk without any loss in returns very nonlinear   nonlinear case 2 if you are changing the weights in your portfolio to move along the efficient frontier then you the risk reward relation is a which is nonlinear nonlinear case 3 if you are changing the weights in your portfolio to move away from the efficient frontier then you increase risk without adding a fully amount of return   there could be many paths along the risk reward plane but generally it will not be linear in the sense that it will not be on the same line as your initial efficient portfolio and your savings account linear case 1 the most common sense in which we think of the risk reward relation being linear is when the thing you are changing is the size of your investment   if you take money out of savings to put in your fully diversified portfolio without changing the relative weights your expected returns will increase linearly linear case 2 if you believe the capm then the expected return of an asset stock is linearly proportional to the market risk of the firm   if you could change the market risk of a single asset without changing anything else then you would linearly change its expected return the general rule about the risk reward relation is this if you are changing the size of your investment the relation is linear   if you are changing its composition the relation is nonlinear

does this make sense i 'm concerned that by buying shares with post tax income i 'll have ended up being taxed twice or have increased my taxable income the company will then re reimburse me for the difference in stock price between the vesting and the purchase share price sure   assuming you received a rsu for shares worth $ 10 and your marginal tax rate is 30 all made up numbers either or so you 're in the same spot either way   you paid $ 300 to get $ 1,000 worth of stock taxes are the same as well   the full value of the rsu will count as income either way and you 'll either pay tax on the gains of the 100 shares in your rsu our you 'll pay tax on gains on the 70 shares in your rsu and the 30 shares you bought   since they 're reimbursing you for any difference the cost basis will be the same although you might get taxed on the reimbursement but that should be a relatively small amount this first year i wanted to keep all of the shares due to tax reasons and because believe the share price will go up i do n't see how this would make a difference from a tax standpoint you 're going to pay tax on the rsu either way either in shares or in cash   how does the value of the shares going up make a difference in tax additionally i 'm concerned that by doing this i 'm going to be hit by my bank for exchange fees foreign money transfer charges broker purchase fees etc   that might be true if that 's the case then you need to decide whether to keep fighting or decide if it 's worth the transaction costs

your question boils down to saving for a house or saving for retirement why not do both if you invest in a roth 401k or roth ira you can withdraw any contributions that are at least 5 years old without penalty assuming you 're willing to put off purchasing a little longer than your original 2 3 years if you qualify as a first time home buyer i.e. you have n't owned a home in at least 2 years you can withdraw investment earnings as well if your distribution is earmarked towards the down payment and is no more than $ 10000 although you wo n't be penalized for using investment earnings for a down payment you will still have to pay taxes on them so this may be more appealing to someone that has enough contributions to avoid dipping into the investment earnings the only other downside is that contributions to a roth investment are not tax deductible like traditional ira and 401k contributions are instead they grow tax free and distributions are tax free when you reach retirement age

the value of debt is that it allows you to profit from the return of equity beyond the amount of actual net equity you own   of course this only works if the cost of borrowing is less than your return on equity   market timing matters a great deal but is n't accounted for in this view   for my answer i would like to hand wave away market timing considerations   one plausible justification is that you could default on your current home and then immediately go buy one of equal value   if you buy a new home of a lesser value due to lack of funds and then prices appreciate then you missed some opportunity cost but probably not $ 100k worth of it moving on here are some helpful assumptions i 'll make i 'll ignore performance of your portfolio after retirement and only seek to optimize f which will be your net worth upon retirement   in either case your current net worth is earning the r2 rate   we can convert this for both your current net worth and future savings using conversion formulas present to future value f = p annual to future value f = s 1 r2 adding these together is sufficient to obtain f in the case that you have no borrowing power   the case where you do not default and maintain your credit score is different due to an initial $ 100k penalty and the amortized value of borrowing power   in a completely theoretical sense you get an effective yield on all borrowed money   the future value will be the following f = a1 one step is missing however which is to convert this value the value of having a good credit score into present value to compare to value of your defaulting p of borrowing power = f = a1 now let 's put some specific values in   say that you can borrow $ 300k with your good credit history and this applies for the next 25 years after which you retire   the borrowing rate is 7 and the time value of money to you is 10   i would then calculate p of borrowing power = $ 58 k < $ 100 k this indicates that it would be more economical to default   of course some people might point out that it will be removed from your record after 7 years   if you plug 7 years instead of 25 years into the equation almost no assumptions about rates will lead to the option of keeping your house being preferable so in a nutshell the value of your credit is probably less than $ 100k in a purely mathematical sense   but there are other factors too   if you do n't have that borrowing ability maybe you would n't be able to borrow money to start the business of your dreams   if you are a rock star entrepreneur then time value of money to you could be 1,000 yield sure then maybe you could make the above numbers work to favor keeping the house   i 've also neglected ethics   as other people point out it would be like stealing from the bank

assuming that the conversion was completely non taxable i.e. your traditional ira was 100 basis then the converted money can be taken out at any time whatsoever no 5 year or age stuff without tax or penalty similar to directly contributed money for withdrawing conversions and rollovers within 5 years of the conversion or rollover the penalty only applies to the part of the conversion or rollover that was taxable since in this case the conversion was completely non taxable there is no penalty on the withdrawal however note that the ordering of the conversion money is not the same as for contribution money and this may be significant in some cases when you take money out of roth ira it goes 1 contributions 2 rollovers and conversions and 3 earnings however money within 2 is then further divided by year with rollovers and contributions for earlier years ordered before rollovers and contributions for later years and then within each year the taxable rollover and conversion money are ordered first before the non taxable money so what does that mean well suppose you made a roth ira conversion that was taxable one year and then the next year you make a contribution if you withdraw a little bit it comes from the contribution which is ordered first which means no penalty now suppose in that second year you had a backdoor roth ira contribution instead of a regular contribution if you withdraw the first year 's conversion is ordered first and since it 's within 5 years there 's a penalty it 's still true that withdrawing the backdoor roth ira has no penalty but you do n't get to that money until you finish the other one if you 've never made a taxable conversion before then this issue does n't exist

cfd 's are highly speculative so they should represent a very small proportion of your asset or less if you need the 100 for food or rent then definitely not   however if you have some money spare that you could afford to will definitely need more than 100 and you are prepared to put the time and effort it to learn and manage your risks carefully then there is no reason why you should n't try it   i would advise against trading on a demo account for learning most of what you need to learn is how to stick to your plan while under emotional pressure i also would n't call it gambling but managing risk the best traders only win half of their trades so they might have a losing streak of 5 10 or 20 trades if they are trading 5 of their capital with each trade then poof they 're out their winning trades might make 10 100 times the amount risked so they know that it is more profitable to always only risk around 1 sticking to that requires discipline    this page has a pretty comprehensive introduction

you 're a god damn idiot anyone who actually read a little about the debt knows it does n't even matter our debt shows a strong economy and dollar it shows value and investment worthy anyone can buy treasury bonds you me apple you think our debt is at 20 t because it 's all we can get invested fuck no people are waiting in line to buy new treasury bonds they 're solid investments for people who do n't want to worry about stock trading and know for a fact in 30 years they get their money and interest but somehow you think the jews were able to pool enough money to lend out 20 t but not have the ability to increase the debt and lend out 5 t a year and not 600b hah

i am a realtor when i am approached directly by a buyer it 's their choice to bring their own agent come unrepresented or buy through us via disclosed dual agency with no buyer agent my office and i get the full commission the seller has already agreed to a fixed percent of the sale price how does it benefit me to agree to this   update from all the comments below i 'll add this the realtor site country wide states   a real estate professional can also agree to rebate a portion of    his her commission to a consumer   however note that some states do    have laws prohibiting the payments of rebates to    individuals and so this would not be legal in those jurisdictions so far so good my own state massachusetts says or rebates to the seller or buyer are permissible given    that the seller or buyer in the transaction is a principal and is not    required to be licensed as a broker brokers are by definition    agents for either the seller or buyer consequently using    to attract listings or giving incentives such as rebates for those who    purchase a listed property do not violate the prohibition on sharing    valuable consideration with those who are brokering without the    benefit of a license the sellers and buyers in purchase and sale    transactions are not acting for anyone else and therefore are not    brokering indeed it is their broker who acts on their behalf thus in my state what op asks for is legal and a matter of whether or not either broker wishes to participate if another member wishes to research ny laws that would be great

that 's actually pretty close to what the original goal for arbitration was arbitration was envisioned as a way to resolve disputes between two businesses in a niche industry by an expert in that industry rather than by an court the idea being that someone in the chicken processing industry for example would know more about a chicken processing related dispute than a judge would   but then somewhere along the way the courts and congress got a hard on for arbitration clauses and started allowing them everywhere somehow they continue to overlook the fact that letting an industry expert resolve a dispute between someone else in the industry and an customer is profoundly unfair   and that 's how arbitration became yet another good idea that got perverted

of course but then paper also has utility so do seashells and    there is no obvious reason why even in a perfect world we would go looking for a malleable highly conductive corrosion resistant metal as something to peg the value of our banknotes to    the argument in favor of a gold standard is not whether gold is intrinsically more valuable than paper or seal skins or anything else it 's that gold is fairly inelastic in terms of supply so it limits the ability of central bankers to mess up the value of the currency through funny business    if you picked up a rock and started going around telling people that we should use it as money because it 's highly malleable and conductive and can be used in computer parts they would look at you like you 're a crazy person that 's not why gold is was should be a currency    gold was the perfect currency for thousands of years because it was easy to identify easy to handle hard to and rare those were important characteristics when strangers had to carry physical money to different places without any atms credit cards or paypal accounts they are somewhat less critical today but still   the one characteristic that might still argue in favor of a gold standard is rarity since the amount of gold in the world is somewhat fixed forcing the currency supply to be restricted to the gold supply semi prevents governments and central bankers from getting into too much or at least that 's the theory    i will leave it to others to argue over whether a return to the gold standard would be a good idea but the argument has nothing to with the intrinsic utility of gold i 'm sure we can all agree that gold is a fine metal with many good qualities

between two people purchasing a house together one with good and one with bad credit will having both persons on the loan raise the interest rates if the house deed is on both names generally the bank would insist the loan should also be on both of your names this to ensure that bank has enough leverage to recover the house in case of default if one of you has bad credit bank would raise the interest rate assumption that bad credit would drag the good credit and force him to some activities actions that could stretch the finance of one with good credit if timely payments are not made it would make your good credit to bad if the house deed is on only on your name and you can get the loan on your own this would be a better position if the house deed is on only on your name and you would like to loan to be on both names then the positive side is credit score of the person with bad credit would start showing improvement over period provided both of you make timely payments as pointed out by keshlam there are enough question where people have entered into agreement without deciding what would happen if they separate there is no right wrong answer it would be best you decide how it would be with respect to the ownership in the house and with respect to payments and if in worst case you part ways how the settlement should look like

companies in the us will take care of paying a portion of your required income tax on your behalf based on some paperwork you fill out when starting work   however it is up to you as an individual to submit an income tax return   this is used to ensure that you did not end up under or overpaying based on what your company did on your behalf and any other circumstances that may impact your actual tax owed in my experience the process is similar in europe   i think anyone who has a family a house or investments in europe would need to file an income tax return as that is when things start to get complex

it only matters for purposes of the dependent so if you are clearly at 50 then you do n't need to calculate this cost   if it is close to not being 50 then you will have to allocate between your sister and mother   to calculate support costs you can of course include the costs incurred for transportation per pub 17 p 34   if you and your sister have an arrangement where she uses the car and in exchange she shoulders extra costs for your mother then that 's legitimately your expense for your mother as long as this is a true agreement then it was money she owed you but paid directly to the vendors and creditors that you would have paid note that there is a simpler avenue   if your sister agrees that you will claim your mother as dependent and nobody else provides any substantial support of costs then she can just agree that it 's you who will claim her   if you like such an agreement may be attached to your taxes possibly using form   as a general rule though you do not need to use or any other agreement nor submit any support calculations   if your sister verbally agrees that she has n't and wo n't claim your mother then it 's unlikely to cause any problems   her signed agreement not to claim your mother is merely the most conservative possible documentation strategy but is n't really necessary   see pub 17 p 35 on multiple support agreements for more info

in the other question the op had posted a screenshot circa 2010 from transunion with suggestions on how to improve the op 's credit score   one of these suggestions was to obtain retail revolving accounts   by this they are referring to credit accounts from a particular retail store   stores have been offering credit accounts for many years and today this usually takes the form of a store credit card   the credit card does not have the visa or mastercard logo on it and is only valid at that particular store   for example target has their own credit card that only works at target stores   the revolving part simply means that it is an open account that you can continue to make new charges and pay off as opposed to a fixed retail financing loan such as you might get at a high end furniture store where you obtain a loan for a single piece of furniture and when it is paid off the account is closed the formula for credit scores are proprietary secrets   however i have n't read anything that indicates that a store credit card helps your credit score more than a standard credit card   i suspect that transunion was offering this tip in an attempt to give the consumer more ideas of how to add credit cards to their account that the consumer might not have thought of   but it is possible that buried deep in the credit score formula there is something in there that gives you a higher score if you have a store credit card as an aside the op in the other question had a credit score of and was trying to make it higher   in my opinion this is pointless   remember that the financial services industry has an incentive to sell you as much debt as possible and so all of their advice will point to you getting more credit accounts and getting more in debt

probably not in general if you withdraw money from a 401k before age 59 1/2 you must pay a 10 penalty there are some special cases you can withdraw money to pay certain unreimbursed medical bills if you are disabled or to pay back taxes you can also withdraw money if you are dead see there is also a provision that you can make penalty free withdrawals as long as you take them regularly made as part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments beginning after separation from service and made at least annually for the life or life expectancy of the participant or the joint lives or life of the participant and his or her designated beneficiary the payments under this exception except in the case of death or disability must continue for at least 5 years or until the employee reaches age 59½ whichever is the longer period see i do n't quite understand this rule you ca n't take money out one time but you can take money out multiple times oh well i think the idea is supposed to be that you can take out money for an early retirement

you will almost certainly be able to sell 10,000 shares at once the question is a matter of price if you sell at market then you may get a lower price for each batch of the stock sold one person buys 50 another buys 200 another buys 1000 etc at varying prices will you be able to execute a single order to sell them all at the same price at the same time nobody can say and it 's not really a function of the company size the exchange has what 's called open interest which roughly correlates to how many people have active orders in at a given price this number is constantly changing alongside the bid and ask particularly for active stocks so let 's say you have 10,000 shares and you want to sell them for $ 100 each what you need is at least 10,000 in open interest at $ 100 bid to execute by contrast let 's say you issue a limit order at $ 100 for 10,000 shares your ask will stay outstanding at that price and you 'll be filled at that price if there are enough buyers i you have a limit sell order at $ 100 for 10,000 shares the strike price of the stock can not go to $ 100.01 until all of your sell orders are filled

you could certainly look at the holdings of index funds and choose index funds that meet your qualifications   funds allow you to see their holdings and in most cases you can tell from the description whether certain companies would qualify for their fund or not based on that description particularly if you have a small set of companies that would be problems you could also pick a fund category that is industry specific i invest in part in a healthcare focused fund for example   pick a few industries that are relatively diverse from each other in terms of topics but are still specific in terms of industry a healthcare fund a commodities fund an reit fund   then you could be confident that they were n't investing in defense contractors or big banks or whatever you object to however if you do n't feel like you know enough to filter on your own and want the diversity from non industry specific funds your best option is likely a socially screened fund like is likely your best option given there are many similar funds in that area you might simply pick the one that is most similar to you in philosophy

i 'm going to make an educated guess on 1 money markets invest in bonds with a very short time to maturity an mma at a bank will be invested in government bonds yields on these bonds are really low right now thus the yield on that mma is going to be pretty low when you make a deposit in a savings account the bank uses some of that money to lend back out to its customers in the form of car loans mortgages etc these rates are higher so the bank is willing to pay you a bit more than the yield mma so they can use your money for these loans for 2 your time window is short so there are n't really a lot of options for you keeping your money where it is will actually cost you money in fees you can do as i suggested in my comment above close the current savings account that 's hitting you with fees and open a free high yield savings account you might get 1.1 if you average $ 60k in the account over the next 6 months you 'll earn $ 200 250 after taxes you did n't ask about cds but lately shorter term cds are paying less than savings accounts going out to a year will get you just above the rate on a high yield savings account two years just a little more these are outside your goal window so they are n't an option for you

first i do n't think your parents are ripping you off but you should get your agreement in writing the fact that you never own more than 25 does n't matter if the condo 's value is increasing you are in fact building equity your share of the equity just does n't increase but it does n't decrease either for example if the condo is worth $ 300,000 now you have $ 75,000 in equity of course if the value is decreasing so is your equity if you are paying $ 500/month in interest as op clarified above and you do n't have a written agreement you are probably unable to claim that payment as mortgage interest if you itemize your deductions on u.s. federal or state tax returns thus you may be losing out on a legal tax deduction assuming you earn enough to itemize they will need to give you each year the proper irs form for mortgage interest form 1098 and they have to claim the $ 500/month as interest income on their tax returns having a written and signed contract eliminates confusion and potential for misunderstanding the future and it sounds like you are already experiencing some doubt and confusion now your rate seems within market rates for an interest only loan let 's say you wanted to buy out your parents share of the condo right now would you pay $ 115,000 or would you have to get an appraisal to find out what the condo is worth now if you ca n't answer that question you need to get that in writing so that you wo n't have an argument over it someday if the condo has appreciated significantly and all you have to pay is the $ 115,000 then that 's a sweet deal for you because you 'd be buying out a much more valuable property for much less than it 's worth if that is the agreement and the property is appreciating no guarantee especially with condos then you are essentially building equity if the property is declining in value and you do wish to sell it then you wo n't have to pay $ 115,000 they 'll just end up with their 75 share which will be less than the $ 115 k they invested both of you would lose some of your investment but you would have had all the benefits of living in a nice condo all those years and they would n't they are definitely taking more risk than you are second if you had $ 40,000 cash saved up your parents probably raised you with some good financial sense and work ethic so i 'm optimistic they have good intentions for your future operate from that frame of mind when you go to ask for a written agreement next read up about equity share agreements there are many models that will help inform your decisions but you should engage a real estate lawyer to help you draw up a fair agreement for both parties   i was in an equity share agreement for my first townhouse it 's a common practice and it wo n't cost all that much to get one created it 's worth the money to get it done properly

i 've been using ynab4 for the last few years and i like it so much that i have n't switched to the web version new ynab yet   however i have played around with the web version a little and here is what i have discovered despite the different look of the credit card account and the lengthy dissertation on the credit card differences in the transition guide credit cards are handled almost exactly the same in the new ynab as they were in ynab4 you enter credit card spending transactions in the same way as ynab4   when you enter a transaction money is pulled out of the budget category you select   the only difference is that in ynab4 this money was considered gone   now that money moves from your budget category into the new credit card category when it comes time to pay the credit card bill you also enter this transaction in the same way as before   it is entered as a transfer of money from your checking account to your credit card account   the only difference here is that with new ynab the funds are deducted from your credit card category   this is handled automatically so you do n't have to think about it if you do n't want to    if you always pay your credit card bill in full you never have to budget money manually into the credit card category   the money will already be there from when you entered the credit card spending transactions   the only time you would manually budget money into the credit card spending category is if you have old credit card debt that you are trying to pay off a quick example in pictures i start out with $ 10,000 in my checking account and no credit card debt   i 've got all $ 10,000 in my fun money category   now i spend $ 100 at the store   you can see that just like in ynab4 the credit card account is now in the red $ 100 and the checking account balance has not changed in the categories my fun money category is down $ 100 to $ 9,900 just like it would be in ynab4   the only difference is that there is now $ 100 in the new credit card payments category   when it is time to pay the bill i enter an account transfer just like in ynab4   note that the credit card balance is back to $ 0 and the checking account balance is now down to $ 9,900 the credit card payment budget category is now magically back to $ 0   the above example starts with a zero balance on the credit card   however most people will have a non zero balance on their credit card when they first start a budget   in ynab4 when you added a credit card with a negative balance the debt was shown in a budget category called pre ynab debt   you then added money to this budget category until it went to zero and then you did n't need this budget category anymore with new ynab credit card balances are not shown in budget categories   if you add a credit card account with a balance the debt is not shown in the budget categories   to pay off this debt you can fund the credit card payments category   after this existing balance amount is paid off you wo n't need to fund the credit card payments category anymore as long as you properly assign each new credit card purchase to a funded budget category

being long something means you own it   being short something means you have created an obligation that you have sold to someone else   if i am long 100 shares of msft that means that i possess 100 shares of msft   if i am short 100 shares of msft that means that my broker let me borrow 100 shares of msft and i chose to sell them   while i am short 100 shares of msft i owe 100 shares of msft to my broker whenever he demands them back   until he demands them back i owe interest on the value of those 100 shares   you short a stock when you feel it is about to drop in price   the idea there is that if msft is at $ 50 and i short it i borrow 100 shares from my broker and sell for $ 5000   if msft falls to $ 48 the next day i buy back the 100 shares and give them back to my broker   i pocket the difference $ 50 $ 48 = $ 2/share x 100 shares = $ 200 minus interest owed   call and put options   people manage the risk of owning a stock or speculate on the future move of a stock by buying and selling calls and puts   call and put options have 3 important components   the stock symbol they are actionable against msft in this case the strike price $ 52 in this case and an expiration june   if you buy a msft june $ 52 call you are buying the right to purchase msft stock before june options expiration 3rd saturday of the month   they are priced per share let 's say this one cost $ and sold in 100 share blocks called a contract   if you buy 1 msft june $ 52 call in this scenario it would cost you 100 shares x $ = $ 10   if you own this call and the stock spikes to $ 56 before june you may exercise your right to purchase this stock for $ 52 then immediately sell the stock at the current price of $ 56 for a profit of $ 4 share $ 400 in this case minus commissions   this is an overly simplified view of this transaction as this rarely happens but i have explained it so you understand the value of the option   typically the exercise of the option is not used but the option is sold to another party for an equivalent value   you can also sell a call   let 's say you own 100 shares of msft and you would like to make an extra $ 0.10 a share because you don't think the stock price will be up to $ by the end of june   so you go to your online brokerage and sell one contract and receive the $ 0.10 premium per share being $ 10   if the end of june comes and nobody exercises the option you sold you get to keep the $ 10 as pure profit minus commission   if they do exercise their option your broker makes you sell your 100 shares of msft to that party for the $ 52 price   if the stock shot up to $ 56 you do n't get to gain from that price move as you have already committed to selling it to somebody at the $ 52 price   again this exercise scenario is overly simplified but you should understand the process   a put is the opposite of a call   if you own 100 shares of msft and you fear a fall in price you may buy a put with a strike price at your threshold of pain   you might buy a $ 48 june msft put because you fear the stock falling before june   if the stock does fall below the $ 48 you are guaranteed that somebody will buy yours at $ 48 limiting your loss   you will have paid a premium for this right maybe $ for example   if the stock never gets down to $ 48 at the end of june your option to sell is then worthless as who would sell their stock at $ 48 when the market will pay you more   owning a put can be treated like owning insurance on the stock from a loss in stock price   alternatively if you think there is no way possible it will get down to $ 48 before the end of june you may sell a $ 48 msft june put   however if the stock does dip down below $ 48 somebody will exercise their option and force you to buy their stock for $ 48   imagine a scenario that msft drops to $ 30 on some drastically terrible news   while everybody else may buy the stock at $ 30 you are obligated to buy shares for $ 48   not good   when you sold the option somebody paid you a premium for buying that right from you   often times you will always keep this premium   sometimes though you will have to buy a stock at a steep price compared to market   now options strategies are combinations of buying and selling calls and puts on the same stock   example i could buy a $ 52 msft june call and sell a $ 55 msft june call   i would pay money for the $ 52 call that i am long and receive money for the $ 55 call that i am short   the money i receive from the short $ 55 call helps offset the cost of buying the $ 52 call   if the stock were to go up i would enjoy the profit within in $ range essentially maxing out my profit at $ what the long short call spread cost me   there are dozens of strategies of mixing and matching long and short calls and puts depending on what you expect the stock to do and what you want to profit or protect yourself from   a derivative is any financial device that is derived from some other factor   options are one of the most simple types of derivatives   the value of the option is derived from the real stock price   bingo   that 's a derivative   lotto   that is also a derivative   power companies buy weather derivatives to hedge their energy requirements   there are people selling derivatives based on the number of sunny days in omaha   remember those calls and puts on stock prices   there are people that sell calls and puts based on the number of sunny days in omaha   sounds kind of ridiculous but now imagine that you are a solar power company that gets free electricity from the sun and they sell that to their customers   on cloudy days the solar power company is still on the hook to provide energy to their customers but they must buy it from a more expensive source   if they own the sunny days in omaha derivative they can make money for every cloudy day over the annual average thus hedging their obligation for providing more expensive electricity on cloudy days   for that derivative to work somebody in the derivative market puts a price on what he believes the odds are of too many cloudy days happening and somebody who wants to protect his interests from an over abundance of cloudy days purchases this derivative   the energy company buying this derivative has a known cost for the cost of the derivative and works this into their business model   knowing that they will be compensated for any excessive cloudy days allows them to stabilize their pricing and reduce their risk   the person selling the derivative profits if the number of sunny days is higher than average   the people selling these types of derivatives study the weather in order to make their offers appropriately   this particular example is a fictitious one i do n't believe there is a derivative called sunny days in omaha but the concept is real and the derivatives are based on anything from sunny days to bls unemployment statistics to the apartment vacancy rate of nyc to the cost of a gallon of milk in maine   for every situation somebody is looking to protect themselves from something and somebody else believes they can profit from it   now these examples are highly simplified many derivatives are highly technical comprised of multiple indicators as a part of its risk profile and extremely difficult to explain   these things might sound ridiculous but if you ran a lemonade stand in omaha that sunny days derivative just might be your best friend

that 's true it definitely depends on the temperature   the dew point is the temp at which water or evaporates depending on which way your going on the scale and is dependent on the relative humidity   when relative humidity goes up the dew point goes up   as long as your external body temp skin temp is higher than the dew point the sweat will evaporate   mentioned the heat index being 102 ° f   this would mean you 'd have to get your skin temp higher than 102 ° f which would mean your core temp is even higher dangerously high   this is one of the major advantages of moisture clothing   it removes the sweat from your skin when evaporation is n't good enough and helps cool you faster

simply put the interest you 're paying on your loans is eating into any gains you have in the stock market   so figure out how much you 're paying in interest and consider the feasibility of paying off some of the loan   also figure in if you would be selling the stock at a profit or a loss    generally speaking a home loan is typically long term with a high principal   i believe the consensus is that it is typically not worth paying down extra on it   a car loan though is much shorter term with a lower principal   it may be worth it to pay that down i would certainly consider paying down the loan with 10 interest even without running any numbers what about doing this without selling stock   the reason i suggest that is that you should not sell the stock unless you truly need the money or for some material related to the company the market etc   of course one other reason would be to cut losses unless i was looking to sell some stock anyway i would try other ways to come up with the money to pay down the highest interest loan at least   if you are thinking of selling stock to pay down debt definitely run the numbers

it might some but i 'd wager it pushes the short term rental pricing down like hotels while pushing the long term rental and housing market prices up     if landlords can make way more in short term rentals they are going to do that and limit the supply of long term   the tourism sector may have increased revenue but by what extent i do n't know   i 'd wager that exploding rent and housing prices will negate any benefits for most residents and may end up costing them much more   this is why i think you should only be able to do it on your primary residence   unless you want to be regulated like a hotel because if you have short term rentals that you do n't reside in that is effectively what you are   not being regulated the same as a hotel at that point only gives you an unfair loophole advantage to other short term rentals

update unfortunately citibank have removed the standard account option and you have to choose the plus account which requires a minimum monthly deposit of 1800 sterling and two direct debits absolutely there is   i would highly recommend citibank 's plus current account   it 's a completely free bank account available to all uk residents there are no monthly fees and no minimum balance requirements to maintain   almost nobody in the uk has heard of it and i do n't know why because it 's extremely useful for anyone who travels or deals in foreign currency regularly in one online application you can open a sterling current account and deposit accounts in 10 other foreign currencies when i opened mine around 3 years ago you could only open up to 7 accounts at any one time citibank provide a visa card which you can link to any of your multi currency accounts via a phone call to their hotline unfortunately not online which frequently annoys me but i guess you ca n't have everything   for usd and eur you can use it as a visa debit for usd eur purchases for all other currencies you ca n't make debit card transactions but you can make atm withdrawals without incurring an fx conversion best of all for your case a free usd cheque book is also available you can fund the account in sterling and exchange to usd through online banking   the rates are not as good as you would get through an fx broker like xe.com but they 're not terrible either you can also fund the account by usd wire transfer which is free to deposit at citibank but the bank you issue the payment from will likely charge a swift fee so this might not be worth it unless the amount is large enough to justify the fee if by any chance you have a citibank account in the us you can also make free usd transfers in out of this account subject to a daily limit

the united nations is already working on stripping us of our world reserve currency status so are the brics people think we need to maintain the status quo and give a specific country the world reserve currency there are serious discussions to create a neutral global currency so no country has an edge   i found a lot of posts on the topic but am linking to a really interesting post from a well known publication   gt;the us dollar is getting close to losing its status as the world ’s reserve currency should it cross the line the 2008 financial crisis could look like a summer storm yes worries about insolvency in europe dominate the headlines last week standard amp poor ’s cut spain ’s bond rating to a clear sign that europe ’s financial crisis is far from over but america ’s escalating debt problem is far more likely to a truly global crisis because the dollar has for decades played such a central role in the world economy how bad is the us problem former treasury official lawrence recently pointed out that investors are us bonds and notes the lack of other buyers forced the federal reserve to buy a stunning 61 percent of the total net issuance of us government debt last year like many others he warns that ballooning debt puts the us economy at risk for a sharp correction   reuters the greenback ’s losing to the yuan   but the even larger risk is the potential loss of the dollar ’s reserve currency status a key support of the world economy for the last four decades it started with the 1973 saudi commitment to accept only us dollars as payment for oil followed by opec ’s 1975 agreement to trade only in dollars trading of other commodities came to be priced in dollars reinforcing the dollar ’s reserve status as a result central banks worldwide have held onto large reserves of dollars to facilitate trade that in turn has enabled the us to print much larger amounts of its currency with seemingly little inflationary consequences it ’s also made it easier for americans to import more than they export to consume more than they produce and to spend more than they earn but all that is changing rapidly a number of countries are abandoning the dollar for the chinese yuan last december japan and china agreed to trade in yen and yuan in january the 10 nations of the association of southeast asian nations finalized a non dollar credit agreement equivalent to $ 240 billion strengthening their links with china japan and south korea that same month chinese premier signed a currency swap agreement with the united arab which holds 7 percent of the world ’s oil reserves iran has agreed to accept rubles and yuan in trade with russia and china and now is trading oil with india in rupees and gold in late march the china development bank agreed with its counterparts in brazil russia india and south africa to eschew dollar lending and extend credit to each other in their own respective currencies with global demand for dollars falling central banks around the world will inevitably reduce their dollar reserves that selloff further weakens the dollar against other currencies and in turn drives up inflation all this comes as us federal debt is soaring adding to concerns about the future value of that debt and of the dollar it ’s suddenly much easier to imagine a dollar collapse which would be a highly unexpected occurrence known as a black swan event this would unprecedented disruption because the dollar remains the world ’s most important currency let ’s hope we can avert a global crisis triggered by reckless us government spending what ’s needed is new leadership in washington with the courage to get our fiscal house in order and to defend the dollar against attack in a competitive global market   here is another opinion on the topic   edit let me add if we are constantly adding stimulus from the central banks we are going to be seriously the faith the rest of the world has in us as well the fed was the buyer of what like 10 of our bonds before the crisis now they are buying 60 we have using quantitative easing and stimulus for three years to fix the economy if we were suddenly having a recovery that would be fine because people would know we would be ready to start paying down our debts however we have spent trillions and our gdp growth is about two thirds the average since that 's a sign that there is something wrong with our economy right now clearly not an argument to end stimulus because without it we would be in a major depression the problem is that once people realize that they will question how stable our economy really is   your argument that we are the most stable economy in the world and deserve the reserve currency status is circular logic we have had the reserve currency status since 1944 that has helped us maintain the stability the rest of the world has n't enjoyed for a very long time without it we may never have become anything near the country we are today it gave us access to tremendous capital which we were able to use to expand our nation incredibly we have built an empire on our ability to take on massive amounts of debt i am sure we would have been a superpower without it but no one can say how much or how harder other recessions would have been if we had never been granted that privilege

in the us if your monthly statement was issued by the credit card company on january 1 and it showed a balance of $ 1000 then a payment must be made towards that balance by january 25 or so not february 1 as you say to keep the card in good standing the minimum payment required to keep the card in good standing is specified in your monthly statement and failure to meet this requirement can trigger various consequences such as an increase in the interest rate charged by the credit card company with regard to interest charges whether your purchase of $ 2000 on   january 3 is charged interest or not depends entirely on what happened the previous two months   if you had paid both your monthly statements dated november 1 and december 1 of the previous year in full by the their respective due dates of november 25 and december 25 and the $ 1000 balance on the january 1 statement is entirely due to purchases no cash advances made in december then you will not be charged interest on your january purchase of $ 2000 as long as you pay it off in full by february 25 the charge will appear on your february 1 statement but if you had not paid your december 1 statement in full by december 25 then that $ 1000 billed to you on january 1 will include   purchases made during december finance charges on the unpaid balance from the previous month   plus finance charges on the purchases made during december the finance charges will continue to accumulate during january until such time as you pay off the bill in full these charges will appear on your february 1 statement hopefully by the due date of january 25 but even if you pay off that $ 1000 in full on january 25 your charge of $ 2000 on january 3 will start to accumulate finance charges as of the day it hits the account and these finance charges will appear on your february 1 statement   if you paid off that $ 1000 on january 10 say then maybe there will be no further finance charges on the $ 2000 purchase on january 3 after january 10 but now we are getting into the real fine print of what your credit card agreement says ditto for the case when you pay off that $ 1000 on january 2 and made the $ 2000 charge on january 3 you most likely will not be charged interest on that $ 2000 charge but again it depends on the fine print for example it might say that you will be charged interest on the average of the daily balances for january but will not be charged interest on purchases during the february cycle unless you miss the february 25 payment and the whole cycle starts all over again as a general rule it takes two monthly cycles of payment in full by the due date before one gets into the state of no finance charges for new purchases and effectively an interest free loan of $ 2000 from january 3 date of purchase till february 25 due date of payment   matters become more complicated when cash advances are taken from a credit card which are charged interest from the day they are taken but do n't trigger finance charges on new purchases or the so called zero percent balance transfer offers are accepted

many of the major indices    today because of this news why how    do the rising budget deficits and debt    relate to the stock markets the major reason for the market is the uncertainty regarding the us dollar if the us credit rating drops that will have an inflationary effect on the currency as it will push up the cost of us treasuries and reduce confidence in the usd if this continues the loss of usd confidence could bring an end to the usd as the world 's reserve currency which could also create inflation as world banks could reduce their usd reserves this can make us assets appear overvalued why is there such a large emphasis on    the s&p rating s&p is a large trusted rating agency so the market will respond to their analysis much like how a bank would respond to any change in your rating by transunion consumer credit bureau does this have any major implications    for the us stock markets today in the    short term and in july if you are a day trader i 'm sure it does there will be minor fluctuations in the market as soon as news comes out either of its extension or any expected delays in passing that extension what happens when the debt ceiling is    reached since the us is in a deficit spending situation it needs to borrow more to satisfy its existing obligations in short it pays its debt with more debt as a result if the debt ceiling is n't raised then eventually the us will be unable to pay its existing obligations we would be in a default situation which could have devastating affects on the value of the usd how hard the hit will depend on how long the default situation lasts the longer we go without an increased ceiling after the exhaustion point the more we default on in reality congress will approve a raise but they will drag it out to the last possible minute they want to appear as if they are against it but they understand the catastrophic effects of not doing so

some have suggested you can put the money in the 401k then take a loan to pay off the student loan debt   some things to consider before doing that check your 401k plan first   some plans allow you to continue paying on a loan if you leave the company some do not   if you have to change jobs before you pay back the 401k loan you may only have 90 days to completely pay the loan or the irs will treat this as an early withdrawal which means taxes and penalties   if you do n't have another job lined up this is going to make things much worse since you will have lost your income and may owe even more to the government depending on your state it may be up to 50 of the remaining amount   there are ways to work with some student debt loans to defer or adjust payments   there is no such option with a 401k plan this may change your taxes at the end of the year   most people can deduct student loan interest payments   you can not deduct interest paid to your 401k loan   you are paying the interest to yourself though    it may hurt your long term growth potential   currently loans on 401k loans are in the 4 range   if you are able to make more than 4 inside of your 401k you will be losing out on that growth since that money will only be earning the interest you pay back it may limit flexibility for a few years   when people fall on hard times their 401k is their last resort   some plans have a limit on the number of loans you can have at one time   you may need a loan or a withdrawal in the future   once you take the money out for a loan you ca n't access it again   see the first bullet about working with student loan vendors they typically have ways to work with you under hard circumstances   401k loans do n't amortization schedule   many 401k loans can only be amortized for a max of 5 years if you currently have 10 year loans can you afford to pay the same debt back in 1/2 the time at a lower rate   you will have to do the math when considering debt other than student loans such as credit cards if you fall on hard times you can always negotiate to reduce the amount you owe or the debt can be discharged with tax penalties of course   they ca n't make you take money out   once it is out it is fair game just to clarify the above is n't saying you should n't do it under any circumstances it is a few things you need to evaluate before making that choice   the 401k is supposed to be used to help secure your financial future when you ca n't work   the numbers may work out in the short term but do they still work out in the long term   most credit cards require minimum payments high enough to pay back in 7 10 years so does shortening that to 5 or less make up for the probably early years of compounding interest for your retirement   i think others have addressed some of this so i wo n't do the math i can tell you that i have a 401k loan and when things got iffy at my job for it was a very bad feeling to have that over my head because unlike other debts there is n't much you can do about it

i do n't know what the op means when he says i want to invest in health insurance from now on so that i can use the policy after i retire generally a health insurance policy covers costs incurred during the current calendar year or specific period such as july 1 of one year through june 30 of the next year and does not cover future periods indeed many policies do not guarantee renewal when the current period ends with exceptions for employer provided coverage through cobra in case employment ends so investing in a health insurance policy meaning that you pay the premiums now and the insurance company provides the policy in the distant future is   something that is new to me besides what will the policy include if someone had bought such a policy many years ago say before cat scans and were developed would the policy cover such new developments or the policy would cover only those procedures tests and medications that are available when the policy is written and the insurance premiums start to be paid the long term health of the insurance company is also of some concern   when something is offered to me with a lifetime guarantee i ask my lifetime or the device 's life time or the company 's lifetime

this was the day traders dilemma you can on paper make money doing such trades but because you do not hold the security for at least a year the earnings are subject to short term capital gains tax unless these trades are done inside a sheltered account like a traditional ira   there are other considerations as well wash sale rules and number of days to settle   in short the glory days of rags to riches by day trading are long gone if they were ever here in the first place   edit the site will not allow me to add a comment so i am putting my response here possibly yes one big gotcha is that your broker reports the proceeds from your sales but does not report your outflows from your buys then there is the risk you take by the broker refusing to sell the security until the transaction settles not to mention wash sale rules you are trying to win at the buy low sell high game but you have a 25 chance at best of winning at that game can you pick the low maybe but you have a 50 chance of being right then you have to pick the high and again you have a 50 chance of doing that 50 times 50 is 25 warren buffet did not get rich that way buffet buys and holds do n't be a speculator be a buy and hold investor buy securities inside a sheltered account like a traditional ira that pay dividends then reinvest those dividends into the security you bought scottrade has a flexible reinvestment program that lets you do this with no commission fees

there are a couple reasons for having a traditional or roth ira in addition to a 401(k program in general starting with the traditional ira with regards to the roth ira also both the traditional and roth ira allow you to make a $ 10,000 withdraw as a first time home buyer for the purposes of buying a home this is much more difficult with the 401(k and generally you end up having to take a loan against the 401(k instead so even if you ca n't take advantage of the tax deductions from contributions to a traditional ira there are still good reasons to have one around unless you plan on staying with the same company for your entire career and even if you do they may have other plans the traditional ira tends to be a much better place to park the funds from the 401(k than just rolling them over to a new employer   also do n't forget that just because you ca n't take deductions for the income does n't mean that you might not need the income that savings now will bring you in retirement if you use a retirement savings calculator is it saying that you need to be saving more than your current monthly 401(k contributions then odds are pretty good that you also need to be adding additional savings and an ira is a good location to put those assets because of the other benefits that they confer also some people do n't have the fiscal discipline to not use the money when it is n't hard to get to i.e. regular savings or investment account and as such it also helps to ensure you are n't going to go and spend the money unless you really need it

i am perfectly qualified to not use an accountant   i am a business professor and my work crosses over into accounting quite a bit   i would certainly find a cpa that is reputable and hire them for advice before starting   i know a physicist who did n't do that and found they ended up with $ in fines   there are a number of specific things an accountant might provide that quickbooks will not   first and foremost they are an outsider 's set of eyes   if they are good they will find a polite way to say you want to do what   if they are good they wo n't fall out of their chair their jaw wo n't drop to the floor and they wo n't until they get home a good accountant has seen around a hundred successful and unsuccessful businesses   they have seen everything you may have thought of   intelligence is learning from your own mistakes wisdom is learning from the mistakes of others   accountants are the of wisdom an accountant can point out weaknesses in your plan and help you shore it up   they can provide information about the local market that you may not be aware of   they can assist you with understanding the long run consequences of the legal form that you choose   they can assist you in understanding the trade offs of different funding models   they can also do tasks that you are not talented at and which will take a lot of time if you do it and little time if they do it there is a reason that accountants are required to have 160 semester hours to sit for the cpa   they also have to have a few thousand field hours before they can sit for it as well there is one thing you may want to keep in mind though   an accountant will often do what you ask them to do so think about what you want before you visit the accountant   also remember to ask the question is there a question i should have asked but did n't

i asked this question in another sub but i thought i might also get answers here    i was just wondering how pension funds or investment firms calculate the interest that they give to their members or clients in the us or whichever country you are from    i ask this because i have a gut feeling that the national pension fund in my country does it the wrong way and is basically cheating people so i wanted to make a comparison with other countries forgive me if i 'm wrong and there 's nothing to worry about    ok so what they do is collect money in a given financial year which starts in july and ends in june let 's say they collect 100 million in 2010 11 they then invest this 100 million in the year july 2011 june 2012 after deducting admin costs and all that interest for this 2010 11 money is declared on october 1st 2012    that basically means that money someone contributed in july 2010 will earn interest 2 years later in 2012 i just feel like that is not how it should be done but you can correct me if i 'm wrong    they also regularly give interest at about 12 which is good when i read about interest rates in the us being around 7 but i feel like since this interest is basically announced after 2 years that 12 is n't as good as it seems    someone help me understand if i 'm wrong   thanks

you need a brokerage account to invest in etfs there are many different kinds of etfs not just one and that usually means having some amount already deposited with them into the cash account in your name once the brokerage account is established you can send whatever money from each paycheck to the brokerage and tell them to invest it in the etf of your choice there are no restrictions as to how much money you can send if you send them a check if you want the money to be withheld from your paycheck then of course the limit is the amount of the take home pay and whether your employer offers such a service will affect the issue if you are wanting to invest in etfs through your employer 's 401(k plan or 403(b plan there are lots of other considerations

there is not a special rate for short term capital gains   only long term gains have a special rate   short term gains are taxed at your ordinary income rate see here   hence if you 're in the 25 bracket your short term gain would be taxed at 25   the ira withdrawal as you already mentioned would be taxed at 25 plus a 10 penalty for 35 total   thus the bite on the ira withdrawal is larger than that on a non ira withdrawal as for the estimated tax issue i do n't think there will be a significant difference there   the reason is that traditional ira withdrawals count as ordinary taxable income see here   this means that when you withdraw the funds from your ira you will increase your income   if that increase pushes you too far beyond what your withholding is accounting for then you owe estimated tax   in other words whether you get the money by selling stocks in a taxable account or by withdrawing them from an ira you still increase your taxable income and thus potentially expose yourself to the estimated tax obligation in fact there may be a difference   as you note you will pay tax at the capital gains rate on gains from selling in a taxable account   but if you sell the stocks inside the ira and withdraw that is ordinary income   however since ordinary income is taxed at a higher rate than long term capital gains you will potentially pay more tax on the ira withdrawal since it will be taxed at the higher rate if your gains are long term rather than short term   this is doubly true if you withdraw early incurring the extra 10 penalty   see this question for some more discussion of this issue in addition i think you may be somewhat misunderstanding the nature of estimated tax   the irs will not ask you for a quarterly estimated tax when you sell stock   the irs does not monitor your activity and send you a bill each quarter   they may indeed check whether your reported income with info they received from your bank etc but they 'll still do that regardless of whether you got that income by selling in a taxable account or withdrawing money from an ira because both of those increase your taxable income quarterly estimated tax is not an extra tax it is just you paying your normal income tax over the course of the year instead of all at once   if your withholdings will not cover enough of your tax liability you must figure that out yourself and pay the estimated tax see here if you do n't do so you may be assessed a penalty   it does n't matter how you got the money if your taxable income is too high relative to your withheld tax then you have to pay the estimated tax   typically tax will be withheld from your ira distribution but if it 's not withheld you 'll still owe it as estimated tax

a couple ways but its not a guarantee   you have to have special charts instead of each tick being 1 min 5 min or whatever it is a set number of trades say 2000 since retail investors only buy and sell in small amounts there will be small volume per tick an institutional investor however would have a much much higher trade lot size even if using an algo thus large volume spikes in such a chart would signal institutional activity over retail similarly daily charts showing average trade size can help you pick out when institutional activity is highest as they have much larger trade sizes you could also learn how the algos work and look for evidence one is being used ie every time price hits vwap a large sell order goes through would indicate an institutional investor is selling especially if it happens multiple times in a row

making a profit in trading is not a function of time it 's a function of information speed and consistency regardless of how much time you spend learning about trading there is no guarantee that you will ever become profitable because you will always be competing against a counter party who is either or more poorly informed than you are   since trading is a zero sum game someone is always a winner and someone else is always a loser so you need to be either better informed than your counter party or you need to be as well informed as them but beat them to the punch you also need to be able to be consistent or else eventually you will get wiped out when the unexpected happens or you make a mistake this is why resources such as full time professional analysts high speed trading terminals platforms and sophisticated algorithms can provide significant advantages personally i think that people with talent and those kinds of resources would take all my lunch money so i do n't trade and stick to passive investing one funny story i once knew a trader who was in the money on a particular trade and went out to have a drink to celebrate the next day she remembered that she had forgotten to exercise the options luckily they had expired while in the money and by rule had been exercised automatically as a result

based on these dates in your question going back over my records i was able to recall the following maryland realized recently that on the 2009 federal 1040 form you stated that on december 31 2009 you in maryland they are wondering where the state tax form is dc md and va due to reciprocity collect income tax based on where you live not where you work so when you moved in august 2009 and again in august 2010 you needed to file new state versions of the w4   the fact you did or did n't submit to your employer a correct state w-4 is not directly related because you would owe the tax regardless the w-4 just makes sure that something close to the correct amounts are withheld and sent to the appropriate state capital i seem to remember something about not having to pay maryland state    taxes since i not only lived in the state for less than 6 months but    also did not work in the state the reciprocity between dc md and va says that maryland gets the money because that is where you lived the last time i had to do a part year the law was that they would forgive a half a month in other words if you move in late december or early january you could ignore that small time period and avoid having to file in two states in some cases people argue that some short term moves were never meant to be permanent you might be able to claim that except the fact that your 2009 federal tax form you most likely claimed you lived in maryland   the next issue is time and money if maryland says you   owe them money for that time period and if they still have the ability to force you to pay it this is where the issue of correct state w-4 comes in   if the money during the period you lived in maryland was sent to virginia you should have had that money refunded by richmond in the spring of 2010 but if there was no w-4 filed with your employer that would mean that maryland did n't get any money for 2009 if you did n't tell richmond you moved in 2009 they may not have refunded everything because they thought you lived there all year because of the time that has passed it may be too late to fix your virginia filing so they may not refund you excess payment to them maryland is interested in calculating how much you should have paid them in 2009 they are only looking at what you told the feds you made and they may be assuming that you lived there the whole year but until you file correctly that have no ability to calculate what you really owe you need professional advice you need to know what they can and ca n't collect you also need to know what you can and ca n't get back from richmond and since it also may impact your filings for 2010 you will want to get that resolved at the same time

let p denote the amount of the investment r the rate of return and i the rate of inflation   for simplicity assume that the payment p is made annually right after the return has been earned   thus at the end if the year the investment p has increased to and p is returned as the annuity payment if i = 0 the entire return can be paid out as the payment and thus p = that is at the end of the year when the dust settles after the return has been collected and paid out as the annuity payment p is again available at the beginning of the next year to earn return at rate r. we have p = p if i > 0 then at the end of the year after the dust settles we can not afford to have only p available as the investment for next year next year 's payment must be p*(1+i and so we need a larger investment since the rate of return is fixed   how much larger   well if the investment at the beginning of next year is p*(1+i it will earn exactly enough additional money to pay out the increased payment for next year and have enough left over to help towards future increases in payments note   that we are assuming that r > i. if r < i a perpetuity can not be created   thus suppose that we choose p such that p = p*(1+i    multiplying this equation by we have p*(1+i = in words at the start of next year the investment is p*(1+i and the return less the increased payout of p*(1+i leaves an investment of for the following year   each year the payment and the amount to be invested for the following year increase by a factor of solving p = p*(1+i for p we get   p = i   as the initial perpetuity payment and the payment increases by a factor each year   the initial investment is p and it also increases by a factor of each year in later years the investment is at the start of the year the payment is and the amount invested for the next year is this is the same result as obtained by the op but written in terms that i can understand that is without the financial jargon about discount rates pv fv and the like

it seems that counting your father as your dependent should n't in itself cause him to be ineligible for snap eligibility requirements for snap can be found on this page there are upper limits on the resources such as a bank account that the beneficiary 's household may have and on that household 's income there are some other requirements too from what i can tell from your question your father should n't be part of your household for snap purposes because everyone who lives together and purchases and prepares meals together is grouped together as one household if you 're transferring him money i assume he 's living and eating somewhere else so it seems you are not part of his household according to the irs 's publication 501 your father is not required to be part of your household for irs purposes to be your dependent the test to qualify is that a non child dependent must either live with you all year as a member of your household or be related to you in one of the ways listed under relatives who do not have to live with you however by the special rule for parent you may be able to use your father as your qualifying person dependent to be able to file as head of household so long as you pay more than half their support and more than half the cost of keeping up a home that was the main home for the entire year for your father i do n't know if in this case the irs would consider your father part of your household or not even if the irs considered your father part of your household based on the way you filed your taxes i think it 's possible as the irs and are two different entities that the definition of your father 's household for snap purposes could be different from the irs 's

they are not required to fulfill the trade that they have intended to execute   they are able to cancel or modify the trade at any point   example this is how insiders are able to manipulate the price of shares through there buying and selling intentions   a ceo would be able to disclose a buy order for a month from now or whatever time period is required   this would most likely increase the price of the stock as investors would see this as a good sign of company performance   up until the point when the buy order is scheduled to execute the ceo can then cancel the order and create a new sell order   since the stock is high in price his new order is likely to make him money based on the manipulation from his trading intentions    i am not an expert on the subject and only know as much as i do through personal research here is an interesting article about this kind of insider trading and manipulation fine line between legal and illegal insider

okay i went through a similar situation when my mother died in march of this year the estate still needs to go into probate especially if there was a will and when you do this your husband will be named as the executor then what he will need to do is produce both of their death certificates to the bank have the account closed and open an estate account with both of their names on it their debts anything like this should be paid from this account as well then what you can do is endorse the check as the executor and deposit it into this account after all debts are paid the money can be disbursed to the beneficiaries your husband basically as long as they did n't have any huge debts to pay he will see the money again it just may be a couple of months and you will have to pay some filing fees

before answering specific question you are liable to pay tax as per your bracket on the income generated i work with my partner and currently we transfer all earning on my personal bank account can this create any issue for me if you are paying your partner from your account you would need to maintain proper paperwork to show the portion of money transferred is not income to you alternatively create a join current account move funds there and then move it to your respective accounts which sort off account should be talk and by whose name can be any account savings current if you are doing more withdrawls open current else open savings it does not matter on who s name the account is paperwork to show income matters from tax point of view what should we take care while transfering money from freelance site to bank nothing specific is there any other alternative to bank there is paypal etc however ultimately it flows into a bank account what are other things to be kept in mind keep proper record of actual income of each of you along with expenses there are certain expenses you can claim from income for example laptop internet mobile phone etc consult a ca he will be able to guide and it does not cost much

the escrow rules used to be a lot more lax   the banks used to screw people pretty hard   for example after paying off a loan banks would drag their feet about sending back the money   this does not account for much on one loan but if you multiply that by all the loans they service it is a significant amount there are not strict rules governing the amount of money that can be held in escrow and how quickly the money has to be returned after a loan payoff

this is automation a goal that businesses are going to head for no matter how much people about it   as long as we have an economy that demands profits as soon as it becomes viable to use a machine over a human it will     it 's not a new trend either   machines replace humans all the time   it 's been happening since the industrial revolution   this is just the latest iteration in a long running cycle   the correct response to automation replacing human labor is not to fight automation though it happens every time and always loses in the end but rather to embrace the new technology and ensure the displaced workers have other jobs or failing that the ability to retrain or train for higher paying jobs   this is an argument for a better more comprehensive welfare system more funding for public education maybe even something as horrific as a basic income system that ensures not only are our most vulnerable able to survive but those that want are given the opportunity to thrive instead of forcing them to work a low wage job for eternity

i 'm guessing you 're conflating bonus share issuance with stock split   that seems very common to me from a quick search there 's even some issues of terminology between the us and europe i think it seems some europeans may use bonus shares to mean stock split as opposed to the more common meaning in the us of stock dividend sometimes a bonus share issuance is incorrectly called a stock split like in this public announcement from in 2004   it is a 1:1 bonus share issuance meaning they issue one bonus share to everyone who has one share now but it is in essence the same thing as a stock split a 2:1 stock split namely   they combined the 1:1 from bonus share with the wording split causing the confusion bonus share issuance also known as a stock dividend is covered well in this question answer on this site or from a search online   it has no obvious effect initially both involve doubling shares out there and halving the price but it has a substantially different treatment in terms of accounting both to the company and to your tax accountant

every time you buy or sell a share for some price somebody must have thought that that was exactly the right moment to sell or buy that share at that price and to trade with you every time a trade is made both sides think they are doing the smart thing most of the time one will turn out to be wrong the other right nothing in your proposed method of trading explains why you would be the side that was right more often so they 'll probably even out or maybe there are people in the market who actually do have a slightly better than average method and you 'll be wrong somewhat more often than right each trade has transaction costs if you simply hang on to your shares that 's more or less the same as evening out good trades and bad trades but without the transaction costs

if you are buying your order will be placed in bid list if you are selling your order will be placed in the ask list the highest bid price will be placed at the top of the bid list and the lowest ask price will be placed at the top of the ask list when a bid and ask price are matched a transaction will take place and it will the last traded price if you are looking to buy at a lower price say $ your bid price will be placed 3rd in the bid list and unless the ask prices fall to that level your order will remain in the list until it trades it expires or you cancel it if prices do n't fall to you bid price you will not get a trade if you wanted your trade to go through you could either place a limit buy order closer to the lowest ask price however this is still not a certainty or to be certain place a market buy order which will trade at the lowest ask price

switzerland was once known for its high regard for private property rights   recently it is has started to violate those rights by forcing banks to turn over the names of account holders to the us government   not a great trend another aspect that makes switzerland an attractive place for people and businesses is the swiss 's neutral policy   the swiss government is not deploying the swiss military around the globe to fight terrorism to spread democracy to advance its own power or other such murderous government programs   the swiss people do not have to worry about the payback that arrives because of such government programs the swiss were traditionally extreme advocates of individual gun rights which allows the people to provide protection for themselves against others and against the government   this too is changing read section on the enemy within in a not so favorable direction i also the swiss franc was the last major currency to sever its tie to gold   the currency use to be highly desired due to its tie to gold   i think the currency is still highly regarded but the swiss central bank is participating in the currency war and has attempted multiple times in the past couple of years to its currency so it does not appreciate against the euro or dollar

i 've been budgeting with ms money since 2004 and was pretty disappointed to hear it 's being discontinued budgeting is actually a stress hobby for me and i can be a bit of a control freak when it comes to finances so i decided to start early looking for a replacement rather than waiting until ms money can no longer download transactions here are the pros and cons of the ones i 've tried updated you need a budget pro ynab based on the old envelopes system ynab has you money from each paycheck to a specific budget category envelope it encourages you to live on last money 's income and if you have trouble with overspending that can be a great plan personally i 'm a big believer in the envelope concept so that 's the biggest pro i found also it 's a downloaded software so once i 've bought it for about $ 50 it 's mine without forced upgrades as far as i 've seen the big con for me was that it does not automatically download transactions i would have to sign on to each institution 's website and manually download to the program also coming from money i 'm used to having features that ynab does n't offer like the ability to store information about my accounts overall it 's forward thinking and a good budgeting system but will take some extra time to download transactions and is n't really a comprehensive management tool for all my financial needs you can try it out with their free trial mint this is a free online program the free part was a major pro it also looks pretty if that 's important to you updating is automatic once you 've got it all set up so that 's a pro mint 's budgeting tools are so so basically you choose a category and tell it your limit it at you by text or email when you cross the line but does n't seem to offer any other incentive to stay on budget   when i first looked at mint it did not connect with my credit union but it currently connects to all my banks and all but one of my student loan institutions   another recent improvement is that mint now allows you to manually add transactions including pending checks and cash transactions   the cons for me are that it does not give me a good end of the month report does n't allow me to enter details of my paychecks and does n't give me any cash flow forecasting overall mint is a good casual retrospective free online tool but does n't allow for much planning ahead mvelopes here 's another online option but this one is subscription based again we find the old envelopes system which i think is smart so that 's a pro for me it 's online so it downloads transactions automatically but also allows you to manually add transactions so another pro the big con on this one is the cost depending on how you far ahead you choose to pay quarterly yearly or you 're paying $ to $ 12 per month they do offer a free trial for 14 days plus another 14 days offered when you try to cancel another con is that they do n't provide meaningful reports overall a good concept but not worth the cost for me quicken i had n't tried quicken earlier because they do n't offer a free trial but after the last few fell short i landed with quicken 2009 pro for quicken as an ms money user is that it is remarkably similar in format and options the registers and reports are nearly identical one frustration i 'd had with money was that it was ridiculously slow at start up and after a year or so of entering data quicken is dragging con for quicken again as an ms money user is that it 's budgeting is not as detailed as i would like   also it does not download transactions smoothly now that my banks all ask security questions as part of sign in   i have to sign in to my bank 's website and manually download   quicken 2011 is out now but i have n't tried it yet   hopefully they 've solved the problem of security questions   quicken 2011 promises an improved cash flow forecast which sounds promising and was a feature of ms money that i have very much missed   have n't decided yet if it 's worth the $ 50 to upgrade to 2011

as mentioned in the other answer you ca n't invest all of your money in one slightly risky place and to receive a significant return on your investment you must take on a reasonable amount of risk and must manage that risk by diversifying your portfolio of investments unfortunately answers to this question will be somewhat opinion and experience based i have two suggestions however both involve risk which you will likely experience in any situation peer to peer lending in my own situation i 've placed a large sum of money into peer to peer lending sites such as lendingclub lendingclub specifically advertises that 98 of its user base that invests in 100 notes or more of relatively equal size receive positive returns and i 'm sure you 'll see similar statements in other similarly established vendors in this area historical averages in this industry can be between 5 7 you may be able to perform above or below this average   the returns on peer to peer lending investments are paid out fairly frequently as each loan you invest in on the site pays back into your account every time the recipient of the loan makes a payment   if you invest in small amounts fractions of several hundred loans you 're receiving several small payments throughout the month on various dates you can withdraw any money you have received back that has n't been invested or money you have in the account that has n't been invested at any time for personal spending however this involves various risks which have to be considered such as someone you 've loaned money to on the site defaulting rental property property itself i 'm also considering purchasing a very cheap home and renting it out to tenants for passive income this is something i would consider a possibility for you on this front you have the savings to do the same it would be possible for you to afford the 20 downpayment on a very low cost home say $ 100,000 or less up to $ 200,000 depending on your area but you 'd need to be able to pay for the monthly mortgage payment until you had a tenant and would need to be able to afford any on going maintenance however ideally you 'd factor that into the amount you charged tenants you could very likely get a mortgage for a place and have a tenant that pays you rent that exceeds the amount you pay for the mortgage and any maintenance costs earning you a profit and therefore passive income however rental properties involve risks in that you might have trouble finding tenants or keeping tenants or keeping the property in good shape and it 's possible the property value could decrease   one could also generalize that property is a somewhat safe investment in that property values tend to increase over time and while you may not significantly over run inflation 's increase you may be able to get more value out of the property by renting it out in the mean time additional note on credit you mention you have a credit card payment that you 're making to build credit i 'd like to place here for your reference that you do not need to carry a balance to build credit having active accounts and ensuring you do n't miss payments builds your history to be more specific your history is based off of many different aspects such as   i 'm sure i missed a couple of things on this front you should be able to find this information with some research wanted to make sure you were n't carrying a balance simply due to the common myth that you must do so to build credit summary the items mentioned above are suggestions but whatever you choose to invest in you should carefully spread out diversify your portfolio across a variety of different areas   it would not be advisable to stick to just one investment method say either of the two above and not also invest in stocks bonds or other types of investments as well   you can certainly decide what percentage of your portfolio you want to invest in different areas for instance x% of assets in stocks bonds y% in real estate etc but it does make the most sense to not have all of your eggs in one basket

okay i see where we might be confusing each other in absolute dollar terms the employee might make more working for themselves but money is not the only factor that goes into choosing a job if the worker can make $ working for themselves and $ 500 doing the same job a company they may value the benefits of not worrying about running their own business or the extra free time like you said as being worth more than that $ 100 they are still choosing the option that they value highest to themselves whichever it may be i did nt that the company is giving the employee some sort of gift in hiring them they are just offering the employee the best possible option of the employee 's other choices if it was nt the best option for the worker then they logically should not select that option

to be honest if you have to ask tips about taking over your family business someone really dropped the ball on showing you the business in the first place      anyway learn yourself some basic bookkeeping accounting   money management tax handling will be something you will need to know even if you have staff to handle this for you      learn the specific product service whatever you offer   nothing can be worse than having no clue what your product service does and you 're running it      shadow the family that are running it now   find out what they do throughout their day involving the business   whoever your replacing is the one you should focus on most      also make sure you understand your branding quality and price measures   any basic business class will teach you that branding quality and price are the three factors of a business 's success   where you fail in one you take up in another   for instance apple has horrible prices   extremely expensive   how do they make it up   well quality is about on par with other products since they largely come from the same source as competitors but the iphone and ipod are well known brands far more recognized than the smartphone and mp3 player that they are instead called by the specific product name   same with kleenex   no one asks for a facial tissue   they ask for a kleenex   that 's strong branding that connects the consumer to the product      anyway just make sure you know where your points fall on those three lines in your business   improve as you can but understand where your main fall back is   best prices quality or most well known           lastly do n't doubt that you can do this   similarly do n't   your friends will all ask for deals and discounts and you 'd do best to deny them in most cases   family will always want a cut and will probably get nasty in some cases by how you 're set up   when dealing with employees remember that they work for you   you 're not friends   nothing destroys a staff faster than the boss trying to be friends with everyone and ends up promoting the           eh not sure what else to toss out   that covers a lot of bases but i 'm sure i can think of more later

thanks for quoting the meat of the article i agree with the gp i did n't have the patience to make it to page 2 but this meat is still textured flavored soy protein   gt well one of the reasons there 's no place to invest the cash is that wages as a percentage of gdp have fallen by so much that workers ca n't afford to buy anything any more   what   this manages to be both circular and wrong on multiple levels   our workers ca n't afford our product so we ca n't spend all this cash rolling in on them   gt we kept profits to a minimum because if we had high profits we would have to pay high taxes so at every opportunity we bought another machine or we opened another plant or we hired more people to try to build long term value through expansion because that was the way you avoided tax   ah daddy had the luxury of operating in a non saturated market   meanwhile google apple and microsoft piss away money as fast as they can on all sorts of basic research and yet still have massive stockpiles   but then i think that touches on the real problem with hanauer 's point it 's just plain   we live in a world where the governments have become so dysfunctional that private industry is now funding things like space exploration energy policy education transportation

remember that risk should correlate with returns in an investment this means that the more risk you take on the more return you should be receiving in an efficient marketplace that 's why putting your money in a savings account might earn you < 1 interest right now but putting money in the stock market averages returns over time you should be very careful not to use the word interest when you mean returns in your post you are calling capital gains the increase in value of owned property interest this may be in your head the level of risk associated with property ownership in the case of the bank they are not in the business of home construction rather than take that risk themselves they would rather finance many projects being done by construction companies that know the business the bank has a high degree of certainty of getting its money back because its mortgages are protected by the value of the property   part of the benefit of an efficient marketplace is that risk gets bought by individuals who want it this means that people with a low risk tolerance such as banks people on fixed incomes seniors etc can avoid risk and people with a high risk tolerance stock investors young people with high income etc can take on that risk for higher average returns the bank 's reasoning should remind you of the risk associated with property ownership increases in value are not a sure thing if you do not understand the risk of your investment you can not be certain that you are being well compensated for that risk note also that most countries place regulations on their banks that limit the amount of their funds that can be placed in higher risk asset classes typically this something along the lines of if someone places a deposit with your bank you can only invest that deposit in a low risk debt based asset ie you can take money deposited by customer a and use it to finance a mortgage for customer b this is done in an attempt to prevent collapse of the financial sector if risky investments start failing

i 've given up on trying to understand how the allowances correspond to my number of dependents    what i do instead to achieve the same end goal of having the right amount of money withheld is using a paycheck calculator if i get paid 24 times a year twice a month and i figure i 'm going to owe about $ 6,000 of taxes then every paycheck needs to have $ 250 of federal tax withheld from it to make sure i am covered go to the paycheck calculator and play with the allowance numbers until you get $ 250 as the federal tax withheld and then submit a new w4 to your employer this is the only reliable way i 've found to figure this out on my own   because my calculations are done in dollars instead of exemptions etc and my taxes do not wildly fluctuate year to year this works well for me

the short answer it depends the long answer off the top of my head there are quite a number of factors that an analyst may look at when analyzing a stock to come up with a recommendation   some example factors to look at include the list goes on   quite literally any and all factors are fair game for a recommendation   so the question is n't really what analysts do with financial data it is what do analysts do with financial data that meets your investment needs as an example if you have two analysts one who is focused on growth stocks and one who is focused on dividend growth they may have completely different views on a company   if both analysts were to analyze apple aapl 5 years ago the dividend analyst would likely say sell or at the most hold because back then apple did not have a dividend   however an analyst focused on growth would likely have said buy because apple appeared to be on a clear upward trend in terms of growth   likewise if you have analysts who are focused on shorting stocks and ones who are focused on deep value investing the sell analyst may be selling sell because they are confident the stock will go down in price so you can make money on the short position   conversely the deep value investor may be saying buy because they believe that based on the companies strong balance sheet and recent shake ups in management the stock will eventually turn around   two completely different views for the same company the analyst focused on shorting is looking to make money by capitalizing on falling share price while the analyst focused on deep value is looking for companies in a whom s he believe will turn around the thesis being that if you dollar cost average as the price drops when it corrects you 'll reap the rewards that all said to answer the question about what analysts look for so really you should be looking for analysts who align with your investment style and use those recommendations as a starting point for your own purchases   personally i am a dividend investor so i have passed many buy recommendations from analysts and my former broker because those were based on growth stories   that does not mean that the analysts my former broker or myself are wrong   but we were all incorrect given the context of how i invest and what they recommend

a shorter term ma would be used for short term changes in price whilst a long term ma would be used for longer term movements in price   a 200 day sma is widely used to determine the trend of the stock simply a cross above the 200 day sma would mean the stock may be entering an uptrend and a cross below that the price may be entering a downtrend if the price is going above and below in a short period of time it is usually range trading then there are moving averages and weighted moving averages which give more emphasis to the latest price data than the earlier price data in the period chosen compared to a sma mas can be used in many different ways too many to list all here the best way to learn about them is to read some ta books and articles about them then choose a couple of strategies where you can use them in combination with a couple of other indicators that are complimentary with each other

now technically she is supposed to pay rent but legally i am not sure her name is not there in the rental agreement so she is not eligible to pay the rent since she is already living in the same house there is some basic courtesy to pay the $ 200 now thing here is how are we going to divide it if she is paying $ 200 will that be deducted out of your room mate 's or yours fact of the matter is who is taking more space and who is paying for it since there is no change to your space you should continue paying the same amount because there is no change in your space as you mentioned before moreover the fact that she is paying the utilities is good enough because that is shared by all 3 so keep the arrangement like somewhat like this you pay half the rent + utilities and your friend and his girlfriend will pay their share of the rent which is equal to yours and they will share the utilities too hope this makes sense    thanks

there 's really not a simple yes no answer   it depends on whether you 're doing short term trading or long term investing   in the short term it 's not much different from sports betting and would be almost an exact match if the also got a percentage of the team 's ticket sales in the long term though your profit mostly comes from the growth of the company   as a company apple say or tesla increases sales of iphones or electric cars it either pays out some of the income as dividends or invests them in growing the company so it becomes more valuable   if you bought shares cheaply way back when you profit from this increase when you sell them   the person buying it does n't lose as s he buys at today 's market value in anticipation of continued growth   of course there 's a risk that the value will go down in the future instead of up of course there are also psychological factors say when people buy apple or tesla because they 're popular instead of at a rational valuation   or when people start panic selling as in the 08 crash   so then their loss is your gain assuming you did n't panic of course

you have received much good advice but based on 53 years investing and the first 25 getting my nose and breaking even i very strongly offer the following before doing so let me first offer this caveat i am not questioning your broker or the advice but it is only valuable to you if history proves correct no one not even bernanke can predict how stock will perform in the future maybe if he sees a depression my advice to someone new to stock investing is to purchase a index fund from a discount broker e.g. fidelity or vanguard and then study the market and economics the wall street journal and the web are my favorites i started with a hell of a lot less than you have saved i would not turn $ 200 k over to anyone until you know exactly the risk and cost involved also i would n't depend on one person or firm to advise or manage my money i like to balance one against the other i do not recall different firms recommending the same stocks one must remember everyone in the business of recommending stock or any investment is selling something and must be compensated that 's how they earn a living

when you invest in an etf or mutual fund you 're not investing in stocks or bonds you 're buying shares of a company that invests in stocks or bonds this level of is what makes it so bond funds do not mature bonds inside of etfs or mutual funds do have a maturity date when they mature the fund manager uses the principal value that is returned to purchase another bond that meets the investment objectives of the fund so the fund never matures since it is always investing in more bonds when the old ones mature unit investment trusts made of bonds do have a maturity date as well since the portfolio does not change once the uit is issued as the individual bonds in the portfolio mature the principle value is returned to investors so the overall maturity date is effectively the maturity date of the last bond in the trust all of the statements quoted above are accurate in explaining why there is no guarantee of a return of principle when investing in bond funds etf or open ended mutual fund the bonds they hold do mature but are replaced within the fund as needed the investor will never see it happen unless they watch the holdings reports filed by the funds   the only way to have an assurance of the return of principle is to invest in individual bonds or in unit trusts made up of bonds

section 8 housing at least these days is a scam meant to funnel poor and into shitty areas and shitty housing away from the wealthy affluent areas that have decent jobs and services int he 70s people on assistance which includes lots of minorities were entering into middle class or better white neighborhoods and making racists and angry so then they decided people on section 8 were spending too much money on rent and instead moved them to cheaper section 8 housing blocks of course areas purposefully concentrated with people all on government assistance would never flourish economically but it does make the surrounding land cheaper thus you can build and cram even more section 8 people into that area and get paid by the government to do it   unsurprisingly you do n't have a flourishing economy in an area mainly composed of poor people with the cheapest and shittiest housing they can legally make no businesses want to move there so crime rates go up and desirability keeps going down

401(k does n't have a return rate because 401(k is not a type of investment it is a vehicle for investment with certain tax treatments just like your money that 's not in a 401(k you can invest it in either the bank a cd stocks mutual funds bonds etc you can similarly depending on the options given to you by your 401(k plan invest the money in the 401(k in a cash account buy stocks mutual funds etc your return is dependent on how you invest your money not whether it 's in a 401(k or not whether it 's in a roth or traditional 401(k simply affects when and how it gets taxed it is true that most 401(k plans offer little variety in types of investments you can choose however this is not a big deal as chances are that in a few years you will leave your company at which point you are able to rollover the 401(k into an ira at which point you will have many many options for how to invest it to make a valid comparison you should be comparing the same type of investment in both cases that means you should assume the same return for both the money outside the 401(k and the money inside the 401(k and only consider the taxes and penalties if you plan to withdraw early

yes automatic rate increases are typical in my experience and i think it 's very greedy when it 's based on nothing except that your lease is up for renewal which is the situation you are describing yes you should negotiate i 've had success going to the apartment manager and having this conversation   make these points conclude i am not open to a rate increase though i will sign a renewal at the same rate i am paying now this conversation makes me very uncomfortable but i try not to show it i was able to negotiate a lease renewal at the same rate this way in a large complex in sacramento ca   if you are talking to a manager and not an owner they will probably have to delay responding until they can check with the owner the key really is that they want to keep units rented especially when units are staying empty empty units are lost income for the owner it is the other empty units that are staying empty that are the huge point in your favor

if they directly paid for your education it is possible that it would n't count as taxable income to you according to the irs depending on the amount if you receive educational assistance benefits from your employer    under an educational assistance program you can exclude up to $    of those benefits each year this means your employer should not    include those benefits with your wages tips and other compensation    shown in box 1 of your form w-2 this also means that you do not have    to include the benefits on your income tax return source however your situation is a bit trickier since they are sort of retroactively paying for your education i 'd think the answer is maybe and you should consult a tax professional since it is a gray area   update on further research i 'm going to downgrade that maybe to probably not but hopefully soon the reason i am doing so is that there is a bill in congress specifically to allow what you are asking which presumes that you currently ca n't do this   the bill is hr bill the student loan employment benefits act of 2013 sponsored by rep steve israel d it has co sponsors from both parties so that is promising for it 's passage i suppose however it appears to be still early in the legislative process if this issue is near dear to your heart maybe you should call your congressman summary of the bill from student loan employment benefits act of 2013 the internal    revenue code to exclude from the gross income of an employee amounts    paid by an employer under a student loan payment assistance program    limits the amount of such exclusion to $ 5,000 in a taxable year requires an employer student loan payment assistance program to be a    separate written plan of an employer to provide employees with student    loan payment assistance   defines student loan payment assistance as    the payment of principal or interest on any indebtedness incurred by    an employee solely to pay qualified higher education expenses which    are paid or incurred within a reasonable time before or after such    indebtedness was incurred and are attributable to education furnished    during a period in which such employee was a student eligible for    federal financial assistance

lots of loans that are shady to say the least are advertised currently on tv in the uk i 'm happily in a situation where i do n't need a loan but might be asked to be a guarantor if anyone asked me to be a guarantor for a loan i 'd either be capable and willing to loan that money to the person myself or i would n't guarantee i 'd never ever in a million years be a guarantor   there is one company in particular offering loans the good old fashioned way asking for interest with a guarantor that is an interest rate that can bankrupt the guarantor if you take the loan with me as the guarantor and you decide that you are not interested in paying back the loan i 'm stuck with this loan so since the guarantor must trust you if he or she is established in the uk the best thing to do would be for them to take a loan from a bank or any supermarket nowadays will give you a loan at a decent rate in their own name give the money to you and hope that you pay back the money i 'm equally responsible for repayment whether i 'm guarantor or whether the loan is in my name so i 'd get that loan at a decent rate from a reputable bank

you are probably right that using a traditional buy and hold strategy on common equities or funds is very unlikely to generate the types of returns that would make you a millionaire in short order however that does n't mean it is n't possible you just have to accept a more risk to become eligible for such incredible returns that you 'd need to do that and by more risk i mean a lot more risk which is more likely to put you in the than a mansion mostly we are talking about highly speculative investments like commodities and real estate however if you are looking for potential to make or more likely lose huge amounts of money in the stock market without a very large cache of cash options give you much more leverage than just buying a stock outright that is by buying option contracts you can get a much larger return on a small movement in the stock price compared to what you would get for the same investment if you bought the stock directly   of course you take on additional risk a normal long position on a stock is very unlikely to cause you to lose your entire investment whereas if the stock does n't move far enough and in the right direction you will lose your entire investment in option contracts

as others have pointed out the theoretical prices in each exchange rate are identical however the cost to you may vary you need to work out the opportunity cost of using each of the three currencies because you lose money every time you convert between two currencies let 's supposed for example that you live in canada and earn and spend cad there but also happen to have some hkd to keep this simple i 'll ignore the usd but you can apply the same reasoning to that if you 're not planning on visiting hong kong for a while then your holdings of hkd are just gathering dust so your choices are to convert them to cad and make the gbp purchase in cad or to spend the hkd directly on the gbp purchase probably the first option will end up costing you more in conversion fees than the second but you need to look at the precise costs to verify this if you are planning on visiting hong kong soon and will need the hkd then the choices are somewhat different you can either spend cad on the gbp purchase or you can spend the hkd on the gbp purchase and then soon convert some cad into more hkd for your trip in this case the first option will probably end up costing you less in conversion fees

market price is just the bid or offer price of the last sell or buy order in the market the price that you actually receive or pay will be the price that the person buying the stock off you or selling it to you will accept if there are no other participants in the market to make up the other side of your order i.e. to buy off you if you are selling or to sell to you if you are buying the exchange pays large banks to be market makers they fulfil your order using stocks that they do n't want to either buy or sell just so that you get your order filled when you place an order outside of market hours the order is kept on the broker 's order books until the market and then at market opening time there is an opening auction at which orders are matched to opposing orders i.e. each buy order will be matched with a sell at a price determined by auction you will not know what price the order was filled at until it has been filled if you want to guarantee a price you can do so by placing a limit order that says not to pay more than a certain price for any unit of the stock

yes when i place an order with my broker they send it out to the exchange for individual investors what are some cons and pros of trading on     the exchanges directly versus indirectly via brokers i may be highly doubt it but from my understanding you can not trade directly through an exchange as a retail investor bats allows membership but it is only for   your firm must be a registered broker dealer registered with a self regulatory organization and connected with a clearing firm no apple aapl is listed on the nasdaq so trades go through the nasdaq for aapl caterpillar inc cat is listed on the nyse so trades go through the nyse   the exchange you trade on is dependent on the security if it is listed on the nyse then you trade on the nyse as a regular investor you will be going through a broker when looking to purchase a security it is more important to know about the company and less important to know what exchange it is listed on since there are rules a company must comply with for it to be listed on certain exchanges it does make a difference but that is more the case when speaking about a stock listed over the or nyse it is not important when asking nyse or nasdaq selecting a broker is something that 's dependent on your needs you should ask your self what s important to me do i want iphone android do i need fancy trading tools generally all the brokers you listed will most likely do the trick for you some review sites brokerage review   online broker review 2012 barron 's 2012 online broker review

stock index funds are likely but not certainly to be a good long term investment   in countries other than the usa there have been 30 + year periods where stocks either underperformed compared to bonds or even lost value in absolute terms   this suggests that it may be an to assume that they always do well in the long term   furthermore it may suggest that they are persistently overvalued for the risk and perhaps due for a long term correction   if everybody assumes they 're safe the equity risk premium is likely to be eaten up putting all of your money into them would for most people be taking an unnecessary risk   you should cover some other asset classes too   if stocks do very well a portfolio with some allocation to more stable assets will still do fairly well   if they crash a portfolio with less risky assets will have a better chance of being at least adequate

when on this topic you 'll often hear general rules of thumb and similar to the only buy stocks if you plan to hold more than x years there are going to be periods where if you buy at a bottom right before the market turns up you might be ahead just months after you buy i 'd say that if you buy right below market you 're ahead the day you close   edit i maintain and have schiller providing supporting data that real estate goes up with inflation in the long term no more no less if the rise were perfectly smooth correlated 100 month to month you 'd find it would take x years to break even to the costs of buying commission and closing costs if we call that cost about 8 and inflation averages 3 it points to a 3 year holding period to break even but since real estate rises and falls in the short term there are periods longer than 4 years where real estate lags and very short periods where it rises faster than the costs involved   the buy vs rent is a layer right on top of this if you happen upon a time when the rental market is tight you may buy see the house decline 10 in value and when the math is done actually be ahead of the guy that rented

he general advice i get is that the younger you are the more higher risk investments you should include in your portfolio i will be frank this is a rule of thumb given out by many lay people and low level financial advisors but not by true experts in finance   it is little more than an old 's tale and does not come from solid theory nor empirical work   finance theory says the following the riskiness of your portfolio should inversely correspond to your risk aversion   period it says nothing about your age   some people become more risk averse as they get older but not everyone   in fact for many people it probably makes sense to increase the riskiness of their portfolio as they age because the uncertainty about both wealth social security the value of your house the value of your human capital and costs how many kids you will have the rate of inflation where you will live go down as you age so your overall level of risk falls over time without a corresponding mechanical increase in risk aversion in fact if you start from the assumption that people 's aversion is to not having enough money at retirement you get the result that people should invest in relatively safe securities until the probability of not having enough to cover their minimum needs gets small then they invest in highly risky securities with any money above this threshold this latter result sounds reasonable in your case   at this point it appears unlikely that you will be unable to meet your minimum needs i'm assuming here that you are able to appreciate the warnings about underfunded pensions in other answers and still feel comfortable   with any money above and beyond what you consider to be prudent preparation for retirement you should hold a risky but still fully diversified portfolio   do n't reduce the risk of that portion of your portfolio as you age unless you find your personal risk aversion increasing

the issue with your point is that government has does move to make decisions in the markets to institute their political views or agendas of which these views and agenda do not often take into consideration any of the unforeseen consequences in the light of market realities the market realities which i speak of are everything affected by government action from businesses dealing with the cost of extra added government regulation on their bottom line employee costs taxes the impact of subsidies and price controls etc in a competitive market where everyone is looking for an edge over their competitors however with government many times these market realities are often ignored when making broad and over reaching governmental polices based on political agendas and the whims of the public rather then on solid and sound economic decisions   which in turn these governmental polices effect many many more people then businesses acting for their own needs to ensure their survival in the marketplace thus having a president who does not or willfully will not acknowledge how government interaction in the market place can create unintended and often negative results is worse in respects to having a president who does understand how the bottom line is effected via government action and attempts to reconcile both in light of making a decisions that effects the economy as a whole

someone who filed for bankruptcy multiple times be running national finances at a time when we have a big debt problem   his answer   i 've never filed for bankruptcy   um to say the least this is semantics i would classify it as an outright lie   i say that because he the name on everything he is the president ceo chairman of the board he is responsible until things go south then the investors and debtors are left with an empty shell   here are some examples   trump plaza hotel bankruptcy on nov 2 1992 trump 's plaza hotel was forced to file chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after being unable to make its debt payments under the plan trump agreed to give up a 49 stake in this luxury hotel to citibank and five other lenders    trump shuttle closure the trump shuttle became no more when it merged with shuttle inc operating as shuttle in 1992   donald trump personal bankruptcy by 1994 trump slashed a large portion of his $ 900 million personal debt and washed away $ 3.5 billion in his portfolio 's business debt   trump hotels amp casino resorts bankruptcy on november 21 2004 trump 's company filed for bankruptcy trump said the filing was really just a technical thing as the best way to implement a restructuring plan   donald trump personal bankruptcy again once again trump filed for personal bankruptcy protection and restructured his debt in 2004   bankruptcy on november 22 2006 donald j. trump ’s casino empire filed for bankruptcy protection after months of negotiations with bondholders over restructuring a crushing debt   donald trump 's online travel search engine was launched in 2006 just a year later it folded   trump 29 casino now known as spotlight 29 casino because donald trump 's ownership management involvement ended in 2006   donald trump ocean resort baja this mexican resort was never built and investor 's deposits up to $ have not been returned trump claims these buyers are lucky because they would have lost more money in a tanking market had the projects been actually built   trump towers tampa trump is being sued right now in tampa florida for taking deposits on a condo tower that he never built none of the buyers got their $ 45,000 deposits back and in an ironic twist initial sales of this condo were so successful that all deposits were returned to charge a higher price   trump international hotel and tower chicago trump built the second tallest building in chicago he also defaulted on a $ 40 million loan rather than having to pay the bank loan trump demanded the same bank should pay him $ 3 billion for undermining the project and damaging his reputation   trump magazine trump 's private labeled publication which was aimed at affluent readers in major us markets suffered from ad sales it folded on may 19 2009 this was trump 's third failed attempt at offering a magazine bearing his name   trump international hotel amp tower new orleans if constructed this trump tower would become the tallest building in the city of new orleans and the state of louisiana at 70 stories high but the project was put on hold in february of 2009   trump entertainment resort holdings bankruptcy on february 17 2009 casino operator trump entertainment resorts inc filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with a debt ratio of $ 50 million in assets to his $ 500 million in debt   donald trump hotel condominium donald trump was sued for fraud over his new york condo offering in 2010 the lawsuit by 15 plaintiffs alleged that during the first 18 months of marketing trump advertised that the building was 30 40 50 60 percent or more sold when in fact just 16 of the units were sold   trump ocean resort baja mexico instead of a luxury vacation home complex with pools and tennis courts this project is shaping up to be a legal battle with a big hole in the ground dozens of angry buyers sued trump for failing to complete the project trump claims he only lent his name to the project and it was the developers who allowed the project to fail   trump international hotel amp tower fort lauderdale construction was to be completed by the end of 2009 featuring hotel condominium units having defaulted on a $ million loan donald trump announced in november of 2010 he was no longer affiliated with the project   trump international hotel amp tower las vegas through the end of february 2010 the condominium hotel had only closed on units that equates to a vacancy rate it was forced into renting out the building as apartments   trump international hotel amp tower in dubai this mixed used building on the palm ’s golden mile was first announced in 2005 construction was never started and the $ 2.9 billion project had been canceled and replaced with a shopping mall   so back to your distinction has he filed for personal bk   no   has he filed for personal bk protection while he reorganized debt yes   does he manipulate the corporate bk laws by playing a corp shell game and filing for bk protection yes   is it smart business

ultimately no one really knows what causes the markets to rise and fall beyond supply and demand if more people want to buy then sell prices go up and if more people want to sell prices go down the news channels will often try to attribute a specific reason to the price move but that is largely just guess work to fill up the news pages so people have something to read you may find it interesting to read up on the elliot wave principle the crash of 2008 was a perfect elliot wave fit elliot wave theory states that social which ultimately drive the stock market generally occur in a relatively predictable pattern the crash in september was a wave 3 down this is where the majority of people give up hope however there are still a few people who are still holding on the markets tend to about during wave 4 finally the last few people give up hope and sell out this causes the final crash of wave 5 only when the last person has given up hope can the markets start to go up again

i do n't believe most do it on purpose its a function of two things   1 markets are relatively efficient so generating profits off of publicly available information is rare   2 analysts can not ethically nor legally make   recommendation based on material non public information   that leaves them with using public information and building out s model to estimate earnings and therefore share price as best as possible the problem is that estimating earnings is notoriously difficult every model is subject to garbage in garbage out all analysts start with some of the same basic assumptions and then tweak them based on their best guess take enough analysts and you 've now replicated roughly what all investors are doing in the marketplace meaning as a whole analysts wo n't be more accurate than the market   the only way to generate above market returns is for you to consistently pick the analyst with the right recommendation if only it were so easy   furthermore analysts tend to make similar recommendations due to biases their initial model may have said buy for ge but they realize no other analysts have a buy rating on the stock they 're more likely to go back and revise their guesses to something more inline with their peers its less risky to be with the crowd   tl;dr   security selection is hard and outperformance without is unlikely over the long term   i am no longer in the industry after as an analyst and going through the cfa curriculum i 've learned that there are very few opportunities for out performance especially so on a risk adjusted basis

i think you 're over complicating it there is the market maker in the pure sense as what said a a middleman they are just the brokers in between the buyers and sellers and they simply make profit off of the spread differential   but market maker is also used to refer to large high volume buyers and sellers that can influence the price because they control a larger of volume these only really exist on low volume products and they slowly out the larger the volume on higher volume products i like to refer to them as institutions that is well informed large pockets whether is be central banks clearing houses hedge funds boutique firms these are the people who are generally in the know and they often bet against this helps

this is a poor example really it 's not necessary to measure inequality from the position of a janitor it 's more illustrative to measure it from the educated middle class who have also fallen sharply in household wealth relative to the 1 this trend is more surprising and disturbing as it runs counter to the great 20th century trend of a rising middle class   if you want to understand inequality just look at the rate of investment and the relative rate of return achieved by the 1   not only is the wealth of the 1 increasing it is increasing at a faster rate    needless to say that difference compounds over time   until we have an extended period of the wealthy losing money at a faster rate than the less wealthy inequality will rise and also needless to say that scenario is forever and always unacceptable to the 1   it 's easy to talk about solutions to inequality right up until someone asks how are we going to make the wealthy less wealthy in a relative sense   at which point you realize there are no serious efforts being made against inequality

having worked in insurance i can give you a few pointers firstly state that you may have to complain insurers hate complaints because they really complicate matters are loads of work and must be tracked i would advise not actually escalating it to a complaint until later as this may cause a delay as the actual process is quite convoluted mentioning the possibility of complaint sometimes makes people a bit more active try and resolve the issue and if you are n't getting anywhere then make a complaint maintain a friendly polite if you get angry and aggressive you 'll not likely get far remember that the people on the end of the phone are both human and more knowledgeable about insurance than you you want them on your side not against you make notes if you can record calls if you are recording calls you will likely legally need to give them the option of not being recorded so make sure you mention that you 're recording each individual call as soon as you start speaking to the handler   refer to your notes and make sure you carry out actions you say you will if you spend a few days sending something you said you 'd email over that day and you then chase them a few days after that they may not have had the document through their workflow yet it also urgency if you 're acting promptly and suggests that you do n't really care if you 're taking your time   get names this is an important step as this gives the handler someone to talk to who may be familiar with your case you may end up speaking to the same people more than once so try and build a rapport if you do i like this guy may lead to a bit more effort being put in and a potentially better outcome in my experience can be a bit slow to respond to things so you 'll likely have to chase them up if you chase them up and say i called on x date discussing y with z and z said they would do a b and c. has this been done yet it looks better than saying i called about a week ago and spoke to one of your colleagues who said he 'd do something for me he 's not done it what 's going on as to a plan of action i would split this into two points mis sold policy and definition of commuting mis sold policy if they truly gave your wife two options then they messed up the standard 3 offered by are social domestic and pleasure and and business use other companies sometimes roll commuting into as standard on the comparison sites however there are usually the three separate options and if you used one to set the policy up and clicked only then you may be in trouble   social domestic and pleasure only does not include commuting whilst it is your responsibility to thoroughly check any documentation that comes through it could be argued that if given two options between business use and then a reasonable person could be considered to assume that definition of did include commuting therefore they need to prove to you that there were three options offered and that your wife specifically excluded commuting if they ca n't then you should be able to argue that only two were offered and that commuting could have reasonably been assumed to be included use that term reasonable person btw it 's used in a lot of internal literature at least at the insurer i worked at not commuting firstly clarify their definition of commuting if your wife was on her way to work afterwards then they may well consider she was commuting for instance at present i drive from my house to my son 's then to my wife 's work and finally to mine my commute could be argued to be 1 minute my workplace is probably a minutes drive from my wife 's but i ca n't park in her car park but if i were to have an accident between my house and my son 's ~15 mins drive the insurers would probably consider that commuting   if she was not on her way to work afterwards and assuming your wife arranged her visit via text or whatsapp fb messenger or similar you should easily be able to show that your wife had driven from a friends house to the if she was on a holiday day or was not working on that day then that 's also something you should be able to prove either with proof of her working pattern or proof of her holiday if she does n't have a job at all then again that 's something that 's provable proof reigns king in claims so if you can prove certain key facts then you should be on to a winner

forecasts of stock market direction are not reliable so you should n't be putting much weight on them   long term you can expect to do better in stocks but obtaining this better expected return has the danger of buying in to the market at a particularly bad moment leading to a substantially lower return   so mitigate that risk while moving in a big piece of cash by dollar cost averaging   an example would be to divide your cash hoard conceptually into say six pieces and invest each piece in the index fund two months apart   after a year you will have invested the whole sum at about the average of the index for the year
