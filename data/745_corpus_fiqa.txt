you 're interpreting this correctly furthermore if your total tax liability is less than $ 1000 you can not pay estimates at all just pay at the tax day see this safe harbor rule in the irs publication 17 general rule     in most cases you must pay estimated tax for 2016 if    both of the following apply you expect to owe at least $ 1,000 in tax for 2016 after subtracting your withholding and refundable credits you expect your withholding plus your refundable credits to be less than the smaller of 90 of the tax to be shown on your 2016 tax return or 100 of the tax shown on your 2015 tax return but see special rules for farmers fishermen and higher income taxpayers later    your 2015 tax return must cover all 12 months

there is empirical data to suggest deregulation in healthcare would drive down prices in a free market where prices are transparent prices go down    as to your pharmaceutical example that is a form of protectionism regulation the reason why epipen is able to charge that price is because they have a patent protection protectionism that lasts through 2025 lack of there is no substitute    if there were a reform in pharma laws that made pharmaceutical company have to share their patents for licensing costs similar to how cellular providers must provide access to their networks for a fee then the price would go down    market forces do reign supreme it is supply and demand as simple as that if there is a market with a lot of profit in a free market participants will enter the market until the profit drops down to zero that is why you can not charge 10 dollars for a big mac in the same city where a mcdonalds 1 mile away charges 5 dollars

i think you 've confused what i am saying here as are others i 'm not making an argument where i say either private insurance vs. government management vs. single payer is best because to me you are just arguing whether its more effective to shovel coal wood or up paper into the fires of cost inflation    the systems in the us and all other oecd nations are actual quite similar despite the semantic hair splitting of partisans with aca our system is quite indistinguishable from that of the netherlands my point is that none of these systems costs therefor none of them solve the core problem   to put my point another way as long as you fund health care through a financial product like insurance whether it be public of private you are going to see this level of inflation just like we saw in housing prior to the sub prime bubble and just like we are seeing now with college tuition

there are multiple problems with your claim firstly in some places uber and lyft are regulated in california they are regulated as transportation network puc enforcement secondly i do n't think this particular practice calling in fake rides is something that is prohibited by regulations or at least enforced for existing industries like taxis and cars i have heard anecdotes that taxi companies routinely do the same thing and that this is why taxis often do n't show up if you call and request one i think your attribution of this practice to unregulated capitalism is misguided

gaining traction is your first priority warning as explains in his answer the tax penalty for withdrawing from a 401(k can easily exceed the apr of the credit card making it a very bad strategy consult in depth with a financial advisor to see before taking that path   as @joetaxpayer has noted a loan is another alternative the 401k is no good to you if you ca n't have shelter or comfort in the mean time   the idea is to look at all the money as a single thing and balance it together   there is no credit and retirement just a single target that you can hit by moving the good money to clear the bad consolidating the credit card debt somehow would be very wise if you can   assuming it is 30 apr shrinking that quickly is the first priority you may be able to justify a hardship withdrawal to finance the reduction consolidation of the credit card   it may be worth considering negotiating a closure arrangement with a reduced principal   credit card companies can be quite open to this as it gets their money back you may also be able to negotiate a lower interest rate you may be able to negotiate a non credit affecting debt consolidation with a debt   they want to make money and a 25 k loan to a person with sound credit is a pretty good bet moving buying a house or any of that may just relocate the problem    you may be able to withdraw $ 25 k from your 401k under hardship pay the credit card and come up with a payment plan for the medical debt it 's a retirement setback for sure but retirement is an illusion with that credit card shark eating all of your hard earned money   you got ta that beast quick again be sure to fully analyze whether the penalty on the 401(k withdrawal exceeds the apr of the credit card

how often should one use dollar cost averaging trivially a dollar cost averaging dca strategy must be   used at least twice more seriously dca is a discipline that people typically investors with relatively small amounts of money to invest each month or each quarter   use to avoid to the temptation to time the market   as mhoran_psprep points out it is well suited to 401k plans and the like e.g. 403b plans for educational and non profit institutions 457 plans for state employees etc and indeed is actually   the default option in such plans since a fixed amount of money gets invested each week or every   two weeks or every month depending on the payroll schedule many plans offer just a few mutual funds in which to invest though far too many people having little knowledge or understanding of   investments simply opt for the money market fund or guaranteed annuity fund in their plans   in any case all your money goes to work immediately since all mutual funds let you invest in of a share some plans allow investments in stocks through a brokerage but i think that using dca to   buy individual stocks in a retirement plan is not a good   idea at all the reasons for this are that not only must shares must be bought in whole numbers but it is generally cheaper to buy stocks in round lots   of 100 or multiples of 100 shares rather than in odd lots of say 37 shares so buying stocks weekly or biweekly or monthly in a 401k plan means paying more or having the money sit idle until enough is accumulated to buy 100 shares of a stock at which point the brokerage executes the order to buy the stock and this is really not dca at all   worse yet if you let the money accumulate but you are the one calling the shots buy 100 shares of appl today instead of letting the brokerage execute the order when there is enough money you are likely to   be timing the market instead of doing dca so are brokerages useless in retirement fund accounts   no they can be useful but they are not suitable for dca strategies involving buying stocks stick to mutual funds for dca do people use it across the board on all stock investments as indicated above using dca to buy individual stocks is not the best idea regardless of whether it is done inside a retirement plan or outside dca outside a retirement plan works best if you not trust yourself to stick with the strategy i forgot to mail the check yesterday oh well i will do it next week but rather arrange for your mutual fund company to take the money out of your checking account each week month quarter etc and invest it in whatever fund(s you have chosen most companies have such programs under names such as automatic investment program etc why not have your bank send the money to the mutual fund company instead well that works too but my bank charges me for sending the money whereas my mutual fund company does for free but ymmv dollar cost averaging generally means investing   a fixed amount of money on a periodic basis an alternative strategy if one has decided that owning 1200 shares of co is a good investment to have is to buy round lots of 100 shares of each month the amount of money invested each month varies but at the end of the year the average cost of the 1200 shares is the average of the prices on the 12 days on which the investments were made of course by the end of the year you might not think is worth holding any more this technique worked best in the   good old days when blue chip stocks   paid what was for all practical purposes a guaranteed dividend each year and people bought these stocks with the intention of passing them on to their and children

yes the distinction between how your funds are applied to principal vs interest is very important the interest amount charged each period probably monthly is not just one fixed sum calculated at the origination but rather is a dynamically calculated amount that changes each period relative to how much principal is remaining amount you owe   the picture you posted showing principal and interest assumes the payer always paid their minimum payment and never made any extra payments of principal take a look at the following graph and play around with the extra payment fields you will see some pretty drastic differences in the total interest paid green lines when extra payments are made

not everyone pays their balance in full every month they may not make interest off of you or me but they do make interest off of a lot of cardholders in many cases the interest is variable and the larger your running balance the higher your rate if you 're close to your limit and making minimum payments you can literally take decades to pay off $ 2,000 or so   some people do n't pay at all every month and end up paying late fees some people use their cards overseas and pay foreign transaction fees ever take a cash advance me neither but they charge you interest right away for that instead of waiting until your statement the list of fees and charges is as long as my arm and in tiny print that 's how they make money the points bonus cash back and other rewards programs are to get you in the door it 's like when you see a luxury car advertised for a too good to be true price and you get to the lot and find out that the one they are selling for that price is a manual transmission without ac or a radio they only had one and they sold it an hour before you got there it got you on the lot though the rewards programs function in much the same way minus the disappearing part they get you interested in their offering among a sea of virtually identical products but rest assured if the card issuers were losing money because of them they would n't exist for very long

  the guy claimed that btc had intrinsic value so i asked him what value btc had   btc has literally 0 intrinsic value it does n't even exist physically   i 'm not saying the technology is worthless or that it does n't have value but it certainly does n't have intrinsic value   gold you can create things with gold silver silver is important in medical applications can be made into things   these things have value even in circumstances where the market disappears or the demand ceases   a company has intrinsic value in that its assets can be sold off and liquidated for cash even if they do n't generate a single penny   gold has intrinsic value in that even if there is no one demanding gold it can still be useful for something     if no one wants btc you literally ca n't do anything with it except look at the numbers   it 's the equivalent of hoarding a pile of dust that the market valued for some reason and then the market crashes what are you going to do with a pile of dust   literally nothing except watch it fly in the wind   it was only worth something because other people valued it     block chain is revolutionary tech but there is no iv with btc   btc and block chain are n't really even interchangeable it 's like the relationship between a square and a rectangle a square is a rectangle but a rectangle is not necessarily a square   btc is block chain but block chain is n't btc   even if btc fails and dies there will be something else that takes its place but there is no iv with btc   trying to assign btc some sort of iv is a misleading   there are many reasons btc is revolutionary but it 's not because there is some sort of huge iv attached to it     and where did i ever call btc a ponzi scheme   you sound like you got a chip on your shoulder

yes an overall $ 500 loss on the stock can be claimed since the day trader sold both lots she acquired the wash sale rule has no net impact on her taxes the wash sale rule would come into play if within thirty days of second sale she purchased the stock a third time then she would have to amend her taxes because claiming the $ 500 loss would no longer be a valid under the wash sale rule it would have to be added to the cost basis of the most recent purchase

1 in most cases the difference between filing joint or married filing single is close to zero when there is a difference you 're better off filing joint   2 the way the w4 works is based on how many allowances you claim unfortunately even in the day of computers it does not allow for a simple well my deduction are $ xxx do n't tax that money each allowance is equal to one exemption same as you get for being you same as the wife gets same as each kid 3 people x $ 3800 = $ you are telling the employer to take off the top before calculating your tax she does this by using circular e and is able to calculate your tax as you request if one is in the 15 bracket one more exemption changes the tax withheld by $ 570 so if you were going to owe $ 400 in april one few exemption will have you overpay $ 170 i.e. in this 15 bracket each exemption changes annual withholding by that $ 570   for most people running the w4 numbers will get them very close and only if they are getting back or owing over $ 500 will they even think of adjusting   3 my recently published last minute tax moves offers a number of interesting ideas to address this the concept of grouping deductions in odd years is worth noting   4 i 'm not sure what this means 2 accounts each worth $ 5000 should grow at the same rate if invested the same the time it makes sense to load one person 's account first is if they have better matching you say you are not sure what percent your wife 's company matches you need to change this for both of your retirement plans you need to know every detail exact way to maximize matching expense ratios for the investments you choose any other fees etc knowledge is power and all that in what is an appropriate level of 401k fees or expenses in a typical plan i go on to preach about how fees can wipe out any tax benefit over time for any new investor my first warning is always to understand what you are getting into if you ca n't explain it to a friend you should n't be in it   edit you first need to understand what choices are within the accounts the 4 and 6 are in hindsight right these are not fixed returns you should look at the choices and more heavily fund the account with the better selection deposit to her account at least to grab the match   as far as the longer term goals see how the house purchase goes life has a way of sending you two kids and forcing you to tighten the budget you may have other ideas in three years i have no p2p lending experience by the way   last many advise that separate finances are a bad path for a couple it depends jane and i have separate check books and every paycheck just keep enough to write small checks without worry most of the money goes to the house account whatever works for you is what you should do we 've been happily married for most of the 17 years we 've been married

this is great thanks so just assuming a fund happened to average out to libor plus 50 for a given year would applying that rate to the notional value of the index swaps provide a reasonable estimate of the drag an etf investor would experience due to the cost associated with the index swaps   for instance applying this to the hypothetical i linked to in the original question they assumed fund assets of $ 100 m with 2x leverage achieved through $ 85 m of s&amp;p500 stocks $ 25 m of s&amp;p500 futures and a notional value of the s&amp;p500 swaps at $ so the true costs to an etf investor would be expense ratio + commissions on the $ 85 m of s&amp;p500 holdings + costs associated with $ 25 m of futures contracts + costs associated with the $ 90 m of swaps and the costs associated with the $ 90 m of swaps might be roughly libor plus 50

i switched to the buy side here is some things you should do   first of all you already had 6 interviews   i would say the hr people are going to be less helpful because its harder to differentiate yourself   if you are talking to an investment portfolio and they ask you any of type of   what are you interested in how did you get into this space   you better have multiple stock pitches lined up   for example on the the first question   i 'm interested in im because i was exposed at an early age by my parents   although i did n't know what i was doing i kept following stock 1 you 're first crack in the   more about your background stuff   in fact stock 1 turned out to be one of my best worst trades   i thought it was going here and it went there due to this and that and etc info about stock 1   now i like to look at names such as stock 2 5 because they are show this multiple or that yield or these depending on who you are talking to   that is how you get a job through an informational interview     as for how you get an informational interview   go run through linkedin   sort for investment management   any person you have a 2nd degree network or group network is fair game   just shoot your common friend an email hey what s up i saw you were friends with x i 'm really interested in his company can you put me in touch   although the end person may never respond the connection is like almost guaranteed to help assuming you 're a nice friendly person   recruiting for im is a full time job   even other industries as well   my roommate graduated business undergrad program top 3 in the country in two years not 2 letters and science + 2 business but 2 total years at 19 years old took him a full year of recruiting and paying his own way out to ny to meet people to land an banking job due to similar circumstances as he was fully out of school and was n't in the normal rotation   what really concerns me is you keep saying analysis   it makes me think that you have no clue what you want to do   tell me what analysis means   if you want to recruit for im you better be watching the markets everyday esp if you are unemployed have opinions on lots of companies etc

this does n't really make sense as the small cap indices have a similar rate of growth as the s&amp;p 500 the global scale has some relevance but exports are included in gdp as well so it 's not the full story   a better answer as is noted in comments lower down is that the s&amp;p does not grow at 6 it returns 6 per year the dividend yield of the s&amp;p is a bit over 2 dividends are not growth they are simply income they may also grow themselves but rarely by 6 per year in real terms additional income that 's not paid out in dividends probably amounts to another 1 2 growth is the final 1 3 which makes it roughly match gdp

if the equity market in the usa crashed its very likely equity markets everywhere else would crash the usa has a high number of the world 's largest businesses and there are correlations between equity markets so you need to think of equities as a global asset class not regional your question is then a question about the correlation between equity markets and currency markets   here 's a guess if equity markets crashed you would see a lot of panic selling of stocks denominated in many currencies but probably the most in usd due to the large number of the world 's largest businesses trading on us stock exchanges therefore when the rest of the world sells us equities they receive cash usd which they might sell for their local currency that selling pressure would cause usd to fall but when equity markets crash there 's a move to safety of the bond markets the world 's largest bond markets are denominated in which currency probably usd so those who receive usd for their equities are going to spend that usd on bonds in which case there is probably no correlation between equity markets and currency markets at all a quick google search shows this kind of thing

you ask a few different though not unrelated questions everywhere you turn today you hear    people talk about how much they need    to save or how important it is to find    a good deal on things in this    economy they use phrases like now    more than ever and in these    uncertain times it seems to be a lot    of doom and gloom some of this is marketing   you may notice that when the economy goes south the number of ads for the cheaper alternatives goes north   e.g. hair discount grocery stores discount just about anything   truth is we should always be looking for ways to save money on goods and services we purchase   the question is what is acceptable to you for your desired lifestyle   and is that desired lifestyle reasonable for your income age and personal situation   generally speaking the harder times are the more we find discounted cheaper alternatives acceptable    is there really a good reason that    people should be saving more than    spending right now how much you are putting away is a personal matter   i can still remember my dad whenever he could n't save half of his paycheck   that said putting away half your paycheck may lead to a rather lifestyle   this of course depends on the size of your paycheck and your desired lifestyle   you could be raking it living simply and potentially put away more than half your income with relative ease if you have a stable job and a decent cash reserve is it anymore dangerous to make a large purchase now than it was seven years ago who knows   honestly no one   predicting the future is a fool 's errand   if you are interested in reading more on this view point i suggest the black swan you mention the correct approach in this question   ensure that you have liquid assets cash or cash equivalents i.e. money that you can draw on immediately and is n't credit which covers at least 3 6 months of your necessary expenses rent mortgage bills car payments food   there is no reason that you could n't try to increase this to 1 year especially in this economy you should also strive to have money available for emergencies that do n't necessarily include loss of income   of course make sure you 're putting away for retirement as appropriate for your retirement goals   after that should come discretionary items including investing entertainment the large purchase you mentioned etc    you should never use money that you may need immediately 5 10 years for investing   this does n't necessarily include the large purchase you are contemplating   for example if you are considering purchasing a home the down payment may be one of the items for which you need money in the immediate future is it really only because of unemployment numbers this is probably the big one that is the focus of everyone 's attention   that said the human attention span is limited   we have a natural need to simplify things   this is one of the reasons that we tend to focus on a few hopefully important things   however the unemployment numbers are not that the only thing of concern   credit is still pretty hard to come by these days   the overall economy is still hurting even if we are technically no longer in a recession   there are also concerns about u.s. government borrowing consumer spending recent trucking numbers etc   it may not be obvious but trucking is used as a barometer of economic activity   if there are n't as many trucks goods across the country it probably means that there is less economic activity   the headline number these days is unemployment as most census workers have now been returned to the pool to answer the overall question we should always be saving money in good times or in bad   be that by squeezing more value out of our purchases or by putting some money away   we should always try to reduce our risks by having an emergency cash cushion   we should always be saving for retirement   truth be told it is probably more important to put money away in good times before the hardships hit

because they track an index edited the definition of the word in this case meaning something used or serving to point out a sign token or indication from meaning   3 i presume therefore you are asking what an index is there are many variations of what makes up an index but in short it is a representation of some part of a market an extremely simplistic calculation would be to take a basket of stocks and sum their prices   if one stock moves up a dollar and one moves down a dollar the index has effectively not changed as it is presumed that the loss in one is offset by the gain in the other

gt what they pay is the market wage by definition   how are we defining market retailers if so they pay below market   other retailers pay more   try and make that fact stick for a second before you reply   if you define wal mart as it 's own market sure they pay market wages by definition   they are after all the largest retailer in the usa   gt in which case why do n't they work for one of those other employers   low turnover at those other employers   workers who are happy leave the company less thus less openings for new workers   gt in what way does that force people to work for wal mart you act like the only way to get a job is to work for them if you do not like the job that wal mart offers you there is no compulsion to accept it   again real world vs theory   look at small towns across the country where wal mart down a superstore right at the annex of the biggest few towns in the area   ca n't compete but the people still live there   a lot them all their lives   those shop owners know how to do retail and guess what jobs open up in their areas choosing to move somewhere else and your whole life is n't an easy thing to do for those folks   taking a job at wal mart to support your family does n't seem like a terrible option to a lot of them at the time when it happens   heck people actually get excited about wal mart thinking they could make manager one day and what have you   so they do choose to work for wal mart but really they have no other choice   they could just become homeless yes that is a choice they could make   is it a realistic one no   gt workers are not essentially the same if they were they would tend to have the same wage   did n't you just get done telling me that market wages are set by the market   you honestly believe that the workers at costco are inherently more capable of the retail work costco does and therefore do n't work at wal mart because of their superior skillset   i worked at wal mart briefly out of high school   i was a great worker when i got hired because i worked for the store remodel team out of arkansas and they trained me very well   then i started working in electronics and had very bad training by the outgoing manager so i was viewed as a bad worker by the new manager of that department   was i bad worker not at all i just was n't trained well     wal mart has excellent and fully capable workers in some stores some areas etc and terrible ones in others   they have a revolving cast of managers and a lot of the capable ones leave the second something better comes along   so you have this management style and training that can be anything and yes the more competent people leave   why because wal mart pays below market wages and benefits   you can find good and bad workers at all retail stores some with excellent training and some without   wal mart is a bottom but they employ plenty of good people who just have no other options   you seem to have this notion that the more productive workers are readily apparent why look at this fine he 's 20 more productive than the rest of your workers   it does n't work like that in real life   sorry

simply put it makes sense from the moment you can afford the loss without negative consequences for example if your car costs $ 20000 and you happen to have another $ 20000 laying around you can choose not to insure your car against damage in the worst case you can simply buy a new one however not insuring your car has a hidden cost you ca n't long term invest that money anymore if your insurance costs $ 500 a year and you can invest those $ 20000 with a return on investment of more than 2.5 it still makes sense to invest that money while having your car insured

the ultimate reason to own stock is to receive cash or cash equivalents from the underlying security you can argue that you make money when stock is valued higher by the market but the valuation should though clearly not necessarily is be based on the expected payout of the underlying security there are only three ways money can be returned to the shareholder as you can see if you do n't ask for dividends you are basically asking for one of the top two too occur which happens in the future at the end of the company 's life as an independent entity if you think about the time value of money money in the hand now as dividends can be worth more than the ultimate appreciation of liquidation or acquisition value add in uncertainty as a factor for ultimate value and my feeling is that dividends are underpaid in today 's markets

it 's a statement that seems to be true about our tendency to believe we wo n't make the same mistake twice even though we do and that somehow what 's occurring in the present is completely different even when the underlying fundamentals of the situation may be nearly identical   it 's a form of self delusion and sometimes mass delusion and it has been a major contributing factor to many of our worst financial disasters if you look at every housing bubble for instance we examine the aftermath put new regulations and procedures into place theoretically to prevent it from happening again and then move forward   when the cycle starts to repeat itself we ignore the signals telling ourselves oh that ca n't happen again this time it 's different when investors begin to ignore the warning signs because they think the current situation is somehow totally different and therefore there will be a different outcome than the last disaster that 's when things actually do go bad the 2008 housing crisis was caused by the same essential forces that brought about similar albeit smaller scale housing disasters in the 80 's and 90 's greed caused banks and other participants in the housing sector to make loans they knew were no good an oversimplification to be sure but apt nonetheless and eventually the roof in on the market   in 2008 the essential dynamics were the same but everyone had convinced themselves that the markets were more sophisticated and could never allow things like that to happen again   so everyone told themselves this was different and they dove into the markets ignoring all of the warning signs along the way that clearly told the story of what was coming had anyone bothered to notice

all right i will try to take this nice and slow this is going to be a little long try to bear with me suppose you contribute $ 100 to your newly opened 401(k you now have $ 100 in cash and $ 0 in mutual funds in your 401(k and $ 100 less than you used to somewhere else at some later date you use that money within the 401(k to buy a single share of the acme world all market index fund which happens to trade at exactly $ 100 per share on the day your purchase goes through as a result you have $ 0 in cash and exactly one share of that fund corresponding to $ 100 within your 401(k some time later the price of the fund is up 10 so your share is now worth $ 110 since you have n't contributed anything more to your 401(k for whatever reason your cash holding is still $ 0 because your holding is really denominated in shares of this mutual fund of which you still have exactly one the cash equivalent of your holding is now $ 110 now you can basically do one of two things by selling the share you protect against it falling in price thus in a sense locking in your gain but where do you put the money instead you obviously ca n't put the money in anything else that might fall in price doing so would mean that you could lose a portion of your gains the only way to truly lock in a gain is to remove the money from your investment portfolio altogether roughly speaking that means withdrawing the money and spending it and then you have to consider if the value of what you spent the money on can fluctuate and as a consequence fall what 's the value of that three weeks old of milk in the back of your refrigerator the beauty of compounding is that it does n't care when you bought an investment let 's say that you kept the original fund which was at $ 110 now since that day it is up another 5 since we are looking at the change of price of the fund over some period of time that 's 5 of $ 110 not 5 of the $ 100 you bought at which was an arbitrary point anyway 5 of $ 110 is $ 5.50 which means that the value of your holding is now at $ from a gain first of 10 followed by another 5 if at the same day when the original fund was at $ 110 you buy another $ 100 worth of it the additional 5 gain is realized on the sum of the two at the time of the purchase or $ 210 thus after the additional 5 gain you would have not $ 210 $ 100 + $ 100 + 5 nor $ $ 100 + 5 + $ 100 but $ $ 110 + $ 100 + 5 see how you do n't need to do anything in particular to realize the beauty of compounding growth there is one exception to the above some investments pay out dividends interest or equivalent in cash equivalents basically deposit money into an account of yours somewhere in the case of retirement plans usually within the same container where you are holding the investment these dividends are generally not counted against your contribution limits but check the relevant legal texts if you want to be absolutely certain this is somewhat uncommon in mutual funds but very common in other investments such as stocks or bonds that you purchase directly which you really should not do if you are just starting out and/or feel the need to ask this type of question in that case you need to place a purchase order yourself for whatever you want to invest the dividend in if you do n't then the extra money of the dividend will not be growing along with your original investment

i agree with mhoran_psprep 's answer but would like to add a few additional points to consider    turbotax and the professional it will send to represent you in case of a tax audit   have no more information about your tax return than what you entered into the program   now there are three or four different kinds of audits    the correspondence audit is the most common kind where irs sends a letter requesting copies of documents supporting a deduction or tax credit that you have claimed representation is hardly necessary in this case    the office audit is more serious where you have to make an appointment and go to the local irs office with paperwork that the examining agent needs to see physically and to answer questions etc   it would be better to be accompanied by a representative at these meetings but office audits are not as common as correspondence audits and because they are expensive for the irs usually occur when the irs is fairly sure of recovering a substantial sum of money   if you have been cutting corners and pushing the envelope in taking large enough deductions to make it worthwhile for the irs to go after you you probably should not have been using turbotax to file your income tax return   but should have been using an accountant or tax preparer who would be   representing you in case of an audit if the reason that you used turbotax   is that no accountant was willing to prepare a tax return with the deductions   that you wished to claim i doubt that having turbotax 's representative with you when you go to the irs office will help you all that much an example of a field audit is when the irs agent comes to your home to see if you actually have a space set aside to use exclusively as your home office as you claimed you did etc a taxpayer compliance measurement program audit is where the   irs randomly chooses returns for statistical checks that taxpayers are complying with the regulations the taxpayer has to prove every line of the return you claim to be filing as married filing jointly bring in your marriage certificate   submit birth certificates and social security cards of your dependent children and so on   yes having turbotax represent you for only $ will help but not if you are not married and can not provide the irs with a marriage certificate etc so pay the fee for peace of mind if you like and as insurance as littleadv suggests   but be sure you understand what you might be getting for the   money   most tax returns selected for audit are selected for what the irs believes are good reasons not at random   if what you said if my tax return is randomly selected for audit they will represent me   is interpreted literally turbotax will represent you only if your return is selected for examination under the program not if it is selected for audit because the irs believes that something is fishy about your return   and as always you get what you pay for

when a house is sold at a foreclosure auction the selling bank usually does not provide the guarantees that a normal house seller provides   furthermore the previous owner may have neglected the property and/or damaged the property   bank owned properties are often neglected and/or   banks are usually too short sighted to properly market the real estate they own and do a poor job of making it easy to buy the property thus foreclosure sales usually happen at a price that is significantly below the fair market value of sales between competent households   it is common for a house that is worth $ 125,000 even in a depressed market to sell for only $ 100,000 in a short sale or foreclosure it is possible that this property sold for an even larger discount   it is also possible that the tax assessor is inadvertently comparing a run down property with well maintained properties that have extra expensive features without fully adjusting for the properties conditions and features   in the latter scenario the property owner can ask the tax assessor to re consider the assessment   usually this request is called an appeal

this very much depends how you use that second line of credit and what your current credit is there are of course many more combinations buy you can probably infer the impact based on these cases    your credit score is based on your likely hood of being profitable to a creditor should they issue you credit this is based on your history of your ability to manage your credit   having more credit and managing it well shows that you have a history of being responsible with greater sums of money available   if you use the card responsibly now then you are more likely to continue that trend than someone with a history of irresponsibility   having a line but not using it is not a good thing   it costs the creditor money for you to have an account   if you never use that account then you are not showing that you can use the account responsibly so if you are just going to throw the card in a safe and never access it then you are better off not getting the card in the first place

to answer your question directly   you can investigate by using google or other means to look up research done in this area   there 's been a bunch of it here 's an example of search terms that returns a wealth of information i 'd especially look for stuff that appears to be academic papers etc and then raid the references section of those   look for stuff published in industry journals such as journal of portfolio management as an example if you want to try out different models yourself and see what works and what does n't this monte carlo simulator might be something you would find useful the basic theory for those that do n't know is that various parts of a larger market do not usually move in perfect but go through cycles one year tech might be hot the next year it 's healthcare   or for an international portfolio one year korea might be doing fantastic only to slow down and have another country perform better the next year     so the idea of re balancing is that since these things tend to be cyclic you can get a higher return if you sell part of a slice that is doing well e.g. sell at the high and invest it in one that is not buy at the low because you do this based on some criteria it helps circumvent the human tendency to hold on to a winner too long how many times have you heard someone say but it 's doing so well why do i want to sell now presuming trends will continue and they will lose out on future gains only to miss the peak and ride the thing down back into mediocrity   depending on the volatility of the specific market and the various slices using re balancing can get you a pretty reasonable lift above the market average for relatively low risk generally the more volatile the market such as say an emerging markets portfolio the more opportunity for lift i looked into this myself a number of years back the i came was that the most effective method was to rebalance based on need rather than time   need is defined as one or more of the slices in your portfolio being more than 8 above or below the average   so you use that as the trigger how you rebalance depends to some degree on if the portfolio is taxable or not   if in a tax deferred account you can simply sell off whatever is above baseline and use it to buy up the stuff that is below    if you are subject to taxes and do n't want to trigger any short term gains then you may have to be more careful in terms of what you sell   alternatively if you are adding funds to the portfolio you can alter how your distribute the new money coming into the portfolio in order to bring up whatever is below the baseline which takes a bit more time but incurs no tax hit   the other question is how will you slice a given market   by company size   by sectors such as tech finance industrial healthcare by geographic regions

yes it is possible as long as the broker you use allows conditional orders i use cmc markets in australia and they allow free conditional orders either when initially placing a buy order or after already buying a stock see the place new order box below   once you have selected a stock to buy the number of shares you want to buy and at what price you can place up to 3 conditional orders the first condition is a place order if conditional order here you can place a condition that your buy order will only be placed onto the market if that condition is met first   say the stock last traded at $ and you only want to place your order the next day if the stock price moves above the current resistance at $ 10.00 so you would place order if price is at or above $ 10.00 so if the next day the price moves up to $ 10 or above your order will be placed onto the market the second condition is a stop loss conditional order here you place the price you want to sell at if the price drops to or past your stop loss price it will only be placed on to the market if your buy order gets traded so if you wanted to place your stop loss at $ 9.00 you would type in 9.00 in the box after if at or below and select if you want a limit or market order the third condition is a take profit conditional order this allows you to take profits if the stock reaches a certain price say you wanted to take profits at 50 that is if the price reached $ 15.00 so you would type in 15.00 in the box after if at or above and again select if you want a limit or market order these conditional orders can all be placed at the time you enter your buy order and can be edited or deleted at any time the broker you use may have a different process for entering conditional orders and some brokers may have many more conditional orders than these three so investigate what is out there and if you are confused in how to use the orders with your broker simply ask them for a demonstration in how to use them

the most important thing to remember about bitcoin is that it is an information technology as you ’re probably aware information tech advances very rapidly and renders the previous generations obsolete i too think bitcoin is in a bubble though it probably has a while to go blockchain tech will rapidly improve and become more ubiquitous meanwhile bitcoin offers nothing new and is plagued with issues the fact it accounts for 50%+ of all crypto value is mind boggling imagine one stock accounting for 50 of the entire stock market of the world when blockchain tech is mainstream that ’s essentially what bitcoin has to do to maintain its status seems very doubtful to me

i hate the usps   the vast majority of the mail i receive is worthless literally the only things i get that are worthwhile are magazines and things people send specifically to me   their pricing structure for services is bizarre and confusing and their employees are generally surly   i ship by other means whenever possible and i think it 's ridiculous to ask for more support to stop the gov't from pulling resources   that said it 's also unreasonable for the gov't to forbid the usps from closing branches   if you are n't going to give enough funding at least let them by cutting costs

i 'm not op but i think a very basic example would be brand choice every day people choose to buy cheaper products over greener products cups still exist because people buy them companies get as big as walmart because people shop there   if people really have a shit they could simply make different choices in a capitalistic system that would then promote small local business and sustainable practices but people choose lower prices every single time without regard to the inequalities or environmental destruction their choices promote

this effect has much empirical evidence as googling dividend price effect evidence will show as the financial economic schools of thought run the so do the theories   one school goes as far to call it a market inefficiency since the earning power thus the value of an equity that 's affected is no different or at least not riskier by the percentage of market capitalization paid most papers offer that by the efficient market hypothesis and arbitrage theory the value of an equity is known by the market at any point in time given by its price so if an equity pays a dividend the adjusted price would be efficient since the holder receives no excess of the price instantly before payment as after including the dividend since that dividend information was already discounted so would otherwise produce an arbitrage

in the eu prices on consumer focussed sites are quoted inclusive of vat in the usa prices are   quoted exclusive of sales tax consumer pricing is usually driven at least partly by psychological concerns some are more appealing to certain types of buyers than others   the euro vs dollar exchange rate has fluctuated a bit over the years but it 's generally averaged somewhere around 1.2 dollars per euro over the last decade vat has varied around in most cases put these things together and the same headline price points are generally appropriate in both the usa and the eurozone otoh the pound has been worth substantially more than the dollar or the euro so it makes sense to have a lower headline price in the uk b2b focussed sites often quote prices exclusive of vat you need to be aware of this when comparing prices

it may have some value   investopedia has a well written quick article on how stock holders may still get some portion of the liquidated assets   while there is generally little left for common shareholders if the price of those shares is tiny and some money does come back to shareholders there can still be significant profit to be made as to why the trading volume is so high there are many firms and hedge funds that specialize in calculating the value of and buying distressed debt and stock   they often compete with each other to by the stock debt that common shareholders are trying to get rid of   in this particular case there is a lot of popular interest intellectual property at stake and pending lawsuits that probably boosts volume

form w-9 officially the request for taxpayer identification number and certification is used in the united states income tax system by a third party who must file an information return with the internal revenue service irs it requests the name address and taxpayer identification information of a taxpayer in the form of a social security number or employer identification number a w-9 is typically required when an individual is doing work as a contractor or as an employee for a company and will be paid more than $ 600 in a tax year   the company is required to file a w-2 or a 1099 and so requests a w-9 to get the information necessary for those forms i can not say if it is incompetence on the part of the accounting department or a deliberate ploy to make the refund process more onerous but do not comply   politely on a refund without any further information   if the company refuses request a charge back from the credit card company file a complaint with the consumer protection department of the state where the company is located and write a bad review on yelp or wherever else seems appropriate

i am not trying to attribute the current economic climate and the decisions that stem from that with raising tax rates   i simply think that a higher tax rate for the wealthy will further slow the recovery i also think that the issue of tax rates is being used to divert the attention of the people from that which is actually killing us the national debt that is thanks to trillion dollar deficits the tax hikes are used to a fight between red and blue without getting to the crux of the matter    the reality is that at most the government might be able to raise taxes that would generate 200 or 300 billion dollars more in yearly revenue over the short term over the long term these taxes will drive capital off shore and into investments that shelter it from taxes at the same time that the debt continues to increase at over 1 trillion per year anyway   the debate should be this do we want to cut federal spending by 40 now or do we want to cause an economic and monetary collapse by continuing along with deficits that are 10 of gdp

as a rule one should have a retirement however you also have over a half a million dollars of debt   paying down debt is another way to prepare for retirement   i would say throwing your excess money at your debts is a fine strategy right now   especially the student loan the mortgage probably has a lower rate and brings tax savings so paying it off is less urgent if i were you i 'd probably put something into tax deferred retirement accounts because in your tax bracket the savings from doing so are significant the max you can put in tax deferred is $ 5,500 per year each in ira 's and up to $ 17,000 to your 401(k each   the tax saving contribution opportunities will not come up again you ca n't make up for it later any retirement saving beyond the tax advantaged part makes no sense while you have outstanding debt

many of the major indices    today because of this news why how    do the rising budget deficits and debt    relate to the stock markets it does seem strange that there is a correlation between government debt and the stock market   but i could see many reasons for the reaction   the downgrade by s&p may make it more expensive for the government to borrow money i.e. higher interest rates   this means it becomes more expensive for the government to borrow money and the government will probably need to raise taxes to cover the cost of borrowing   rising taxes are not good for business   also many banks in the us hold us government debt   rising yields will push down the value of their holdings which in turn will reduce the value of us debt on the businesses balance sheets   this weakens the banks balance sheets   they may even start to unload us bonds why is there such a large emphasis on    the s&p rating i do n't know   i think they have proven they are practically useless   that 's just my opinion   many though still think they are a credible ratings agency what happens when the debt ceiling is    reached theoretically the government has to stop borrowing money once the debt ceiling is reached   if this occurs and the government does not raise the debt ceiling then the government faces three choices

as some of the other answers pointed out company 401(k accounts can sometimes have poor investment choices so if the company is n't doing some sort of matching and you only have a limited set of options i would likely recommend that you roll the money over to a different 401(k account so you have better investment options why choice from tens of funds when you may have the full market worth of options as your disposal likewise if you have electronic deposit you might be able to have the 10 automatically deposited to that account out of your paycheck so you will still be getting the advantage of having forced savings from a young age in regards to a roth ira as others have pointed out they are a bit of a gamble and you ca n't ensure that you will come out ahead at the end of the day in regards to taxes however you also need to take your own career goals into account when you make that decision if you see yourself getting up there in the income bracket of the course of your career it does n't hurt to have a roth ira now and start putting some money in it limited amount though maybe only $ 100 a month but if you do n't see yourself getting up that high in the income brackets then it might not be worth the overhead of having multiple accounts to keep track of that said though make sure that you are n't just saving for retirement you should have another savings account that you are putting money away for rainy days houses and the like

absolutely terrible on many fronts firstly why are you giving away equity at all usually it 's to attract people you otherwise would n't be able to hire like extremely talented coders or business development managers but normal employees bad idea if you really want to give up equity then make sure it 's only realized valued once certain targets are met i.e. sales revenue share price investment etc as for the nomenclature they 're not co founders that 's typically reserved for the people that the company not just people who happened to be working for the company it started trading call them founding employee if you must but they 're certainly not founders why does this matter if the company ever takes or you get investment or you fire one of them or one just gets the idea to sue you their position name suddenly really matters and by not being careful they could win a substantial cut of your company in a lawsuit there 's even stories of employees up on their bosses and they end up owning the company i know someone that 's been involved in high 8 figure suit for 7 years for exactly the same reason so unless they 're putting in startup capital or they 're taking a serious hit on their salary in return for compensation in the form of equity do n't give anyone equity

here are the basic questions i usually ask any new business startup do these numbers answers seem reasonable to you and is some benchmark available that allows you to see how likely this is    remember particularly in internet based advertising ventures the client may be indirect   the person who clicks on a google context based link is not directly google 's client   the person who decided to host adwords code on their site is the direct client you 're also going to want to see a chart or some process chart indicating exactly what needs to be done at what cost and by whom   answers to these questions give a sense of not only how seriously they are taking the business but also how organised my final question who is your first client they need either someone who is going to contract the service or have a clear indication of where income is going to come from on their first day of trading their task is to sell their idea to you by proving that it will return on your investment and be profitable   from the strength of these answers you can gauge the value of your investment to them how critical it is how risky the opportunity and ultimately the stake and returns you should expect

you start taking on some big risks when go to absolute zero unlike your plane analogy you do n't have to fly or not fly you can opt to take a safer hybrid form of transit or to extend the analogy now you 're driving or walking instead of flying which per mile traveled is statistically more risky even if the plane feels and looks riskier   consider reading up a bit on the risks of all cash bonds including shortfall and inflation yes real estate is a hedge but most of your portfolio is still exposed to inflation why not also buy some treasury inflation protected securities via a bond fund why not put 25 in the stock market to help do well when the markets do well   i think if you do some reading on this you 'll find yourself shocked at the risks of being all cash fwiw i 'm a relatively conservative voice on investing subreddits the guy who is usually saying hey be sure to keep some so i 'm all about a safe balanced portfolio but tilt too far in either direction and you take on more risk not less   you mentioned a pension and real estate those are presumably good inflation hedges and relatively stable holdings the pension especially suggests you can take more stock risk since you have that stable bond like holding   the thing to me is that you would be all in during the good times if you 're this risk adverse when you see warning signs i 'm curious were you 100 stocks before totally on off like that seems kinda intense

gt;you bring up a very good point if he cares so much about his employees but it 's just too inconvenient for him to run the company if his taxes go up 5 why not sell it instead of putting 7000 people out of a job why threaten people when there 's an obvious alternative hell if he just wants to close it anyways he could just give the company away   it 's funny you think we 're talking about only 5 liabilities could go up 10 15 it 's not just taxes its insurance liabilities and other requirements what business experience do you have you obviously are n't considering all the angles here and it 's not about caring or not caring about his employees believe it or not i 'll bet he did n't start the company 40 + years ago to create jobs for his employees caring for employees only gets you so far he probably cares for them as much as he cares about his office or his properties but if one of his office became condemned and dealing with it became more stressful than profitable guess what he 'd blow it up and never look back   he explicitly states that he will downsize or close the company if there are any new taxes whatsoever on either him or the business it 's also worth noting that his company is currently more profitable than its ever been   but that comes down from somebody who has seen increased liabilities increased over the decades its all or nothing at this point and it would n't be a tiny increase in liabilities gross profit = /= net profit   gt;what   obama has used the argument you did n't build that to say you benefited from other people 's taxes to get where you are but guess what government existed just fine without increased taxes it 's only now that they want to maintain and will increase the level of spending they need more revenues and private participation in things like the healthcare plan   gt;yeah so maybe he should cut his bullshit rhetoric when those jobs are on the line and the only one responsible for their fates is him and if it 's really too much of a bother for him to run the company if he 's making slightly less money when he 's already said he has more money than he 'll ever need he can promote someone else to run the company or just sell it saying he cares about his employees makes him a liar criticizing people who spent beyond their means makes him a hypocrite and his empty threats and beating make him a bully   jobs are a byproduct of his goal and thus peripheral they are that way for every company unless it 's a very small company the employees are not more important than the business itself   you keep this as slightly less but its not its millions and millions    the point is it is his company and he can do whatever he wants you obviously have no actual decision making business experience because if you did and talked to these people you 'd realize they 're not all greedy yes some make quite a bit of profit but you 'd also be amazed at all of the liabilities government requirements and yes taxes they have to deal with   right or wrong it 's choice to decide what happens not yours not mine

the situation you 're proposing is an over simplification that would n't occur in practice orders occur in a sequence over time time is an important part of the order matching process orders are not processed in parallel otherwise the problem of fairness already heavily regulated would become even more complex first crossed and locked markets are forbidden by regulators   crossed orders are where one exchange has a higher bid than another 's ask or a lower ask than another 's bid   a locked market is where a bid on one exchange is equal to the ask on another   hfts would be able to make these markets because of the gap between exchange fees since these are forbidden and handling orders in parallel would ensure that a crossed or locked market would occur orders are up processed in order of price time priority so the first to cross the market will be filled with the best oldest opposing order regulators believe crossed or locked markets are unfair   they would however eliminate the bid ask spread for many large securities thus the bid ask cost to the holder

as cars age the amount of tends to decrease   you have already lost between 19 and 17 k on the car in the past 3.5 years   you ca n't lose that much on that car ever again   first because it is not worth that much   second because even if the engine blows up or it is totaled you can always get about $ 300-$400 for it if you trade this car for a newer model the same exact scenario is likely to happen again   in three years or so the car will lose half its value   if you happen to stick the same price point and are comfortable with $ going out the window then it might be time to trade up you can get a decent idea of what your car will be worth in the 2.5 years by seeing what a 2006 with 116 k miles on it   one option is to keep driving it after it is paid off   with putting a little money into it and having it detailed every once in a while it can feel like a pretty sweet ride for many years and miles to come   even if you have maintenance costs you wo n't have a car payment   how sweet would that be

there is plenty of over in the majority of these answers when the simple answer is that it is simply down to statistics say an insurer had two pieces of information about two separate drivers annual mileage and whether they had had an accident in the last 3 years driver a drives 10,000 miles a year and has n't had an accident in the past 3 years driver b drives 500 miles a year and has n't had an accident in the past 3 years which would the insurer think was the safer bet the answer is a and this makes his premiums lower the reason for this is that the insurer has a lot more data about driver a than driver b they know that driver a has driven 30,000 miles without having an accident this could of course be luck or a fluke but it is likely that driver a is actually a safe driver the chance that driver a has n't had an accident just through sheer luck and that they are actually a terrible driver is quite slim on the other hand driver b has only driven 1,500 miles in the past three years whilst this seems like prima evidence of them being as safe a driver as driver a it is much more likely that driver b could have driven 1,500 miles and avoided an accident through sheer luck even though they are a terrible driver   this means drivers who drive low amounts of mileage will be penalised relative to other drivers who have high mileage it has nothing to do with insurers taking a judgement that doing more mileage makes you more experienced or makes you a better driver as others have suggested here although it is probably true it 's not quantifiable from an insurer 's perspective

this solution obviously would n't work for everyone and is contingent on the circumstances of your parents finances with regards to their house but   have you considered buying your parents house   this way your parents desire for you to get a house as an investment would be satisfied they would n't have to worry about losing their home and you might even be able to work out a financing rent deal that is beneficial to everyone involved   there are definitely fewer costs going this route anyway for instance your parents wo n't have any marketing costs associated with selling the house and could pass this savings along to you   also having lived in the house for a large part of your life you will also know what you are getting in to

you could buy shares of an exchange traded fund etf based on the price of gold like gld iau or you can invest in this fund through almost any brokerage firm e.g. fidelity etrade td ameritrade charles schwab sharebuilder etc keep in mind that you 'll still have to pay a commission and fees when purchasing an etf but it will almost certainly be less than paying the markup or storage fees of buying the physical commodity directly an etf trades exactly like a stock on an exchange with a ticker symbol as noted above the commission will apply the same as any stock trade and the price will reflect some fraction of an ounce of gold for the gld it started as .1 oz but fees have been applied over the years so it 's a bit less   you could also invest in which is a closed end mutual fund that allows investors to trade their shares for gold bars however because the fund is closed end it may trade at a significant premium or discount compared to the actual price of gold for supply and demand reasons also keep in mind that investing in gold will never be the same as depositing your money in the bank in the united states money stored in a bank is fdic insured up to $ 250,000 and there are several banks or financial institutions that deposit money in multiple banks to double or triple the effective insurance limit fidelity has an account like this for example if you invest in gold and the price plunges you 're left with the fair market value of that gold not your original deposit   yes you 're hoping the price of your gold investment will increase to at least match inflation but you 're hoping i.e. speculating which is n't the same as depositing your money in an insured bank account if you want to speculate and invest in something with the hope of outpacing inflation you 're likely better off investing in a low cost index fund of inflation protected securities or the s&p500 over the long term rather than gold   just to be clear i 'm using the laymen 's definition of a speculator which is someone who engages in risky financial transactions in an attempt to profit from short or medium term fluctuations this is similar to the definition used in some markets e.g. futures but in many cases economists and places like the cftc define speculators as anyone who does n't have a position in the underlying security for example a farmer selling corn futures is a while the trading firm purchasing the contracts is a speculator the trading firm does n't necessarily have to be actively trading the contract in the short run they merely have no position in the underlying commodity

this is where an insurance agent is very useful they will help you choose appropriate coverage based on local rebuilding costs the build quality of your house higher quality or historic semi historic construction requires a different type of coverage etc they can also help advise you on things like the need for flood insurance etc local rules can vary and the local agent will know about them for example we found out that my home was in a semi historic district which requires using higher cost materials for also our city separately licenses who tend to be unionized and thus more expensive had i just picked default coverages i would have been in a pickle in the event of a loss

what you are referring to is called an externality in economics efforts are often made by governments to internalize costs to groups and individuals that do n't experience consequences of their actions    but from another perspective forces such as scientific advancement bring new methods of eliminating such consequences much like the wall e concept per the movie of the same name technology reorganizing or converting what was previously waste    this is another aspect of the free market but it has what some economists call or delay from problem to solution as scientific advances are often done via fiscal motives urged on by the marketplace and public demand

americans are snapping like crazy and not only americans i know a lot of people from out of country are snapping as well similarly to your australian friend the market is crazy hot i 'm not familiar with cleveland but i am familiar with phoenix the prices are up at least 20 30 from what they were a couple of years ago and the trend is not changing however these are not something everyone can buy it is very hard to get these properties financed i found it impossible as mentioned i bought in phoenix that means you have to pay cash not everyone has tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash available for a real estate investment for many americans 30 60 k needed to buy a property in these markets is an amount they can not afford to invest even if they have it at hand also keep in mind that investing in rental property requires being able to support it pay taxes and expenses even if it is not rented pay to property managers utility bills gardeners and plumbers insurance and property taxes all these can amount to quite a lot so its not just the initial investment many times advertised rents are not the actual rents paid if he indeed has it rented at $ 900 then its good but if he was told hey buy it and you 'll be able to rent it out at $ 900 would n't count on that i know many foreigners who fell in these traps do your market research and see what the costs are at these neighborhoods keep in mind that these are distressed neighborhoods with a lot of foreclosed houses and a lot of unemployment it is likely that there are houses empty as people are moving out being out of job it may be tough to find a renter and the renters you find may not be able to pay the rent but all that said yes those who can are snapping

the other answers are good i would just like to add certain points taking this question together with the previous ones you have asked here how can a person measure how much to spend on food car bills or rent    from his salary is there a formula to keep in check basically it may well be that your best option would be to move to a smaller apartment or worse location to bring down rent possibly forget about your own study in the worst case sell the car and use public transportation eat as many meals as possible at home bring boxed lunch from home to work if this applies etc whatever makes a saving and sense to you regarding food this is the point where it is usually possible to save a very significant amount if you are prepared to make food at home unless you are already doing it look around for articles such as living on 20 pounds a week or so maybe they will give you ideas you can use eg how to eat on 10 pounds a week shopping list and recipes where you are shopping is crucial here as similar items can differ in price significantly between different chains if the electricity bill is significant and you are at home a lot you could try to bring it down by changing all bulbs in your home to led ones unless it has already been done yes they can cost 2 3 more than eg ones but they use 5 10x less electricity forget credit cards if possible use debit cards so you know the money you spend does not get you into more debt one question you asked here was about exchange rates if you work with different currencies a lot there are several companies such as revolut or which offer accounts with debit cards that use near fx rates in my i could save around 10 15 on currency conversion eur gbp using revolut compared to my local bank rate for example i find myself looking at my account every single day and get    and sad because almost whenever the money pay comes in i freak out    that after everything there is nothing for us to enjoy or save well yes that is nearly the definition of too much debt the point about going to the extremes of reducing expenses i outlined above is that the more you can reduce your expenses while struggling with debt the faster you 'll get out of it it might be hard to adapt but it will be better if you can calculate how long it will take to get you back on feet and know that eg in 6 months i can start to think of savings and carefully upgrading my lifestyle back   in turn the smaller the reduction of expenses the more prolonged the process you might be looking at 2 3 years of insecure constantly frustrating risking more debt lifestyle instead of 6 months of severely reduced one alternatively if things go too bleak you might consider declaring bankrupcy although i am not sure how feasible it is in the uk

you ca n't get there from here   this is n't the right data   consider the following five year history   2 16 32 14 1   that would give a 13 average annual return   now compare to 26 15 2 16   that would give a 4 average annual return    notice anything about those numbers   two of them are in both series   this is n't an accident   the first set of five numbers are actual stock market returns from the last five years while the latter five start three years earlier   the critical thing is that five years of returns are n't enough   you 'd need to know not just how you can handle a bull market but how you do in a bear market as well   because there will be bear markets    also consider whether average annual returns are what you want   consider what actually happens in the second set of numbers    but if you had had a steady 4 return you would have had a total return of 21 not the 8 that would have really happened   the point being that calculating from averages gives misleading results   this gets even worse if you remove money from your principal for living expenses every year    the usual way to compensate for that is to do a 70 bond mix or with five years of expenses in cash equivalent savings   with cash equivalents you wo n't even keep up with inflation   the stock bond mix might give you a 7 return after inflation   so the five years of expenses are more and more problematic as your nest egg shrinks   it 's better to live off the interest if you can   you do n't know how long you 'll live or how the market will do    from there it 's just about how much risk you want to take   a current nest egg of twenty times expenses might be enough but thirty times would be better   since the 1970s the stock market has n't had a long bad patch relative to inflation   maybe you could through with ten   but if the are like the 1970s you 'd be in trouble

you were n't really clear about where you are in the world what currency you are using and what you want your eventual asset allocation to be if you 're in the us i 'd recommend splitting your international investment between a global ex us fund like veu as chris suggested in his comment and an emerging markets etf like   if you 're not in the us you need to think about how much you would like to invest in us equities and what approach you would like to take to do so also with international funds particularly emerging markets low expense ratios are n't necessarily the best value active management may help you to avoid some of the risks associated with investing in foreign companies particularly in emerging markets if you still want low expenses at all cost understand the underlying index that the etf is pegged to

great question there are two ways to increase the amount of money you have it 's difficult to decrease your expenses past a certain point and your question is focused on the first aspect anyway but it 's worth noting that controlling spending is a significant part of accumulating wealth you need to make more money and there 's no trick to it ask for a raise sure that ca n't hurt but also think about what you need to do to get a higher paying job there 's a lot to think about does you current job have growth potential are you doing everything you can do to maximize that potential if you 're just it in and collecting your paycheck that 's not going to make you much more money but if you 're working hard learning new skills and have an opportunity to grow into more responsibilities and more money that 's a good start in my experience the biggest paycheck increases have come from looking for new opportunities and switching jobs btw i 'm not suggesting quitting your job you need to always have the new job locked up before quitting the old job the wealthiest people i know are self employed and they worked hard to build up their companies do you work in an industry where you can build your skills to a point where you can go out on your own does entrepreneurship interest you either way focus on your job skills and maximizing your income potential be your own advocate make sure your boss knows what a good job you 're doing if you need to start looking for other options take your time and start looking the often quoted line the harder i work the luckier i get is appropriate

i think so   i am doing this with our furniture   it does n't cost me any more money to pay right now than it will to pay over the course of 3 years and i can earn interest on the money i did n't spend but know this they are n't offering 0 they are deferring interest for 3 years   if you pay it off before then great if you do n't you will owe all the accumulated interest the key with these is that you always pay it and on time   miss a payment and you get hosed   if you do n't pay on time you will owe the interest that is being deferred   they will also be financing this through a third party like a major bank and that company is now doing business with you which means in the us they can call you and solicit new services   i am willing to deal with those trade offs though plus as you say you can always pay it off why they do it what is in it for them a friend of mine works for a major bank that often finances these deals here is how they work basically banks do this to generate leads for their divisions that do cold calls   if you are a high credit high income customer you go to a classic bank and request cash if you are building credit or have bad credit you go to a financial services branch   if you tend to finance things like cars and furniture you get more cold calls

this bbc article says that nuclear power notes came about when the french energy company edf purchased british energy in 2008 the note changes in value with wholesale energy prices and power output levels from british energy 's existing nuclear stations edf energy 's website describes these notes under the section titled nuclear power notes when edf acquired british energy in january 2009 nuclear power notes were issued to british energy shareholders who chose to take them in lieu of 74 pence of cash per british energy share held the nuclear power notes are ten year financial instruments 2009 2019 which give ex british energy shareholders a continuing interest in the edf energy nuclear generation fleet they are traded on the securities derivatives exchange formerly known as the plus quoted exchange    each year a pre defined calculation is performed to determine whether any cash will be paid to nuclear power note holders the calculation is dependent on the nuclear output of the edf energy nuclear generation fleet eligible nuclear output and market power prices power prices this calculation may or may not result in a cash payment each year to nuclear power note holders the are figures you see are measures of watt hours i.e. energy output the value of nuclear power notes is tied to this output looking at the most recent statement june 2013 you can see a line that looks like this month ahead price in respect of july 2013 gbp which is an energy spot price for the output of the nuclear plants i 'm not entirely sure of the relationship between this and the payment to shareholders but if you look at the 2012 yearly payment calculation notice on the same page you 'll see this in the first section a the yearly payment for the period 1 january 2012 to 31 december 2012 the    relevant year payable in respect of each on 31 january 2013 shall be zero the payments were also zero for 2010 and 2011 the 2009 calculation notice however states that a the yearly payment for the period 1 january 2009 to 31 december 2009 the relevant year payable in respect of each on 31 january 2010 shall be pence stated to 6 decimal places i presume that payment would have appeared in whatever account holds these notes e.g. your brokerage account technically the financial statements above refer to a contingent value rights instrument which is a derivative linked to the nuclear power notes this site sums it up better than i can the british energy were created by the issue of nuclear power notes to the target ’s shareholders who opted to take up this alternative the were issued by barclays bank plc and were linked to guaranteed contingent value rights instruments that were issued to barclays by edf ’s acquisition vehicle lake acquisitions and which were ultimately guaranteed by edf energy plc lake barclays is required to make yearly payments to for 10 years the amount of which is limited to the corresponding amount paid by lake acquisitions to barclays for the lake basically there is a chain of payments through these derivatives that eventually links back to nuclear energy output

if you mean if i invest say $ 1000 in a stock that is growing at 5 per year versus investing $ 1000 in an account that pays compound interest of 5 per year how does the amount i have after 5 years compare then the answer is they would be exactly the same   as kent anderson says compound interest simply means that as you accumulate interest that for the next interest cycle the amount that they pay interest on is based on the previous cycle balance plus the interest for example suppose you invest $ 1000 at 5 interest compounded annually after one year you get 5 of $ 1000 or $ 50 you now have $ 1050 at the end of the second year you get 5 of $ 1050 not 5 of the original $ 1000 or $ so you now have $ etc stocks tend to grow in the same way but here 's the big difference if you get an interest bearing account the bank or investment company guarantees the interest rate unless they go bankrupt you will get that percentage interest but there is absolutely no guarantee when you buy stock it may go up 5 this year up 4 next year and down 3 the year after the company makes no promises about how much growth the stock will show it may show a loss it all depends on how well the company does

some of the other answers recommended peer to peer lending and property markets i would not invest in either of these firstly peer to peer lending is not a traditional investment and we may not have enough historical data for the risk to return ratio secondly property investments have a great risk unless you diversify which requires a huge portfolio crowd funding for one property is not a traditional investment and may have drawbacks for example what if you disagree with other crowd about the required repairs for the property if you invest in the property market i recommend a well diversified fund that owns many properties beware of high debt leverage used to enhance returns and at the same time risk and high fees when selecting a fund however traditionally it has been a better choice to invest in stocks than to invest in property market beware of anyone who says that the property market is too good to not get into without specifying which part of the world is meant note also that many companies invest in properties so if you invest only in a well diversified stock index fund you may already have property investments in your portfolio however in your case i would keep the money in risk free assets i.e. bank savings or a genuine low cost money market fund i.e. one that does n't invest in corporate debt or in variable rate loans which have short duration but long maturity the reason is that you 're going to be unemployed soon and thus you may need the money soon if you have an investment horizon of say 10 years then i would throw stocks into the mix and if you 're saving for retirement then i would go all in to stocks in the part of the world where i live in money market funds generally have better return than bank savings and better diversification too however your 2.8 interest sounds rather high the money market fund i have in the past invested in currently yields at 0.02 but then again i live in the eurozone so be sure to get estimates for the yields of different risk free assets so my advice for investing is simple risk free assets for short time horizon a mixture of stocks and risk free assets for medium time horizon and only stocks for long time horizon in any case you need a small emergency fund too which you should consider a thing separate from your investments my emergency fund is 20 000 eur your 50 000 aud is bit more than 30 000 eur so you do n't really have that much money to invest only a bit more than a reasonably sized emergency fund but then again i live in rental property so my expenses are probably higher than yours if you can foresee a very long time horizon for part of your investment you could perhaps invest 50 of your money to stocks preference being a geographically diversified index fund or a number of index funds but i would n't invest more because of the need for an emergency fund

one of the often cited advantages of etfs is that they have a higher    liquidity and that they can be traded at any time during the trading    hours on the other hand they are often proposed as a simple way to    invest private funds for people that do not want to always keep an eye    on the market hence the intraday trading is mostly irrelevant for    them i am pretty sure that this is a subjective idea the fact is you may buy goog aapl f or whatever you as well such as qqq spy etc and keep them for a long time in both cases if you do not want to keep an on the market it is ok because if you keep them it is called idea is collecting dividends etc if you are day trading then is it called speculation because you main goal is to earn by buying and selling of course you may loose as well so you do not care about dividends or owning some percent of the company as etfs are derived instruments their volatility depends on the volatility of the related shares i 'm wondering whether there are secondary effects that make the    liquidity argument interesting for private investors despite not    using it themselves what would these effects be and how do they    impact when compared for example to mutual funds to turn cash could create high volatility which means high risk and high reward from this point of view mutual funds are more safe because money managers know how to diversify the total portfolio and manage income under any market conditions

the 20x number is drawn directly from the assumption that it should be easy to get more than 4 average return on investment after lots of historical studies   monte carlo simulations and the like there was a consensus that saving more did n't significantly increase the odds of achieving at least the desired yearly income sustainably that 's the same calculations the insurance firms use as the starting point for writing annuities there are also some assumptions about inflation and its interaction with the market built into this rule of thumb note that this is 20x what you want as post retirement income not necessarily 20x your current income i have a moderately frugal lifestyle and my budget confirms that my actual spending even in years when i allow myself a splurge is well below my current income with the excess going into the investments to sustain my lifestyle i need that lower number plus any taxes that 'll be due on it plus whatever i want to allocate as average emergency reserve and theoretically i should be able to base the 20x on that lower number when i run estimates quicken has a tool for this so does my credit union i   presume others are widely available they tend to confirm this i 'm still using the higher number for planning though i do n't feel any need to retire early though i have issues with my current manager and i have no objection at all to being able to afford better toys on occasion or to leaving a legacy to friends relatives and/or charity but it 's nice to know exactly when i could the day job if i wanted to

there are other answers here about how much you can deduct for a home office what seems unique is the question of whether you can deduct it for both your llc and for your employment unless your llc owns the home you can not deduct the depreciation directly instead you have to charge your llc rent for the time that you are using the space for the llc that rent must be declared as income on your personal tax return and you can then offset some of it with the time you spend in that space working for your employer and depreciation for time it is being rented to your llc using a strategy this complex may save you a few bucks on your return but this is definitely an area where a tax professional is worth the expense making sure you get it right

this question is largely opinion based but i wanted to balance out the people jumping on you there are lots of factors that go into salary pay such as what you contribute to the company and you go above or beyond what s expected of you i would say seniority is one factor or at least there is a case to be made that it is important if someone has worked 5 years for me that is five years that i have not had to search interview and train a replacement i am not a business owner but i do employ people and when someone quits its an extremely stressful process not having to go through that again in my opinion is worth a small bump in pay i ca nt comment on if its fair or not that is opinion what is fact is that whenever a broad group of people are given a pay raise for arbitrary reasons and other employees are nt its creates it hurts morale employees leave and in severe cases the business becomes crippled so i m not sure if its fair but is it a bad idea generally see here and i highly recommend going here for anyone who thinks dramatically raising pay because its the right thing to do is a good idea

one easy way to monitor costs in quickbooks is to establish sub bank accounts    for example you may have an asset account called state bank numbered asset cash and cash equivalents bank convert this to a parent account for a middle school by making subaccounts such as at budget formation transfer $ 800 from operations to family fun committee   then write all checks for family fun from the family fun subaccount    for fundraising transfer $ 0 at budget formation to the x grade accounts   do deposit all grade level receipts into the appropriate grade level subaccounts and write all checks for the grades from the grade level subaccounts    the downside to the above is that reconciling the check book each month is slightly more complicated because you will be reconciling one monthly paper bank statement to multiple virtual subaccounts also you must remember to never write a check from the parent state bank and instead write the checks from the appropriate subaccounts

the core idea behind this statement is that there is always money for what you prioritize if you try to use whatever is left over after your bills for savings you probably wo n't save very much if anything in practice you decide on a fixed amount of money you will save out of each paycheck and put that aside in an investment or savings account then pay your bills out of what is left   essentially it is a way to counteract the tendency of your lifestyle rising to exactly meet your income and leaving nothing for savings

yes it is but first let me address this sentence my current withholding on my w4 is already at 0 so i ca n't make it    lower you definitely can make it lower on w4 in addition to the allowances that what you meant by already at 0 there 's also a line called additional withholding there you put the dollar amount that you want your payroll to withhold from your paycheck each pay period so the easiest way to send a one time payment to the irs if you 're a w2 employee would be to adjust that line with the amount you want to send and change it back to 0 next pay period you can also send a check directly to the irs follow the instructions to form 1040-es that is exactly what that form is designed to be used for

hey i was thinking back to that x ray you got done at the hospital that you said was cheaper than 90 of the population i am wondering if maybe that hospital was n't one of the many that qualify for reimbursement payments what could have happened is that they saw that you are uninsured and made a decision that they would only charge you for the portion that they did n't think medicare medicaid would reimburse if that happened it would n't even show up on your credit report as the hospital is the one that would file a credit claim likely if they have to go through this a lot they would n't even waste time filing a credit claim they would just go after a reimbursement through medicare medicaid and thus to you it would just look like a very small bill but in reality it would only represent a smaller portion of the true bill    i would also wonder if they do a lot of these if they are n't also one of the hospitals that article i linked to showed was super inflating the prices of uninsured in the hopes of getting a larger portion reimbursed

back testing itself is flawed past performance is no guarantee of future results is an important lesson to understand market strategies of one kind or another work until they do n't   edited in provides a tool that 's halfway to what you are looking for it only goes back to 1972 however just to try it i compared 100 s&p to a 60/40 blend of s&p with 5 yr t bills a asset 5 yr treasuries are notes not bills i found the mix actually had a better return with lower volatility   now can i count on that to work moving forward rates fell during most of this entire period so bonds notes both looked pretty good this is my point regarding the backtest concept   appears more sophisticated but command line work on pcs is beyond me it may be worth a look for you jp etf replay appears to be another backtest tool it has its drawbacks however etfs only

and please tell me what is my agenda by alluding banks are ponzi schemes i never made that claim   i just saw a similarity i was asking if the similar idea of taking money from investors and returning it just like a ponzi scheme but the similarity ends there apparently in the background one is using future investors as payouts the other uses fractional reserve banking to reinvest   to me it seems like the latter just seems smart but idk   that was my agenda finding out if my latter idea was possible and/or why its not a ponzi e and how does it differ   i think i got the answer w the accounting equation but getting to that point was like trial by fire apparently

this is way too long for a comment so i am posting this as an answer my bet is that you 're buying a new piano it is the only instrument that makes sense the rest of this answer are going to assume this but this should apply well if you 're going after a or for example for those readers that do not know a piano is a very delicate and expensive music instrument my piano is literally more expensive than my car there are a lot of similarities in sales negotiation between buying a piano and buying a car you may be surprised to know that the cost for the dealer to acquire a piano is only around half the listed price therefore the salesperson has a lot of room to negotiate a sale price to you this explains why he was able to make a good offer for the model you are not intending to buy you are best by comparing the final sale price with other similar models in your region or the exact model around your region which you have already did those indicate the standard price in your negotiation you described the dealer had the exact model you desire only in different appearance i assume you want a black color while they have a white or wood pattern one in their showroom note every piano is different even with the exact same model there will be very slight differences in the tune and touch since some processes are hand finished if you 're buying a treat each of them as an individual hand crafted art play the exact instrument you will be buying before closing the deal if they do not have your desired model in the showroom ask for a visit to their inventory facility again play the exact instrument not a showroom model some dishonest dealers will have their showroom regulated and tuned differently than the standard from shipping if you get an extremely good offer proceed with caution there may be defects in that particular instrument look for rust or layers on the strings look for in the hammers listen to clicking when playing the keys these are signs that the instrument has been around for quite a while and they can not sell it you can also copy down the serial number and look up the manufacturing date online before you close the deal ask for after sale services how many free will they provide will they polish your piano after delivery these are bargain chips you can use for final adjustment of the price

it 's going to be quite a challenge to give a definitive answer to any why question about law and especially so for a question about tax law one would need to try to dig up statements made by the legislators and/or their and debating the law as it is tax law is already inconsistent in many ways why are there people who ca n't contribute to a roth ira directly but can contribute to a traditional and then immediately convert it to roth why are maximum limits for 401(k plans and iras separate rather than being one combined retirement savings maximum in the absence of some specific legislative statements saying that it was set up this way for some specific purpose one must assume that it was written with the some goals as all tax law as a compromise between various ideas trying to accomplish some specific purpose feel free to add in some level of inefficiency and it being hard to completely understand the entirely of the tax law which leads to things perhaps not being as tidy as one might hope for but there 's no reason to think that the people the tax advantages for hsa plans had any reason to use 401(k plans as a template or wanted them to accomplish the same goals

i do nt think the author really understands why or how credit bureaus work why they exist and therefore where the blame exists for incorrect data no credit bureau wants incorrect data for obvious reasons but it happens that 's one reason why they let you get access to your credit score to check it the data is correct and make the product data about you better the source of the data is always to blame for something being incorrect though   that 's banks utilities companies etc   a credit bureau ca n't check any more than they do already but they can improve how they deal with mistakes or badly matched data not sure about how that works in the us but here in eu there are strict rules about how mistakes are corrected and how long it takes   as for storing it in block chain that would n't really solve ops problem with credit bureaus someone still needs to collect and match data and that 's arguably harder than securing the data in the first place

take some of the commentary on home buying forums with a grain of salt i too have read some of the commentary on these forums such as myfico or zillow and rarely is the right advice given or proper followup done typical 401k withdrawals for home purchase would not be considered a hardship however most employer 401k plans will allow you to take a loan for 401k as long as you provide suitable documentation statement real estate contract good faith estimate or some other form of suitable documentation as described by the plan administrator   for instance i just took a 401k loan to pay for closing costs and i had to provide only the real estate contract could i not follow through with the contract sure but what if i am found out for fraud then the plan administrator would probably end up turning the distribution into a taxable distribution i would n't go to jail in this hypothetical situation i am only stealing from myself but the law states that certain loan situations are not liable for tax as long as that situation still exists in the home loan situation my employer allows for a low interest 10 year loan my employer also allows for a pre approved loan for any purpose this would be a low interest 5 year loan   there is also the option to not do a loan at all but normally that is only allowed after you have exhausted all your loan options and the government makes it intentionally harsh 30 penalty at least to discourage people from dumping their tax free haven 401k accounts that all being said many plans offer no prepayment penalty so like my employer has for us i can pay it all back in full whenever i want or make micropayments every month otherwise it comes out of my pay stub biweekly so if it were to fall through i could just put it all back like it never happened though with my plan there is a cooling off period of 7 days before i can take another loan keep in mind that if you leave your employer then the full amount becomes a taxable distribution unless you pay it back within a certain period of time after leaving the employer   whether this fits your financial situation is up to you but a loan is definitely preferred over a partial or full withdrawal since you are paying yourself back for your rightly earned retirement which is just as important

the chinese corporate sector does n't really have a crazy amount of debt compared to developed countries and households even less what people are concerned about is how quickly it is rising not the actual amount and also the structure of the debt and how much of it is n't captured and reported   but to answer your question the two factors you mention are positively correlated not negatively as you postulate the more assets you have the higher the odds you are able to repay and the more debt lenders are willing to give you but debt tends to be measured relative to income not wealth and this is another reason chinese household wealth may be overstated

first a quick terminology correction i believe you 're proposing selling 10,000 shares of the stock of a company not 10,000 stocks when you sell you need to decide whether you 're selling for a specific minimum price or just selling for whatever price you can get if you set a specific lower limit on asking price then if people are n't interested at that price it does n't sell which may mean you sell only a few shares or none if your asking price is n't considered reasonable if you want to sell independent of price then as you begin to flood the market with your shares the price you get per additional share may decline until it finds a buyer what that lower limit is will depend on what people think the stock is currently worth this is one of the many complications i do n't want to deal with which is why i stick with index funds

what do you think is a reasonable rate of return a reasonable rate really breaks down into three things opportunity cost what you need and risk appetite opportunity cost comes into play because whatever returns you make should at least exceed after expenses the next best option   typically the next best option is the risk free return you can get somewhere else which is typically a savings account or some other safe investment vehicle e.g. a guaranteed investment certificate gic bonds etc   but this opportunity cost could also be an alternative investment e.g. an index etf which is not necessarily risk free but it may represent the next best option risk appetite comes down to the amount of risk you are willing to take on any investment and is completely subjective   this is typically how much can you sleep with losing amount what you need is the most subjective element   all things being equal e.g. identical risk profiles access to same next best thing to invest in if your cost of living expenses are only expected to go up 2 per year but mine are expected to go up 3 per year then my reasonable rate of return must exceed 3 but yours must only exceed 2 that said an appropriate return is whatever works for you period   nobody can tell you otherwise for your own investing what you can do is measure yourself against a benchmark   e.g. if your benchmark is the s&p 500 then the s&p 500 spdr etf is your opportunity cost e.g. what you would have made if you did n't do your own investing    in that way you are guaranteed the market return caveat the market return is not guaranteed to be positive as an aside do n't ever ever ever let someone else handle your money unless you want somebody else have your money there is nothing wrong with letting someone else handle your money provided you can live with the triple constraint above   investing takes time and effort and time and effort equals opportunity   if you can do something better with the time and effort you would spend to do your own investing then by all means do it   think about it if you have to spend 1 day a month managing your own investments but that day costs you $ 100 in foregone income e.g. you are a sole proprietor so every day is a working day that is $ 1,200 per year   but if you can find an investment advisor who will manage your books for you and costs you only $ 500 per year what is the better investment   if you do it yourself you are losing $ 1,200   if you pay someone you are losing $ 500   clearly it is cheaper to outsource despite what everyone says not everyone can be an investor   not everyone wants to live with the psychological emotional and mental effort of looking up stocks buying them and then second guessing themselves they are more than happy to pay someone to do that which also lets them point the finger at that person later if things go sideways

this directly relates to the ideas behind the yield curve for a detailed explanation of the yield curve see the linked answer that joe and i wrote in short the yield curve is a plot of the yield on treasury securities against their maturities if short term treasuries are paying higher yields than long term debt the yield curve has a negative slope there are a lot of factors that could cause the yield curve to become negatively sloped or at least less steep but in this case oil prices and the effective federal funds rate may have played a significant role i 'll quote from the section of the linked answer that describes the effect of oil prices first a rise in oil prices may increase expectations of short term inflation so investors demand higher interest rates on short term debt because long term inflation expectations are governed more by fundamental macroeconomic factors than short term swings in commodity prices long term expectations may not rise nearly as much as short term expectations which leads to a yield curve that is becoming less steep or even negatively sloped as the graph shows oil prices increased dramatically so this increase may have increased expectations of short term inflation expectations substantially   the other answer describes an easing of monetary policy e.g. a decrease in the effective federal funds rate ffr as a factor that could increase the slope of the yield curve however a tightening of monetary policy e.g. an increase in the ffr could decrease the slope of the yield curve because a higher ffr leads investors to demand a higher rate of return on shorter term securities longer term treasuries are n't as affected by short term monetary policy so when short term yields increase more than long term yields the yield curve becomes less steep and/or negatively sloped the second graph shows the effective federal funds rate for the period in question and once again the increase is significant   finally look at a graph of inflation for the relevant period   intuitively the steady increase in inflation from 1975 onward may have increased investors expectations of short term inflation therefore increasing short term yields more than long term yields as described above and in the other answer these reasons are n't set in stone and just looking at graphs is n't a substitute for an actual analysis of the data but logically it seems plausible that the positive shock to oil prices increases in the effective federal funds rate and increases in inflation and expectations of inflation contributed at least partially to the inversion of the yield curve keep in mind that these factors are all interconnected as well so the situation is certainly more complex if you approve of this answer be sure to vote up the other answer about the yield curve too

your first and second paragraphs are two different cases moving money between a checking account and a savings account will credit cash and debit cash making a gl transaction unnecessary unless the amounts in the two bank accounts are tracked as two separate gl accounts you might have account cash checking and account cash savings in that case a movement of money between these two accounts should be tracked by a transaction between the gl accounts credit checking debit savings it wo n't affect your balance sheet but depending on your definition of liquidity of assets   it might affect working capital on your statement of cash flows if you consider the savings account illiquid then money moved to it is a decrease in working capital basically what you are creating with your store credit accounts for each client is an unearned revenue account when clients pay you cash for work you have n't done yet or you refund money for a return as store credit instead of cash the credit is a liability account balancing an increase in cash inventory or an expense if you 're giving credit for free perhaps due to a mistake on your part you would debit a store credit expense account this can be split out client by client in the gl if you wish avoiding the need for a holding account the way you want to do it you 'd have a client holding account it must be unique in the gl and to the client and yes it is a liability account to transfer to holding you simply debit unearned revenue and credit client holding logging the transaction as transfer of client store credit or similar moving liability to liability balance sheet does n't change then as you sell goods or services to the client you debit accounts receivable and credit revenue then to record the payment you credit ar and debit client holding up to its current credit balance after which the client pays you cash and you debit that or the client still owes you to zero out a remaining balance on the holding account debit client holding and credit unearned revenue i do n't think the holding account the way you want to use it is a good idea if you want to track each customer 's store credit balance with a gl account then create specialized unearned revenue accounts for each client who gets a store credit named for the client and containing their balance zero or otherwise if you do n't care about it at the gl level then pool it in one unearned revenue account have one store credit account if you must and track individual amounts off the books

if it was me i would drop out you can achieve a better kind of plan when there is no match   for example fidelity has no fee accounts for iras and roths with thousands of investment choices   you can also setup automatic drafts so it what happens with your 401k.   not an employee of fidelity just a happy customer some companies pass the 401 k fees onto their employees and all have limited investment choices the only caveat is income   there are limits to the deductibility of iras and roth contributions if you make too much money   for roth 's the income is quite high so most people can still make those contributions   about 90 of households earn less than $ 184 k when roths start phasing out now about this 401 k company it looks like the labor department has jurisdiction over these kinds of plans and i would research on how to make a complaint   it would help if you and other employees have proof of the shenanigans   you might also consult a labor this might make a great class

the partition is more or less ok the specific products are questionable partition it 's usually advised to keep 2 3 monthly income liquid in your case 40 45 is ca 24 27 i.e. 2000 a month thus the range is 4 7 as you are strongly risk averse then 7k is still ok then they propose you to invest 60 in low risk but illiquid and   15 in middle or high risk which is also ok however it does n't have to be real estate but could be specifics be aware that a lot most of the banks including local banks they are however less aggressive often sell the products that promise high commissions to them often with a part flowing directly to your client advisor especially now when the interest rates are low they stand under extra pressure you should rather switch to passively managed funds with low fees if you stick up to the actively managed funds with their fees you should choose them yourself

most penny stocks go to zero because most businesses fail   you stated in your original post that you were wondering specifically about companies with no assets these are exactly the kind that fail and go to zero   there are many holes within the regulatory structure that allow for many accounting tricks in penny stock land and even in areas that are adequately regulated there will be few to no remedies for the optimistic penny stock shareholder speculator

my take on this is that with any short selling contract you are engaging in at a specified time in the future you will need to transfer ownership of the you sold to the buyer whether you own the or in your case you will buy your friend 's used   car in the meantime or dig enough gold out of the ground in the case of hedging a commodity exposure is a matter of trust hence there is normally some form of margin or credit line involved to cover for you failing to deliver on expiry

they may be willing to issue mortgages with smaller deposits but may take longer to make a decision that can not be farther from the truth if you are getting a mortgage on a smaller deposit you will be paying a higher interest rate time to take a decision depends very much on your credit situation earnings spending and the amount of loan you want to avail of advantages and disadvantages compared to banks today nothing specifically that is obvious you deposits are guaranteed by fscs which is primarily everybody 's biggest concern one thing i did observe was they generally have saving accounts which pay better than the big banks but that is for one to compare and find out   in ownership structure you own a part of the building society because you are a member by having an mortgage with them not the case with a big bank though unless you own any shares you can make a case for the difference of the big bank 's multiple business as compared to a building society

to the best of my knowledge the uk 's online banking systems look purely at the sort code and account number when routing transfers   the name is not cross checked to ensure it matches this is why it 's so easy to transfers if you make an error entering the numbers and inadvertently enter the details for a valid account belonging to the wrong person so in your case so long as you 're sure you have the correct account number and sort code it does n't matter what you put in the name field it 'll end up in the account to which those numbers apply   of course you might as well put your best guess into the name field since it does n't hurt and in the event that something does go wrong it 's backup evidence of your intentions

the sec 30-day yield you 're seeing is a standardized yield calculation set out by the securities exchange commission   it can be useful for comparing bond funds but it does n't guarantee what you 'll actually earn from a fund important the sec 30-day yield represents a bond fund 's returns from the previous 30 days expressed as an annual percentage of the current fund price yes an annual percentage in other words do n't expect return on your money every 30 days   such a return is too good to be true return in today 's low rate environment   per year   more reasonable even then the you see is merely an estimate one based on assumptions of what you might expect to earn if you keep your money in place for the next year   the estimate is based on the assumptions that these are n't reliable assumptions   's price does fluctuate   you are not promised to get your principal back with a bond fund   only an individual bond promises your principal back and only at maturity so earning $ on $ 10,000 invested for a full year while taking on interest rate and other risks might not be worth the trouble of putting your money in a brokerage account you 'll need to transfer the money in and out and there are potential trading fees to take into account   how much to buy sell units an fdic insured high interest savings account makes more sense

if they are truly long term investments i would not put a stop loss on them the recent market dive related to the brexit vote is a prime example of why not to have one that was a brief dive that may have stopped you out of any or all of your positions and it was quite short lived you would likely have bought your positions back or new positions entirely and run the risk of experiencing a loss over what turned out to be a non event that said i would recommend evaluating your positions periodically to see if they still make sense and are performing the way you want

your answer will need loads of information and clarification so i will ask you to visit the vat and have a 1 obligation is for you to find out the correct rate of vat charge and pay tax accordingly you can call up the hmrc vat helpline for help which they will be happy to oblige normally everybody pays vat every 3 months or you can pay once in a year 2 depends on your annual turnover including vat less than £ you join the flat rate scheme there are schemes for cultural activities might be good to check here on gov.uk 3 if you pay vat in eu countries you can reclaim vat in uk you need to reclaim vat while filing in your vat returns but be careful about your receipts which can be checked to verify you are not defrauding hmrc   the basic rule is that b2b services are as the name suggests supplies from one business to another and subject to some exceptions are treated as made where the customer belongs no vat is chargeable on b2b supplies to an overseas customer but where you make a b2c supply vat depends on where your customer is located 1 if they are outside the eu you do n’t need to charge vat 2 if they are located in an eu country then you must charge vat source all in all keep all records of vat charged and paid to satisfy the taxman if the rules get complicated get an accountant to help you out don take chances of interpreting the law yourself the fines you might pay for wrong interpretation might be a deal breaker

i 've investigated this and banks are willing to offer a deal similar to what you ask you would take out a securities backed loan which provides you with the down payment on the property for the remainder you take out a regular mortgage   jaganalyst wonders why banks would accept this simple because there 's money to be made both on the securities backed loan and the mortgage both parts of the deal are financially sound from the banks perspective now the 20 number is perhaps a bit low having 20 of the value in shares means you 'd be able to get a loan for 50 of that so only a 10 downpayment

the downside of the store card is that the deal for using the card is typically 6 12 months of no payments or no interest in reality the deal is deferred payments interest the problem is if you miss any payment or fail to pay the computer off in full you 'll have to pay for the accrued interest at a rate typically 25 or higher that means if you buy your computer for $ 1,000 and pay $ 999 at the end of 12 months you may have to pay $ 250 in accrued interest these cards can be great deals just be really careful

i am going to assume your location is the us from what i am seeing it is unlikely you will get a loan other than some government backed thing   you are a poor risk at 7k month you have above average household income   the fact that all of your income is being washed off somewhere is a behavior problem not a mathematical one   for example why do you have a car payment   you should purchase a car for cash failing that given reasonable rent 1100 reasonable car payment 400 insurances 300 other expenses 1000 you should clear at least 4000 per month in cash flow   where is that money going   here tracking spending and budgeting is your friend   figure out the leaks in your budget and fix them by cutting back and perhaps working a second job or somehow earning more you could have a down payment for a home in as little as 10 months   that is not a very long time    similarly we can discuss the grocery store   had you prepared for this moment three years ago you could have bought the store for cash   this would have eliminated a bunch of risk and increase the likelihood of this venture 's success   if you had started this one year ago you could have gone in with a significant down payment   the bank would see this as a good risk if you wanted to borrow the remainder instead the bank sees you as a person as a poor risk   you spend every dime you make without much concern for the future or possible negative events by implication of your question   if you can not handle the cash flows of regular employment well how can you handle the cash flows of a grocery business   it is far more complex and there is far less room for error    so how do you get a loan   i would start with learning on how to manage your personal finance well prior to into the world of business

no   the more legs you add onto your trade the more commissions you will pay entering and exiting the trade and the more opportunity for slippage   so lets head the other direction    can we make a simple risk free option trade with as few legs as possible the not really surprising answer is yes but there is no free lunch as you will see   according to financial theory any riskless position will earn the risk free rate which right now is almost nothing nada 0    let 's test this out with a little example in theory a riskless position can be constructed from buying a stock selling a call option and buying a put option   this combination should earn the risk free rate selling the call option means you get money now but agree to let someone else have the stock at an agreed contract price if the price goes up   buying the put option means you pay money now but can sell the stock to someone at a pre agreed contract price if you want to do so which would only be when the price declines below the contract price   to start our risk free trade buy google stock goog at the oct 3 close    x = $ the example has 100 shares for compatibility with the options contracts which require 100 share blocks we will sell a call and buy a put contract price of $ 500 for jan    therefore we will receive $ 50,000 for certain on jan unless the options clearing system fails because of say global financial collapse or war with according to google finance if we had sold a call today at the close we would receive the bid which is or $ total   and if we had bought a put today at the close we would pay the ask which is or $ total so to receive $ 50,000 for certain on jan we could pay $ for the goog stock minus $ for the money we received selling the call option plus a payment of $ for the put option we need to protect the value   the total is $    if we pay $ today plus execute the option strategy shown we would have $ 50,000 on jan   this is a profit of $ 158 the options commissions are going to be around $ so in total the profit is around $ 120 after commissions    on the other hand in a bank cd for 12 months at 1.1 will yield $ 550 in similarly risk free interest    given that it is difficult to actually make these trades simultaneously in practice with the prices jumping all around i would say if you really want a low risk option trade then a bank cd looks like the safer bet   this is n't to say you ca n't find another combination of stock and contract price that does better than a bank cd but i doubt it will ever be better by very much and still difficult to monitor and align the trades in practice

lets imagine two scenarios 1 you make 40 of total income yearly contributions to a savings account that earns 1 interest for 10 years in this scenario you put in and earned in interest for a total of 2 you make the same yearly contribution to an index fund that earns 7 on average for 10 years in this scenario you put in the same but earned in interest for a total of the main advantage is option 1 has more liquidity you can get the money out faster option 2 requires time to divest any stocks bonds so you need enough savings to get you through that period imagine another two scenarios where you stop earning income you stop working and have only your principal amount in a 1 savings account if you withdraw yearly for your current cost of living you will run through your savings in 7 years you stop working and have only 20k 2 years of savings in savings that earns 1 with in stocks that earns 7 if you withdraw your cost of living currently at you will run through your investments in 15 years and your savings in 2 years for a total of 17 years the two years of income in savings is extremely generous for how long it starts the process   in summary invest your money it was n't specified what currency we are talking about but you can easily find access to an investment company no matter where you are in the world keep a small amount for a rainy day

i dislike reading opinion articles because most people have a construed understanding of monetary policy and macroeconomics   i disagree completely about the yuan possibly taking over as reserve currency first of all some countries use it as a reserve because they deal with china a lot and purchase a lot from china when you purchase from china you either have to buy with yuan or us dollar we obviously print the dollar so we have no issue buying from them in dollar but many countries prefer to use the yuan because they may have lower dollar reserves or its a higher transaction cost secondly and probably the most important is that china will be a failed economy society most likely in the future 1.5 billion people of many different ethnic groups extreme inequality will lead to social unrest already has china has a lot of shit to take care of it 's quite laughable if anyone thinks the yuan is a stable currency and can be a good reserve currency    i posted a link for you to read if you want to understand the monetary system and what the fed 's role is here it is again     read it and tell me what you think

since i have 10k in my account after down payment will i get a    good interest rate on the loan when the bank considers your loan they will see $ regardless they will want to see certain amount of savings that would allow you to continue paying your loan in case of an emergency and $ 10 k might not be enough i was planning to put down 15 but i have been told that i should buy    something called pmi to satisfy the rest 5 and if i take that my    interest will be more and sometimes bank will not go for anybody who    pays less than 20 is that true yes after downpayment + closing costs how much money in the savings    accounts is the bank looking for to say that i am a good buyer depends on the bank my wild guess would be they 're looking for several months worth of loan payments you should have ~6 months worth of savings for emergencies regardless of loans

here is from yahoo finance the s&p 500 over the last ~60 years logarithmic scale   the behavior since has been weird by historical standards and it 's very easy looking at that graph to say yes i would have made so much money had i invested in march 09 of course back in march 09 it was n't so clear that was the bottom but yes over the last 10 years or so you could have made more money by adopting a rule that you 'll accumulate cash in a fdic or similar insured savings account and dump it into an s&p index fund etf when the index is n% off its high of course if you look at the rest of the chart that strategy looks a lot less promising start in the early 80 's and you 'd have held cash until the crash in 2000 except for the recent the general trend in the s&p 500 and stock markets in general has been upward in other words to a first order approximation the s&p 500 is always at an all time high that 's just the general trend

better suggestion refinance into a lower rate mortgage in the us right now you could cut that rate substantially with very little effort unless you are a bad credit risk also not all mortgages permit use as a line of credit without additional fees in addition to credit card transfer fees there is often a different kind of house loan at a higher interest rate if you really need that flexibility so this idea may not even be possible or those fees may kill it even before considering costs and risks on the credit card side generally gimmicks do n't work

fyi i 'm not a lawyer i would not try to reverse the transfer   you need to create a paper trail as to what happened to this money and why   be sure to document whatever you do reach out again reach out to the company again and see if you can transfer the money back to their account   a wire transfer is $ 20 usually be sure to negotiate the company covering this and every other fee if you can not reach them you could probably move the money to an escrow account at your new bank   the new bank will likely be able to advise you on the best way do this   you should probably also send a letter via certified mail to ensure they received it informing them you 've done this and how to get in touch with you by putting the money in an escrow account you 've proven that you have n't used it and if the company wants it back its very obvious who 's money it is   sending the certified mail someone must sign for it will also create a paper trail that will help you if things get ugly finally do n't spend it

i finally found it johnson controls international plc form a amended current report filing filed for the period ending from says on page my emphasis for the relevant paragraph on september 2 2016 johnson controls and tyco completed their    combination pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger the merger    agreement dated as of january 24 2016 as amended by amendment no    1 dated as of july 1 2016 by and among johnson controls tyco and    certain other parties named therein including merger sub llc an    indirect wholly owned subsidiary of tyco merger sub    pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement on september 2 2016    merger sub merged with and into johnson controls with johnson controls    being the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly owned    indirect subsidiary of tyco the merger    following the merger tyco changed its name to johnson controls    international plc   immediately prior to the merger and in connection    tyco shareholders received ordinary shares of tyco    which shares are now referred to as combined company ordinary shares    for each tyco ordinary share they held by virtue of a one    share consolidation in the merger each outstanding share of common    stock par value $ 1.00 per share of johnson controls johnson controls    common stock other than shares held by johnson controls tyco and    certain of their subsidiaries was converted into the right to receive    either the cash consideration or the share consideration each as    described below at the election of the holder subject to    procedures described in the merger agreement and applicable withholding    taxes    the election to receive the cash consideration was as a    result holders of shares of johnson controls common stock that elected    to receive the share consideration and holders of shares of johnson    controls common stock that made no election or failed to properly make    an election became entitled to receive for each such share of johnson    controls common stock $ in cash without interest and    combined company ordinary shares subject to applicable withholding    taxes    holders of shares of johnson controls common stock that elected to    receive the cash consideration became entitled to receive for each such    share of johnson controls common stock $ in cash without    interest subject to applicable withholding taxes    in the merger johnson controls shareholders received in the aggregate    approximately $ billion in cash immediately after the closing of    and giving effect to the merger former johnson controls shareholders    owned approximately 56 of the issued and outstanding combined company    ordinary shares and former tyco stockholders owned approximately 44 of    the issued and outstanding combined company ordinary shares this answers what actually happened in the transaction as far as my cost basis in the new jci it 's a little more obscure on page it says for pro forma purposes the valuation of consideration transferred is    based on amongst other things the adjusted share price of johnson    controls on september 2 2016 of $ per share and on page johnson controls adjusted share price as of september 2 2016 2 $ 2 amount equals johnson control closing share price and market    capitalization at september 2 2016 $ and $ million    respectively adjusted for the tyco $ million cash contribution    used to purchase million shares of johnson controls stock for    $ per share and both agree with the information posted at merger transaction fair value of consideration transferred details which i ca n't seem to find on an official website but it purports to post from the sec edgar database     so for each share of jci it had a fair value of $ prior to the acquisition and transformed into $ in cash plus of new jci shares with a basis of $ $ = $ stated in terms of new jci shares this is $ = $ per new jci share i 'm not really 100 sure of this calculation though   i also found jci 's form which states fair market value generally is the price at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of the facts u.s. federal income tax law does not specifically prescribe how former jci shareholders should determine the fair market value of the tyco ordinary shares received in the merger   one possible method of determining the fair market value of one tyco ordinary share is to use the average of the high and low trading prices on the date of the merger which was $ other methods for determining the fair market value of tyco ordinary shares are possible former jci shareholders are not bound by the approach described above and may in consultation with their tax advisors use another approach    as well as similar text on the irs website one possible method of determining the fair market value of one tyco ordinary share is to use the average of the high and low trading prices on the date of the merger which was $ using this figure former jci shareholders that elected to receive shares in the merger would receive cash and tyco ordinary shares worth approximately $ per share of jci common stock exchanged in the merger assuming no cash received in lieu of fractional shares

so i am trying to puzzle out this claim about tax cuts paying for themselves through growth   this means that for every $ 1 in revenue they in cuts they expect to get $ 1 back in revenue elsewhere like other taxes so with a high tax burden on something say 25 that $ 1 cut in revenue would need to generate $ 4 in additional value to pay for itself   i ca n't think of anything where the federal tax burden is actually 25 of the total value this looks like a pretty clear case of diminishing returns because the lower the tax burden the higher the growth needs to be in order to get the money back if we look at something on the order of sales tax say 5 that $ 1 cut needs to generate $ 20 in growth   if we flip this around and look at it as an investment these are the kinds of returns that are reserved for right time right place bets they are not the kind of returns you can expect to get from groceries and mortgages   can somebody sanity check me on this

this entirely depends on two factors now let 's look at what applecare gives you what it covers is any manufacturing defect it also covers you for phone support as otherwise it 's a $ incident charge even for simple issues it also covers any software issues that you may come across as long as the issues pertain to apple software or the operating system itself what it does n't cover is any damage caused by the user if you snap the corner of the screen drop it spill liquid on it modify it etc then you 're responsible for paying the repair costs if you 're outside of phone support then you 're going to have to pay someone to fix any problems you come across now if we 're to trust this handy study done in 2009 then we can say that the 3-year failure rate for and macbook pros is we could go ahead and say that $ 350 $ 2000 = 17.5 so the chances match up but what 's the likelihood that apple is going to cover the full $ 2000 only under extreme cases are you losing the full $ 2000 theft shock damage etc and those are all cases that apple wo n't cover anyways instead we 're looking at cases such as please keep in mind it has been several years since i worked for apple so these figures may be off so this reduces our possible savings significantly let 's then also look at what the warranty becomes after they fixed a part a replacement part or apple product including a user part that has been installed in accordance with instructions provided by apple assumes the remaining term of the warranty or 90 days from the date of replacement or repair whichever provides longer coverage for you which means in this case that you have a 90-day warranty after they 've fixed an issue this significantly reduces the likelihood of a same part going bad multiple times in a row therefore the chances of that $ 350 being worthwhile are very much against you even if the system does fail in some way it is likely that the repair would be cheaper than the applecare the chances of running into a repair or series of repairs that pays for the applecare and then some are astonishingly low i would still get it if you were giving it to someone who was significantly lacking in any technology concepts such as a parent or grandparent as they are more likely to utilize the extended phone support especially for smaller things that they might you about

no there is no special given to first time tax payers in general this should n't be an issue the irs collects your taxes out of every one of your paychecks throughout the entire year in what is called a withholding tax the amount that the irs withholds is calculated on your w-4 form that you file with your employer whenever you take a new job the form helps you calculate the right number of allowances to claim usually this is the number of personal exemptions but depending upon if you work a second job are married and your spouse works or if you itemize the number of allowances can be increased withholding tax withholding tax also known as payroll withholding is essentially income tax that is withheld from your wages and sent directly to the irs by your employer in other words it ’s like a credit against the income taxes that you must pay for the year by subtracting this money from each paycheck that you receive the irs is basically withholding your anticipated tax payment as you earn it in general most people overestimate their tax liability this is bad for them because they have essentially given the irs an interest free loan and were n't able to use the money to earn interest themselves i have n't heard of any program targeted at first time tax payers to tell them to file a return but considering that most tax payers overpay they should or they are giving the government a free grant

first price is n't artificially maintained at a level when a refining company signs a contract to buy crude from a supplier it promises to buy at a certain price with options for increase and decrease due to the fluctuating prices in the market and it buys crude to build up a certain buffer to supply itself for a certain duration in case of supply problems as it had bought oil at a higher price it would be reluctant to lower the prices even if the current crude it buys is at a lower cost if it buys oil from the open market it has no other option than to pass on the hike on to the consumers so a more intense fluctuation in the prices of oil at the point where you buy it some airlines used hedging to take care of the in the price of oil to their operating margins   and moreover refining and distribution is a very low margin business so the company has an incentive to sell at a higher cost if required

former financial analyst here happy to help you first off you are right to not be entirely trusting of advisors and attorneys they are usually trustworthy but not always and when you are new to this the untrustworthy ones have a habit of reaching you first you 're their target market i 'll give you a little breakdown of how to plan and a starting investment first figure out your future expenses a lot of that money may go to medical bills or associated care do n't forget the costs of modifications and customizations to items so you can have a better quality of life cars can be retrofit to assist you with a you can build a chair lift into a things like that which will be important for mobility all depending on the lingering medical conditions mobility and independence will be critically important for you your past expenses are the best predictor of future expenses so filter out the one time legal and medical costs and use those to predict second for investing there is a simple route to get into the stock market and hopefully you will hear it a lot exchange traded funds etfs you 'll hear the s&p 500 increased by 80 points today on the news the s&p is a combination of 500 different stocks and is used to gauge the market overall you can buy an exchange traded fund as a stock and it 's an investment in all those components there 's an etf for almost anything but the most popular ones are for those big indexes i would suggest putting a few hundred thousand into an s&p 500 indexed etf do it at maybe $ 10,000 per month so you spread the money out and ensure you do n't buy at a market peak and then let it sit there for many years you can buy stocks through online brokerages like scottrade or etrade and they make it fairly easy they even have local offices that you can visit for help stocks are the easiest way to invest once you 've done this you can also open a ira a type of retirement account with special tax benefits and contribute several thousand dollars to it per year i 'll be happy to give more advice if when you need it but there are a number of good books for beginning investors that can explain it better than i. i would suggest that you avoid real estate especially if you expect to move overseas as it is significantly more complicated and has maintenance costs and taxes

first let me say that $ 1000 is not that much of amount to invest in stocks you need to remember that each transaction buy sell has fees which vary between $ depending on the broker you mentioned scottrade they charge $ 7 per transaction for stocks and about twice as much for some mutual funds consider this you invest $ 1000 you gain $ 100 you 'll pay $ 15 in fees just to buy sell that 's 1.5 expense ratio if you invest in more than 1 stock multiply your fees to avoid that you can look into mutual funds different brokers offer different funds for free and almost all of them carry many of the rest for a fee when looking into funds you can find their expense ratio and compare remember that a fund with 1 expense ratio diversifies and invests in many stocks while for you 1.5 expense ratio is for investing in a single stock is it a good idea to invest only in us or diversify worldwide you can invest in the us but in funds that diversify worldwide or across industries generally it is a good idea to diversify i am 28 should i be a conservative investor or take some risks depends on how bad of a shape will you be if you lose all your principle what online brokerage service is the best i have heard a lot about    but want to be sure before i start it seems to be the    least expensive and most user friendly to me best is a problematic term scottrade is ok e*trade is ok you can try sharebuilder ameritrade there are several discount online brokers and plenty of on line reviews and comparisons amongst them what is a margin account and how would it affect my investing from    what i understand it comes into play when an investor borrows money    from the broker do i need to use it at all as i wo n't be investing on a big scale yet you understand right there are rules to use margin accounts and with the amount you have i 'd advise against them even if you get approved read through the brokers faq 's on their requirement should i keep adding money on a monthly basis to my brokerage account    to give me more money to invest or keep it at a certain amount for an    extended period of time sharebuilder has a mechanism to purchase monthly at discounted prices but be careful they give you discounted prices to buy but not to sell you may end up with a lot of positions and the discounts you 've gotten to buy will cause you spend much more on selling generally averaging investing monthly is a good way to save and mitigate some risks but the risks are still there this is good only for long term savings how should my breakdown my investments in terms of bonds vs stocks depends on your vulnerability and risk thresholds

what are you talking about the rules are regulations are setup as needed if you give a concrete e.g. maybe if you give a concrete example of where the govt is in the way i can understand rules and regulations are not examples of govt in the way in itself it would be if say you need to do something but you need to petition the govt first for something and there 's tons of bureaucracy or or something else govt just set the rules such as stop at red light etc   govt is not in the way here    the rest of your comments are on same line so this one bullet is enough again you 're just accusing generally with no specifics and i 'm not naive this is real and my opinion govt sets new rules as needed as a response to something not because people in the govt who change every few years feel so you 're talking about changing people in govt all adhering to the same laws because it makes sense to keep it and if not it gets repealed govt is not one same set of people always present from your birth to death govt keeps changing govt does care about fairness and hft 's existing is proof that govt lets free market and private business start things as it pleases till such time as it stops being fair for all    govt is not really an inhibitor to free market govt actually has no to free market because it allows a fair and balanced free market unlike what you 're referring to which is a free market with no rules like the wild wild west we had that free market before and over time people went from unregulated markets to more regulated markets because it is for our own good govt is just people who agreed with it joined the govt and made it so and others agreed if we do n't agree in future it can be changed    there is a term as regulated free market unregulated free market will lead to salesmen and generally a backwards movement to the wild west again   i do n't think you really want to talk you just want to spew your ignorant libertarian viewpoints because you 've heard them somewhere without thinking much about it you just blindly believe the govt is always wrong with no logic or justification just like religious people    just think on a few points and you will see that you are wrong sometimes is the govt perfect heck no is it always right nope but it is some times and it does do the right things many times it does the wrong things at times as well    but i do n't believe like you do at all because i think for myself and reason if you reason on a few points you 'll see the other viewpoint and stop reading or ron paul because they 're not right about govt being always wrong either    i wo n't bother replying to you anymore because you 're just a troll or arrogant smug guy who thinks he knows it all because your friends all think like you and blindly agree with you so you 've never been taken to reason or logic like others have to you on this board look at the other replies to your posts almost all contradict you just think why are they all wrong or perhaps you are

crude is a cash settled blend of oman and dubai crude oil both quoted in usd   the daily settlement price is mark to market but the final settlement price is based on reported prices from dubai and oman or calculated in some cases with a known procedure averaged and then converted to yen using monthly average exchange rates as published by a reference bank see detailed rules you 're trying to go all the way back and quotes into a blend of usd quoted oils   the correct procedure here would be to go with the oman and dubai prices in the first place unless you 're trying to arbitrage the market as to why they do it this way   it 's a service   takes on all the challenges to provide customers with a steady and consistent way of trading cash oil   for physical oil all you 'd have to do is buy the blend on dubai 's and oman 's spot market   you trust 's price finding process i.e. there will be no discrepancies between your cash oil and the middle east physical oil edit as to why japan is n't buying wti directly   there 's a considerable cost of carry   wti delivery location is ok there are pipelines but it 's still a logistics act to get the oil to a port on the west coast and then have it shipped to japan   dubai 's delivery is at ali persian gulf crude can be shipped straight from al   not only is it a shorter trip but also there are more shipping companies specialised in oil deliveries to the asian why they pay in usd   persian oil is highly sought after in nearly all of asia 's economies but there 's little other exported goods from there   so naturally the market for currency crosses etc is not that liquid   at least not as liquid as to make buying persian oil a smooth deal   anyway both dubai and oman chose to follow western practice to quote their contracts in usd and maybe because of liquidity concerns also to accept usd for payment only

if you are interested in a career in algorithmic trading i strongly encourage you to formally study math and computer science   algorithmic trading firms have no need for employees with financial knowledge if they did they 'd just be called trading firms   rather they need experts in machine learning statistical modeling and computer science in general of course there are other avenues of employment at an algorithmic trading firm such as accounting clearing exchange relations etc   if that 's the sort of thing you 're interested in again you 'll probably want a formal education in those areas as opposed to just reading about finance in the news if you edit your question or add a comment below with information about your particular background i could perhaps advise you in a bit more detail edit given your comment i would say you have a fine academic background for the industry   when hiring mathematicians firms care most about the ease with which you can explore and extract features from massive datasets especially time series regardless of what the dataset might represent   an intelligent firm will not care whether you arrive at their doorstep with zero finance knowledge they will want to teach you everything from scratch anyway nonetheless some domain knowledge could be helpful but you 're not going to get more of it from reading any mass market news source whether you have to pay for it or not   that 's because   some non mass market news sources in the industry are   these are subscription only and actually discuss real information that real professional investors care about   they are loaded with industry jargon they 're extremely opinionated and in my opinion they 're useless   i ca n't imagine trying to learn about the industry from them but if you want to spend money for news in order to be exposed to the of the industry then either of these is far better than the financial times   despite requiring a subscription the financial times still does not cover the technical details of professional trading instead of trying to learn from news then i would suggest some old favorites and above all else read everything in the navigation box on the right side under financial markets and financial instruments

i used to think the physical books were great but i 'm definitely over that   you end up with shelves of books you 'll probably never open again   it just contributes to the clutter   oddly i feel the opposite about text books from the parent   i feel like text books are still and more functional in paper form   a digital copy would be useful for doing searches maybe but provided the book has a good index that should be covered

i believe you are talking about public provident fund and national savings certificate schemes in india ppf > deposit money > if you want to take a loan after 3 years you can take out 25 of the balance in your ppf account nsc > money locked for 6 years and can only be after 3 years you cancel your deposit and encash all your money money is safe in both cases because they are secured by the indian government but at present for both in 2014 15 financial year is for ppf but half yearly for nsc so you get a higher interest rate in case of nsc so if you can lock in your money without any need for withdrawls choose a nsc for higher returns tax rebate wise both are same

probably not but if the damage was bad enough that target gets its lawyers in gear they can certainly come after you for the monetary damages   however it would probably more trouble for them than is worth it   a business like target probably writes off millions of dollars for these kinds of things per year theft damages spoiled product shipping costs lawsuit settlements recall etc
