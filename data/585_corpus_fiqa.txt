i think following the professional money managers is a strategy worth considering the buys from your favorite investors can be taken as strong signals but you should never buy any stock blindly just because someone else bought it be sure do your due diligence before the purchase the most important question is not what they bought but why they bought it and how much to add comment on 's points

most likely scenario a you spend tons of time and effort talking to them with the end result that they take away the extra points   you feel screwed having to do their job for them they 've given you no benefit for looking out for them and you 're left with the points you 've earned but maybe less desire to go back and use them most likely scenario b you just use the points they eventually figure out the problem and fix it   they send you a nasty letter demanding some sort of compensation that they have no legal obligation to because points are not money you will have rendered existing points for service and they have per your existing phone call which can be substantiated in existence though not content through phone records confirmed that they are yours they may go so far as to bar you from their premises   if you do n't use enough points to go negative before they fix it you may avoid this if they can deal with this competently from a customer service pr standpoint then in scenario a they may understand you quickly and they may leave you with some extra points for your trouble   in scenario b pretty much the same thing they 'll let you have the points you used and even leave you a little extra i suggest in either case you only engage in written communication with them or if your jurisdiction allows it record voice conversations   you need a record of what you 've been told

i would expect that your position will be liquidated when the option expires but not before there 's probably still some time value so it does n't make sense for the buyer to exercise the option early and take your stock instead they could sell the option to someone else and collect the remaining time value occasionally there 's a weird situation for whatever reason where an option has near zero or negative time value and then you might get an early exercise but in general if there 's time value someone would want to sell rather than exercise if the option has n't expired maybe the stock will even fall again and you 'll keep it if the option just expired maybe the exercise just has n't been processed yet it may take overnight or so

what i think you 're really confused   is the baby boomers   all of the policies that were put in place that led up to first the .com bubble and then the housing bubble took place in the late 80s and through the 90s most of gen x was somewhere between their late 20s early 30s for the oldest and elementary school for the youngest born in the small percentage of that group that was even out of school during those years was very likely in their first few years on the job even while the events eventually 2000 2008 most of gen x was still either in school or in their first few years on the job the very oldest of them was around 40 and finally at a point where they could start being considered as middle managers   only now in 2012 are we finally starting to see the bulk of the power starting to shift as the baby boomers finally begin to retire and gen x starts taking their place in all actuality the collapse in 2008 could turn out to be the line in the sand where the boomer rule ended and gen x took over in 15 years if things have gotten worse then we can all get back together and blame gen x but as far as the mess we 're in currently that 's the boomers

a few reasons   first it 's hard to buy a stock that has never gone up and is n't necessarily wise to do so   even if you just wait for a stock go down what if you wait and it goes up two dollars then drops 10 cents   has it gone up or down   when should you buy it in general your idea is correct the higher the price the less you should want the stock   but in some sense the past price is irrelevant you ca n't buy it at the past price   you should buy it now if it 's the best option now   and that is based on your assessment of whether it 's future prospects are worth the current price and in fact enough worth enough to make buying the stock the best economic decision you can currently make finally the price may have gone up for a reason   the company may have done something or some information about the company may have become known that affects it 's future prospects   that might make it a better deal perhaps even better than it was before the price increase

i think i understand what you 're trying to achieve you just want to see how it feels to own a share right to go through the process of buying and holding and eventually selling be it at a loss or at a gain   frankly my primary advice is just do it on paper just decide for whatever reason which stocks to buy in what amount subtract 1 for commissions i 'm intentionally staying on the higher side here and keep track of the price changes daily    instead of doing it on mere paper some brokers offer you a demo account where you can practice your paper trading in the same way you would use a live account as far as i know interactive brokers and saxo bank offer such demo accounts go look around on their web pages   the problem about doing it for real is that many of the better brokers such as the two i mentioned have relatively high minimum funding limits you need to send a few thousand pounds to your brokerage account before you can even use it of course you do n't need to invest it all but still the cash has to be there   especially for some younger and inexperienced investors this can them to gambling most of their money away which is why i would not advise you to actually invest in this way it will be expensive but if it 's just for trying it on one share use your local principal bank for the trade   hope this gets you started

short answer if you bought the car as opposed to leasing it there is no one to turn it in to   the reality of cars and car loans is this the value of a car tends to fall rapidly the first couple of years then more slowly after that like it might lose $ 2000 the first year $ 1000 the second $ 500 the third etc what you owe on a loan falls slowly at first because a lot of your payment is going to interest but then as time goes on you pay off the loan faster and faster so you may pay off $ 1000 the first year $ 1100 the second etc i 'm just making up numbers depends on the value of the car and the term and interest rate of the loan but that 's the general idea combining these two things means that in the first few years after you buy a car if you had a small or no down payment you might well owe more on the car than it is worth that 's just how the numbers work out if you keep the car long enough eventually you hit a point where it is worth more than you owe keep it until you 've paid off the loan and you owe $ 0 but the car is still worth something exactly how much depending on its condition and other factors if you just use the car and pay off the loan i.e. if you do n't sell the car or refinance the loan or some such then this does n't matter very much you make your loan payments and you have use of the car what difference does the book value of the car at any given moment matter to you if the idea of owing more than the car is worth bothers you in principle then in the future you could make a larger down payment or make extra payments on the loan the first couple of years to knock the principle down faster that 's about the only things you can do well you could buy with cash so you owe zero and the car is always worth more than you owe but given that you are where you are if you just keep the car and keep driving it and keep paying the loan then you are exactly where you thought you would be when you bought the car right i mean the day you bought the car you presumably were n't thinking that at some future date you could refinance at a lower rate how would you know so i think the easy answer is do n't sweat it just enjoy the car and pay your bills

well taking a short position directly in real estate is impossible because it 's not a fungible asset so the only way to do it is to trade in its derivatives investment fund stock indexes and commodities correlated to the real estate market for example materials related to construction     it 's hard to find those because real estate funds usually do n't issue securities and rely on investment made directly with them another factor should be that those who actually do have issued securities are n't usually popular enough for dealers and market makers to invest in it who make it possible to take a short position in exchange for some spread so what you can do is you can go through all the existing real estate funds and find out if any of them has a broker that let 's you short it in other words which one of them has securities in the financial market you can buy or sell one other option is looking for real estate property derivatives like this particular example personally i would try to find other securities that may in some way correlate with the real estate market even if they look a bit far fetched to be related like commodities and stock from companies in construction and real estate management etc and trade those because these have in most of the cases more liquidity hope this answers your question

again you 're welcome   it 's also important to note it really can not be is that the taxes that were increased were are virtually all the regressive ones   the rate of fica taxation for example on rents interest and other capital gains i.e. non payroll income were initially 0 then later became 0 and currently are 0   meanwhile the fica rate on average amp median payroll wages salaries of workers and mid level managers etc increased from 1 to 15 that 's a increase or put another way it is an increase of 1,500 during less than a single working career the cost of absolutely nothing else in the history of our society increased at anything like that rate not even education and health care costs nor even housing at the peak of the bubble and in actuality just about everything else including the notorious gasoline sold by those evil petroleum companies actually decreased during the same time frame   and then during virtually the same time period those other taxes increased in a similar if less egregious fashion for example in my state there was no sales tax at all circa 1950   a bit over a decade later when it was first instituted it was initially set at 3 but applied only to a select category of goods subsequently the rate was increased to 4 then 5 then with the addition of various county and municipal sales taxes to 6 and higher and more critically the goods and services that are subject to the tax has increased as well many of them already with hidden buried excise taxes so a large portion of the sales tax is actually a tax on a tax   when you realize that as wealth increases the average expenditure on taxable goods tends does not tend increase in anything like a directly proportional manner i.e. while a person making $ 50k a year may pay more than 2x the total sales tax than someone making $ 25k a year simply because a big part of the $ 25k a year goes to basic necessities of food rent etc and it is even possible that the person making $ 100k a year pays a simple 2x in sales tax of the $ 50k person but the $ 1 m a year is highly unlikely to be paying 10x the sales tax as the $ 100k a year person then you begin to realize the way that the regressive form of those taxes work basically the middle class and preventing it from reaching upper middle class status   now to be blatantly it is not simply a matter of blaming the rich because the lion 's share of those taxes were and are being used to redistribute money to an ever increasing number of non working people either retirees or disabled former workers etc the vast majority of which were things demanded by the general population   hence the reality   the means that the rich elites have used to milk amp the system may be indirectly linked to those taxes but in general are actually much more likely to be based on other things access to leverage credit amp the socialization of bad bets losses avoidance of wages and emphasis on capital gains etc   does n't mean the elites wealthy gaming scamming the system indeed many of them are but at least a significant part of the blame for the burdensome tax system lies with the people themselves   as another example of the same thing take healthcare insurance people want their insurance to not only cover the rare large expenses cancer treatment major accident trauma etc but also to cover their annual checkups etc and then are shocked shocked i say when their insurance premiums go up   well what do people expect if virtually everyone goes for an annual checkup and that checkup costs per policy are say $ 300 a year then how can premiums not go up by approximately $ 300 + administration costs   did they expect the money to pay those things to magically appear out of nowhere   seriously you demand something and eventually one way or another you are going to pay for it     so in your father and they were able to support a larger family in no small part because they were not paying for all of those safety net things   in addition for what little safety net did exist at the time the people collecting on it were tiny versus the larger working paying history i.e. in 1940 each retiree on social security was supported by nearly 160 workers by 1950 the ratio was a tenth of that 1 retiree supported by 16 workers by 1965 it was a quarter of that of the 1940 ratio 1 retiree to 4 workers and currently 2009 it is a 1 to 3 ratio and set to get a lot worse as the baby boomer bulge retires en masse in the coming   so basically your single income job still is supporting a large family you just are n't supporting them directly any more instead you pay the government and they get checks from the government and the family you are supporting is probably not biologically related to you i.e. they are someone else 's kids parents etc   and then just as importantly since you are no longer directly supporting a large family you have essentially zero control over the of how the money gets spent whereas your father and grandfather did get to decide instead the monies are being tossed as entitlements to the recipients who since they have been told and certainly want to believe that they are just getting what they are due do n't feel that anyone has any right to tell them how to spend it   sorta like as if when your father and grandfather were working as if their wife and each of their kids as well as great grandpa joe in the back bedroom and maybe the disabled neighbor dave was legally granted a government mandated allowance of 1/10th of your dad 's paycheck and instead of your dad getting his full paycheck the government required his employer to cut several paychecks paying those allowances directly to the wife kids whose checks would go directly to their schools grandpa joe neighbor dave etc and they other than the kids were then able to spend it on whatever they wanted and your dad would n't have been able to say boo about it   because when it comes right down to it that 's what has happened there 's just multiple layers of official bureaucratic obfuscation in the middle that hide the transfers under various

there are a few factors at work here supply and demand being the main one the office for national statistics has some good information supply has historically struggled to compete with demand in the uk and this situation has been since the 1980s when margaret thatcher was prime minister   she set up a variety of schemes to encourage people to own their own home such as tax relief and since then home ownership in the uk has increased dramatically the then conservative government also set up the right to buy scheme in 1980 that allowed council tenants to purchase their council houses at a discounted rate   the effect of this was to increase the number of home owners whilst reducing the amount of housing available for councils to rent to new tenants   anecdotal evidence i ca n't find a documented source to back this up suggests that councils did not build sufficient new homes to replace those purchased by their ex tenants the population of the uk has also increased by around 10 million since 1980 around 20 and this has pushed up demand for housing   house building in the uk has not kept pace with these factors that has led to a shortage of supply that has pushed up prices there 's another factor at play here as well   if you go back to the 1970s around 53 of women would go out to work but in 2013 this figure increased to 67 as it became more common for households to have double incomes   this extra supply of cash also pushed up house prices your question regards a debt based monetary system is not entirely clear but there are limitations put onto how much money people can borrow that are potentially limiting how much house prices can rise by   today most lenders are more conservative in how much they will lend but this was n't the case in the mid 2000s when house prices rose very quickly    lenders are more cautious today after the crash of the late 2000s but things are to relax again and they are starting to lend more which could in turn lead to further house price rises in line with what was seen in the 2000s recessions have with house prices falling back or at least being stable   in the 1980s house prices from 1980 to 1988 but then fell back a little as the recession hit before starting to rise again in 1997   this rise was sustained until 2008 during which time prices again   based on this you could assume prices will again as we come out of the recession as long as this is sustained for 8 years or so however as the potential for more households to become double income is reduced high female employment already and wages are unlikely to raise that quickly this may not be realistic unless the mortgage lenders become extremely lax to the point of reckless to answer your other question about the affordability of housing this will be based on the level of wages in the uk and how strict or lax the lenders are also taking into effect the availability of housing for purchase   if wages rise house prices will rise if lenders are willing to lend more money house prices will rise and if demand continues to supply prices will rise none of the major uk political parties are likely to solve the problems of population growth and not enough houses being built so it is likely prices will rise but you could argue that they are not far off a peak based on current wages and lenders attitudes   if the uk economy continues to recover from the recession it is possible they will fuel another housing boom by lending ever increasing salary multiples as happened in the 2000s unless there is government intervention ie regulation of the lenders

uber currently they recognize 100 of the cost of a ride as revenue   the amount the drivers keep is a cost of sales   under the new rules they would only recognize as revenue the amount that goes to uber same as on the solo rides   the net impact is a material reduction in revenue and no impact on profits or cash flow   tech   the accounting rule changes will cause companies to recognize more revenue early on and less expenses   both of these things will increase their accounting profits   there is no impact on cash flow

you apparently assume that pouring money into a landlord 's pocket is a bad thing not necessarily whether it makes sense to purchase your own home or to live in a rental property varies based on the market prices and rents of properties in the long term real estate prices closely follow inflation however in some areas it may be possible that real estate prices have increased by more than inflation in the past say 10 years this may mean that some stupid people assume that real estate prices continue to appreciate at this rate in the future the price of real estates when compared to rents may become unrealistically high so that the rental yield becomes low and the only reasonable way of obtaining money from real estate investments is price appreciation continuing no it will not continue forever furthermore an individual real estate is a very poorly diversified investment and a very risky investment too a mold problem can destroy the entire value of your investment if you invest in only one property real estates are commonly said to be less risky than stocks but this applies only to large real estate portfolios when compared with large stock portfolios it is easier to build a large stock portfolio with a small amount of money to invest when compared to building a large real estate portfolio thus i would consider this how much return are you going to get by not needing to pay rent but needing to pay some minor maintenance costs when purchasing your own home how much does the home cost what is the annual return on the investment is it larger than smaller when compared to investing the same amount of money in the stock market as i said an individual house is a more risky investment than a well diversified stock portfolio thus if a well diversified stock portfolio yields 8 annually i would demand 10 return from an individual house before considering to move my money from stocks to a house

yep you 're single you 're possibly still a dependent on your parent 's taxes in lieu of rent and you 're finally bringing home bacon instead of bacon bits welcome to the working world let 's say your gross salary is the u.s. median of $ 50,000 with bi weekly checks 26 a year common practice you 're getting $ per paycheck in the 2013 percentage method tax tables here 's how your federal withholding is calculated as a single person paid biweekly federal taxes are computed the amount up to a is taxed at x% then the amount between a and b is taxed at y% so if you make $ c between a and b the tax is + c the amount is included in the base amount for ease of calculation back to our example let 's say you 're getting $ gross wages per check that puts you in the 25 marginal bracket you pay the sum of all lesser brackets which is the base amount of the 25 bracket plus the 25 marginal rate on every dollar that falls within the bracket that 's + .25 = + .25 = + = $ per paycheck the effective tax rate on the total amount as if you were being charged a flat tax is and this is just for the federal income tax add to this ma state income taxes 5.25 flat tax fica aka medicare 1.45 flat and aka social security 6.2 up to a wage base that $ 50k does n't even approach and your effective tax rate on each dollar you earn is + 5.25 + 1.45 + 6.2 = this does n't include any state unemployment taxes that may be withheld separately but as the rate i come up with is pretty darn close to what you 've figured meaning i slightly overestimated your gross income and thus your effective tax rate my bet is that 's either employer paid in ma or it 's just part of ma state income tax it gets better at least at the federal level the amount of your state income taxes is tax deductible at the federal level if you itemize your deductions that may not be a factor for you as you 'd have to come up with more than $ of other tax deductible expenses to make itemizing the better option than taking the standard deduction big ticket items are mortgage expenses other than principal payments hospital stays such as for or major accident and state and local taxes such as sales property and income if you can claim yourself as a dependent meaning your parents ca n't then $ 150 of each check $ 3,900 of your annual salary is no longer taxed for federal withholding lowering the amount of money taxed at the 25 marginal rate you effectively save $ biweekly $ annually in taxes get married and file jointly and your spouse her personal exemption and an extra standard deduction amount if you do n't itemize go on your taxes the tax rates for married couples filing jointly are also lower they 're currently calculated or were in 2012 to be the same as if two equal earners were to file separately so if your spouse does n't work your taxes on the single income are calculated at the rates you 'd get if you earned half as much it does n't work out to half the taxes but it is a significant marriage advantage have kids and each one is another little $ 3,900 tax write off it 's nowhere near the cost of having or raising the child but it helps and having kids is n't about the money owning a home making charitable deductions having medical expenses etc are a toss up the magic number in 2013 is $ for a married couple $ for a single person if your mortgage interest insurance premiums property taxes medical expenditures charitable donations any contributions from your take home pay to a tax deferred savings account typically these accounts are paid into by your employer as a pre tax deduction and never show up as taxable income but you could just as easily move money from your take home pay into tax deferred savings and any other tax deductible payments add up to more than 12 large then itemize if not take your standard deduction as a single taxpayer just starting out in life you probably do n't have any of these types of expenditures certainly not enough to give up the sd i did the math on my own taxes in 2012 and was surprised at how little the government actually gets of my paycheck when all 's said and done remember back in the summer of 2012 when everyone was mad at romney for making millions and only paying an effective income tax rate of 14 which was compared to the middle class 's marginal rate of 25 28 well my family of 3 living on a little more than the median income from one earner me taking the married standard deduction three personal exemptions and a little extra for student loan interest paid an effective federal income tax rate of something like 3.5 of course the fica and ss taxes do n't allow any deductions not even for retirement savings so add in the 4.2 ss in 2012 and 1.45 fica and the full federal gimme was more like 9 10

what do you think is a reasonable rate of return a reasonable rate really breaks down into three things opportunity cost what you need and risk appetite opportunity cost comes into play because whatever returns you make should at least exceed after expenses the next best option   typically the next best option is the risk free return you can get somewhere else which is typically a savings account or some other safe investment vehicle e.g. a guaranteed investment certificate gic bonds etc   but this opportunity cost could also be an alternative investment e.g. an index etf which is not necessarily risk free but it may represent the next best option risk appetite comes down to the amount of risk you are willing to take on any investment and is completely subjective   this is typically how much can you sleep with losing amount what you need is the most subjective element   all things being equal e.g. identical risk profiles access to same next best thing to invest in if your cost of living expenses are only expected to go up 2 per year but mine are expected to go up 3 per year then my reasonable rate of return must exceed 3 but yours must only exceed 2 that said an appropriate return is whatever works for you period   nobody can tell you otherwise for your own investing what you can do is measure yourself against a benchmark   e.g. if your benchmark is the s&p 500 then the s&p 500 spdr etf is your opportunity cost e.g. what you would have made if you did n't do your own investing    in that way you are guaranteed the market return caveat the market return is not guaranteed to be positive as an aside do n't ever ever ever let someone else handle your money unless you want somebody else have your money there is nothing wrong with letting someone else handle your money provided you can live with the triple constraint above   investing takes time and effort and time and effort equals opportunity   if you can do something better with the time and effort you would spend to do your own investing then by all means do it   think about it if you have to spend 1 day a month managing your own investments but that day costs you $ 100 in foregone income e.g. you are a sole proprietor so every day is a working day that is $ 1,200 per year   but if you can find an investment advisor who will manage your books for you and costs you only $ 500 per year what is the better investment   if you do it yourself you are losing $ 1,200   if you pay someone you are losing $ 500   clearly it is cheaper to outsource despite what everyone says not everyone can be an investor   not everyone wants to live with the psychological emotional and mental effort of looking up stocks buying them and then second guessing themselves they are more than happy to pay someone to do that which also lets them point the finger at that person later if things go sideways

it 's likely you do n't have to make estimated tax payments if this is your first year of contracting extra income and your existing salary is already having taxes withheld if you look at the 1040-es general rule in most cases you must pay estimated tax for 2014 if both   of the    following apply this is easier to understand if you look at the worksheet   look at line and the associated instructions   is your required annual payment based on last year 's tax   is the lesser of that number and so is your worst case   is the amount of tax you need to prepay withholding counts as prepayment i 'm going to apply this to your situation based on my understanding because it 's not easy to parse

to the best of my knowledge los angeles county does not require a lawyer to be involved in a real estate transaction i looked through the county recorder site and found no evidence that a lawyer is required i live in a different county in california where a lawyer is also not required for real estate transactions some counties do require a lawyer to be involved that said a purchase contract is a contract a legal document which you sign a realtor may be able to help you understand the housing market pricing trends but can not not allowed by law draft the contract for you or advise to you on the clauses of the contract you 're signing only a lawyer licensed in your state california is allowed to do that so if you want a legal advice about the contract you 're going to sign you need to talk to a lawyer especially if you want a contract drafted for your own special needs or have some specific requirements for a company or a trust for example same goes for the mortgage contract and any other piece of paper you 'll be signing during the closing meeting and there will be plenty of such signatures so it is not a question of need it 's a question of should

as you note your question is inherently opinion based   that said if i were in your situation i would sell the stock all at once and buy whatever it is you want to buy hopefully some index etf or mutual fund according to what i see the current value of the hd stock is about $ 8500 and the jnj stock is worth less than $ 500   with a total investment of less than $ 10,000 any gain you are likely to miss by liquidating now is not going to be huge in absolute terms this is doubly true since you were given the stock so you have no specific reason to believe it will do well at all   if you had picked it yourself based on careful analysis it could be worth keeping if you believed in yourself or even if you just wanted to test your acumen but as it is the stock is essentially random   even if you want to pursue an aggressive allocation it does n't make sense to allocate everything to one stock for no reason   if you were going to put everything in one stock you 'd want it to be a stock you had analyzed and picked   i still think it would be a bad idea but at least it would be a more defensible idea so i would say the risk of your lopsided allocation just two companies with more than 90 of the value in just one outweighs any risk of missing out on a gain   if news breaks tomorrow that the ceo of home depot has been or if trump decides to go on the twitter for some reason your investment could disappear another common way to think about it is if you had $ 9000 today to buy stocks with would you buy $ 8500 worth of hd and $ 500 worth of jnj   if not it probably does n't make sense to hold them just because you happen to have them the only potential exception to my advice above would be tax considerations   you did n't mention what your basis in the stock is   looking at historical prices it looks like if all the stock was 20 years old you 'd have a gain of about $ 8000 and if all of it was 10 years old you 'd have a gain of about $ 6000   if your tax situation is such that selling all the stock at once would push you into a higher tax bracket it might make sense to sell only enough to fit into your current bracket and sell the rest next year   however i think this situation is unlikely because a since the stock has been held for a long time most of the gains will be at the lower long term rate b if you have solid income you can probably afford the tax and c if you do n't have solid income your long term capital gains rate will likely be zero

a more recent article on inheritance taxes than the one cited by says that maryland does not charge inheritance tax on inheritances received from parents and other close relatives as well thus there is no inheritance tax due to maryland on your inheritance and of course estate tax both federal and state is imposed on the estate and payable by the estate and thus should have been taken into account by the executor before determining the amount to be divided among the children   if the executor screwed up on this point some of the inheritance may have to be returned to the estate so that the estate can pay the taxes due or be paid directly to the federal government and/or the state of maryland on behalf of the estate some part of the inheritance might be taxable income to you if it came in the form of an inherited ira on which federal and possibly state taxes have to paid on the taxable part of any distribution from the ira including the required minimum distribution that must be made from the ira each year there is also a 50 penalty for not taking at least the rmd each year note that the value of the ira is not taxable income in the year of inheritance just the money taken as a distribution some people liquidate the ira within 5 years as used to be required for non spouse under earlier tax law and thus end up paying a lot more income tax than they would have to pay if they went the rmd route if your uncle took the help of a lawyer in winding up your father 's estate you are probably ok in that all the rules were likely followed but if it was a do it yourself job or you do n't trust your uncle not to screw it up anyway then as john bensin has already told you you   should certainly consult   a tax professional in maryland to make sure you do n't run afoul of tax authorities

rich people use debt for various reasons the question should not assume that billionaires do n't use debt they also pay lower interest rates on that debt because they have enough collateral that their debt is safer than a typical mortgage many rich people will use interest only mortgages on their primary residences so that they can keep their stock earning at higher growth rates than the mortgage interest that they are paying all while writing off a portion of that mortgage interest on their taxes   taking an artificially low salary and receiving equity for the larger portion of compensation is also a tax strategy to limit the amount of taxes owed on that income if paid directly in stock grants that will count as income but if paid in options then the purchased stock will only be taxed at the lower capital gains rates if the stock is held for a year after the options are exercised every billionaire will have complicated tax avoidance strategies that will require multi year planning for the best long term of taxes debt is a strategic part of that planning also consider that a major part of that upscale lifestyle corporate jets fancy meals etc is on the company dime because the ceo is always on the clock as long as he is meeting with business prospects or doing other company business those expenses will be justified for the corporation and not attributed as income

do not provide any personal information if the debt is not yours ask the caller to provide all the identifying information they have over the phone to verify whether they have your information or are just following up on similar names even if they have information that is yours do not provide more information always make them tell you what they know if they provide information that is not yours simply state that it is not your information and politely end the call if they persist in calling you there are local agencies you can report them to   if they have your information then ask for all of the details of the debt who is it owed to when was the debt incurred what was the original amount of the debt what is the current balance when was the last activity on the account what is their relation to creditor   once you know the creditor you can contact them directly for more information it is possible they may have written off the account and closed it selling it to a debt collector in order to get some sort of return on debt if they truly have a debt that is yours and you did not incur it then you will need to file a police report for a case of identity theft be prepared for some scrutiny

yes money is created out of thin air and it is a good and necessary thing all money even commodity money such as gold is given value only by what can be traded for it so in that sense all money is created out of thin air because it represents the payment of a future debt money merely serves as ious between traders   who do you think should be responsible for adding money to the system been tried does n't work so well individual banks been tried does n't work so well nation states works a lot better although can still fail   so far having a central bank issue money as an economy needs it for trade has been the most successful method to deal with who gets to issue the ious   edit see my post above on a little how and why it works as it does

if you 're willing to do a little more work and bookkeeping than just putting money into the 401(k i would recommend the following i note that you said you chose some funds based on performance since the expense ratios are all high i would recommend against chasing performance because active funds will almost always falter honor the old saw   past performance is no guarantee of future returns assuming the cash in your ally account is an emergency fund i would use it to pay off your credit card debt to avoid the interest payments use free cash flow in the coming months to bring the emergency fund balance back up to an acceptable level if the ally account is not an emergency fund i would make it one with no debt and an emergency fund for 3 12 months of living expenses pick your risk tolerance then you can concentrate on investing your 401(k options are unfortunately pretty poor with those choices i would invest this way once you fill up your choice of ira then you have the tougher decision of where to put any extra money you have to invest if any a brokerage account gives you the freedom of investment choices and the ability to easily pull out money in the case of a dire emergency the 401(k will give you tax benefits but high fund expenses the tax benefits are considerable so if i were at a job where i plan on moving on in a few years i 'd fund the 401(k up to the max with the knowledge that i 'd roll the 401(k into a rollover ira in the relatively short term if i saw myself staying at the employer for a long time 5 + years i 'd probably take the taxable account route since those high fund fees will add up over time one you start building up a solid base then i might look into having a small allocation in one of my accounts for play money to pick individual stocks or start making sector bets

when trying to understand accounting it 's always helpful to reference the balance sheet identity thus and debits and credits must balance in this case one would so that cash is subtracted credited from assets and loans to family members is added debited to assets the income identity is treated differently as so unless if the cash and loans to family members did not start there was no revenue or expense   a revenue will be any interest paid   the expenses will be any costs related to loaning the money such as drafting a contract or any amount defaulted assets are not liabilities a liability on the balance sheet is a liability owed by the entity measured such as a person or a company the family members in this case are the borrowers so they are the ones who must increase their liability accounts like so the lender to family members would not increase liabilities in this case because the lender is not borrowing from the borrower debits credits and the balance sheet debits credits must be equal or an identity is violated debits add to assets and subtract from liabilities and equity while credits subtract from assets and add to liabilities and equity if a lender were to try to simultaneously subtract cash from assets and add loans to liabilities to book a loan the operation would look like this this would cause an immediate imbalance because there are no offsetting debits but more importantly crediting loans to family members as a liability would actually mean that the lender owes loans to family members

if your spouse wishes to buy a car and finance it with a car loan they are free to do so once they have bought a car they are free to let you use it however if you are the owner of the car the loan is going to have to be in your name your spouse ca n't get a loan backed by an asset they do n't own they could get a personal loan and then give the money to you but the interest rates would likely be rather high also even if you are n't on any of the paperwork you being married likely will affect the situation it will depend on what state you 're in if you want to go that route one of the best ways to find out is to simply have your spouse ask the people that would be providing the loan can i finance this separate from my spouse or will they be included in the credit evaluation

first you should diversify your portfolio   if your entire portfolio is in the roth ira then you should eventually diversify that   however if you have an ira and a 401k then it 's perfectly fine for the ira to be in a single fund   for example i used my ira to buy a riskier reit that my 401k does n't support    second if you only have a small amount currently invested e.g. $ 5500 it may make sense to put everything in a single fund until you have enough to get past the low balance fees   it 's not uncommon for funds to charge lower fees to someone who has $ 8000 $ 10,000 or $ 12,000 invested   note that if you deposit $ 10,000 and the fund loses money they 'll usually charge you the rate for less than $ 10,000   so try to exceed the minimum with a decent cushion    a balanced fund may make sense as a first fund   that way they handle the diversification for you   a targeted fund is a special kind of balanced fund that changes the balance over time   some have reported that targeted funds charge higher fees   commissions on those higher fees may explain why your bank wants you to buy    i personally do n't like the asset mixes that i 've seen from targeted funds   they often change the stock bond ratio which is not really correct   the stock bond ratio should stay the same   it 's the securities stocks and bonds to monetary equivalents that should change and that only starting five to ten years before retirement   prior to that the only reason to put money into monetary equivalents is to provide time to pick the right securities fund   retirees should maintain about a five year cushion in monetary equivalents so as not to be forced to sell into a bad market    long term i 'd prefer low load index funds   a bond fund and two or three stock funds   you might want to build your balance first though   it does n't really make sense to have a separate fund until you have enough money to get the best fees   70 75 stocks and 25 30 bonds should add to 100 e.g. 73 and 27   balance annually when you make your new deposit

so the price earnings ratio is price over earnings easy enough but obviously earnings are not static in the case of a growing company the earnings will be higher in the future there will be extra earnings above and beyond what the stock has right now you should consider the future earnings in your estimate of what the company is worth now one snag those extra earnings are future money future money is an interesting thing it 's actually worth less than present because of things like inflation but also opportunity cost   so if you bought $ 100 in money that you 'll have 20 years from now you 'd expect to pay less than $ 100 the us government can sell you that money it 's called a series ee savings bond and it would cost you $ 50 i think do n't quote me on that though ask the treasury so you ca n't compare future money with present money directly and you ca n't just add those dollars to the earnings you need to compute a discount that 's what discounted cash flow analysis is about figuring out the future cash flow and then discounting the future figuring out what it 's worth now the actual way you use the discount rate in your formula is a little than simple division though because it involves discounting each year 's earnings in this case someone has asserted a discount of 11 a year and five years of earnings growth of 10 wikipedia gives us the formula for the value of the future cash flow   essentially adding all the future cash flows together and then discounting them by a compounded rate please forgive me for not filling this formula out i 'm here for theory not math

is n't the premise a bit off   a single minimum wage worker ca n't afford a two bedroom apartment   what about two earners sharing a one bedroom apartment   that would make much more sense both for the workers and for housing costs in general   my wife and i both make much more than minimum wage and we simply choose to live in a one bedroom apartment   we get to save a lot more and plan for our future   a two bedroom apartment is a luxury for a single person not a necessity   that 's like saying he ca n't afford a brand new ford f150 either   no shit   live below your means and you life will be much better in the long run

i agree that retail looks for orderly markets but orderly markets have really never existed really study market history and you 'll see that markets are more orderly today than they ever have been the stuff that used to take place was just insane and happened before computers let alone hft   let me state that while it may seem like i 'm defending hft my algos are actually much longer term and would n't be hurt by any of your proposals i think many of the hft guys are no better than those three card monte sharks who used to fill times square but they 're just playing the game they 're not good but they 're also not bad they 're just another segment of players in orderly markets up and down they really do add liquidity when things go awry as they tend to do in the markets the hfts step aside but do n't fool yourself market makers have always done the exact same thing and also remember that many markets do n't even have market makers traders provide all liquidity   here 's the thing retail investors to the markets when everything is going up and up they believe they can do no wrong and that prices will go up forever then the market gets a bit tougher retail investors and most pros by the way start to lose and then retail investors cry foul markets were never intended to be a nice safe playground for the masses they were designed for those who dedicate their lives to understanding them i do n't pretend that i can litigate a legal case operate on someone 's brain or build a bridge experts have studied those areas for decades and are quite good at those things but retail investors have always thought of wall street as some sort of safe las vegas in reality it 's survival of the   i 'll say to you what i say to every one of my friend 's who wants me to show them a few things about trading if you are n't going to really commit thousands of hours to understanding the markets then stay out invest money that you do n't need for some time in a few good mutual funds keep your debt to a minimum do n't chase quick profits if you do n't understand the game

the reason your scheme fails is because you 're attempting to make all bonds trade at their face value plus interest regardless of the credit of the issuer in all of your examples you 're suggesting i can pay my bill to the electric company using bonds from xyz corp does my electric company have a right to refuse xyz corp bonds as payment and demand other payment   if they do have a right to refuse payment it is almost a certainty my electric company will have no interest in over the books of xyz corp or 's country diner in order to decide whether they accept or reject the payment they will simply reject it and demand cash    if they can not refuse to accept the payment then you will immediately have all sorts of shell corps who 's only purpose is to accumulate debt and act as a free money printing press for some other entity    in both cases your plan fails

re specifically am i right in that everything i put on these is deducted from tax or are there other rules and   am i correctly understanding this as anything above £ 3,600 per year will not be deducted from your tax neither interpretation seems quite right unless what you mean is this the contributions to a pension or to the share save scheme are deducted from your pay before it is taxed that 's how it works for employer run pension schemes in other words you are paying the gross amount you earn into the pension not the amount after tax it 's a tax efficient way to save because compared to other forms of saving the bit about the £ 3,600 you can ignore this assuming you 're earning more than £ 3,600 a year what happens to the pension if you decide to move back to france or another country in some cases you can transfer tax free worst case you 'd pay some tax on the transfer but not more than 25 see here for the current rules re the share scheme if by salary exchange you mean salary sacrifice where your gross pay is officially reduced by that amount e.g. £ 150 a month that 's even more tax efficient because it saves you paying the national insurance contribution too approx 9 of the pay packet conclusion saving into pension and company share save schemes is supremely tax efficient and provided you 're ok with your money being locked away until you 're 57 pension or tied up in company shares it 's understandably many people 's priority to make use of these schemes before considering other forms of saving where you pay into them from your salary after tax now about this i am trying to understand how much i should put into it should i put money into these or should look for another way to save how will this work out if i go back to france or another country nobody here can advise you what to do since individuals goals and circumstances are different and we do n't know enough of the picture that said fwiw i 'll tell you what i might do based solely on what you 've told us in the question first i 'd definitely contribute 6 to the company pension this gets you the full employer match that 's free money plus remember the tax relief = more free money if you 're 27 a total of 12 salary into a pension a year is a decent rate to start saving for retirement actually 14 would be generally advisable and maybe more still it 's generally a case of the more the better especially while young as you have time for growth and you do n't know what later priorities might change financial needs might arise nevertheless you said you might move overseas so in your position i would then

i have n't read the terms here but the question may not have a good answer   that wo n't stop me from trying    call the real rate interest rate inflation and you 'll have what is called negative real rates it 's rare for the overnight real rate to be negative   if you check the same sources for historical data you 'll find it 's usually higher   this is because borrowing money is usually done to gain an economic benefit ie make a profit   that is no longer a consideration when borrowing money short term and is imo a serious problem   this will cause poor investment decisions like you see in housing notice i said overnight rate   that is the only rate set by the boc and the longer rates are set by the market   the central bank has some influence because a longer term is just a series of shorter terms but if you looked up the rate on long canadian real return bonds you 'd see them with a real rate around 1 what happens when the central bank raise or lowers rates will depend on the circumstances   the rate in india is so high because they are using it to defend the rupee   if people earn more interest they have a preference to buy that currency rather than others   however these people are n't stupid they realize it 's the real rate that matters   that 's why japan can get away with very low rates and still have demand for the currency they have or had deflation   when that changed the preference for their currency changed so if canada forex driven inflation then the boc will have to raise rates to defend the dollar for the purpose of lowering inflation from imports   whether it works or not is another story   note that the canadian dollar is very dependant on the total dollar value of net oil exports if canada has inflation due too an accelerating economy this implies that there are profitable opportunities so businesses and individuals will be more likely to pay a positive real rate of interest   in that scenario the demand for credit money will drive the real rate of return

you can also roll money from prior 401ks into current 401ks call the administrator of the 401k you prefer i.e. fidelity schwab whoever the financial institution is explain you do n't work there anymore and ask if you can roll money into it some plans allow this and some do n't so either 1 you   can roll all your prior 401ks into your current 401k 2 you might be able to roll all prior 401ks into the prior 401k of your choice if they will accept contributions after you 've left you ca n't move the amount in your current employer 's 401k until you separate or hit a certain age 3 like mentioned above you can roll all prior 401ks into an ira at any financial institution that will let you set up an ira process the financial institutions you want to move the money from tell them you want a direct rollover have them write the check to the financial institution you are rolling into with your name mentioned but not the beneficiary i.e. check written to schwab john doe account tax implications you are rolling from a pre tax 401k to a pre tax 401k or ira and the money goes directly from institution to institution you are not liable for taxes you can also roll from a roth type already taxed account into another roth type account with no tax implications if they write a check to you and you do n't put the money in an ira or 401k within 60 days you will pay ~20 tax and a 10 early withdrawal penalty that 's why it 's best to transfer from institution to institution 401k vs ira is a personal decision you could move all your prior 401ks into an ira you set up for yourself generally the limitations of a 401k are the lack of funds to invest in that fit your retirement strategy or high expense ratios be sure to investigate the fees you would pay for trades in an ira 401k are almost always free and the expense ratio for funds in your 401k vs funds you might invest in at a broker for your ira best of both can roll all your 401ks into a single 401k and still set up an ira or roth ira if your income qualifies that you can contribute to separately this could give you flexibility in fund choices if your 401k fees tend to be cheaper while keeping the bulk of your nest egg in low cost mutual funds through an employer account last advice even if you do n't like the options in your current 401k make sure you are contributing at least enough to get any employer match

from my experience and friends experiences i can say that there are advantages and disadvantages for paying off your mortgage quickly basically it depends on these factors the type of the mortgage its interest rate your financial stability your skills in making investments and other outside factors such as inflation liquidity cost etc paying it off means you save on interest ratings you decrease investment risks and your investment rates are taxable disadvantages are that you can not use this money for investing you can not use this money for tax deductions and that in a state of inflation not paying it off in advance could save you a lot of money   however i always recommend to read some more on websites that deal with mortgages and speak with the mortgage expert in your bank just acquire enough information to make a good assessment an interesting article on this topic the advantages and disadvantages of paying off your mortgage

when you buy a put on a stock you buy the right to sell the stock at fixed price f that his usually different from the market price m. you paid a price p for the put   your potential profit going forward is represented by the difference you get to collect between your fixed price f and that market price m plus the price you paid for the put or this assumes that p is fixed but the smaller m gets the larger the term and therefore the higher your potential profit from owning the put so when m tanks the put goes higher   the $ put is already in the money if it were settled today the value would be $ or $ 19 this minus the cost of the put itself represents your profit the $ 365 put is out of the money the stock has to fall $ 11 more before the put is exercised but if the stock went down 8 points today that is less than the $ 19 difference at the start of the day because there is time between now and october there is a chance for the stock to go down further thereby going into the money the current value of the put is represented by this chance obviously the chances of the stock going down $ 11 more from today is greater than the chance of it going down $ 19 more on the other hand the closer it gets to the expiration date the less an out of the money put is worth it 's a race between the stock 's fall and the time to expiration

yes that 's right in the end tax is charged on the total of your income in a tax year paye on employment income is just a way of making incremental payments throughout the year note that tax rates are marginal rates applying to bands of salary not the entire salary but as your employment salary would be already over the 40 threshold £ 45,000 for the entire extra from self employment would indeed be taxed at 40 note that you 'll also owe national insurance contributions in general if your employed income is over the higher rate tax threshold it should be 2 class 4 on the self employment income however due to various complications in the way the system works you might be initially charged more than that and and explicitly claim the excess back from hmrc it might also be less if your earnings are below or only slightly above the lower profits limit   you still get to keep 58 only you can decide whether that is worth your time or not

the most obvious use of a collateral is as a risk buffer just as when you borrow money to buy a house and the bank uses the house as a collateral so when people borrow money to loan financial instruments or as is more accurate gain leverage the lender keeps a percentage of that or an equivalent instrument as a collateral in the event that the borrower falls short of margin requirements brokers in most cases have the right to sell that collateral and mitigate the risk   derivatives contracts like any other financial instrument come with their risks and depending on their nature they may sometimes be much more riskier than their underlying instruments for example while a common stock 's main risk comes from the movements in its price which may itself result from many other macro micro economic factors an option in that common stock faces risks from those factors plus the volatility of the stock 's price   to cover this risk lenders apply much higher haircuts when lending against these derivatives in many cases depending upon the notional exposure of the derivative that actual dollar amount of the collateral may be more than the face value or the market value of the derivatives contract usually this collateral is deposited not as the derivatives contract itself but rather as the underlying financial instrument an equity in case of an option a bond in case of a cds and so on this allows the lender to offset the risk by executing a trade on that collateral itself

the are a couple of explanations that i can think of though for determining exactly what is different you will want to print out both returns and compare them line by line to see how they differ if the company up your income to account for the taxes on housing possibly by paying the additional withholding you may be just benefiting from them estimating your tax rate this can especially be the case if your only work was the three month internship they would have to assume your salary was for the entire year there is an earned income tax credit for low wage earners that you may have qualified for it would depend your specific circumstances if you meet the criteria but that credit for a range of income actually pays out more the more you earn to encourage working that extra hour instead of reducing benefit because you had another hour of employment as for the housing subsidy itself while the value is quite high the irs considers that to be a taxable benefit that the employer provided you and so it needs to be added to your w-2 wages $ 8k a month seems quite high but i do n't know the quality of the apartment you were provided and what the going rates are in the area given that you said you worked for a major tech company i can imagine that you might have been working in an area with high rents if the employer did gross up your paycheck so as to cover your taxes that $ 24k would also include that extra tax payment e.g. if the employer paid $ 8k in additional taxes for you then the housing cost that they directly paid were $ 16k

this is an old post i feel requires some more love for completeness   though several responses have mentioned the inherent risks that currency speculation leverage and frequent trading of stocks or currencies bring about more information and possibly a combination of answers is necessary to fully answer this question my answer should probably not be the answer just some additional information to help aid your and others firstly as a retail investor do n't trade forex period major currency pairs arguably make up the most efficient market in the world and as a layman that puts you at a severe disadvantage you mentioned you were a student since you have something else to do other than trade currencies implicitly you can not spend all of your time researching monitoring and investigating the various infinite drivers of currency return since major financial institutions such as banks broker dealers hedge funds brokerages inter dealer brokers mutual funds etf companies etc do have highly intelligent people researching monitoring and investigating the various drivers of currency return at all times you 're unlikely to win against the opposing trader not impossible to win just improbable over time that probability will rob you clean secondly investing in individual businesses can be a worthwhile endeavor and especially as a young student one that could pay dividends pun intended for a very long time that being said what i mentioned above also holds true for many large capitalization equities there are thousands maybe millions of very intelligent people who do nothing other than research a few individual stocks and are often paid quite handsomely to do so as with forex you will often be at a severe informational disadvantage when trading so view any purchase of a stock as a very long term commitment at least five years and if you 're going to invest in a stock you must review the company 's financial history that means through 10-k q for several years i typically examine a minimum ten years of financial statements and reading the notes to the financial statements read the yearly quarterly is usually too volatile to be useful for long term investors management discussion and analysis but remember management pays themselves with your money i assure you management will always place a cherry on top even if that cherry does not exist if you are a shareholder any expense the company pays is partially an expense of yours never forget that no matter how small a position you have partial ownership of the business in which you 're invested thirdly i need to address the stark contrast and often but not always deep conflict between the concepts of investment and speculation according to seth klarman written on page 21 in his famous margin of safety both investments and speculations can be bought and sold both typically fluctuate in price and can thus appear to generate investment returns but there is one critical difference investments throw off cash flow for the benefit of the owners speculations do not the return to the owners of speculations depends exclusively on the of the resale market this seems simple and it is but do not underestimate the profound distinction mr. klarman makes here and ask yourself will forex pay you cash flows while you have a position on a simple test prior to purchasing a stock might help to differentiate between investment and speculation at what price are you willing to sell and why i typically require the answer to be at least 50 higher than the current salable price so that i have a margin of safety and that i will never sell unless there is a material operating change accounting fraud or more generally regime change within the industry in which my company operates furthermore i then research what types of operating changes will alter my opinion and how severe they need to be prior to a liquidation i then write this in a journal to keep myself honest this is the personal aspect to investing the kind of thing you learn only by doing yourself and it takes a lifetime to master you can try various methodologies there are tons of books but overall just be cautious money lost does not return on its own i 've just the surface of a 200,000 page investing book you need to read if you 'd like to do this professionally or as a if this seems like too much or you want to wait until you 've more time to research consider index investing strategies i wo n't delve into these here   and because i 'm an investment professional please do not interpret anything you 've read here as personal advice or as a solicitation to buy or sell any securities or types of securities whatsoever this has been provided for general informational purposes only contact a financial advisor to review your personal circumstances such as time horizon risk tolerance liquidity needs and asset allocation strategies again nothing written herein should be construed as individual advice

there 's many concrete answers but there 's something circular about your question the only thing i can think of is that phone service providers ask for credit report when you want to start a new account but i am sure that could be worked around if you just put down a cash deposit in some cases so now the situation is flipped you are relying on your phone company 's credit   who is to say they do n't just walk away from their end of the deal now that you have paid in full    the amount of credit in this situation is you just have to eat the risk and rely on their credit because you have no credit it does n't matter how much money you have $ 10 or $ 10000 can be out of you equally well if you must always pay for future goods up front you also ca n't use that money month by month now even in low risk investments although they will do exactly that and keep the interest and i challenge your assumption that you will never default you are not a being you live on planet earth ever had to pay $ 125,000 for a treatment because you got a rare form of cancer well you wo n't be able to default on your phone plan and pay for your drug or food if you bankrupt yourself on the drug because your money is already gone i know you asked a simpler question but i ca n't write a good answer without pointing out that no default is a bad model it 's like doing math without a zero element by the way this is realistic it applies to renting in say new york city it 's better to be a tenant with credit who can withhold rent in issue of neglected maintenance or gross unfair treatment than a tenant who has already paid full rent and has left the landlord with little market incentive to do their part

i would say that there is no real difference   asset management companies that is part of large banking groups usually seat in separate entities and operate independently from the rest of the bank assuming proper procedures and regulators usually check that are in place they will not share information with the rest of the bank and their assets are clearly segregated from the rest of the bank they have the same fiduciary duties as an independent am and are probably using the broker dealer services of other banks as well as their parent reputation is a key issue for banks and conflict of interests are usually managed properly independence also comes and goes the corporate history of is a good example was once an independent asset manager in 2003 it merged with lehman brothers thus loosing its independence when lehman went bankrupt in 2008 nb did not join its parent company in bankruptcy and did not lose the assets of its clients the company continued to operate until it was acquired by the management finally it is mostly a question of marketing and positioning

client 's    home or office to do work there i do not think this is true you can not deduct trips to your main business location i.e. you can not deduct trips to your office or client 's location if this is your main client and you routinely work on site however if you only visit your clients on occasion for specific events while doing your routine work at home you can definitely deduct those trips the deduction of the home usage itself has nothing to do with it however there 's a different reason they refer to pub your home must qualify as principal place of business even if it does n't qualify for deduction the qualifications of principal place of business are described in pub if for some personal reason you do not go directly from one location to the other you can not deduct more than the amount it would have cost you to go directly from the first location to the second what is not clear to me is what exactly is deductible if there are    significant time gaps within a single day between trips to different    clients you got it right what this quote means is that if you have client a and client b and you drive from a to b you can only deduct the travel between a and b nothing else i.e. if you have 2 hours to kill and you take a trip to the mall you can not deduct the mileage attributable to that trip you only deduct the actual distance between a and b as it would be had you driven from a to b directly the example you cite re first client being considered as the place of business is for the case where your home does n't qualify as principal place of business in this case you start counting miles from your first client and only for direct trips from client to client if you only have 1 client in that day tough luck nothing to deduct also it 's not clear whether between clients would really be    personal reasons since the appointment times are often set by the    client so it 's not as if the delay between a and b was just because i    felt like it there was never the option of going directly from a to    b. that 's what is called facts and circumstances you can argue that you had enough time between meetings to go back to your home office to continue working the irs agent auditing you and you 're likely to get audited will consider that maybe will accept it maybe not if i had a gap like that described above i could save on my taxes by    going to the park or a hamburger stand instead of going home between a    and b but then you would n't be at home so why would it be principal place of business if you 're not there boom lost deduction for the trip to the first client i suggest you talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state you 're dealing with deductions that are considered red flags for the irs i.e. many people believe that these deductions business use of your home car trigger audits to substantiate business use of your car you need to keep very good track of your travels literally travel log they sell them at staples and make sure to distinguish between personal travel and business travel keep proofs that the meetings took place although keeping a log is a requirement it can be faked so if audited the irs will want to see more than your own documentation a good tax adviser will educate you on all these rules and also clarify the complexities you were asking about here i 'm not a tax adviser so do n't rely on this answer when you 're preparing your tax return or responding to the irs audit in your edit you ask this specifically what i 'm wondering is whether it is possible for a home    to qualify as a principal place of business for purposes of    deducting car expenses but not for the home office deduction the answer is yes deductibility is determined by exclusivity of use among other things but the fact that you manage your business from your kitchen does n't make your kitchen any less of a principal place of business it is non deductible because you also cook your dinners there but it is still nonetheless your principal place of business the pub which i linked to has these qualifications your home office will qualify as your principal place of business if    you meet the following requirements you use it exclusively and regularly for administrative or management activities of your trade or business you have no other fixed location where you conduct substantial administrative or management activities of your trade or business as you see exclusivity of the usage of your home area is not a requirement here the exclusively and regularly in the quote refers to your business not using any other location and managing it from home regularly i.e. if you manage your business a day in a year that 's not enough for it to be considered principal if you manage your business from your office and your home you can not consider home as principal

to avoid risk from rising interest rates get a fixed rate mortgage for the life of the mortgage your principal and interest payments will remain the same keep in mind that the taxes and insurance portion of your monthly payment may still go up because you own the property the costs to maintain the property are your responsibility if you rented this would be the responsibility of the owner of the property if the cost to repair and maintain goes up so does the rent because you are the owner your annual costs to repair and maintain may go up over time the way to eliminate risk of loss of value is to never move until the mortgage is paid off you will know exactly what principal and interest will cost you over the life of the loan when you sell that will be essentially return on your payments you do n't know if the loss of value is due to world national regional local or individual circumstances so hedging is tough if the fact that the mortgage is 95 is what makes you nervous your biggest risk is risk of being upside down that risk is greatly reduced by increasing the amount of the down payment that decreases the risk that the value will be below the mortgage amount if due to unforeseen circumstances you have to sell immediately the money will still be lost due to decrease in value but you are n't forced to bring cash to the settlement table if you need to sell

black cabs are acknowledged globally as the best on earth other than the huge cost i have always had a very positive experience in them so you are correct it is not in every city on earth   london black cabs are still pretty awful they are expensive and not particularly innovative throughout the uk are far better in my view you can book them in advance pay online use an app to see where they are and who is coming or get a call text etc in short tend to be cheaper and generally offer more efficient service they are also regulated far less strictly i could go and start driving a minicab fairly easily no so much for black cabs   gt;i have been to 40 of countries in the world and travel extensively for business and vacations taxis are almost universally awful i have had negative experiences on every continent   compare them to the uber equivalent though taxis in hong kong are ubiquitous and cheap but they are n't particularly pleasant uber somehow manages to be worse   uber in berlin was at best on a par with a normal cab in glasgow it was more expensive   in short uber feels like another minicab firm the local standard seems more relevant because there is n't a consistent uber standard   gt;as a man i have felt threatened on occasions and realized that no one knows i am in this taxi i can only imagine what women go through   i have n't possibly the philippines once or twice but i do n't really feel significantly safer in an uber   gt;i am no fan of how uber is run but the concept is here to stay taxis will never be able to compete with the and accountability whether it is uber or a competitor that is what the world will use   but cab companies already do i can see who my driver is what the registration is with my local cab company moreover i can call the cab company schedule a pick up for two weeks time for a trip to the airport and know what i 'm paying    in short there is nothing that makes uber particularly special they are essentially a minicab company with a technological edge that has already been or is being eroded   gt;the the term ride sharing however the generally accepted definition today is an uber type service   uber is trying to it because it suits them to try and distance themselves from the vehicle for hire definition that means they have to comply with licensing vehicle and employment regulation   moreover it 's a real shame shame because there is value both economic social and environmental in actual ride sharing it 's part of the sharing economy that is actually    the only people who defend taxis either very rarely take them or are drivers themselves   well i do n't drive a taxi and use them regularly enough but i 'll happily defend some of my local firms because they are pretty decent i do however understand why people in areas with poorly regulated taxi services might see uber as a positive in that it will disrupt an unnatural and often inefficient monopoly

i hope i 'm misunderstanding your plan you want to invest in a way that will make so much that you pay back all of the loan payments with investment gains like the answer i gave on the preceding question and like @littleadv 's comment mhoran 's answers do n't do this no good will come of it   this strategy requires higher returns but does not necessarily give you a better return    but because you asked the question again let me specify what you 're missing i do think that learning is a good thing it boils down to two very significant problems that you have n't addressed   1 where are you getting your monthly income from   2 realistic vs. how big do any gains have to be and does that exist in the real world in a way that you can capture   in a nutshell if my answer to the last question showed that it 's crazy to invest and pay back out of your capital and income since you 're trying to keep your capital and only pay back with monthly gains this one will require even higher and thus more unrealistic gains   the model you 're implying   if that 's what you mean with this model which i think you do then here are my two very key questions again how are you getting your monthly income financial investments i.e. stocks or bonds will have two components of value one component of value is the stream of payments such as a monthly dividend from stocks that pay those or the interest payment from a bond the other is the ability to resell a security to another investor receiving back your capital   so you either have to find stocks that pay > 52 returns tax free each year and pay this loan off with the payments or higher returns to cover taxes but these kinds of investments do not exist for you   or you can try to invest in something pray that it goes up per month and so that you can sell it pay back your loan payment with the proceeds and use the capital to buy your next investment that will go up per month to turn and sell it again   the pros that do model this type of speculation go into much more depth than you are capable of they build models that incorporate probabilities for rates of return based on historical data they have better information and have specialized in calculating this all out they even have access to better investment opportunities like pre ipo twitter or private notes you just wo n't find the opportunities to make this happen each month for 24 months again you wo n't find them they do not exist for you in as an investor in securities realistic vs. so clearly i hope that by now i have convinced you that these would be the required returns they simply are n't available to you if they were you would still run into obstacles with converting book returns into physical money that you could repay the loans with and then continuing that growth   and while i appreciate the notion that if i could just make the payments each month i 'd have $ 10,000 after 24 months i guarantee you that you 'll be better off finding another way to target that same investment   along the lines of what mhoran said if you aim for a basic 401 k or other similar investment account and target it into the s&p500 you might see returns of anywhere from to + 25 over the next 24 months but if things went like they tend to average for the s&p500 it 's more like annually check out a savings target calculator like this one from bankrate.com and put in the numbers if you can save about $ 390 a month you 'll be at $ 10 k in 24 months it 's not as fun as the other but you can actually expect to achieve that   you will not find consistent > 50 returns on your money annually

okay let me introduce you to a distinction that may help you as you go through life you can thank me later    the distinction is between prescription and description    what you get when you look in a dictionary or a reference source like wikipedia for a definition of a word or phrase is a descriptive example it 's a description of a common usage but not a limitation or restriction    you seem to have confused this descriptive resource with a such as a law against parking in a handicapped zone without plates that allow you to do so the latter is a hard fast rule that can not be altered and that seems to be what you think a dictionary or wikipedia represents that 's not what how it works you can go ahead and write a letter to jimmy wales yourself if you like but i 'm sure he 's on my side     besides which if you do n't like the phrase patent troll in reference to lego then i 'm happy to work with you and say instead they 're ugly thugs that abuse the patent system does that work out better for you    anyway glad you took the time to make sure the message was crystal clear

first and foremost you should do more research on credit cards and what everything means   as expressed by others the balance transfer fee is not what you think it is   credit cards can be great they can also quickly erode your credit score and your standing   so understanding the basics is very important    the credit card that is right for you should have the following criteria   the first two points should be straight forward you should not have to pay a cc company for the privilege to use their card   they should pay you through perks and rewards   it should also be a cc that can be used for what you need it for   if you travel internationally a lot and the cc you choose only works within the us then what good is it the third point is where you need to ask yourself what you do a lot and if a cc can offer rewards through travel miles or cash back or other bonuses based on your lifestyle   the transfer fee is not what you think it is people who already are carrying debt on another credit card and would like to transfer that debt to another credit card would be interested in finding a fee or a low   people do this to get a batter rate or to get away from a bad credit card   if one charges 28 and another charges 13 well it makes sense to transfer existing debt over to the 13 provided they do n't crush you on fees   since you have no credit card debt assumption based on the fact you want to build your credit you should ask yourself for what purpose and how often do you plan to use the credit card   would this card be just for emergencies and wo nt be used on daily purchases then a credit card that offers 3 cash back on gasoline purchases is not for you   if you however love to travel and plan to use your credit card for a lot of purchases or have a few large purchases insurance tuition etc then get a credit card that provides rewards like miles   it really comes down to you and your situation there are numerous websites dedicated to the best credit card for any situation    the final thing i will say is what i mentioned at the beginning its important cc 's can be a tool to establish and improve your credit worthiness they can also be a tool to destroy your credit worthiness so be careful and make smart choices on what you use your card for   a credit score is like a mountain it requires a slow and steady discipline to reach the top but one and that credit score can tumble quickly

a credit card is not a bank account   it is essentially a contract to extend a line of credit on an as needed basis through a process accepted by the through approved cash advance etc   there is no mechanism for the bank to accept or hold a deposit   while most card issuers will simple retain the money for a period of up 30 60 days to apply toward transactions i have had a card that actually charged a fee for having a negative balance in excess of $ 10 for more than 30 fee was $ 10/month so no you can not deposit money on any credit card   you need an account that accepts deposits to make a deposit

gt;&gt i propose to make the requirements for finish high school and college degrees much much higher as it was in the past   gt not gon na happen   totally agree with you what i was proposing is what should be done   gt waiting for disadvantaged kids to get higher scores will not happen until they get accepted into college   even then almost all disadvantaged kids smart or not smart the diploma they get is almost worthless the diploma will not give them much advantage or improve their situation the diploma barely even helps very smart kids from rich advantaged homes   actually if in the past no matter who you knew no matter your family background a diploma will almost always guarantee a secure and advantaged life   gt if you force schools to gain their income from future students earnings they will have high concern for kids that have a good p e ratio it will also stop the loan industry from putting these kids into debt   in theory you are correct in practice many many problems to implement for starters this makes college a very risky business because it 's very hard to predict future income of its students even the very smart and accomplished students and i will give you a related example colleges teach computer science programming to many kids today but the profession is about to die due ai and automation + outsourcing this was unexpected 1 2 years ago    barely economists can predict the economy so you want colleges to predict income based on what is taught   gt the downside is that it may turn colleges into trade techs    actually colleges are already trade techs because today almost all students study just for the hope to get a job   in the past you studied to become a scholar and wise and then pick some kind of a job of your interest where being generally smart and knowledgeable is needed   bottom line since you and i know that nothing will be done no higher standards and no future income based tuition here 's what what 's happening with my son which is what happened with me which is still happening in germany no i am not german but i come from a german culture my parents are of german descent but i was born and raised in israel   it 's called master and apprentice   i have been working since i was 13 with computers and if you consider my age 55 when i was 13 no pcs with internet and only punch cards were used to access a computer my parents did not push me it was me who felt the need to work while i was studying just like my father had that need when he was young   my son 13 today but since he was 10 the apple does not fall far from the tree found work he 's not even allowed to work by law and is making money he 's right now teaching administering and designing minecraft worlds and applications   hands on experience especially taught from a master is better than any diploma   he will probably go to some so so college to get a piece of paper called diploma while he will continue working in whatever he 's interested   he will be successful like i am not trying to brag i never pushed him but i explained to you some realities of the world   last word actually most masters real masters are desperate to teach for free their knowledge vision and know and the system does not allow them to do that to protect the colleges and universities only in medicine it 's still happens think about it

a mutual fund could make two different kinds of distributions to you capital gains when the fund liquidates positions that it holds it may realize a gain if it sells the assets for a greater price than the fund purchased them for as an example for an index fund assets may get liquidated if the underlying index changes in composition thus requiring the manager to sell some stocks and purchase others mutual funds are required to distribute most of their income that they generate in this way back to its shareholders many often do this near the end of the calendar year   when you receive the distribution the gains will be categorized as either short term the asset was held for less than one year or long term vice versa based upon the holding period the gain is taxed differently currently in the united states long term capital gains are only taxed at 15 regardless of your income tax bracket you only pay the capital gains tax not the income tax short term capital gains are treated as ordinary income so you will pay your probably higher tax rate on any cash that you are given by your mutual fund you may also be subject to capital gains taxes when you decide to sell your holdings in the fund any profit that you made based on the difference between your purchase and sale price is treated as a capital gain based upon the period of time that you held the mutual fund shares it is categorized as a short- or long term gain and is taxed accordingly in the tax year that you sell the shares dividends many companies pay dividends to their stockholders as a way of returning a portion of their profits to their collective owners when you invest in a mutual fund that owns dividend paying stocks the fund is the owner that receives the dividend payments as with capital gains mutual funds will redistribute these dividends to you periodically often quarterly or annually the main difference with dividends is that they are always taxed as ordinary income no matter how long you or the fund have held the asset i 'm not aware of texas state tax laws so i ca n't comment on your other question

from a mathematical expected value standpoint there is no difference between gambling e.g. buying a lottery ticket and investing e.g. buying a share of stock   the former probably has negative expected value while the latter probably has positive expected value but that is not a distinction to include in a definition else every company that gives a bad quarterly earnings report suddenly changes categories however investment professionals have a vested interest in claiming there is a difference that justifies them charging fees to steer you into the right investment   consequently hair splitting ideas like the motive behind a purchase are introduced   the classification of an item to be purchased should not depend on the mental state of its purchaser depending on the situation it may be right to engage in negative ev behavior   for example if you have $ 1000 and need $ 2000 by next week or else you ca n't have an operation and you will die and you ca n't find anyone to give you a loan   your optimal strategy is to gamble your $ 1000 at the best odds you can get with a possible outcome of $ 2000   so even if you only have a 1/3 chance of winning and getting that operation it 's still the right bet if you ca n't find a better one

the answer to your question depends very much on your definition of long term because let 's make something clear an investment horizon of three to six months is not long term and you need to consider the length of time from when an emergency develops until you will need to tap into the money emergencies almost by definition are unplanned when talking about investment risk the real word that should be used is volatility stocks are n't inherently riskier than bonds issued by the same company they are likely to be a more volatile instrument however this means that while stocks can easily gain 15 20 percent or more in a year if you are lucky as a holder they can also easily lose just as much which is good if you are looking to buy unless the loss is by significantly weaker fundamentals such as earning lookout most of the time stocks rebound and regain lost valuation but this can take some time if you have to sell during that period then you lose money the purpose of an emergency fund is generally to be liquid easily accessible without penalties stable in value and provide a cushion against potentially large unplanned expenses if you live on your own have good insurance rent your home do n't have any major household or other items that might break and require immediate replacement or repair then just looking at your emergency fund in terms of months of normal outlay makes sense if you own your home have dependents lack insurance and have major possessions which you need then you need to factor those risks into deciding how large an emergency fund you might need and perhaps consider not just normal outlays but also some exceptional situations what if the refrigerator and water heater breaks down at the same time that something breaks a few windows for example what if you also need to make an emergency trip near the same time because a relative becomes seriously ill notice that the purpose of the emergency fund is specifically not to generate significant interest or dividend income since it needs to be stable in value not depreciate and liquid an emergency fund will tend towards lower risk and thus lower yield investments the extreme being cash or the for many more practical option of a savings account account forms geared toward retirement savings tend to not be particularly liquid sure you can usually swap out one investment vehicle for another but you ca n't easily withdraw your money without significant penalties if at all bonds are generally more stable in value than stocks which is a good thing for a longer term portion of an emergency fund just make sure that you are able to withdraw the money with short notice without significant penalties and pick bonds issued by stable companies or a fund of investment grade bonds however in the present investment climate this means that you are looking at returns not significantly better than those of a high yield savings account while taking on a certain amount of additional risk bonds today can easily have a place if you have to pick some form of investment vehicle but if you have the option of keeping the cash in a high yield savings account that might actually be a better option any stock market investments should be seen as investments rather than a safety net hopefully they will grow over time but it is perfectly possible that they will lose value if what triggers your financial emergency is anything more than local it is certainly possible to have that same trigger cause a decline in the stock market money that you need for regular expenses even unplanned ones should not be in investments thus you first decide how large an emergency fund you need based on your particular situation then you build up that amount of money in a savings vehicle rather than an investment vehicle once you have the emergency fund in savings then by all means continue to put the same amount of money into investments instead just make sure to if you tap into the emergency fund replenish it as quickly as possible

when inflation is high or is rising generally interest rates will be raised to reduce people spending their money and slow down the rate of inflation as interest rates rise people will be less willing to borrow money and more willing to keep their money earning a good interest rate in the bank people will reduce their spending and invest less into alternative assets but instead put more into their bank savings when inflation is too low and the economy is starting to slow down generally interest rates will be raised to encourage more spending to restart the economy again as interest rates drop more will take their saving out of their bank accounts as is starts to earn very little in interest rate and more will be willing to borrow as it becomes cheaper to borrow people will start spending more and investing their money outside of bank savings

not to pick your words apart but i 'm used to the word laddering as used with cds or bonds where one buys a new say 7 year duration each year with old money coming due and in effect is always earning the longer term rate while still having new funds available each year   so the article you link suggests that there 's money to be saved by not taking a long term policy on all the insurance you buy they split $ 250 k 30 year $ 1 m 20 year the money saved by going short on the bigger policy is they say $ 11k.   it 's an interesting idea will you use the $ 11 k saved to buy a new $ 1 m 10 year policy in 20 years or will you not need the insurance there are situations where insurance needs drop e.g. 20 years into my marriage college fully funded as are retirement accounts i am semi retired and if i passed there 's enough money there are also situations where the need runs longer the concept in the article works for the former type of circumstance

the technical term of a recession is 2 successive quarters of negative gdp growth as is the natural cycle the curve will at some point in the future maybe it 's tomorrow or 5 years from now but nobody knows for certain one also should n't take any single indicator as the end all be all of indicators for example there are other spreads that indicate the health of credit in the global economy such as the ted spread and the libor spread if you take a peek at the ted spread it tells a much different story the ted spread measures the health of the global banking system by tracking the rate at which banks lend to each other a lower ted rate equals more trust and perceived creditworthiness of the borrower which would be another bank   lastly you really ca n't rely on a single article or single indicator to come to the conclusion that the sky is falling even if we are on the of a recession here in the us nobody can tell the impact and depth of the recession in my opinion we are nearing the top of the credit cycle and should be expecting a bit of a cooling off in the near term 1 3 years outside of that your guess is as good as mine

if you withdraw all or most of your pension 25 is tax free but the rest is treated as income upon which you will pay income tax at the usual uk rates withdrawing a lump sum to buy property is therefore unlikely to be 10 per annum as you 'll spend years making up lost ground on the initial capital investment if your pension is a self invested personal pension a sipp you could buy property within the pension wrapper itself which would avoid the income tax hit if you do n't have a sipp you may be able to convert your pension to a sipp but you would be wise to seek professional advice about that the uk government is also introducing an additional 3 stamp duty on properties which are not your first home so this may further impact your returns this would apply whether you withdraw your pension as cash or buy the property within a sipp one other alternative to an annuity in the uk is called drawdown where you keep the money invested in your pension as it is now and withdraw an annual income this means your tax bill is reduced as you get to use your annual allowance each year and will also pay less higher rate tax the government provides more details on its website

one of the best answers to this question that i 've ever read is in a paper published by robert lucas in the journal of economic perspectives that journal is meant to a be a place for experts to write about their area of expertise in economics for a general but still technically minded audience they recently opened up the journal as free to the public which is a fantastic resource you no longer need a subscription to or whatever to read it   you can read the abstract to the paper and find a link to it here one of the things that i like a lot about this paper is that it strips out absolutely everything even slightly unnecessary to thinking about a and just discusses what one can arrive at with a very very simple model of course with great simplicity come sacrifice about details however it does a great job of answering your question why do people care about growth a quick note the key to understanding the answer to your question is to think about things in terms of the long term   not even looking forward to the future because we 'll be dead by then but looking back to the past the key to the importance of growth is that for the last years the us has on average had maybe 2 3 real growth per year i 'm pulling these numbers out of my head i think much better numbers are in that paper somewhere on average over that period of time this growth has meant that the quality of life that one has if one lives in a country experiencing this growth is enormous compared to countries that do not experience this average growth over that period   statistically speaking growth is also somewhat auto correlated roughly speaking if it was low the last few periods you can expect it to be low the next period same thing if it 's high    then the reason we care about growth right now if you have too many periods of low growth pretty soon the average over the long term growth will be pulled down and then quality of life ca n't be higher in the future which quickly becomes someone 's present the paper above makes this point with a very simple model of course none of this touches on issues which are another issue entirely with respect to the economy needs to grow to just keep up with its debt repayments i think the answer is along the lines of sometimes countries get into debt expecting that growth will increase their resources in the future and thus they can pay back their debt that strategy is of course the strategy that anyone borrowing taking out a loan should be employing you should expect that your future income will be enough to pay back your on a loan you took otherwise you 're irresponsible at the aggregate level production is the nation 's income it is what you have all that you have as a nation to pay back any debt you 've incurred at the national level

concise answers to your questions depends on the loan and the bank when you accelerate repayment of a loan by applying a pre payment balance to the principal your monthly payment may be reduced however standard practice for most loan types is that the repayment schedule will be accelerated you 'll pay no less each month but you 'll pay it off sooner i can neither confirm nor deny that an internship counts as job experience in the field for the purpose of mortgage lending it sounds logical especially if it were a paid internship in which case you 'd just call it a job but i ca n't be sure as i do n't know of anyone who got a mortgage without accruing the necessary job experience post graduation a loan officer will be happy to talk to you and answer specific questions but if you go in today with no credit history the student loan probably has n't even entered repayment and a lot of unknowns an offer can be for instance you are virtually certain to be denied a mortgage the bank is going to want evidence that you will make good on the debt you have over time one $ 10,000 payment on the loan though significant is just one payment as far as your credit history and credit score is concerned now a few more reality checks $ 70k yr is not what you 'll be bringing home as a single person without dependents you 'll be taxed at the highest possible withholdings rate your effective tax rate on $ 70k depending on the state in which you live can be as high as 30 including all payroll ss taxes for a 1099 earner and/or an employee in a state with an income tax so you 're actually only bringing home 42k yr or about $ if you 're paid biweekly to that add a decent chunk for your group healthcare plan which as of 2014 you will be required to buy or else pay another $ 2500 effectively another 3 of gross earnings in taxes and even now with your first job you should be at least trying to save up a decent chunk o change in a 401k or ira as a retirement nest egg that student loan beginning about 6 months after you leave school will cost you about $ in monthly payments for the next 10 years if it 's all stafford loans with a 50/50 split between sub that could be as much as $ for all stafford or $ 700 or more for private loans if you were going to pay all that back in two years you 're looking at paying a ballpark of $ leaving just $ 700 to pay all your bills and expenses each month with a 3-year payoff plan you 're turning around one of your two paychecks every month to the student loan servicer which for a bachelor is doable but still rather tight your mortgage payment is n't the only payment you will make on your house if you get an fha loan with 3.5 down the lender will demand pmi the city county will likely levy a property tax on the assessed value of land and building the lender may require that you purchase home insurance with minimum acceptable coverage limits and deductibles all of these will be paid into escrow accounts managed by your lending bank from a single check you send them monthly i pay all of these in a state texas that gets its primary income from sales and property tax instead of income and my monthly payment is n't quite double the simple once you have the house you 'll want to fill the house nice bed probably $ 1500 between mattress and frame for a nice big queen you can stretch out on and have lady friends over nice couch $ 1000 tv call it $ 500 that 's probably the bare minimum you 'll want to buy to replace what you lived through college with you 'll have somewhere to eat and sleep other than the floor of your new home and we 're already talking almost a month 's salary or payments of up to 10 of your monthly take home pay over a year on a couple of store credit cards plates etc just keeps bumping this up yes they 're theoretically all one time costs but they 're things you need and things you may not have if you 've been living in dorms and eating in dining halls all through college the house you buy now is likely to be a starter maybe and 1600 sqft at the upper end they sell em as small as it will support a spouse and 2 kids but by that point you 'll be bursting at the what happens if your future spouse had the same idea of buying a house early while rates were low the cost of buying a house may be as little as 3.5 down and a few hundred more in advance escrow and a couple other fees the seller ca n't pay for you the cost of selling the same house is likely to include all the costs you made the seller pay when you bought it because you 'll be selling to someone in the same position you 're in now i did n't know it at the time i bought my house but i paid about $ 5,000 to get into it 3.5 down and 6 months escrow up front while the sellers paid over $ 10,000 to get out the owner got married to another homeowner and they ended up selling both houses to move out of town i do n't even know what kind of bath they took on the house we were n't involved with i graduated in 2005 i did n't buy my first house until i was married and pretty much well settled in 2011 and yes we were looking because mortgage rates were at rock bottom we really lucked out in terms of a home that if we want to or have to we can live in for the rest of our lives only but it 's officially a with a spare room and a downstairs master suite and nursery office so when we 're old and we can pretty much live downstairs i would seriously recommend that you do the same even if by doing so you miss out on the absolute best interest rates last example let 's say hypothetically that you bite at current interest rates and lock in a rate just above prime at 4 3.5 down seller pays closing but then in two years you get married change jobs and have to move let 's further suppose an alternate reality in which after two years of living in an apartment all the same life changes happen and you are now shopping for your first house having been pre approved at 5 that one percentage point savings by buying now on a house in the $ 200k range is worth about $ or about $ off of your p&i payment $ on a $ 200,000 home with a 30-year term not chump change over 30 years if you had been that lucky it 's $ but it 's less than 5 of your take home pay month to month or annually however when you move in two years the buyer 's probably going to want the same deal you got seller pays closing because that 's the market level you bought in to low priced starters for first time homebuyers that 's a 3 commission for both agents 1 origination guarantor and various fixed fees title etc assuming the value of the house has n't changed let 's call total selling costs 8 of the house value of $ 200k which is probably low that 's $ 16,000 in seller 's costs again assuming home value did n't change and that you got an fha loan requiring only 3.5 down your down payment $ 7k plus principal paid about another $ 7k to be exact only covers $ 14k of those costs you 're now in the hole $ 2,000 and you still have to come up with your next home 's down payment   with all other things being equal in order to get back to where you were in net worth terms before you bought the house meaning $ 7,000 cash in the bank after selling it you would need to stay in the house for 4 and a half years to accumulate the $ 16,000 in equity through principal payments that leaves you with your original $ 7,000 down payment returned to you in cash and you 're even in accounting terms which means in finance terms you 're behind that $ 7,000 invested at 3 historical average rate of inflation would have earned you about $ 800 in those four years meaning you need to stick around about 5.5 years before you break even in tvm terms for this reason i would say that you should be very cautious when buying your first home it may very well be the last one you 'll ever buy whether that 's because you made good choices or bad is up to you

i deleted my comment that this was a reply to so i 'll repost it   it was    gt;i do n't know the answer but i 'm pretty sure this is incorrect   you have to take into account the correlations of the securities across the three different markets   it 's definitely not as simple as dividing by three   the reason why i do n't think this is correct is because you can imagine an exchange in which there is only one other security and the asset in question is perfectly correlated and therefore has a beta of 1   you could then have a different exchange with thousands of securities where the asset has a beta of 0.3   the   simple average method would produce a beta of when it 's probably true that the correct answer is closer to 0.3   the solution is not so i do n't think it can be right it neglects the relative sizes of the exchanges and the correlation of the underlying assets with each other   which leads me to consider perhaps the right thing to do is to calculate the returns across all three exchanges and the returns of the asset on all three exchanges do a weighted average and use that variance covariance to calculate the beta across all three exchanges   i 'm not sure what purpose practically such a beta would serve   i think the correct answer is to take the beta of the asset with respect to the largest most diversified exchange   ultimately using a basket of securities like the s&amp;p 500 is just a proxy for the market whatever that means   it does n't truly represent the realm of possibilities for the diversified investor but it 's close enough   tl dr i say pick one exchange and go with it

i have done this for years and have been quite successful at it two reason i even need to do this desire to pay for engagement ring and pay for 150 person wedding without using my nest egg savings   you need to keep a document that details when the free aprs run out and you need to setup automatic payments of the minimum balance from your checking account so you ensure you do not miss a payment   you need to understand when you are going to need to make big purchases of homes apartments cars so that you can ensure you are n't doing this right before your credit score is being checked need to leave 12 months without opening new accounts before doing this   i have been able to finance about $ 60,000 worth of unsecured debt paying between 3 5 interest per year we have an unsecured credit line with citibank that charges 14 and is capped at $ 10,000 and discover personal loans charge around 14 as well in pre paid interest   i would say all things considering that this is a great deal if you do n't have a secured line of credit with a low interest rate   it is something however that if you are n't diligent can get away from you from my experience i would rather pay a small amount of interest while allowing my savings and retirement to grow interest hopefully greater than 3 5 than pay the huge expense and start from zero but if you miss a single payment on a 0 apr balance transfer they charge you all back interest concessions plus charge you a penalty rate   like many of the other posts you need discipline to make this work

easy answer pay down your debt   why easy because you ca n't afford the house the other posters mentioned it i 'll tackle it too your $ mortgage payment estimation is just that mortgage only why have n't you   included home insurance or taxes according to that last graphic those are $ 1930 and $ 1910 per year that adds $ 320 to your monthly cost $ + $ 320 = $ more than what you 're paying in rent and you say you have little enough left over after that   and that 's not counting cmhc insurance like chris w. rea mentioned or maintenance which is something renters always underestimate i know i did   and do n't even get me started on the fact that the currently super low interest rate is fixed for only 5 years   i know you really really want to buy a house and you really want to stay in that expensive area you live in and you 're trying hard to make the numbers work but the fact is you 're setting yourself up for bankruptcy   realistically you have these options 1 stay in the area forget buying for the foreseeable future continue renting pay down debt and then save for a proper down payment 2 stay in the area but make a smaller cheaper place work 3 move to a cheaper location 4 figure out how to make more money   that 's it sorry to be blunt this is the reality

until you get some financial education you will be vulnerable to people wanting your money   once you are educated you will be able to live a tidy life off which is exactly why this amount was awarded to you rather than some other amount     they gave you enough money   this is not a lottery win   i mean financial counselors who will want to help you with strategies to invest your money   every one will promise your money will grow    the latter case describes every full service broker e.g. what will happen if you walk into   this industry has a long tradition of selling investments which significantly underperform the market and making their money by kickbacks sales commissions from those investments which is why they significantly underperform    they also offer products which are unnecessarily complex meant to confuse customers and hide fees one mark of trouble is early exit fees which they need to recoup the sales commission they already paid out   unfortunately one of those people is you   you are treating this like a windfall falling into old often repeated of lottery win thinking   gosh there 's so much money there what could go wrong   this always ends in disaster and on top of your other woes   it 's not a windfall   they gave you just enough money to live on barely because these lawyers and judges do this all day every day and they know exactly how much capital will replace a lifelong salary and if anything you got cheated a bit   read on    you do n't want to feel like greedy scrooge hoarding every penny   i get that   but generous spending wo n't fix that   what will is financial education and once you have real understanding and certainty about your financial situation you will be able to both provide for yourself and be giving in a sensible manner    this stuff is n't taught in school   if it was there 'd be a lot more millionaires because wealth is n't about luck it 's about intelligent management of money   good advisers do exist they 're hard to find   good advisors work only one way for a flat rate or hourly fee   this is called a fee only advisor   s he never takes commissions   beware of brokers who normally work on commission but will happily take an upfront fee   even if they promise to hand you their commission check they 're still recommending you into the same sub par investments because that 's their training i get the world of finance is extremely confusing and it 's hard to know where to start   just make one leap of faith with me you can learn this   one place it 's not confusing university endowments   they get windfalls just like you and they need to manage it to support them for a very long time just like you   endowments are very closely watched by the smartest people in finance no lottery fever here it 's agreed by all that there is one best way to invest an endowment   and it 's mandatory by law   an endowment is a chunk of money say $ 1.2 million that must fund a purpose say a math or chair in perpetuity   you 're not planning to live quite that long but when you 're in your 20 's the investment strategy is the same   the endowment is designed to generate income of some amount on average over the long term   you can draw from the endowment even in down years   the rule of thumb is 4 6 is a sustainable rate that wo n't the endowment usually but you have to keep an eye on it on $ 1.2 m that 's $ 48,000 to $ 72,000 per year   not half bad   see i told you it could work   read jane austen   referred to as a of 10,000 pounds meaning his assets were many times that but they yield income of £ 10,000 a year   same idea   keep in mind that you need to pay taxes but if you plan your investments so you 're holding them more than a year you 're in the much lower 0 10 15 capital gains tax bracket   so here 's where i 'd like you to go    i would say more but this will give you quite an education by itself   say you gave all your money to me   and said your nonprofit needs an executive director fund it in perpetuity   i 'd say thank you you 're right and i 'd create an endowment and invest it about like this   that is fairly close to the standard mix you 'll find in most endowments because that is what 's considered prudent under endowment law i 'd carry all that in a vanguard or fidelity account and follow bogle 's advice on limiting fees   that said dollar cost averaging is not a suicide pact and bonds are ugly right now for reason suze orman describes and real estate seems really right now so i 'd back out of those for now    i 'd aim to draw about $ 60k year out of it or 5 and on average in the very long term the capital should grow i would adjust it downward somewhat if the next few years are a hard recession to avoid taking too much out of the capital and resist the urge to take more out in boom years because that is your hedge against the next recession over 7 is not prudent per the law absent very reasonable reasons does n't apply to you but i 'd act as if it did   a very reasonable reason to take more than 7 would be to shift investment into a house for living in   i would aim for a duplex to also have income from the property if the numbers made sense which they often do n't in california but that 's another question   at your financial level never never never give cash to a charity   you will get marked as a soft target and every commercial fundraiser on earth will you for the rest of your life at your level you open a donor advised fund and let the fund do your giving for you   once you 've funded it which is tax deductible you later tell them which charities to fund when   they screen out fake charities and protect your identity i discuss at length here   now when charities harass you for an immediate handout just tell them that 's not how you support charities

yes you will need to deposit the funds into your hsa then withdraw them to reimburse yourself for the expenses the tax deduction comes when you contribute deposit to your hsa   if you do not deposit the money there you will not be able to claim the deduction   your hsa provider reports the amount of your contributions to the irs so the amount you say you contribute to your hsa on your tax return has to match what your hsa provider reports when you deposit the money to your hsa you need to explicitly tell your provider that the contribution is for tax year 2014   the reason is that you want to make sure that they report the amount of your 2014 contributions to the irs correctly after you 've deposited the amount into your hsa you can withdraw it to reimburse yourself for an eligible medical expense   in order to be eligible it needs to be an expense that was incurred while you had the hsa in place   if you had your hsa account in place before you paid the expense no problem   but if you set up the hsa account after you paid for the expense you might be out of luck the distribution withdrawal will be a part of tax year 2015 and you 'll see this amount included as part of the gross distributions on your 1099-sa form next year when i first set up my hsa i did n't have any extra money to fund the hsa so i handled it just like you are talking about   i would wait until i had a medical bill then deposit the amount i needed into my hsa and withdraw it back out to pay the bill

federal taxes are generally lower in canada   canada 's top federal income tax rate is 29 the us rate is 35 and will go to 39.6 when bush tax cuts expire   the healthcare surcharge will kick in in a few years pushing the top bracket by a few more points and over 40 state provincial taxes are lower in the us   you may end up in the 12 bracket in new york city or around 10 in california or other bad income tax states   but alberta is considered a tax haven in canada and has a 10 flat tax   ontario 's top rate is about 11 but there are that can push the effective rate to about 17 investment income taxes canada wins narrowly   income from capital gains counts as half so if you 're very rich and live in ontario your rate is about 23 and less than that in alberta   the only way to match or beat this deal in the us in the long term is to live in a no income tax state   dividends are taxed at rates somewhere between capital gains and ordinary income not as good a deal as bush 's 15 rate on preferred dividends but that 15 rate will probably expire soon sales taxes us wins but the gap is closing   canada has a national vat like tax called gst and its rate came down from 7 to 5 when became the prime minister   provinces have sales taxes on top of that in the range of 7 8 but alberta has no sales tax   some provinces their sales taxes with the gst and charge a single rate e.g. ontario has a sales tax hst of 13 5 + 8   13 is of course a worse rate than the 6 8 charged by most states but then some states and counties already charge 10 and the rates have been going up in each recession payroll taxes much lower in canada   canadian employees cpp and ei deductions have a low threshold and top out at about $ 3,000   americans 7.65 fica rate applies to even $ 100 k resulting in a tax of $ property taxes too dependent on the location hard to tell tax benefits for retirement savings canada   if you work in the us and do n't have a 401(k you get a really bad deal your retirement is underfunded and you 're stuck with a higher tax bill because you ca n't get the deduction   in canada if you do n't have an rrsp at work you take the money to the financial company of your choice invest it there and take the deduction on your taxes   if you do n't like the investment options in your 401(k you 're stuck with them   if you do n't like them in your rrsp contribute the minimum to get the match and put the rest of the money into your individual rrsp you still get the same deduction   annual 401(k contribution limits are use it or lose it while unused rrsp limits and deductions can be carried forward and used when you need to jump tax brackets   canada used to lack an answer to roth iras but the introduction of tfsas took care of that mortgage interest deduction us wins here as mortgage interest is not deductible in canada marriage penalty us wins   canadian tax returns are of single or married filing separately type   so if you have one working spouse in the family or a big disparity between spouses incomes you can save money by filing a joint return   but such option is not available in canada there are ways to transfer some income between spouses and fund spousal retirement accounts but if the income disparity is big that wo n't be enough higher education cheaper in canada this is not a tax item but it 's a big expense for many families and something the government can do about with your tax dollars to sum it up you may face higher or lower or about the same taxes after moving from us to canada depending on your circumstances   another message here is that the high tax socialist investment unfriendly canada is mostly a convenient myth

you seem to underestimate the risk of this deal for the a person purchasing a residence is happy to pay $ 70 k instead of $ 150 k now and the only risk they take is that the construction company fails to build the condo whatever happens on the estate market in two years they still saved the price difference between the price of complete apartments and to be build apartments which by the way may be less than $ k since that $ 150 k is the price on a hot market in two years however an investor aiming to earn money counts on that the property will actually cost $ 150 k in two years so he 's additionally taking the risk that the estate market may drop should that happen their return on investment will be considerably lower and it 's entirely possible they will make a loss instead of a profit at this point this becomes yet another high risk investment option like financing a startup

that happens all the time the best situation for this to happen is when you have several products each a bit better and a bit more expensive than the other and you add a new product which is the cheapest that gets people into the store to look at the cheapest product and then you show the the next more expensive which is so much better for only a little more money and the next more expensive which is again so much better you might not sell any of the cheapest product but it helps you sell the others   also happens the other way round you add a really expensive item unaffordable for most customers that is really really nice then customers look at it and you show them that for half the price they can have something that is almost as nice the expensive product increases the amount that customers think is the right price for that kind of product a customer might think that $ 2,000 for a diamond ring is an awful lot of money but if you show them another ring for $ 5,000 then suddenly the $ 2,000 does n't look that expensive anymore and if it is almost as nice as the $ 5,000 ring you sell a lot of rings for $ 2,000 because you had the more expensive ring in the store

the statement can be true but is n't a general rule crashes and recessions are two different things a crash is when the market rapidly something when prices are out of equilibrium whether it be stocks a commodity or even a service   when the internet was new nobody knew how to design webpages so web page designers were in huge demand and insane price premiums i literally had college classmates billing real companies $ for marginal web skills eventually the market up and that industry collapsed overnight another example of a crash from the supply point of view was the discovery of silver in the western us during the 19th century these discoveries increased the supply of the commodity to the point that silver coin eroded in value and devastated small family farms who mostly dealt in silver currency recessions are often linked to crashes but you do n't need a crash to have a recession basically during a recession trade and industrial activity drop the economy operates in cycles and the euphoria and over optimistic projections of a growing or booming economy lead to periods of reduced growth where the economy essentially itself capital is a if not the key element of the economic cycle it 's a catalyst that makes things happen debt is one form of capital it 's not good not bad generally cheap capital ie low interest rates bring economic growth why if i can borrow at 4 i can then perform some sort of economic activity bake bread make computers assemble cars etc that will earn myself 6 8 or 10 on the dollar when interest rates go up economic activity slows because the higher cost of credit increases the risk of losing money on an investment the downside of cheap capital is that risk taking gets too easy and you can run into situations like the $ 2 m ranch houses in california the downside of expensive tight capital is that it gets harder for businesses to operate and economic activity slows down the effects of either extreme cascade and snowball

when you invest in an s&p500 index fund that is priced in usd the only major risk you bear is the risk associated with the equity that comprises the index since both the equities and the index fund are priced in usd the fund in your question however is priced in eur for a fund like this to match the performance of the s&p500 which is priced in usd as closely as possible it needs to hedge against fluctuations in the eur usd exchange rate if the fund simply converted eur to usd then invested in an s&p500 index fund priced in usd the eur priced fund may fail to match the usd priced fund because of exchange rate fluctuations here is a simple example demonstrating why hedging is necessary i assumed the current value of the usd priced s&p500 index fund is 1,600 usd share the exchange rate is 1.3 usd eur if you purchase one share of this index using eur you would pay eur share   if the s&p500 increases 10 to usd share and the exchange rate remains unchanged the value of the your investment in the eur fund also increases by 10 both sides of the equation are multiplied by 1.1   however the currency risk comes into play when the eur usd exchange rate changes take the 10 increase in the price of the usd index occurring in tandem with an appreciation of the eur to 1.4 usd eur   although the usd priced index gained 10 the appreciation of the eur means that the eur value of your investment is almost unchanged from the first equation for investments priced in eur that invest in securities priced in usd the presence of this additional currency risk mandates the use of a hedge if the indexes are going to track the fund you linked to uses swap contracts which i discuss in detail below to hedge against fluctuations in the eur usd exchange rate since these derivatives are n't free the cost of the hedge is included in the expenses of the fund and may result in differences between the s&p500 index and the s&p 500 euro hedged index   also it 's important to realize that any time you invest in securities that are priced in a different currency than your own you take on currency risk whether or not the investments aim to track indexes this holds true even for securities that trade on an exchange in your local currency like adr 's or gdr 's i wrote an answer that goes through a simple example in a similar fashion to the one above in that context so you can read that for more information on currency risk in that context   there are several ways to investors be they institutional or individual can hedge against currency risk ishares offers an etf that tracks the s&p500 euro hedged index and uses a over the counter currency swap contract called a month forward fx contract to hedge against the associated currency risk in these contracts two parties agree to swap some amount of one currency for another amount of another currency at some time in the future this allows both parties to effectively lock in an exchange rate for a given time period a month in the case of the ishares etf and therefore protect themselves against exchange rate fluctuations in that period   there are other forms of currency swaps equity swaps etc that could be used to hedge against currency risk in general two parties agree to swap one quantity like a eur cash flow payments of a fixed interest rate etc for another quantity like a usd cash flow payments based on a floating interest rate etc in many cases these are over the counter transactions there is n't necessarily a standardized definition   for example if the european manager of a fund that tracks the s&p500 euro hedged index is holding euros and wants to lock in an effective exchange rate of 1.4 usd eur above the current exchange rate he may find another party that is holding usd and wants to lock in the respective exchange rate of eur usd the other party could be an american fund manager that manages a usd price fund that tracks the ftse by swapping usd and eur both parties can at a price lock in their desired exchange rates   i want to clear up something else in your question too it 's not correct that the s&p 500 is completely unrelated to the euro far from it there are many cases in which the eur usd exchange rate and the level of the s&p500 index could be related for example troublesome economic news in europe could cause the euro to depreciate against the dollar as european investors flee to safety e.g. invest in treasury bills however this economic news could also cause us investors to feel that the global economy wo n't recover as soon as hoped which could affect the s&p500   if the euro appreciated against the dollar for whatever reason this could increase profits for us businesses that earn part of their profits in europe if a us company earns 1 million eur and the exchange rate is 1.3 usd eur the company earns 1.3 million usd if the euro appreciates against the dollar to 1.4 usd eur in the next quarter and the company still earns 1 million eur they now earn 1.4 million usd even without additional sales the us company earned a higher usd profit which is reflected on their financial statements and could increase their share price thus affecting the s&p500 combining examples 1 and 2 if a us company earns some of its profits in europe and a recession hits in the eu two things could happen simultaneously a the company 's sales decline as european consumers scale back their spending and b the euro depreciates against the dollar as european investors sell euros and invest in safer securities denominated in other currencies usd or not the company suffers a loss in profits both from decreased sales and the depreciation of the eur   there are many more factors that could lead to correlation between the euro and the s&p500 or more generally the european and american economies the balance of trade investor and consumer confidence exposure of banks in one region to sovereign debt in another the spread of asset mortgage backed securities from us financial firms to european banks companies municipalities etc all play a role   one example of this last point comes from this article which includes an interesting line among the victims of america ’s subprime crisis are eight municipalities in norway which lost a total of $ 125 million through subprime mortgage related investments long story short these municipalities had mortgage backed securities in their investment portfolios that were derived from far down the line subprime mortgages on us homes i do n't know the specific cities but it really demonstrates how interconnected the world 's economies are when an american family 's payment on their subprime mortgage in say chicago can end up backing a derivative investment in the investment portfolio of say norway

the easiest and least expensive way of doing this similar to the answer from randy is to write a check and deposit it into the canadian institution since this transfer is between accounts you own the easiest thing to do is to do a deposit by mail contact your current institution on where you would need to mail your deposit to you can then write yourself a check on the us bank and mail it to the canadian bank be sure to write for deposit only along with your account number and branch number for canada on the back this is the slowest but cheapest method an alternative option is to use wire transfers but they can be very costly you 'll usually incur a fee when sending and when receiving i only recommend them when you need the money in the account fast they are usually settled within an hour

i remember like 20 years ago someone did an experiment where peter lynch elementary school kids and an all picked stocks in a situation similar to this the result was almost the same with the elementary school kids coming out slightly better   picking correct stocks is a craps shoot as the market is an emotional entity and in the short run even educated guesses do n't give an edge people like peter lynch eventually win of course because of discipline long term goals and knowledge of tools like derivatives

the meaning is quite literal a representative stock list is a list of stocks that would reasonably be expected to have about the same results as the whole market i.e. be representative of an investment that invests in all those stocks of course you do n't want to invest in all stocks individually that would be impractical but you can either choose a diverse array of stocks that are should be representative as the article recommends or alternatively choose to invest in an index fund which offers a practical way to invest in all the stocks in the index at once

paper money and coins cost real resources too but it does n't matter much that it costs resources except maybe for the environment   no institutions controlling the price and supply is a good thing i prefer a currency in which the global market decides the price and not some government i do n't trust that keeps printing more and more for decades causing the currency to lose value over time   bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will never replace normal currencies but they are already competing and it 's good that governments and banks   do n't have an oligopoly anymore    bitcoin is a great mix of a currency and for longterm inflation it 's easily and divisible without a third party and because it 's scarce yet more accessible than gold it 's a great place to store value to escape an economic crisis or simply monetary inflation   now you 'll probably say something volatile is n't safe enough for a but i think the higher the price and the longer it exists the less volatile the bitcoin price will be and that the longterm trend will be up even after it the of gold   meanwhile cryptocurrencies are a great way to interesting projects and create value out of nothing enriching young smart people whom will be able stimulate the global economy

okay first of all and economic system needs division of labor to have much more efficiency and productivity which means people will do repetitive task and be very good at them decrease their cost of starting a new is a preparation time and cost which also suggest people wo n't be inclined to do the same stuff since it becomes pointless and could have existential crisis it is much fun and fulfilling   to do everything you need to done yourself like keeping care of your house making hunting taking care of health if family building your own house but is also much much less productive and also worse     making this part clear which is a long paragraph for a obvious fact people also need motivation for this which is money and statue these are the goals of everyone doing the same unnecessary stuff lets face it other than shelter food education and health things being done these days are no so quite a necessity   so unless humans became more capable of understanding these are just made up dreams that we had made which makes the system go on otherwise it will collapse and understand the real inner reason for these dreams self fulfillment    attention whatsoever this economic system will continue i understand my response was economically related and was sort of edgy this is my sincere thoughts on the topic i also think this economic model wo n't change unless 2 reasons systems changes which i find likely in 50 years time and people will just give up in democracy since it is being used much worse than monarchy war that has never been written in history before which would change the economic system entirely since most of the economic system in with different and most economic activities are not material but services entertainment and other which has no use in war economy

yesterday i have received a call from my local bank they told the the payment had arrived but the money sender failed to specify my account number they have only specified swift code and my address and in order to receive my money money sender has to send an additional swift message where my account number must be specified and the money transfer will remain frozen or blocked until such a message would be received in this case normally your local bank has to send a swift to the sending bank that the account number quoted is missing the sending bank would contact the company and send back a swift message with required info

there are two options according to wells fargo you can either apply for a business commercial equity loan or a line of credit a loan is what it sounds like they give you a lump sum of money for you to use and you have to pay it in monthly installments a line of credit is like a credit card you have money that you can borrow up to a certain amount and you have to make monthly payments the process can differ for different business they probably look at what your real estate is worth how much money you are generating from it etc i am not recommending or endorsing wells fargo other major banks offer the same types of products wells fargo just happened to appear first when i searched for business line of credit

here 's an all too common anecdote which gives me that impression   executive summaries powerpoint etc have slowly made most leaders slow and ineffective at dealing with change i worked in a company that was adamant to continue to produce a dsl modem wifi router in room movie service box as their next product that would be installed per room into a on site in hotels when i tried to explain to them people are just going to download porn online and a few wifi routers are 1/10th the price and a is a pain in the over the phone they just ignored me why well they said they had been with the company for far longer seniority was their excuse to drive a company into the ground they never gave me one technical or analytical reason why their of a project was actually worth pursuing the actually thought they knew more about technology than their engineers technicians and tech support because they had been sitting in rooms listening about technology at maybe a 10th grade level for 30 years every one of them had business degrees even the cto but that is not too bad on its own it was the fact that they had never out of their academic discipline their book shelves if they had any were filled with popular management books self help guides and dieting books oh man sorry for the long rant i hated that place tl;dr management in mba led technical companies after a certain amount of time imho just becomes a bunch of deluded self righteous good old boys that will drive your company like 60 year old drunk boys at the wheel of a school bus   my background is in computational bio which is close to economics math wise   let me do a play by play of those things and their dependency on context   1 communicating with stakeholders   how is this different from communication skills generally stakeholders are not a homogenous group so the statement is a derp   goals   much like the first this is some communications   key point is that understanding goal feasibility is dependent on experience with the system those goals measure so this fake skill splits between i mentioned and communications   a strategy    falls under expertise because it is most essential to understand technical feasibility   you can not delegate tasks well unless you   understand exactly how to perform those tasks   an organization to accomplish said goals   the first word made your definition recursive

the best approach depends on how much of an emergency fund you have if you have no emergency fund calculate how much you need in order to pay your expenses for 1 month and put at least that amount in a savings account   3 6 months worth of expenses is better   put the remainder towards one credit card if you have less than 3 months worth of expenses in your emergency fund deposit 1 additional month 's worth of expenses into your savings account and apply the rest to one card if you have an emergency fund that you 're completely comfortable with pay $ 8000 towards one card and $ 2000 towards the other one   paying off one card fully gets rid of a bill that you have to think about each month even if the two cards are otherwise identical

generally it goes by when they receive the check not when they cash the check though if the check was received prior to midnight on december 31st but after the bank closes they would probably let the tax payer decide to count it for the next year of course if the check is from person a to person b then the only issue is gift tax or annual limit calculations   if it is company to person then income tax could be involved   the irs calls this constructive receipt income    under the cash method include in your gross income all items of    income you actually or constructively receive during your tax year if    you receive property or services you must include their fair market    value in income example    on december 30 2011 mrs. sent you a check for interior    decorating services you provided to her you received the check on    january 2 2012 you must include the amount of the check in income    for 2012   constructive receipt    you have constructive receipt of    income when an amount is credited to your account or made available to    you without restriction you do not need to have possession of it if    you authorize someone to be your agent and receive income for you you    are treated as having received it when your agent received it example     interest is credited to your bank account in december 2012 you do not    withdraw it or enter it into your passbook until 2013 you must    include it in your gross income for 2012   delaying receipt of income     you can not hold checks or postpone taking possession of similar    property from one tax year to another to avoid paying tax on the    income you must report the income in the year the property is    received or made available to you without restriction example    jones a service contractor was entitled to receive a $ 10,000    payment on a contract in december 2012 she was told in december that    her payment was available at her request she was not paid until    january 2013 she must include this payment in her 2012 income because    it was constructively received in 2012   checks    receipt of a valid    check by the end of the tax year is constructive receipt of income in    that year even if you can not cash or deposit the check until the    following year example dr. received a check for $ 500 on december 31 2012 from a    patient she could not deposit the check in her business account until    january 2 2013 she must include this fee in her income for 2012 in general it is best not to cut it close if the check is to be counted as an january event it is best to send it in january if it is to be december event it is best to send it early enough to be able to say with confidence that the check arrived at the destination before the end of the year

the contract should address this issue it will specify the types of remedies and damages that would result if either side tries to back out of the deal there can be monetary penalties and the courts can force the seller to complete the deal where i have experienced this it generally takes only a gentle reminder from the agent regarding the consequences there is also limited indirect protection via the contract between the seller and their real estate agent many times that contract will require the seller to pay the agent their commission if there is n't a valid reason to cancel the deal the contract was to find a fully qualified buyer the threat of having to pay 6 of list price to the agent and not selling the house can be enough to get them to complete the deal all this assumes there was fraud which could bring in criminal penalties

i assume you get your information from somewhere where they do n't report the truth i 'm sorry if mentioning fox news offended you it was not my intention but the way the question is phrased suggests that you know nothing about what pension means so let me explain 403(b is not a pension account pension account is generally a defined benefit account whereas and similar are defined contribution accounts the difference is significant for pensions the employer committed on certain amount to be paid out at retirement the defined benefit regardless of how much the employee employer contributed or how well the account performed this makes such an arrangement a liability an obligation to pay in other words debt defined contribution on the other hand does n't create such a liability since the employer is only committed for the match which is paid currently what happens to your account after the employer deposited the defined contribution the match is your problem you manage it to the best of your abilities and whatever you have there when you retire is yours the employer does n't owe you anything here 's the problem with pensions many employers promised the defined benefit but did n't do anything about actually having money to pay as mentioned such a pension is essentially a debt and the retiree is a debt holder what happens when employer can not pay its debts employer goes bankrupt and when bankrupt debtors are paid only part of what they were owed and that includes the retirees there 's no one raiding pensions no one goes to the bank with a gun and demands give me the pension money what happened was that the employers just did n't fund the pensions they promised to pay but did n't set aside any money or set aside not enough instead they spent it on something else and when the time came that the retirees wanted their money they did n't have any that 's what happened in detroit and in many other places 403(b is in fact the solution to this problem instead of defined benefit the employers commit on defined contribution and after that it 's your problem not theirs to have enough when you 're retired

it 's impossibly difficult to time the market generally speaking you should buy low and sell high picking 25 as an arbitrary ceiling on your gains seems incorrect to me because sometimes you 'll want to hold a stock for longer or sell it sooner and those decisions should be based on your research or if you need the money not an arbitrary number to answer your questions if the reasons you still bought a stock in the first place are still valid then you should hold and/or buy more if something has changed and you ca n't find a reason to buy more then consider selling keep in mind you 'll pay capital gains taxes on anything you sell that is not in a tax deferred e.g. retirement account no it does not make sense to do a wash sale where you sell and buy the same stock capital gains taxes are one reason i 'm not sure why you would ever want to do this what reasons were you considering you can always sell just some of the shares see above and link regarding wash sales buying more of a stock you already own is called dollar cost averaging it 's an effective method when the reasons are right dca minimizes variance due to buying or selling a large amount of shares at an arbitrary single day price and instead spreads the cost or sale basis out over time all that said there 's nothing wrong with locking in a gain by selling all or some shares of a winner buy low sell high

it bothers me how your being downvoted in a goddamn business sub like i get people like tesla and think it 's going to be a good company but as of right now this company does n't make money and is n't that the whole point of a business sure it might have huge and amazing potential but that 's all it is potential i like tesla as much as the next guy i 'm kicking myself for not buying the stock when i first saw it mentioned on reddit and i considered buying it that was at like $ 70    but there is a simple fact that the company may be overvalued it 's valued like a tech company when it 's currently operating like a car company sure you can argue they are really a tech company or will be in the future when if they dominate the battery market but then that means news like this should n't even make a dent on their price    you gave your simple and valid reasons for why you would n't buy tesla but obviously people do n't want to hear it and will downvote it instead of actually making a discussion from it     sometimes i think that marketing team has reddit completely figured out and is just abusing it

i hope things work out and odds are that they will but there 's always a risk profile with any investment particularly an illiquid one like property here you 're taking the risk that the local market in your area does n't tank or that if it does that you can liquidate your houses quickly and retain most of the capital some areas are more stable than others but things can change in decades    my parents live in a decent part of ct house prices were high in the early 2000s then one of the biotech firms around here pulled out one firm was not so big a deal 30000 jobs is quite a bit but the area did n't become rich off one company   but it turns out that was the start of an industry trend 3 more go and suddenly property values crashed luckily we have a pretty small house for the area so most of the assets are n't tied up in it but it 's pretty alarming to see a formerly upper middle class neighborhood become filled with lawns and for sale signs that hang around long enough to gather moss when my parents sell after they retire they might be taking a hit in nominal terms never mind real terms factoring in inflation   this is about investment real estate though i do think there is a more intangible emotional and stability gain you get from owning the land or property you live in

you can do this through a journal entry in quickbooks   it can all be entered as one entry there 's no need to do separate ones for each bill the journal entry should debit accounts payable and credit your equity account   in the line for accounts payable make sure to choose your name in the name column   this in effect enters a credit to your account which will offset the bills that were shown there previously the last step is to apply those credits to the bills   even though they offset each other your name would still show up in any reports and in the pay bills window   to do this open the pay bills window and select one of the bills owed to you   there should be an option to choose apply credits or something similar depends on which version of quickbooks you are running   choose that option and apply credits in the amount of the bill so that it zeroes out   do the same for all of the other bills   once they are all checked off click the button to pay bills   this wo n't actually pay anything but will instead just apply the credits to the bills as indicated

when is the best time to pay at the end of each year if you save $ 1,000 each month at 1 so as to pay $ 12,000 at on a 4.75 loan you 've lost 4.75 1 = 3.75 over that year   and that 's presuming you put the money in a high yield online savings account thus the best time to pay is as soon as you have the money edit this all assumes that you have an emergency fund more than the bare minimum $ 1 k zero other debt with a higher rate than 4.75 and that you are getting the full company match from 401(k

i mean i was a bartender for years in college and on most saturdays i 'd work from in a giant crowd of sweaty drunk and sticky 18 24 year olds friends of mine worked in warehouses factories construction retail you name it the thing is our presence and physical effort was a business necessity    i think the disconnect between our viewpoints is that you see the remote work option as a service solely benefiting the employee which the employer has to bear at some hardship my thought is that the option is mutually beneficial and requiring 100 personal presence in the absence of a business case is an outdated ideology    consider this fewer on site employees means fewer sites this translates to millions saved in rent utilities insurance maintenance administrative staff and it infrastructure etc it also as the article mentions vastly expands the pool of available talent by removing geographical requirements not only that the option to work from home is in and of itself a feature which the ol' recruiting pipe as i alluded to earlier    the overarching logic is that there should be a quantifiable advantage attached to a decision like this and this advantage was again as the article mentions discovered by ibm 's own internal research efforts which supported remote work it does n't make a lot of sense strategically but i have n't worked for ibm for years so i could n't tell you what internal issues they might be struggling with

you 've described the process fairly well   it 's tough to answer a question that ultimately is how is this fair it 's fair in that it 's part of the known risk and for the fact that it applies to all pretty equally in general this is not very common no i do n't have percents handy i 'm just suggesting from decades of trading it 's probably occurring less than 10 of the time why because there 's usually more value to the buyer in simply selling the option and using the proceeds to buy the stock the option will have 2 components   its intrinsic value in the money and the time premium it takes the odd combination of low to no time premium but desire of the buyer to own the stock that makes the exercise desirable

i 'm of the belief that long term fees eat away at your performance if you chose an etf say voo with its .05 expense and a short term bond fund or money market fund you are going be ahead long term   it 's pretty much accepted fact that money managers are not beating the average long term   for you to simply do as well as i do s&p less .05 your guy has to beat the market year in year out by 1.2 not going to happen yes in hindsight some funds have done this over the decades losing funds are closed or merged into performing ones but in the end the average fund lags the average market return quite a bit to pay someone 25 over two decades is n't what i 'd recommend to anyone    there was recently a pbs frontline special the retirement gamble and this link to my article reviewing the show     i put up an image   which shows the effect of 50 years impact of expenses the vanguard s&p etf linked earlier has just a .05 fee in my chart i show .1 and then a total 1 or 2 fee $ k return for .1 $ 294 k for 1   i 'm painfully aware that 3/4 of us taxpayers are n't saving at all for those that are savers the value in learning about investing is huge this is n't a $ 150 k saved but the savings on just that $ 10 k deposit meanwhile before you learn this a pay for his time fee only planner is worth it for a meeting and first year follow up

a home is an investment but the value it returns is n't primarily financial $ $ they are consumption a place to live this gives it different characteristics than other investments e.g. increasing the amount invested by buying a more expensive home does n't do much to assist your financial well being and future income and is n't necessarily the responsible thing to do you may get some capital gains typically in line with inflation sometimes less sometimes more but those are n't the most reliable and it 's difficult to realize them it involves selling your house and moving its main value as a hedge is a hedge against rising rent but if you 're still working full time and can expect cost of living increases that hedge may not be as valuable to you as it would to say someone living on a fixed income but as for treating it as a low risk investment that 's very problematic real low risk investments are things like government bonds where you ca n't lose principal unless you 're going to live into your house until the day you die the real estate crash should have you of any notion that housing values never go down rather your house is a single illiquid investment imagine if you will going to your brokerage and borrowing a hundred thousand dollars or more on margin to invest in a single real estate investment trust then take away whatever diversification the trust offered by holding multiple properties also you ca n't sell any of it until you move away and the transaction fee will take something like 3 still sound safe moreover it 's exactly the wrong kind of risk your house 's value is tied to what people are willing to pay for housing where your house is which is usually subject to the whims of the local economy this means that in a recession and housing bust in the local economy you can lose your job and have your mortgage go underwater at the same time it totally makes sense to treat your house as an investment to some extent and it makes double sense for a financial adviser to consider it as part of your investment recommendations safety is not the way you should be thinking of it though

yup it 's totally legit and it is not a money market account though interest rates are so low across the board this is about as high as savings accounts get and so it is called a high yield savings account a number of banks offer these there are different offerings nation wide versus local state i would use this compare tool at to find them and the blog is very good with updates and trends here are some well advertised accounts if you do n't already have a rewards checking account get one of those first will direct you to these as well a reasonable interest rate on rewards checking is 2.5 and up so much better the only catches are reasonable online statements direct deposit or autopay and use your debit card 10 or 12 times a month for any transaction amount groceries coffee gas easy the other major thing i would consider when opening any account is where you live and the current accounts you have if you have an amex card already just use their savings account that way you have unified accounts faster transfers your personal information is n't spread thinly around all different banks you have more leverage with the company as a long standing customer etc as far as using a bank in the state where you live it simplifies taxes two more things i would always choose a credit union over a bank and many have excellent rewards checking accounts if you use mint yodlee or other financial software make sure the potential new bank with that service

i think the answer to this question depends on how much you trust yourself most people are wonderful at deceiving themselves i 'd personally not trust myself i 'll use 's points for the pitfalls some people get into you can pay off your loans with summer internships and retain the initial cash you had for additional activities that make college enjoyable i.e clubs dinners and social nights   this is actually the risk i 've seen many people do they 'll blow their money in one semester under the assumption that they 'll just earn more in summer and keep it for expenses or the future another benefit to taking these loans would assist in building credit no credit in the usa is actually a good standing many sensible banks or credit unions will happily give people with no credit a loan this makes intuitive sense if you think about it imagine two people with the same income one owes money regularly to multiple sources and the other has no debt obligations which one are you loaning money to simplifying things a lot great credit is best followed by no credit then good credit and then bad credit the advantage of great credit over no credit is simply that some institutions in some sectors do n't have the policies in place to process no credit people no credit people plan to not apply for credit often for self explanatory reasons so this is a point

i 'm going to assume that the 401 k is not a roth   if that 's the case no you should not withdraw from your 401 k to pay off your mortgage you will pay taxes on the withdrawal as if it is income and that loss will far exceed the 6 you are paying in interest on the mortgage which is deductable so may actually be less than 6 all things considered the calculation is really more complicated but in general this sounds like a bad idea

i agree that the education industry has screwed most young people by lying to them about the value of their education and with guaranteed high paying jobs    however the students made their informed decisions and now need to deal with it   will it impact us   probably but we ca n't reinforce a behavior that constantly bails people out of situations of their own making and that of their parents     parents should be providing better guidance to their children but in many cases they have their ego and bragging rights tied up in this as well   the education marketing arms promote the belief that you are a great parent if your child goes to an expensive university   i ca n't tell you how many parents i have heard spouting off about the fact their daughter or son are going to this university or that university   five years later the daughter got her degree in social work etc and is working retail the son never made it through and are in debt up to their eyeballs

some of the expenses you describe may be eligible to be paid off by a 401(k without incurring a penalty as long as you do not mind paying tax on the extra income if your tax bracket does not go up then using your ira may not be a bad idea you should consult a tax expert and see which expenses can qualify for a withdrawal without penalty   i believe medical bills and medical insurance costs are eligible to be withdrawn without penalty in some instances

it 's going to depend entirely on your tax situation its complexity and your willingness interest in dealing with tax filings   personally i find that not only do i not enjoy dealing with figuring out my taxes but i do n't know even a fraction of the possible deductions available and all the clever ways to leverage them   plus the tax code is changing constantly and staying on top of that is not something i 'm ever going to attempt i am of the philosophy that it is my duty to pay only the absolute minimum tax legally required and to utilize every possible exemption deduction credit etc that is available to me   plus my business activities are a bit on the non traditional side so it requires some thinking at times   for me a trained professional is the only way to go   what it costs me i way more than make up in savings on my tax bill   i also go out of my way to never get a refund because if i get one it just means i gave the government a free loan the last time i computed my own taxes used turbotax if memory serves was i think in the late 90s

you are not the economy the economy is just the aggregate of what is going on with everyone else you should make the decision based on your own situation now and projected into the future as best you can loan rates are at historical lows so it is a great time to take a loan if you actually need one for some reason however i would n't go looking for a loan just because the rates are low for the same reason it does n't make sense to buy maternity clothes if you are a single guy just because they are on sale

i think the key to intrinsic value is that if you have something with intrinsic value you can derive some direct benefit from it without trading   for example a house has intrinsic value because without trading it you can use it to stay warm and dry and use it to store your stuff money whether it 's federal currency or bitcoin has a very low intrinsic value what can you do with cash without trading it maybe make some paper art or patch a leaking boat but a $ 20 bill has very little practical intrinsic value until you trade it for goods or services the same with bitcoin you ca n't play it like a video game or drink it if you 're all you can do is trade it for things that you can use directly

tl;dr   it does n't matter   at a point of sufficient credit score your income is far more important for loan approval than your credit score apparently this was a big mistake because it caused my score to drop to 744 not really except for the of opening a margin account   a credit score of 744 is sufficient for the best rates credit score algorithms are dynamic and advice that may have been good in years past may not be applicable today   pay your bills and do n't have unnecessary credit that will lead to your best credit score    for me despite not following conventional wisdom i am enjoying the highest credit score of my life   i have closed accounts that are just unnecessary and have done some other things that the experts say i should not do to keep a high credit score however all that does n't matter   i do not have a need for credit and will likely never have a need beyond my rebate card   i feel like this is also true for you   what difference does it make if you have an or a 744   probably none   at that point your income counts more toward loan eligibility

trying to make money on something going down is inherently more complicated risky and speculative than making money on it going up   selling short allows for unlimited losses   put options expire and have to be if you want to keep playing that game   if you are that confident that the european market will completely crash i 'm not but then again i tend to be fairly contrarian i 'd recommend just sitting it out in cash possibly something other than the euro and waiting until it gets so ridiculously cheap due to panic selling that it all common sense   for example when companies that are n't completely falling apart are selling for less than book value and/or less than five times prior peak earnings that 's a good sign   another indicator is when you hear absolutely nothing other than doom and gloom and people they 'll never buy another stock as long as they live   then buy at these depressed prices and when all the panic sellers realize that the world did n't end it will go back up

without all the details it 's hard to tell what options you may have but none of them are good   when you cosign you are saying that you believe the primary signer will make good on the loan but that if he does n't you will you are 100 responsible for this debt as such there are some actions you can take first really try to stress to your friend that they need to get you outta this loan urge them to re finance with out you if they can next look for better ways of defaulting on the loan and take them depending on what the loan is for you could deed in or short sale you may just have to admit default if you work with the bank and try not to drag out the process you will likely end up in a better place down the line   also of importance is ownership if you pay the loan do you get ownership of the thing the loan was secured against usually not but working with an attorney and the bank maybe for example if it 's a car can the friend sign over the car to you then you sell it and reduce your debt   basically as a cosigner you have some rights but you have all the responsibilities you need to talk to an attorney and possibly the bank and see what your options are at this point if you think the friend is not that much of a friend anymore it 's time to make sure that any conversation you have with them is recorded in email or on paper

economically you would say that purchased and rented real estate are not perfect substitutes they are largely separate markets   only a few people are able to easily switch from one to the other and that choice is sticky for example once you buy a house prices would have to rise a lot for it to be worth it to sell it and move into an apartment in both markets there is a supply and demand curve but the slope of the demand curve for houses to purchase is much steeper than the demand curve for rentals the market for new housing fluctuates rapidly because it requires a large change in housing prices to change the number of people looking to buy a house   most decisions to buy a house are not driven by the state of the housing market   this describes a supply demand graph with a very steep demand curve   additionally because of the leverage provided by mortgages the demand for houses depends critically on relatively small changes in the interest rate and availability of loans   thus the steep demand curve shifts all over the place as borrowing conditions change on the other hand apartment prices are more stable because people easily move from one apartment to another and people living in their parent 's easily move into apartments if prices change   a small change in the price or quantity of rentals brings about reasonable response in quantity demanded   this is the situation where the demand curve is shallow   in addition rentals are not tied to interest rates tightly nor are they as strongly tied to economic conditions in a recession people avoid buying but renters continue to rent

i 'm assuming you 're operating on the cash basis of accounting based on your comment cash i think that 's the only way for a sole sic consider there are two distinct but similar name concepts here paid for in relation to a expense and paid off in relation to a debt   these both occur in the case you describe under the cash basis of accounting when you can deduct an expense is based on when you paid for the expense not when you eventually pay off any resulting debt arising from paying for the expense admittedly cash basis is n't a great name because things do n't solely revolve around cash rather it 's when money has changed hands whether in the form of cash check credit card etc   perhaps monetary transaction basis might have been a better name since it would capture the paid for concept whether using cash or credit   unfortunately we 're stuck with the terminology the industry established

almost all major no load mutual fund families allow you to do the kind of thing you are talking about however you may need an initial investment of between $ 1000 to $ 3000 depending on the fund   once you have it however annual fee 's are usually very little and the fees to buy that companies funds are usually zero if it 's a no load company vanguard etc   with the larger companies that means you have a pretty large selection of funds but generally each fund has a minimum initial purchase once that 's met then you can buy additional amounts in small quantities without a problem for someone on a smaller budget many low cost brokers etrade as mentioned by scottrade as mentioned by myself in another similar question today allow you to start with smaller initial balances and have a small selection of funds or etf 's that you can trade from without commission   in the case of scottrade they have like 15 etf 's that you can trade comission free   check with the various low cost brokerages such as etrade scottrade and tdameritrade to see what their policies are and what if any funds etf 's they allow you to trade in without commissions keep in mind that for mutual funds there may still be a fund minimum initial investment that applies be sure to check if that is the case or not   the lack of any minimum investment makes etf 's a slightly more attractive option for someone who does n't have the buy in that many funds require
