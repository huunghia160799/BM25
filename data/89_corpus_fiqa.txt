if you 're a sole proprietor there 's no reason to have a separate business account as long as you keep adequate records as you are one and the same for tax purposes my husband and i already have 5 accounts and a mortgage with one bank i do n't see the need to open up yet another account   as a contracted accountant i do n't need to write business checks and my expenses are minimal as long as i have an present my assumed business name certificate and id there 's no reason for a bank not to deposit into my personal account

you should have a separate business account mixing business and personal funds is a bad practice shop around you should be able to find a bank that will let you open a free checking account especially if you are going to have minimal activity e.g. less than 20 of checks per month and perhaps maintain a small balance e.g. $ 100 or $ 500

depending on where you are you may be able to get away with filing a doing business as document with your local government and then having the bank call the county seat to verify this there is generally a fee for processing recording filing the dba form of course but it 's useful for more purposes than just this one i still need to file a dba for my hobby work for pay for exactly this reason

i have checked with bank of america and they say the only way to cash or deposit or otherwise get access to the funds represented by a check made out to my business is to open a business account they tell me this is a federal regulation and every bank will say the same thing   to do this i need a state issued dba certificate from the county clerk 's office as well as an employer id number ein issued by the irs and their cheapest business banking account costs $ 15 month i think i can go to the bank that the check is drawn upon and they will cash it assuming i have documentation showing that i am the sole proprietor but i 'm not sure what a racket

when a business asks me to make out a cheque to a person rather than the business name i take that as a red flag frankly it usually means that the person does n't want the money going through their business account for some reason probably tax evasion i 'm not saying you are doing that but it is a frequent issue if the company makes the cheque out to a person they may run the risk of being party to fraud worse still they only have your word for it that you actually own the company and are n't ripping off your employer by pocketing their payment even worse when the company is audited and finds that cheque the person who wrote it will have to justify and document why they made it out to you or risk being charged with embezzlement it 's very much in their interests to make the cheque out to the company they did business with given that you should really have an account in the name of your business it 's going to make your life much simpler in the long run
# 268026
if you sign the check for deposit only the bank will put it in your account you may need to set up a payable name on the account matching your dba alias however having counted offerings for a church on several occasions i know that banks simply have no choice but to be lax about the pay to the order of line on checks say the church 's legal name for which the operating funds account was opened is saint church of red bluff you 'll get offering checks made out to saint saint b 's church of red bluff red bluff youth group fund pastor frank etc the bank will take em all just got ta stamp em with the endorsement for the church sometimes the money will be earmarked based on the payable line any attempt to pay the pastor directly will go into his discretionary fund and anything payable to a specific of the church will go into their asset account line but really all the cash goes directly to the same bank account anyway for profit operations are similar an apartment complex may get checks payable to the apartment name the management company name even the landlord i expect that your freelance work will be no different

i strongly doubt that being executor will make the assets of the estate vulnerable to a suit against him personally the estate is it 's own separate legal entity with its own tin only creditors against the estate itself can make claims against it and after all creditors are paid then the balance is distributed in accordance with the terms of the will unless he has commingled assets and treated estate assets as his own the legal separation should be quite strong   whether his personal assets are at risk remember that the opposition will likely overstate their case to try to scare him into settling if the business was organized as an llp or llc his personal assets should be pretty safe if it was a sole proprietorship he has occasion to worry

rather than rolling the 401(k to a new employer 's plan you should roll it into a traditional ira   you get more options for the money there 's no limit on how much you can roll over and you have more control over the money   if you do a direct rollover there 's no taxes or penalties involved i 'd recommend against taking any money out of the 401(k   with the numbers you give above it 's like borrowing money at interest which is pretty high and you 're sacrificing your future retirement   if you leave that money alone to grow with compounding you 'll have a lot more when you retire   if you 're not familiar with the concept of compound interest it 's worth reading up on the numbers will blow you away at the very least if you desperately need to get $ 3000 out of it take out just enough to net $ 3000 after taxes and penalties not quite $ using the numbers you give and do a rollover with the rest   at least that way you 're keeping more in the ira just over $ vs the $ 5000 in your proposed scenario overall i really recommend you find a way to accomplish your goals without touching your retirement savings

gt people generally do not like labor especially if it is something they do not find fulfilling    i agree sort of of course people do n't enjoy doing work they find unpleasant but i think the idea that people do not like working as a rule is not as obvious as it seems after all that 's more of a guess as it has never been tested in any meaningful way humans throughout history have for the most part worked    while i have an easy time agreeing that it 's preferable for people to work on things they find fulfilling or at least not unpleasant than to work on things they hate i 'm not sold on the concept that people would actually prefer not working at all to working i think productivity and purpose are critical components to the human experience and work plays a big role in them in other words the idea of not working would n't necessarily match the reality of not working if we ever had a chance to properly explore it on a side note i think this is something absolutely worth experimenting with you could run some decent experiments for less than $ 50 m which is really a small amount to explore such a universally relevant topic    gt wage chattel slavery has never nor will it ever be a positive attribute to any society    this strikes me as a loaded statement and on the surface at least not one i agree with please help me understand your thinking here    how exactly do you define wage slavery    if you define it as working in order to survive would you consider maintaining a small working farm in order to feed your family as was done by many throughout history to be a form of wage slavery how about hunting and gathering not paid labor clearly but nonetheless difficult work that was done only because it was necessary for the worker to survive    is working for wages which you can then exchange to buy food and such different in kind from working to produce or capture food is working to afford enough food and shelter to survive different from working to afford more luxurious food or shelter    i 'm not being i 'm just trying to understand the implications of that statement    as far as a reduction in hours worked that is n't necessarily   disastrous it may be but it can also be mitigated for instance if fewer hours worked yield the same or higher income this is n't as radical as it sounds it could for example be viewed as value based pricing of results as opposed to input    that said in practice i think significant job loss due to technology would be handled poorly and thus very messy at least at first    however i do n't think that the shift in job markets will be as sudden or severe as many claim it will be i think that 's a bit of sensationalist fear mongering based more on predictions than evidence

does it make sense for stocks to earn a premium indefinitely yes there is good reason to think that the stock market will make money indefinitely the stock market is the primary mechanism through which investors bear market risk which requires compensation   if you think of all the owners of firms stockholders and bondholders generally the risk premium that stocks earn stocks is the way bondholders pay equityholders to bear the risk that they do not wish to will stock prices always go up in the long run as long as companies pay out less in dividends than their profit prices will go up   that could change if we were to change our corporate culture and/or tax practices so that firms paid out more in dividends   however for the purposes of your question i think it does n't matter much whether the investor makes money as dividends or capital gains does the 5 7 guess apply only to the us market i did n't write nor read the books in question but most likely that is a global number   the us dominates the global equity market so it 's often a good proxy   however international returns taken together have no less risk and earn no less over long horizons in general   the particular examples you have pointed out are special cases that only apply to a part of the global economy and a particular time period   there are plenty of examples of stock markets and time periods that did much better than the us market to offset your examples is 5 7 a reasonable long term estimate of equity returns equity will always earn more in expectation than risk free securities will   how much more depends on major economic factors   5 7 has been a good estimate for the market risk premium for many many decades stocks should earn this plus whatever the risk free rate is   however that is just an empirical observation not a rule   it can change   some day technological progress could slow down or stop we could run out of important resources in a way that we ca n't compensate for our population permanently could stop growing aliens could invade etc   down the road it is certainly possible for expected equity returns to go down and never go back up again   this would result from a permanent global economic shift that i think would be pretty obvious   that is you would n't have to look at stock prices to know it was happening

littleadv 's first comment check the note is really the answer but your issue is   every mortgage i 've had over 10 in my lifetime allows early principal payments the extra principal can only be applied at the same time as the regular payment think of it this way only at that moment is there no interest owed if a week later you try to pay toward only principal the system will not handle it pretty simple extra principal with the payment due in fact any mortgage i 've had that offered a monthly bill or coupon book will have that very line extra principal by coincidence i just did this for a mortgage on my rental i make these payments through my bank 's billpay service i noted the extra principal in the notes section of the virtual check but again the note will explicitly state if there 's an issue with prepayments of principal the larger issue is that your friend wishes to treat the mortgage like a bi weekly the bank expects the full amount as a payment and likely has no obligation to accept anything less than the full amount given my first comment above here is the plan for your friend to do 99 of what she wishes tell her there 's nothing magic about bi weekly it 's a budget clever way to send the money but over a year it 's simply paying 108 of the normal payment if she wants to burn the mortgage faster tell her to add what she wishes every month even $ 10 it all adds up   final note there are two schools of thought to either extreme a pay the mortgage off as fast as you can no debt is the goal and b the mortgage is the lowest rate you 'll ever have on borrowed money pay it as slow as you can and invest any extra money i accept and respect both views for your friend and first group i 'm compelled to add be sure to deposit to your retirement account 's matched funds to gain the entire match $ 1 can pay toward your 6 mortgage or be doubled on deposit to $ 2 in your 401(k if available and pay off all high interest debt first this should stand to reason but i 've seen people keep their 18 card debt while prepaying their mortgage

although i do n't think you need to factor in risk tolerance to get the probabilities i agree with joetaxpayer that you will need to factor in risk tolerance in order to make a practical decision about what to do   in fact i think that to make a practical decision you will need more than the specific probability you ask for you in the question rather you would like to see the complete probability distribution of possible outcomes in other words it 's not enough to know that there is a 51 chance that investing will outperform paying down debt   you actually need to know much it outperforms when it does outperform and how much it underperforms when it underperforms   as joetaxpayer 's comment suggests you might not choose to make an investment that had a 99 chance of outperforming debt payment by 1 and a 1 chance of underperforming by 99 i think it possible to address these questions by doing simulations   this can be done even with a spreadsheet but more flexibly with simple programming   essentially you can create some kind of probabilistic model of the various factors e.g. chance that your investment will go up or down and see what actually happens how often you lose a lot of money lose a little money gain a little money or gain a lot of money   then based on that you can consult your inner spirit animal to decide whether the probability distribution of possible gains outweighs that of possible losses

if you are struggling with debt and can not realistically pay your debts off with your current level of income these businesses offer for a fee to negotiate with your debt providers a sum that you can realistically afford to pay the debt providers will consider the offer because they would rather get some money back rather than nothing as these are usually unsecured loans for you it can be a better deal than going bankrupt or trying to struggle endlessly to pay off something you ca n't afford to pay off note that even though you wo n't be bankrupt you will be treated by lenders very similar to being bankrupt in other words it will be very hard for you to get new loans in the near future

this article is misleading in it 's of its findings it does have a control group which is a good start but the findings are based on call center employees whose functions are almost perfectly suited for remote work in a way we already knew this because of how much call center work is outsourced and outside of provincial management in other words most companies do n't bother housing customer service call centers at company headquarters let 's see them try to replicate those results with other industries    treating the ability to work from home as a panacea is just as foolish as believing that workers ca n't ever be remote the truth is that individual personalities and more importantly an individual 's work functions are better suited for remote work than others and it takes good management to understand why they take the strategy they take with regards to remote work    all in all the study might be a good case study for encouraging remote work among call center employees but any further of that for other industries is going to be a baseless claim influenced by personal agendas

many people assume that if the price of something is $ 10 and they have 1,000 of that thing they should expect to be able to sell them for something around $ 10,000   such an assumption may hold much of the time but it does n't always   worse the cases where it fails to hold are often those where it would be relied upon most heavily   such an assumption should thus be considered dangerous in a liquid market the quantity of a something that people would be willing to buy at something close to the market price will be large relative to the quantity that people would seek to sell in the short term   if at some moment in time one person in the market was willing to immediately buy 500 shares at $ 9.98 and another was willing to immediately buy 750 at $ someone seeking to sell 1,000 shares could immediately receive $ for them selling 500 to the first person and 500 to the second who would then be ready to buy 250 more from the first person who was willing to sell for $   such behavior would be in line with what many people 's assumptions in an illiquid market however the quantity of something that people would be willing to buy near market price could be surprisingly low   this is more often a problem in the marketplace of things like collectibles than of stocks but the same thing can happen in the stock market   if there 's one potential buyer for a stock who thinks it 's overpriced but has potential and would be worth $ 9.50 but that person only has $ 950 to spend and nobody else thinks the stock would be worth more than $ then until people sold a total of 100 shares the price would be $ 9.50 but after that the price would drop instantly to $ 0.02   there would be no of the fall   if the person with 1,000 shares was first in line he 'd get to sell 100 shares for $ 950 to the aforementioned seller but would be unable to get more than $ 18 for the remaining 900 a major danger with markets is that markets which are perceived as liquid attract people to the buying side while those which are seen as illiquid people   the danger in the latter is obvious having people flee a seemingly illiquid market will reduce its liquidity further but the former is just as bad   having people flock to a market because of its perceived liquidity will increase its liquidity but can also create a false price floor causing demand to appear much stronger than it actually is   unless real demand increases to match the false price floor the people who buy at the higher price will never be able to recoup their investment

when obama took office the yearly deficit was $ 1.6 trillion   when he left office it was only $ 600 billion   yes the total debt continued to increase because he never got the deficit down to zero like the last democratic president clinton did but he made a lot of progress   in fact the only time we 've seen the yearly deficit decrease is when a democrat is in the white house   unfortunately trump seems determined to reverse that trend   he wants a tax cut a wall which he now demands congress pay for a roughly 10 increase in the military budget and a $ 1 trillion dollar infrastructure spend fest   odds are the next democratic president will have to start digging us out of that hole

if you have doubts about the long term prospects at your employer or jobs in your area you may want to keep the option of moving to find a new job open while you save up for a larger down payment on a house   while there are insurance products out there that claim to cover your mortgage they often have loopholes which make them difficult to collect on insurance companies are in business to make money and premiums are high when it 's likely that people will try to collect splitting those premiums into your mortgage and your own self insured unemployment fund i.e. an emergency fund in a money market bank account will usually be a better deal as always make sure you have term life insurance for a family and long term disability insurance just in case something really bad happens in the near term buying a home is a better financial decision when you know you 'll be in an area for at least 5 years saving until you have 20 down on place that you can afford to pay off in 15 years even if you take a 30 year loan will be a lot cheaper and less stressful

that 's not what he 's saying at all   basically most of his argument 4 of 6 points is the connection between bond prices and equity prices it 's not particularly interesting but it definitely does n't always apply either if bond yields fall then so too should equity earnings yields if spreads remain relatively constant i.e. higher equity prices additionally if bond yields are low then any future equity growth gets capitalized at a much higher value because discount rates are much lower again not particularly insightful   the two interesting comments were about oil and cash as a of assets at financial institutions both of these are likely linked to falling or low rates above because banks ca n't invest profitably at low rates and hence hold cash and equivalents instead and oil prices are more likely to fall in a low or falling inflation environment implied by the low rates or fed tightening   really i think he s 's saying something more obvious but not necessarily trivial which is if one asset class goes up so too is another related one

personally i keep two regular checking accounts at different banks   one gets a direct deposit totaling the sum of my regular monthly bills and a prorated provision for longer term regular bills like semi annual car insurance premiums   i leave a buffer in the account to account for the odd expensive electrical bill or rate increase or whatever   one gets a direct deposit of the rest which i then allocate to savings and spending it makes sense to me to separate off regular planned expenses rent mortgage utility bills insurance premiums from spending money because it lets me put the basics of my life on autopilot   an added benefit is i have a checking account in the event something happens to one of them   i do n't keep significant amounts of money in either account and do n't give transfer access to the savings accounts that store the bulk of my money   i wear a tinfoil hat when it comes to automatic bank transfers and account access it does n't make sense to me to keep deposits separate from spending it makes less sense to me to spend off of a savings account

it really depends on what your goals are   if your intent is to benefit the charity i 'm sure that they would tell you that the sooner you give them the money the better if they think that the money would do them more good invested then spent they will invest it   the money you have sitting in your charitable account does n't benefit anyone until you give it away it really does n't benefit you either you take your tax deduction when you contribute and it is really out of your hands at this point   the only reason i could see for using a charitable account this way is if you do n't know who you want to give money to if this is the case you can contribute money to your charitable account now and take the tax deduction now and wait to identify a worthy charity later   but if i were you i would n't wait too long to find someone to give the money to there are lots of good organizations that would do a lot of good with that money and the sooner they get it the better if you skip the charitable account and donate directly to them on a regular basis you can experience the joy of partnering with a charity to help people if you decide in the future to switch to a different charity then you do so waiting until the right time to donate does n't really do anyone any good

the reason is that although the american economy is functioning normally mortgage rates are stupid low and are below a prudent expectation of long term 30 year rates of return in the market    i manage endowments so i say prudent in the context of endowment investment which is the picture of caution and subject to law the p being prudent     what 's more there are tax benefits   yes you pay 15 long term capital gains tax on investment income   but your mortgage interest is tax deductible at your tax bracket rate of 25 28 or 33 this being the tax you would pay on your next dollar of earned income   and in the early years of a mortgage mortgage payments are nearly 100 interest   so even if it 's a wash you gain $ 10k in the market but pay $ 10k in mortgage interest you pay $ 1500 tax on the gains but the interest deduction tax by $ 2800 so you are still $ 1300 ahead    tldr the government pays us to do this

i would not concede your money to your dad if he is really you and we need much more detail to tell   this is the first lesson in life that actually following up on wrong things will save you thousands of dollars throughout your adulthood   it is really easy to turn the other way and be out a few thousand dollars   then the hospital you and you let it go and so on   follow up it is your money the laws behind this are pretty cut and dry   basically if you put money into one account and only your money was touching the account then it is your money   as a minor this is an expectation and once your turn 18 in the us you have a right to your money   that is given that the money was in the account at 18 so if your dad truly did not touch the account and withdraw the money before you turned 18 it is cut and dry   if your dad took money out before 18 or added his own money to the account it gets rather fuzzy since it is easy for dad to say that i took money out for your expenses as for this being nuclear as keshlam suggests he is right   his advice is fine but sets you up for people taking advantage of your throughout your life especially your family   in fact the situation is already nuclear but you were the only thing the bomb hit    so talk to your dad   explain that you will have to go and file a small claims trial if he does not agree to give you the money   if your situation is already over the top i would bring the paperwork with you filled out   a person at your local clerk 's office will help you find the right forms you on the other hand better weigh this conversation   we internet peoples are only hearing one side of the story   we do not understand your situation at your home   we do n't understand who pays for your car gas clothes and room and board   you are 18 so there is no obligation for parents to pay for these things    if i had an 18 year old that had 3 k in the bank under my name and they had n't helped around the house in a year did n't buy their car had a poor attitude and so on i would probably have the same action as your dad   yea it 's your money but is it really   when i was 18 i bought all my clothes bought my car bought my gas insurance and so on   i paid for my toothpaste   if this is where you are at and you help out around the house like an adult would then you have solid ground to stand on if not i would laugh if i were your dad   my first thought would be you want your money that is fine   but you are paying rent   car is gone get your own   you would be paying for everything   but you would have your money   so you have some pros and cons to weigh here and taking the money could cost you a ton of money in the future   however if your dad is just being a pure jerk i kind of doubt this but who knows then you have an obligation to fight for what is yours note that the end goal of any meeting like this in your life should n't be court   it should be an agreement so that the right action is taken and both parties are happy   it could be very well that your dad would be happy with something that has nothing to do with the money   also there are people with really really bad situations at their homes   a controlling parent is a pretty good bad situation and an easy one to solve at 18 move out   if you do n't want to move out then accept your family members not complain about them   no matter how controlling your dad is your question of teenager   i am sure you are n't that bad and i am sure your dad is n't that bad and another note   in no way shape or form am i suggesting you drop the money issue   there is nothing worse than not talking about it even if you think your dad will kick you out of the house   resentment building up in yourself or family is the worst possible thing   this needs to be dealt with

your asset mix should reflect your own risk tolerance   whatever the ideal answer to your question it requires you to have good timing not once but twice let me offer a personal example in 2007 the s&p hit its short term peak at or so as it tanked in the crisis a coworker shared with me that he went to cash on the way down selling out at about 1100 at the bottom or so i his brilliance sarcasm here and as it passed 1300 just 2 years later again mentions how he must be thrilled he doubled his money he admitted he was still in cash done with stocks so he was worse off than had he held on to his pre crash assets for sake of disclosure my own mix at the time was 100 stock that 's not a recommendation just a reflection of how my wife and i were invested   we retired early and after the 2013 excellent year moved to a mix closer to at any time a crisis hits and we have 5 6 years spending money to let the market recover if a long term decline occurs social security kicks in for us in 8 years   if my intent was n't 100 clear i 'm suggesting your long term investing should always reflect your own risk tolerance not some short term gut feel that disaster is around the corner

this sounds very like disguised employment you act like an employee of the company but your official relationship with them is as a contractor you gain none of the protection you get from being an employee and this may make you cheaper less risky and more desirable for the company who is hiring you   depending on your country you may also pay corporation tax rather than income tax which may represent a very significant saving also the company hiring you may not have to pay paye national insurance stakeholder pension etc this arrangement is normal and legal providing you genuinely are acting as a subcontractor however if you are behaving as an employee desk at the company company email have to work specific hours in a specific location no ability to subcontract etc you may be classified as a disguised employee in the uk it used to be common practice for highly paid employees to set up shell companies to avoid tax this will now get you into hot water google it sounds like your relationship in this case is directly with the recruiter you will have to consider if the recruiter is acting as your employer or if you remain a genuinely independent agent the duration of your contract with the recruiter will have a bearing on this in the uk there are a whole series of tests for disguised employment this is a good arrangement provided you go in with your eyes open and an awareness of the legislation   however you should absolutely check the rules that apply in your country before entering into this agreement you could potentially be very badly indeed

it would seem that the best method of bank robbery involves an inside man or woman someone in the bank who can provide information about where the largest amount of cash is and when to hit the bank $ 20,000 does not seem to be worth the risk of jail time i 'd say anything south of $ 100,000 per bank robber probably would n't be worth it and getting that amount of cash would require more than a simple walk in pull a gun empty a register robbery    the trick would either be proving an iron clad for the inside person or the group of robbers collectively contributing to the cost of that person disappearing at the very least that individual should get the largest share of the score    escape is undoubtedly the biggest issue one would need immediate transportation from the scene of the crime which could leave the area then be dumped fully for prints dna etc then the group would all go their separate ways    regardless i do n't think it 's worth the risk or the effort first off when you rob a bank the greedy bankers does n't lose the money it 's paid by the fdic which is founded by taxpayers so what you 're doing is taking money that might otherwise be spent on social services for people who need them moreover it 's expensive and time consuming to launder large amounts of money if you manage to get $ 120,000 out of a robbery which is hugely optimistic that number would take years and a significant fraction of the take just to clean for personal use and the risk of not only prison but possibly death seems rather extreme when compared to the admittedly more dull alternative of finding and holding down career    i think there are probably more efficient criminal methods of obtaining large quantities of money wealth too illegal narcotics for example are a $ 300 billion a year industry while it 's not the easiest business to get into one the potential for someone who is n't just some moron off the street to climb the cartel ladder could be significant and could lead to a high income there are significant risks of course and there 's a serious moral question as to whether selling illegal drugs is acceptable or not but if you 're morally flexible or have the opinion that illegal narcotics are not something that should be prohibited it could work    and there 's always money in the banana stand

it seems that you 're asking for a legal tax advice and i vote to close the question as off topic for that this is not the place but on the second thought i will share some of the ideas i have provided of course that you will not consider them as any sort of tax advice whatsoever and will not rely on it for any tax planning without verifying with a licensed professional taking 401k money out just like that means that you are going to pay your taxes on that money plus additional 10 penalty as @joetaxpayer said this rarely makes economic sense however taking 401 k money out to pay your medical bills which would otherwise be deductible pay attention to the nuances does n't trigger the penalty it looks like in your case you might unfortunately have a chance to use this provision another case when you can withdraw money without penalty is disability which according to what you describe is unfortunately a situation you 're very likely to find yourself in also you can withdraw funds as income for a substantial period of time and under certain conditions it will not be subject to the 10 penalty of course leaving it to the beneficiaries as mentioned by others is another and very valid option see publication 575 for specific details and be sure to consult a tax professional before doing anything

peace of mind is the key to your question just before the us housing bust of 2007 i had someone try to convince me to take all the equity from my house which was overvalued in an overheated market the idea was to put that money in the stock market for a bigger return than the interest on the house many people did that and found themselves out of jobs as the economy crashed unfortunately they could n't sell their homes because they owed more than they were worth i never lost a night of sleep over the money i did n't make in the stock market i did manage to trade up to a house twice the size by buying another when the housing market bottomed out but waiting for a market recovery to sell the smaller house the outcome of my good fortune is a very nice house with no mortgage worth about 1/3 of my total net worth that 's probably a larger percentage than most money managers would recommend but it is steadily decreasing because now all the money that would go to a mortgage payment instead gets deposited in retirement accounts and it still has 30 years to grow before i start drawing it down i almost do n't remember the burden of a mortgage hanging over my head each month almost

i think we 'd need to look at actual numbers to see where you 're running into trouble i 'm also a little confused by your use of the term unexpected expenses you seem to be using that to describe expenses that are quite regular that occur every x months and so are totally expected but assuming this is just some wording here 's the thing start out by taking the amount of each expense divided by the number of months between occurrences this is the monthly cost of each expense add all these up this is the amount that you should be setting aside every month for these expenses once you get a base amount set up so to take a simple example say you have to pay property taxes of $ 1200 twice a year so that 's $ 1200 every 6 months = $ 200 per month also say you have to pay a water bill once every 3 months that 's typically $ 90 so $ 90 divided by 3 = $ 30 assuming that was it in the long term you 'd need to put aside $ 230 per month to stay even i say in the long term because when you 're just starting you need to put aside an amount sufficient that your balance wo n't fall below zero the easiest way to do this is to just set up a chart where you start from zero and add in this example $ 230 each month and then subtract the amount of the bills when they will hit do this for some reasonable time in the future say one year find the biggest negative balance if you can add this amount to get started you 'll be safe if not add this amount divided by the number of months from now until it occurs and make that a temporary addition to your deposits check if you now are safely always positive if not repeat the process for the next biggest negative for example let 's say the property tax bills are april and october and the water bills are february may august and november then your chart would look like this the biggest negative is in april so you have to add $ in the first 4 months or $ per month let 's say $ 93 that would give now you stay at least barely above water for the whole year you could extend the chart our further but odds are the exact numbers will change next year and you 'll have to recalculate anyway the more irregular the expenses the more you   will build up just before the big expense hits but that 's the whole point of saving for these right if a $ 1200 bill is coming next week and you do n't have close to $ 1200 saved up in the account where is the money coming from if you have enough spare cash that you can just take the $ 1200 out of what you would have spent on lunch tomorrow then you do n't need this sort of account

thanks for the great response   the example with calculus is perfect group a is some students who will never ever get it no matter how much you teach and train them   as you know group b is some students who excel in calculus just by reading the book with no need for a professor to explain or teach them they probably exceed in understanding beyond the course objectives   group c most will be in the middle struggle and with efforts of the professor if the class is not more than 10 15 students and their own efforts they will eventually understand some will get c some will get b and few will get a.   which group will succeed with their career if it requires calculus   gt the messed up part is that professors are never formally taught to teach    true i was an professor while studying for my master 's in the end of the semester students had to evaluate their professors i got the 2nd best results after another part time professor and way above all tenured professors are you surprised by the way i was teaching introductory classes and i was working for the department i was teaching for as a research intern   as for professors who do n't know how to teach this was not an issue in the past and was not needed in the past i.e. it 's because of past traditions    in the past the role of the professor was not so much to teach in the sense and the way teachers teach today in elementary school attend and dance around every student 's special needs and go in a slow pace to accommodate make sure nobody is left behind   the role of the professor in the past being a real expert and full of knowledge far and beyond what is required was to plan and sequence what has to be taught in a pace that will meet the full agenda of the class no concern is given for students who ca n't keep the pace also the role was to challenge the students test then and answer any question they may have this includes debates over any topic related to the class material   gt i think the vast majority of work related skills that people develop are learned on the job   absolutely true or let 's put it this way the best school was is and will be a master and an apprentice which is somewhat still done in germany and is the only way medical students learn because no choice the life of others is in their hands    by the way masters have zero patience for who do n't show a promise masters also have little talent in teaching but masters have long term 1000 patience to show again and again correct again and again demand explain and challenge their   to the point the masters actually do n't do much work and instead just teach in their own special way

i think the dividend fund may not be what you re looking for you mentioned you want growth not income but i think of dividend stocks as income stocks not growth they pay a dividend because these are established companies that do not need to invest so much in capex anymore so they return it to shareholders in other words they are past their growth phase these are what you want to hold when you have a large nest egg you are ready to retire and just want to make a couple percent a year without having to worry as much about market fluctuations the etf you mentioned and other small caps are i think what you are after i recently made a post here about the difference between index funds and active funds the difference is very small that is in any given year many active etfs will beat them many wo nt it depends entirely on the market conditions at the time under certain conditions the small caps will outperform the s&p definitely however under other conditioned such as global growth slowdown they are typically the first to fall based on your comments like how you mentioned you do nt want to sell i think index funds should make up a decent size portion of your portfolio they are the safest bet long term for someone who just wants to buy and hold that s not to say they need be all do a mixture diversification is good as time goes on do nt be afraid to add bond etfs either this will protect you during downturns as bond prices typically rise under slow growth conditions and sometimes even under normal conditions like last year when tlt beat the s&p

there is free employer money on both sides of the tax fence for some employees    on the pretax side your employer may provide you a match   if so invest the maximum to get 100 of the match    on the after tax side many companies offers a 15 discount on espp plans and a one year hold   my wife has such an employer   the one year hold is fine because it allows us to be taxed at long term capital gains if the stock goes up which is lower than our current income bracket   after creating a seasoned pool of stocks that we could sell after the one year hold we are then able to sell the same number of stocks purchased each month   this provides a 17.6 guaranteed gain on a monthly basis   how much would you purchase if you had a guaranteed 17.6 return   our answer is 15 our maximum allowed the other trick is that while the employer is collecting the money you will purchase the stock at the lowest day of the period   you will usually sell for even more than the purchase price unless the day purchased was the lowest day of month    the trick is to reinvest the money in tax free investments to balance out the pretax investing   never leave the money in the plan   that is too much risk

demand is also a rule of economics and always exists   it is the advertising marketing efforts that the assumption of economics of perfect information   it is the investors estimation of what the demand will be once consumers have perfect information of the product that creates companies spurs investment and creates jobs to carry out the plan   all of this is based on the idea that the investment of time and money will generate a return   to use a different product as an example there is always demand for food with consumer preference for say pizza   i 'm not creating jobs by sitting on my fat ass at home wanting someone else to make me a pizza and drive it to my doorstep   if there is n't a pizza place i can make myself a sandwich and no jobs are created   it was the investors who there was a hidden demand for like me wanting pizza that made the plan for building a pizza place and then investing money which was used to hire employees based on the assumption that the demand existed and my would spend money giving them a return on their investment

bank of america is the worst once i had a joint account with another individual that i had funded out of my account to make payroll    when i found out that he had screwed two other people by stealing the payroll money i decided to disburse it myself and transferred it back to my corporate account on which i was the only signer   he went back to the bank and effected a withdrawal from my account to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars put the money in the joint account and removed me as a signer    the bank would n't give me my money back and i never collected from him   another time i tried to close my sons accounts which were in inactive status   every day for a week they told me they could not close the account until it was active but they were working on making it active   chase could do this in a minute   i finally went to a branch and loudly informed the manager that maybe the bank was insolvent and that i should call the fdic to see why they wo n't release my money   he wanted to take me into his office   i told him loudly i know all about savings and cds i have run deposit operations for a major bank and wrote software to process them   just put a hold on the account write me two cashiers check and offset them with a voucher   you do know how to write a voucher do n't you it 's just a general ledger entry to a account   well he was so he would do anything to get me out of the branch and gave me the cashier 's checks   fuck b of a.

first check out some of the answers on this question oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing when you have determined that you are ready to invest for retirement there are two things you need to consider the investment and the account   these are separate items the investment is what makes your money grow the type of account provides tax advantages and restrictions   generally these can be considered separately for the most part you can do any type of investment in any account briefly here is an overview of some of the main options in your situation the roth ira is what i would recommend this grows tax free and if you need the funds for some reason you can get out what you put in without penalty you can invest up to $ 5500 in your roth ira each year in addition to the above reasons which are true for anybody a roth ira would be especially beneficial for you for three reasons for someone that is closer in age to retirement and in a higher tax bracket now a roth ira is less attractive than it is for you inside your roth ira there are lots of choices you can invest in stocks bonds mutual funds which are simply collections of stocks and bonds bank accounts precious metals and many other things discussing all of these investments in one answer is too broad but my recommendation is this if you are investing for retirement you should be investing in the stock market however picking individual stocks is too risky you need to be diversified in a lot of stocks stock mutual funds are a great way to invest in the stock market   there are lots of different types of stock mutual funds with different strategies and expenses associated with them managed funds actively buy and sell different stocks inside them but have high expenses to pay the managers index funds buy and hold a list of stocks and have very low expenses the conventional wisdom is that in general index funds perform better than managed funds when you take the expenses into account   i hope this overview and these recommendations were helpful if you have any specific questions about any of these types of accounts or investments feel free to ask another question

my broker offers the following types of sell orders i have a strategy to sell half of my position once the accrued value has doubled   i take into account market price dividends and taxes both and taxes on dividends   once the market price exceeds the magic trigger price by 10 i enter a trailing stop order at 10   ideally what happens is that the stock keeps going up and the trailing stop keeps following it and that goes on long enough that accrued dividends end up paying for the stock   what happens in reality is that the stock goes up some goes down some then the order gets cancelled because the company announces dividends or something dumb like that then i get into trouble trying to figure out how to re enter the order maintaining the unrealized gain in the history of the trailing stop order   i screwed up and entered the wrong type of order once and sold stock i did n't want to lets look at an example a number of years ago i bought some jnj a hundred shares at   accumulated dividends are   my spreadsheet tells me the double price is and double + 10 is   so a while ago jnj exceeded and i entered a trailing stop 10 order to sell 50 shares of jnj   the activation price was   since then the price has gone up and down   it reached a high of setting the activation price at   then jnj announced a dividend and my broker cancelled the trailing stop order   i 've re entered a stop market order at   i 've also entered an alert for $ if the alert gets triggered i 'll cancel the market stop and enter a new trailing stop

in the united states if someone refers to the interest rate especially if heard on news or talk radio in particular they are almost always referring to the federal funds rate a rate set forth and maintained by the united states federal reserve the fed for short if the fed opts to raise or lower this rate it subsequently effects all interest rates whether by being directly connected in a chain of loans   or by market demand through the efficiency of financial markets in the case of bond auctions the fomc meets eight times each year to determine the target for the federal funds rate   the federal funds rate effects all interest rates because it is the originating rate of interest on all loans in the chain of loans because of this significance as a benchmark for all interest rates it is the rate most commonly referred to as interest rate when used alone that is why other rates are specified by what they actually are e.g. mortgage rates 10 year 30 year for 10 year treasury and 30 year treasury bond yields respectively savings rate auto rate credit card rate cd rate all rates of interest effected by the originating loan that is the federal funds rate   this is true in the united states but will vary for other countries in general though it will almost always refer to the originating rate for all loans in a given country institution etc   note that bonds have yields that are based on market demand that is in turn based on the federal funds rate it is because of the efficiency of financial markets that the demand and thus the yields are correlated to the federal funds rate

a primary residence can be an admirable investment retirement vehicle for a number of reasons the tax savings on the mortgage are negligible compared to these   a $ 200,000 mortgage might result in a $ 2000 annual savings on your taxes but a $ 350,000 house might easily appreciate $ 20,000 tax free in a good year some reasons to not buy a larger house getting into or out of a house is tremendously expensive and inconvenient   it can make some life changes including retirement more difficult there is no way to diversify a primary residence   you have one investment and you are a hostage to its fortunes   the shopping center down the street goes defunct and its ruins becomes a for criminals and   your next door neighbor is a lunatic or a   a big hurricane hits your county   ha ha now you 're screwed   as they say in the army bend over here it comes again even if nothing bad happens you are paying to enjoy a bigger house whether you enjoy it or not   eating from paper plates sitting on the floor of your enormous empty dining room may be romantic when you 're 27   when you 're 57 it may be considerably less fun speaking for myself both my salary and my investment income have varied wildly and often over my life but my habit of buying and renovating dilapidated homes in neighborhoods has brought me six figures a year year after year after year tl;dr the mortgage interest deduction is the smallest of many reasons to invest in residential real estate but there are good reasons not to

i completely agree with @littleadv in favor of using the credit card and dispute resolution process but i believe there are more important details here related to consumer protection since 1968 us citizens are protected from credit card fraud limiting the out of pocket loss to $ 50 if your card is lost stolen or otherwise used without your permission that means the bank ca n't make you pay more than $ 50 if you report unauthorized activity and nicely many credit cards these days go ahead and waive the $ 50 too so you might not have to pay anything other than the necessary time and phone calls of course many banks offer a $ 50 cap or no fees at all for fraudulent charges my bank once happily resolved some bad charges for me at no loss to me but banks are under no obligation to shield debit card customers from fraud if you read the fine print on your debit card account agreement you may find some vague promises to resolve your dispute but probably nothing saying you can not be held liable the bank is not going to lose money on you if they are unable to reverse the charges now a personal story i once had my credit card used to buy $ 3,000 in stereo equipment at a store i had never heard of in a state i have never visited the bank notified me of the surprising charges and i was immediately able to begin the fraud report but it took months of calls before the case was accepted and the charges reversed so yes there was no money out of my pocket but i was completely unable to use the credit card and every month they kept on piling on more finance fees and late payment charges and such and i would have to call them again and explain again that the charges were disputed finally after about 8 months in total they accepted the fraud report and reversed all the charges lastly i want to mention one more important tool for preventing or limiting loss from online purchases disposable one time use credit card numbers at least a few credit card providers citibank bank of america discover offer you the option on their websites to generate a credit card number that charges your account but under the limits you specify including a maximum amount and expiration date with one of these disposable numbers you can pay for a single purchase and be confident that even if the number were stolen in transit or the merchant a fraud they do n't have your actual credit card number and they can never charge you again i have not yet seen this option for debit card customers but there must be some banks that offer it since it saves them a lot of time and trouble in pursuing so in short if you pay with a credit card number you will not ever have to pay more than $ 50 for fraudulent charges even better you may be able to use a disposable one time use credit card number to further limit the chances that your credit is misused here 's to happy and safe

your inference in 1 is incorrect   the million dollars he has contributed is going to be part of the assets of the fund   this is common practice and is a way for the founder to express confidence that the fund will make money   he wants you to come up with a model that he can then use to trade those assets   presumably he will give you some money if he uses your model and it works regarding 2 there are lots of ways of getting data   sometimes you can buy it directly from the exchange   you can also buy from vendors like   there are lots of such vendors   since he makes a big deal about saying it 's expensive i 'm assuming he is talking about data at relatively high frequency not daily which would be cheap   stock data is still not bad   complete us data would be a few thousand dollars maybe 20 k at the most   for someone sitting at home with no capital that 's a lot of money but for a hedge fund it 's nothing as an institutional investor your broker will give you a data feed that will provide all prices in real time but not historically   if he 's been in operation a while he could have just saved the prices as they came out of the pipe   i do n't think that 's the case here though based on how young he is and how little money is involved in short he paid for some data and has encrypted it in such a way that he can legally share it for free   supposedly his method preserves the structure so that you could write a trading model based on the encrypted data and it would work on real data   once you have a good trading model you sell it to him and he will use it to trade his million dollars and whatever other money he is able to gather

one important issue that has yet to be covered is the cost to you in terms of paperwork lost time and phone calls that you have to make to claim the insurance   such insurance claims often are very low priority on their customer service queues for obvious reasons since they have already made the sale therefore you might have to spend up to a few hours of your time calling or writing emails to claim the warranty which may often not be much   therefore many people end up not claiming the warranty during the hassle much like non scam mail in rebates more often than not you would either forget to or decide it is not worth your time to claim the warranty before buying such policies other than the obvious cost benefit calculations you should also take this additional factor into account    therefore many people end up not claiming the warranty during the hassle much like non scam mail in rebates more often than not you would either forget to or decide it is not worth your time to claim the warranty before buying such policies other than the obvious cost benefit calculations you should also take this additional factor into account

you did borrow money for the downpayment   when you apply for a mortgage loan on your new home you will be required to list all your assets and all your liabilities you must disclose the first mortgage as well as the second mortgage on your current condo as well as the monthly payment on each of these loans   if you took out the second mortgage five years ago you can truthfully say that you have not taken out any loans within the past year to get cash for the down payment when you apply for a mortgage for purchasing your new house but what the lender will be looking at is can   the applicants current income support monthly payments of    $ 1000 for the first mortgage on the condo plus $ 300 for the second    mortgage on the condo plus $ 1500 for the proposed mortgage on the    new house you might argue that you will be selling that condo soon or will be renting it out and that the rental income will cover the mortgage payments on the condo but will the lender give much to this the condo may not sell easily you might not be able to find a tenant right away or be able to rent the condo at a high enough rental to cover the costs etc if you simply save money from your current extra cash flow and use that to make the down payment the lender will be pondering the question can   the applicants current income support monthly payments of    $ 1000 for the mortgage on the condo plus $ 1500 for the proposed mortgage on the new house which deal will the lender be happier with if you are uncomfortable saving your extra cash flow in a savings account or cd or investing it in stocks and/or bonds until you need the money for the down payment on your new house put that money in a sock under your mattress and do n't smoke in bed

bank products have been pretty common with tax refunds as well and they are also being heavily scrutinized for the same reasons   refund anticipation loans have been outlawed for future tax seasons due to lack of consumer protection   what is a bank product you might ask   rather than waiting 7 14 days for the a direct deposit from the irs a lot of places like block and jackson would offer a bank product to get you money quicker   for this service they charge a fee usually $ which is grossly overpriced for how little work it takes but if your refund is several thousand dollars you may not care   a refund anticipation loan was the most predatory bank product as it was an advance on your loan for the amount your expected refund   however if there were any errors in your return and the irs decided your refund was less than what your tax preparer calculated it to be you were stuck with paying back the advance amount leaving you to foot the bill for whatever errors your preparer may have made   these loans also had very high interest rates since usually the people that wanted were also the same people that rely upon cash advances   there are also electronic refund checks which ironically are paper checks for the consumer not electronic deposits direct deposits and prepaid debit cards   despite the fact that these same methods of refund payments are offered by the irs themselves preparers and banks alike sold these to collect fees for essentially no work   i 'm not sure how similar these bank products for student loans are but i wanted to shed some light on them anyways   regardless of how badly you need money do not ever accept money through a bank product   if it benefited you more banks and preparers would not offer these   source   telemarketing at a tax preparation software company

there is no segregation of amounts that you have in rollover traditional iras when it comes to figuring out how much of your basis is being converted from   your traditional ira into a roth ira    so yes you will lose the benefit of being able to make nondeductible contributions to your traditional ira each year and rolling them over into a roth ira without tax consequences since your   401k amount may be   substantially more than the $ 5 k basis you create each year converting the 401k amount into a traditional ira will mean that most of the money converted to the roth ira is pre tax money and so you end up paying tax on most of the converted amount

for bonds bought at par the face value of the bond like buying a cd for $ 1000 the payment it makes is the same as yield you pay $ 1000 and get say $ 40 per year or 4 if you buy it for more or less than that $ 1000 say $ 900 there 's some math not for me i use a finance calculator to tell you your return taking the growth to maturity into account i.e. the extra $ 100 you get when you get the full $ 1000 back obviously for bonds you care about whether the or municipality will pay you back at all and then you care about how much you 'll make when then do in that order for stocks the picture is different as some companies give no dividend but reinvest all profits think berkshire hathaway on the other hand many people believe that the dividend is important and choose to buy stocks that start with a nice yield a $ 30 stock with a $ dividend is 3.3 yield sounds like not much but over time you expect the company to grow increase in value and increase its dividend 10 years hence you may have a $ 40 stock and the dividend has risen to $ 1.33 now it 's 4.4 of the original investment and you sit on that gain as well

in theory you can buy shares directly from someone else who owns them in practise if the stock is listed on an exchange they are unlikely to own them directly they are likely to own them through an intermediary you will have to pay fees to that intermediary to transfer the shares to your name there are thousands of small companies owned by the guy who started it and a few other investors you can buy stock in that kind of company directly from the existing owners as long as they are willing to sell you some it 's a super high risk investment strategy though this is the kind of deal that happens on dragons den

as a venezuelan who used to buy usd i believe there is not better explanation than the one given to someone who actually lives and works here in venezuela back in 1998 when took the presidency we had a good economy fast forward 10 years and you could see how poor management corruption and   communist measurements had havoc in our economy it was because most of the money usd coming in venezuela were not invested here but instead given away to countries like cuba remember communism lasts while you have money back then we had an oil barrel going over 100 $ and crazy amounts of money were coming in the country however little to no money was invested in the country itself that is why some of the richest people with bank account in swiss are who stole huge amounts of oil money   i know this is a lot to take in but all of this led to venezuelan economy being the worst in the american continent and because there is not enough money inside the country to satisfy the inner market people would pay to have anything that is bought abroad you have to consider that only a very small amount of people can actually buy usd here in venezuela back in 2013 i was doing it i could buy about 80 usd month with my monthly income however that 's nearly impossible for about 99 of   to illustrate minimum wage = 10.000 month black market exchange rate as of january 2016 = per = usd    < < < that is what about 50 of earn every month that 's why this happens   the guy is holding a huge stack of money of the highest venezuelan note which he got from exchanging only 100 usd i am a computer science engineer the monthly income for someone like me is about so that is about 34 $ a month oh dear so finally answering your question q why do people buy usd even at this unfavorable rate a there are many reasons but being the main 2 the following inflation in venezuela is crazy high the inflation from 2014 2015 was which means that having the venezuelan currency in your bank account makes no sense in two weeks you wo n't be able to buy half of the things you used to with the same amount of money a huge amount of dream with living abroad me included why you ask well sir it is certain that life in this country is not the best i hope you can understand better why people in 3rd world countries and crappy economies buy usd even at an unfavorable rate the last question was q why would venezuela want to block the sale of dollars a centralized currency management is an economic measure that should last 6 months tops this was argentina 's case in 2013 but at this point reverting that would take quite a few years   however 's wikipedia link explains that very well regards

to summarize your starting situation you want to possible paths no small business get a job invest the 300 k in safe liquid investments then move the maximum amount each year into your retirement accounts depending on which company you work for that could include 401 k regular or roth deductible ira roth ira the amount of money you can transfer is a function of the options they give you how much they match and the amount of income you earn for the 401 k you will invest from your paycheck but pull an equal amount from the remainder of the if you are married you can use the same procedure for your spouse 's account you current income funds any vacations or because you will not need to put additional funds into your retirement plan by your late 30 's the 300 k will now be fully invested in retirement account unfortunately you ca n't touch much of it without paying penalties until you are closer to age 60 each year before semi retirement you will have to invest some of your salary into non retirement accounts to cushion you between age 40 and age 60 invest start a business take a chunk of the   300 k and decide that in x years you will use it to start a small business this chunk of money must be liquid and invested safely so that you can use it when you want to you also do n't want to invest it in investments that have a risk of loss take the remaining funds and invest it as described in the no small business section you will completely convert funds to retirement funds earlier because of a smaller starting amount hopefully the small business creates enough income to allow you to continue to fund retirement or semi retirement but it might not comment regarding 5 year rules roth ira you have to remain invested in the roth ira for 5 years otherwise your withdrawal is penalized investing in stocks if your time horizon is short then stocks are too volatile if it drops just before you need the money it might not recover in time final advice get a financial adviser that will lay out a complete plan for a fixed fee they will discuss investment options types not particular funds they will also explain the tax implications of investing in various retirement accounts and how that will impact your semi retirement plans review the plan every few years as tax laws change

common sentiment that no investor can consistently beat the market on returns   i guess its more like very few investor can beat the market a vast majority can not do not what evidence exists for or against this obviously we can have a comparison of all investors if we start taking a look at some of the actively managed funds given that fund managers are experts compared to common individual investors if we compare this we can potentially extend it more generically to others most funds beat the markets for few years as you keep increasing the timeline i.e. try seeing 10 year 15 year 20 year return this is easy the data is available you would realize that no fund consistently beat the index few years quite good few years quite bad on average most funds were below market returns especially if one compares on longer terms or 10 20 years hence the perception of course we all know warren buffet has beat the market by leaps and bounds after the initial success people like warren buffet develop the power of self fulfilling prophecy there would be many other individuals

i think the math is wrong note that in scenario 1 you are only out of pocket $ 1000 while in scenario 2 you are out of pocket $ 1250   the contribution and the tax you paid with respect to it a better concept than tax rate is retention rate   this is the fraction of your money that the feds let you keep   and growth factor is the how much the investment grows so in scenario 1 you multiply $ 1000 by the investment growth factor and then by the retirement retention rate and in scenario 2 you multiply the same $ 1000 by the current retention rate and then by the growth factor since in your approximation the two are the same there is no saving

ulip insurance plan ulip is unit linked insurance plan the premium you pay a small part goes towards covering life insurance the balance is invested into stock markets most ulip would give you an option to choose from debt funds 100 safe buy low returns 5 7 or equity high risks returns can be around 15 or a mix of both ulip are not a good way to save money there are quite a few hidden fees that actually reduce the return so notionally even if returns shown are great in effect it is quite less for example the premium you pay in first year say rs 10,000/- rs goes towards commission and say rs 100 goes towards insurance balance rs units are purchased in your account even if these grow by 20 you are still in loss the commissions go down year after year and stop at 5 then there is fund management fees that you do n't get to see there is maintenance fee that is from your balance   thus the entire method of charging is not transparent life insurance from there are broadly 2 types of life insurance plans money back endowment plan the concept here is again same you pay a premium and part of it goes toward insurance the balance invests in safe bonds every year a bonus is declared generally less than bank rate at the end of the plan you get more than what you paid in premium however if you had kept the same in bank fd you would have got more money back so if you die your nominee would get insurance plus bonus if you survive you get all the accumulated bonus pure term plan here the premium is quite less for the sum insured here if you die your nominee would get insurance if you survive you do n't get anything

there may be differences in different contexts but here 's my general understanding rate of return or return on investment is the total gain or loss of an investment divided by the initial investment amount   e.g. if you buy stock for $ 100 and later sell it for $ 120 you have a 20 rate of return   you would have a 20 ror regardless of if you sell it tomorrow or in a year internal rate of return is effectively annualized   it is the annual rate at which each of a series of cashflows is discounted that would give you a net present value of 0   meaning if you spent $ 100 today and in exactly one year you received $ 120 back you would have an irr of 20   if you received the $ 120 back in 6 months your irr would be roughly 40 an irr calculation can include multiple cashflows at various times while ror is in my mind the total net gain or loss relative to the investment irrespective of the time of the cash flows irr is more effective when comparing investments that have different time horizons   spending $ 100 to get $ 120 tomorrow is much better from an irr perspective than getting $ 120 two years from now since you could take that $ 20 gain and invest it for the rest of the two years

yep you 're single you 're possibly still a dependent on your parent 's taxes in lieu of rent and you 're finally bringing home bacon instead of bacon bits welcome to the working world let 's say your gross salary is the u.s. median of $ 50,000 with bi weekly checks 26 a year common practice you 're getting $ per paycheck in the 2013 percentage method tax tables here 's how your federal withholding is calculated as a single person paid biweekly federal taxes are computed the amount up to a is taxed at x% then the amount between a and b is taxed at y% so if you make $ c between a and b the tax is + c the amount is included in the base amount for ease of calculation back to our example let 's say you 're getting $ gross wages per check that puts you in the 25 marginal bracket you pay the sum of all lesser brackets which is the base amount of the 25 bracket plus the 25 marginal rate on every dollar that falls within the bracket that 's + .25 = + .25 = + = $ per paycheck the effective tax rate on the total amount as if you were being charged a flat tax is and this is just for the federal income tax add to this ma state income taxes 5.25 flat tax fica aka medicare 1.45 flat and aka social security 6.2 up to a wage base that $ 50k does n't even approach and your effective tax rate on each dollar you earn is + 5.25 + 1.45 + 6.2 = this does n't include any state unemployment taxes that may be withheld separately but as the rate i come up with is pretty darn close to what you 've figured meaning i slightly overestimated your gross income and thus your effective tax rate my bet is that 's either employer paid in ma or it 's just part of ma state income tax it gets better at least at the federal level the amount of your state income taxes is tax deductible at the federal level if you itemize your deductions that may not be a factor for you as you 'd have to come up with more than $ of other tax deductible expenses to make itemizing the better option than taking the standard deduction big ticket items are mortgage expenses other than principal payments hospital stays such as for or major accident and state and local taxes such as sales property and income if you can claim yourself as a dependent meaning your parents ca n't then $ 150 of each check $ 3,900 of your annual salary is no longer taxed for federal withholding lowering the amount of money taxed at the 25 marginal rate you effectively save $ biweekly $ annually in taxes get married and file jointly and your spouse her personal exemption and an extra standard deduction amount if you do n't itemize go on your taxes the tax rates for married couples filing jointly are also lower they 're currently calculated or were in 2012 to be the same as if two equal earners were to file separately so if your spouse does n't work your taxes on the single income are calculated at the rates you 'd get if you earned half as much it does n't work out to half the taxes but it is a significant marriage advantage have kids and each one is another little $ 3,900 tax write off it 's nowhere near the cost of having or raising the child but it helps and having kids is n't about the money owning a home making charitable deductions having medical expenses etc are a toss up the magic number in 2013 is $ for a married couple $ for a single person if your mortgage interest insurance premiums property taxes medical expenditures charitable donations any contributions from your take home pay to a tax deferred savings account typically these accounts are paid into by your employer as a pre tax deduction and never show up as taxable income but you could just as easily move money from your take home pay into tax deferred savings and any other tax deductible payments add up to more than 12 large then itemize if not take your standard deduction as a single taxpayer just starting out in life you probably do n't have any of these types of expenditures certainly not enough to give up the sd i did the math on my own taxes in 2012 and was surprised at how little the government actually gets of my paycheck when all 's said and done remember back in the summer of 2012 when everyone was mad at romney for making millions and only paying an effective income tax rate of 14 which was compared to the middle class 's marginal rate of 25 28 well my family of 3 living on a little more than the median income from one earner me taking the married standard deduction three personal exemptions and a little extra for student loan interest paid an effective federal income tax rate of something like 3.5 of course the fica and ss taxes do n't allow any deductions not even for retirement savings so add in the 4.2 ss in 2012 and 1.45 fica and the full federal gimme was more like 9 10

i 'm pretty sure you are do n't actually plan to put £ 120,000 into a zero interest account because when you take inflation into account in 20 years then £ 120,000 wo n't be worth anywhere near that amount   for its value to grow you need the interest rate to exceed the rate of inflation and so paying 20 or even 40 tax on the interest can make the difference between whether being richer and getting poorer

you should try to take out other loans sufficient to pay off your 401(k loan if you can    maybe you can take out a home equity loan   you can also ask your bank about unsecured loans   you should also check the rules for your new employer 's 401(k if you 're rolling over your 401(k   there 's a small possibility that you could take out another loan right now and apply it to the previous loan balance or if you need to wait you could use it to help pay off any temporary loans that were needed to avoid the distribution penalty

yes it is a scam and here is how it will work they will deposit a phony check into the account which will appear to clear you will send money to africa from the account the check will take a while to bounce but it will bounce they will take it back out of your account and may try to prosecute you for a fake check at best your account balance will go negative and you will owe the money back to the bank that you sent the people you sent the money to will vanish

i did receive turbotax 's automatically generated confirmation of successfully completing tax filing electronically the day i did my tax on their web site about 24 to 48 hours after you push the button at turbotax the irs should either confirm or reject the initial check of the tax documents you should return to the turbotax website to make sure the irs has accepted the next review either the confirmation you received when you pushed the button or the information at the turbotax site it should specify when the money would be withdrawn you were given options regarding payment method and date you want to make the payment many people who finish their tax paperwork early but owe money wait until the last day to submit now it is possible to submit paperwork early but specify a date just before the deadline print out or even better save an electronic copy of the information at the turbotax website i have no idea how long it takes the irs to actually pull the money from an account once the day you specified has occurred you have to plan as if the withdraw will happen on the exact date but with millions of tax payers making transactions it may be delayed by a day or two

question is what do we need to do as far as the irs is concerned i    mean we 'll get the money from them and pay it back less than two    months later you 're probably worried about the gift tax since you 're a couple the maximum exclusion amount is calculated like this the reason the pg multiplier stands separate is that gift splitting does require form 709 filed even if no tax is due unless they actually write separate checks for their respective portions so the math shows that you and your wife can get at least $ 28 k from anyone without the need of gift tax to be paid or gift tax return to be filed you can get up to $ 56 k from your parents but the gift splitting may need to be documented on form 709 since you 're in fact talking about a loan you 're going to repay you 'll need to document it with a note and everything and document the repayment if interest is being paid your parents must declare it on their tax return for the year obviously in this case if the loan is properly documented repaid and the interest is declared the irs wo n't even bother claiming it was a gift even if there 's no real interest it should n't be an issue the irs might assign some deemed interest at their rates that would be considered a gift but assuming no other gift transactions between you exist for the year the amount would be miniscule and way below the $ 14 k exclusion level of course as with any tax concern you get here what you paid for for a proper advice talk to a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state

i wonder if these two concepts are compatible or mutually exclusive   the minimum wage should provide a decent living standard above the poverty line we should have as close to zero unemployment as possible   if those two statements are not compatible with each other then i do n't see how prohibiting eligible members of the workforce from an opportunity is at all desirable   yes this would mean that some individuals would be earning less money than it would take to make a decent living but those individuals know who they are we do n't   which means that they have the ability to make choices concerning their lives that we should n't try to anticipate   if minimum wage is not a decent wage for what they need they need to adjust their situation to change that   minimum wage was never intended to be a livable wage only the lowest amount you could pay someone   i would argue that if someone has been stuck earning minimum wage for more than 2 years they 're doing something wrong   either they 're not trying to advance or they 're not looking for a better job

i 'll answer but avoiding discussion of m1 m2 etc too pedantic i do n't believe you are asking about the lifetime of either coins or paper money i think you are referencing the fractional reserve system and how a good portion of the total money supply is created by the banks lending out their deposits in effect creating money my answer to you is that if all loans were simply paid off no mortgages no car loans etc the total money in the system would collapse to some reasonable fraction of what it is today 10 or a bit less this comes from the fact that the reserve requirement for most large banks is 10   i 'm referencing money but not bills or coins think about what you make in a year how much do you touch as paper money for my wife and me it 's no more than a few percent most goes from a direct deposit to online payments so this would be the subject of a different question altogether   let me know if this addresses your question

from investopedia   beating the market is a difficult phrase to analyze it can be used    to refer to two different situations 1 an investor portfolio manager fund or other investment specialist    produces a better return than the market average the market average    can be calculated in many ways but usually a benchmark such as the    s&p 500 or the dow jones industrial average index is a good    representation of the market average if your returns exceed the    percentage return of the chosen benchmark you have beaten the market    congrats to learn more read benchmark your returns with indexes 2 a company 's earnings sales or some other valuation metric is    superior to that of other companies in its industry matching the market i would presume will be generating returns equivalent to the index you are comparing your portfolio with if for a sector industry then it would be the returns generated by the sector industry as an index is more or less a of the market as a whole people tend to use an index

most people will never need to pay federal gift taxes the federal gift taxes start after giving away million over the course of your life this number is adjusted annually for inflation there are only two states that i know of which impose state gift taxes connecticut and minnesota in connecticut you need to start paying taxes if the lifetime value of your gifts exceed two million in minnesota it starts at 1 million   the federal tax is paid for by the person making the gift unless other arrangements are made there is an annual exclusion amount of approximately $ 14,000 you can give up to this amount to any number of recipients and it is not considered taxable therefore when you give $ 100 to someone it is not a taxable event   if you do make a gift to an individual in excess of 14k you 'll need to file a gift tax return irs form 709 when you file form 709 you wo n't need to pay taxes until the million is exceeded instead you can claim an exemption since most people do n't exceed that amount its rare to ever pay taxes even when exceeding the annual exclusion amount the annual exclusion amount is adjusted each year for inflation

can they reject a hundred dollar bill as a payment of debt no a creditor can not refuse payment in cash whatever denomination you use however when you 're buying stuff you do n't owe anything to the business owner there 's no debt so the above rule does n't apply as long as there 's no debt in existence the matter of payment is decided between two parties based on the mutual agreement the demand not to use large bills is reasonable in places like or taxi cab that are frequently robbed or at a small retailer that does n't want to invest into forgery detection and fraud prevention so the answer to this question is it the case where this practice of accepting small bills and    rejecting large bills is perfectly legal is yes you can find the full explanation on including code references

i guess the opposite of being hedged is being unhedged typically a hedge is an additional position that you would take on in order to mitigate the potential for losses on another position i 'll give an example say that i purchase 100 shares of stock xyz at $ 10 per share because i believe its price will increase in the future   at that point my full investment of $ 1000 is at risk so the position is not hedged if the price of xyz decreases to $ 8 then i 've lost $ 200   if the price of xyz increases to $ 12 then i 've gained $ 200 the profit loss curve has a linear relationship to the future stock price suppose that i decide to hedge my xyz position by purchasing a put option i purchase a single option contract corresponding to my 100 shares with a strike price of $ 10 and an expiration date in january 2013 for a price of $ this means that until the contract expires i can always sell my xyz shares for a minimum of $ 10   therefore if the price of xyz decreases to $ 8 then i 've only lost $ 50 the price of the option contract compared to the $ 200 that i would have lost if the position was unhedged   likewise however if the price increases to $ 12 then i 've only gained a net total of $ 150 due to the money i spent on the hedge the details of how much money you would actually lose in the hedged scenario are simplified out above even out of the money options retain some value before expiration but pricing of options is outside of the scope of this post so as a more pointed answer to your question i would say that the hedged unhedged status of a position can be characterized by its potential for loss if you do n't have any other assets that will increase in value to offset losses on your position of interest i would call it unhedged

there are many reasons for buying stock for dividends   you are right in the sense that in theory a stock 's price will go down in value by the amount of the dividend as the amount of dividend was adding to the value of the company but now has been paid out to shareholder so now the company is worth less by the value of the dividend however in real life this may or may not happen sometimes the price will drop by less than the value of the dividend sometimes the price will drop by more than the dividend and other times the price will go up even though the stock has gone ex dividend we can say that if the price has dropped by exactly the amount of the dividend then there has been no change in the stockholders value if the price has dropped by more than the value of the dividend then there has been a drop to the stockholder 's value and if the price has gone up or dropped by less than the value of the dividend then there has been a increase to the stockholder 's value benefits of buying stocks with good dividends what you should n't do however is buy stocks solely due to the dividend be aware that if a company starts reducing its dividends it could be an early warning sign that the company may be heading into financial troubles that is why holding a stock that is dropping in price purely for its dividend can be a very dangerous practice

i had about $ 16k in student loans i defaulted on the loans and they got   > passed to a collection type agency   these guys are as legitimate as a collection agency can be one thing that i feel is very sketchy is when they were verifying my identity they said does your social security number end in is your birthday month day year   that is not sketchy it would be sketchy for a caller to ask you to give that information that 's a common scheme for identity theft are following the rules on this one my mom suggested i should consider applying for bankruptcy wo n't help student loans ca n't be discharged in bankruptcy you have the bankruptcy reform act passed during the bush 43 regime for that the loan itself is from school what school contact them and ask for help they may have washed their hands of your case when they turned over your file to then again they may not it 's worth finding out    also name and shame the school future applicants should be warned that they will do this   what can i do to aid in my negotiations with this company do n't negotiate on the phone you 've discovered that they wo n't honor such negotiations ask for written communications sent by postal mail keep copies of everything including both sides of the canceled checks you use to make payments during the six months and in the future keep making the payments you agreed to in the conversation six months ago do not ever ignore a letter from them do not ever skip going to court if they send you a summons to appear they count on people doing this they can get a default judgement if you do n't show up then you 're well and truly screwed what do you want you want the $ 4 k fee removed if you want something else figure out   what it is here 's what to do write them a polite letter explaining what you said here the conversation you had with their telephone agent where they said they would remove the $ 4 k fee if you made payments   the later conversation if possible give the dates of both conversations and the names of the both agents    explain the situation completely do n't assume the recipient of your letter knows anything about your case include evidence that you made payments as agreed during the six months if you were late or something do n't withhold that   ask them to remove the extra $ 4 k from your account and ask for whatever else you want send the letter to them with a return receipt requested or even registered mail that will prevent them from claiming they did n't get it and it will show them you 're serious write a cover letter admitting your default saying you relied on their negotiation to set things straight and saying you 're they are n't sticking to their word the cover letter should ask for help sorting this out send copies of the letter with the cover letter to be sure to mark your letter to cc all these folks so they know you are asking for help it ca n't hurt to call your congressional representative 's office and ask to whom you should send the letter and then address it by name this is called constituent service and they take pride in it if you send this letter with copies you 're letting them know you intend to fight   the collection agency may decide it 's not worth the fight to get the $ 4 k and decide to let it go    again if they call to pressure you say you 'd rather communicate in writing and that they are not to call you by telephone then hang up   should i hire a lawyer   yes but only if you get a court summons or if you do n't get anywhere with this you can give the lawyer all this paperwork i 've suggested here and it will help her come up to speed on your case this is the kind of stuff the lawyer would do for you at well over $ 100 per hour is bankruptcy really an option certainly not unfortunately never forget that student lenders and their collection agencies are dangerous and clever predators you are their lawful prey they look at you lick their chops and think food watch john oliver 's of that industry   good luck and stay safe

i believe it is so   it does n't sound like they did anything outright illegal just a pushy upsell   you can complain to the bank manager   if you want you can mention the employee by name if you know who they are   ultimately you can change banks   from what you say it sounds like you are with this bank so i think you should at least begin evaluating other banks and consider switching   you can also let your current bank know you are planning to take all your money away from them specifically because of their poor customer service you could consider filing a complaint with the consumer financial protection bureau alleging that the bank engaged in some kind of deceptive marketing of their financial products   of course you can also file a complaint with something like the better business bureau or even just write a negative yelp review   but these actions wo n't really result in any penalty for the bank as a result of what they did in your specific case they just express your in a way that will be recorded and possibly made public e.g. in a list of complaints to protect future consumers if you 're really gung ho and have time and money to burn you could hire a lawyer and get legal advice about whether it is possible to sue the bank for fraud or misuse of your personal information   needless to say i think this would be overkill for this situation   i would just cancel the credit card tell the bank you 're switch banks and move on

a 2011 study by the consulting firm management information services inc. estimated the total historical federal subsidies for various energy sources over the years the study found that oil natural gas and coal received $ billion $ 121 billion and $ 104 billion 2010 dollars respectively or 70 of total energy subsidies over that period    oh look the us has always subsidized energy in general to maintain a strong stable energy position and now they want to move from co2 producing dirty tech to more green renewables personally i 'm glad my tax money is being used for it   while subsidizing it costs have fallen by leaps and bounds long term it 's a great move do you think europe and china would be building solar and wind if it was n't

first gather the information you have on her banking history   she may have accounted for that money and moved it to a new account or otherwise spent it   i do n't expect you 'll have much banking documentation from the 1950s but if you do then start there and trace the money to the extent you can you may try to contact the banks in question or their   it may be difficult to trace them through mergers or closings   again it 's very possible that she spent or transferred those funds and there is nothing to find anyway there is also a risk that if the money went unclaimed for too long then the bank was obligated to any remaining balance to the state of ohio   you can try contacting ohio department of commerce about unclaimed funds and attempt to locate anything that may have rightly belonged to her   you will need to gather documentation to do so   you may be able to receive the funds from the state if it has received them

the are a couple of explanations that i can think of though for determining exactly what is different you will want to print out both returns and compare them line by line to see how they differ if the company up your income to account for the taxes on housing possibly by paying the additional withholding you may be just benefiting from them estimating your tax rate this can especially be the case if your only work was the three month internship they would have to assume your salary was for the entire year there is an earned income tax credit for low wage earners that you may have qualified for it would depend your specific circumstances if you meet the criteria but that credit for a range of income actually pays out more the more you earn to encourage working that extra hour instead of reducing benefit because you had another hour of employment as for the housing subsidy itself while the value is quite high the irs considers that to be a taxable benefit that the employer provided you and so it needs to be added to your w-2 wages $ 8k a month seems quite high but i do n't know the quality of the apartment you were provided and what the going rates are in the area given that you said you worked for a major tech company i can imagine that you might have been working in an area with high rents if the employer did gross up your paycheck so as to cover your taxes that $ 24k would also include that extra tax payment e.g. if the employer paid $ 8k in additional taxes for you then the housing cost that they directly paid were $ 16k

while i do not have an issue with treating customers clients well the whole mentality of the customer is always right needs to be re evaluated    in a case where a customer has unreasonable demands or is treating an employee poorly by no fault of the employee their privilege to be right ends in situations like that it is more important to stand up for your employees then it is to side with the customer if you do side with the customer in that situation it not only reinforces that behavior from the customer but makes the employee feel undervalued and will lead to morale issues if your workplace has consistent morale issues you will have a high turnover rate this will end up costing you considerably more not just in human capital but in workplace knowledge time and most prominently money chances are if a customer is being a huge drain of your resources they are likely not worth too much to your company to begin with see below    another reason why this mentality of every customer is valuable is a bad idea is found within the 80/20 principle simply put 80 of your revenue will come from 20 of your customer base and usually the 20 tend to be the lowest maintenance and have the lowest resource demand another application of this principle shows that 20 of your customer base accounts for 80 of the resource usage within your company the principle itself is not limited to 80/20 but the of a majority of x is provided by the minority of y is something that remains consistent across economies and cultures    in short not all customers are created equal and as a result do not deserve the same resources as one another in addition to this workforce integrity is more important in the long run than possibly losing a customer average firms provide good service excellent firms provide smart service

answers to this your question break down along a few lines regarding opportunity costs of tying up a significant chunk of your salary and assets in one piece of property as opposed to other things you 'd like to do with your life   the 30 year standard mortgage was invented in the 30 's as part of fdr 's new deal to make housing affordable to more people while the strain on the market of foreclosed homes from ~10 year interest only balloon mortgages sound familiar the 30 year term tends to follow the career of the average american of that era allowing them to pay the house off and live out the remainder of their lives there at a lower cost   houses are depreciating assets because they wear out over time their greatest investment value is a place to live the appreciation on a home comes from the real estate it sits on and the community the property is located in value is determined by desirability of the house and community in their current state and the supply of property in the area this value can only be extracted when you sell the home this partially answers your last question noting that you should n't buy a really expensive building for investment value we 've learned in recent years that there are no long term guarantees of property value either because land and communities can decrease in value due to unemployment over supply crime pollution etc only buy as much home as you will need in the next decade or so in a place that you will like living over that time period and do n't consider it much of an investment i will tell you to get a fifteen year fixed rate mortgage since it 's readily available at lower rates and has a significantly lower total purchase price than the standard 30 years the monthly payment difference is n't that great and anyone who looks at the monthly payment as opposed to the total costs your priorities and the opportunity costs should n't be trusted for financial advice i do n't like debt there are psychological benefits to being free from the and drain of a long term mortgage on your finances   the biggest argument for paying off your home quickly is freedom to pursue other desires with all of your salary and the assets you have available to you some financial advisers will tell you to keep your mortgage costs under 25 of your income so that you can actually live off the money you make i would also recommend paying at least enough into your 401k to get the company match and fully funding your roth ira i 'd also have an emergency fund to cover at least 6 months of expenses including this mortgage in case you lose your job a 15 or 20 year mortgage will give you breathing room to take care of these other priorities and you can overpay on almost any mortgage to decrease the principal and finish in a shorter time period make sure to get a mortgage that allows prepayment more financially savvy people may tell you to take the 30 year mortgage and invest the difference especially with mortgage rates around 4 this is a very cheap way to increase your purchasing power and total assets most people lack the investment prowess and self discipline to make this plan pay off there are even fewer guarantees regarding markets and investments than property this also is a way of diversifying your total assets to protect against loss of value in your home this approach has for thousands of people who are underwater on their homes this problem is often compounded by job loss forcing you to move or increasing your commute making your home less desirable for you some people will tell you to maintain the mortgage for the tax credit this fails a basic math test since you only get about a quarter of the money depending on your tax rate that you are paying in interest back from the government the rest of the money goes to bank at no gain to you this approach is basically a taxpayer subsidized decrease of your 4 interest payment to a 3 interest payment assuming you have ~ $ 5000 in other deductions and only pays off if you can successfully invest the money at a rate somewhat greater than 3

they do n't have to take cash if they reasonably told you in advance they do n't take cash because they made fair effort to prevent you from incurring a debt   they do n't have to take cash if the transaction has n't yet happened not a debt or if it can be easily undone at no cost to either party such as a newspaper subscription they can just stop delivering   both of these reasons are limited by the rules against discrimination see below   they do n't have to take cash if it 's for instance a transit bus when fares first went to $ 1.00 it took years to fund new able to take paper money   you do n't have to take a mortgage payment in pennies   liquor stores do n't have to take $ 100 bills it requires them to keep too much change in the till which makes them a robbery target   trouble arises when it appears there 's an motive for the rule    suppose a landlord jim requires rent to be paid with eft   rent controlled tells the judge it 's a scheme to me he knows i 'm unbanked   jim counters no i got mugged last month because criminals know when i collect cash rents   it will turn on whether jim can show good faith effort to work with his unbanked tenants to find other ways to pay if jim does a particularly bad job of this he could find himself paying 's legal bills even worse if the motive is discrimination the plumber hates muslims alice the feed supplier hates the amish   so they decide to take credit cards only knowing those people 's religions do n't allow them   their goose is cooked once they ca n't show any other reasonable reason to refuse cash

to round out something that w. rea pointed out the business that a reit is in will be either a equity reit property management b mortgage reit lending or c hybrid reit both   a very key point about why reits broadly have been struggling lately and this would show up in the reit indices etfs you 've linked to is linked to the reit business models   for an equity reit they borrow money at the going rate let 's say for commercial scale loans and use that to take out mortgages on physical properties if a property rents for $ 15 k per month and they can take out a $ 1.8 million loan at $ 9,000 per month then their business is around managing maintenance operating expenses and taxes on that $ 6,000 per month margin for a mortgage reit they borrow funds as a highly qualified borrower again let 's say and lend those funds back out at a higher rate the basic concept is that if you borrow $ 10 million at 4.5 for 30 years you need to pay it back at $ per month if you can lend it out reliably at 5 you collect $ per month a handy $ 3,000 per month the cheaper you can get money at below 4.5 and the higher you can lend it at above 5 the better your margin is   the worry is that both reit business models are very highly dependent on the cost of borrowing money with the us fed changing its bond buying qe stimulus activity the prevailing interest rates are likely to go up while this has its benefits inflation it also will make it more expensive for these types of companies to do business

there are kind of two answers here the practical reason an acquirer has to pay more for shares than their current trading price and the economic justification for the increase in price why must the acquirer must pay a premium as a practical matter   everyone has a different valuation of a company   the current trading price is the lowest price that any holder of the stock is willing to sell a little bit of stock for and the highest that anyone is willing to buy a little bit for however microsoft needs to buy a controlling share   to do this on the open market they would need to buy all the shares from people who 's personal valuation is low and then a bunch from people whose valuation is higher and so on   the act of buying that much stock would push the price up by buying all the shares from people who are really willing to sell   moreover as they buy more and more the remaining people increase their personal valuation so the price would really shoot up   avoid this situation by offering to buy a ton of stock at a substantially higher single price why is linkedin suddenly worth more than it was yesterday microsoft is expecting to be able to use its own infrastructure and tools to make more money with linkedin than linkedin would have before   in other words they believe that the linkedin division of microsoft after the merger will be worth more than linkedin alone was before the merger   this idea is the theoretical foundation for mergers in general and the main reason people use to argue for a higher price you could also argue that by expressing an interest in linkedin microsoft may be telling us something it knows about linkedin 's value that maybe we did n't realize before because we are n't as smart and informed as the people on microsoft 's board   but since it 's microsoft that 's doing the buying in this case i 'm going to go out on a limb and say this is not the main effect   given microsoft 's history the idea that they buy expensive things because they have money to burn is more compelling than the idea that they have an insight into a company 's value that we do n't

regarding the opportunity cost comparison consider the following two scenarios assuming a three year lease option a keep your current car for three years in this scenario you start with a car that 's worth $ 10,000 and end with a car that 's worth $ 7,000 after three years option b sell your current car invest proceeds lease new car here you 'll start out with $ 10,000 and invest it   you 'll start with $ 10,000 in cash from the sale of your old car and end with $ 10,000 plus investment gains you 'll have to estimate the return of your investment based on your investing style    option c use the $ 10k from proceeds as down payment for new car in this scenario you 'll get a reduction in finance charges on your lease but you 'll be out $ 10,000 at the end overall cost comparison to compare the total cost to own your current car versus replacing it with a new leased car first look up the cost of ownership for your current car for the same term as the lease you 're considering   edmunds offers this research and calls it true cost to own    specifically you 'll want to include depreciation fuel insurance maintenance and repairs   if you still owe money you should also factor the remaining payments   so the formula is cost to keep car = depreciation + fuel + insurance + maintenance + repairs on the lease side consider taxes and fees all lease payments fuel and maintenance   assume repairs will be covered under warranty   assume you will put down no money on the lease and you will finance fees taxes title and license when calculating lease payments   you also need to consider the cost to pay off your current car 's loan if applicable   then you should subtract the gains you expect from investing for three years the proceeds from the sale of your car assume that repairs will be covered under warranty   the formula to lease looks like lease cost = fuel + insurance + maintenance + lease payments gains from investing $ 10k for option c where you use the $ 10k from proceeds as down payment for new lease it will be lease cost = fuel + insurance + maintenance + lease payments + $ 10,000 a somewhat intangible factor to consider is that you 'll have to pay for body damage to a leased car at the end of the lease whereas you are obviously free to leave damage on your own vehicle

unless a study accounts for whether the users are following a budget or not it is irrelevant to those who are trying to take their personal finances seriously i can certainly believe that those who have no budget will spend more on a credit card than they will on a debit card or with cash under the right circumstances spending with cards can actually be a tool to track and reduce spending if you can see on a monthly and yearly basis where all of your money was spent you have the information to make decisions about the small expenses that add up as well as the obvious large expenses   debit cards and credit cards offer the same advantage of giving you an electronic record of all of your transactions but debit cards do not come with the same fraud protection that credit cards have so i and many people like me prefer to use credit cards for security reasons alone cash back and other rewards points bolster the case for credit cards over debit cards it is very possible to track all of your spending with cash but it is also more work the frustration of accounting for bad and every transaction multiple times is worth discussing too as a reason that people get discouraged and give up on budgeting my point is simply that credit cards and the electronic records that they generate can greatly simplify the process of tracking your spending i doubt any study out there accounts for the people who are specifically using those benefits and what effect it has on their spending

people agree to sell stocks when a company does bad but remember when you sell the stock of a company that in your estimation did bad someone else had to buy otherwise there is no sale the someone else who bought your shares evidently disagrees with your assessment did you sell because the company did n't earn a profit at all did it not earn a profit because it 's in a dead end business that is slowly but inevitably declining to zero something like sears holdings or did it not make a profit because it is in an emerging market that will possibly someday become hugely profitable something like tesla inc. did you sell because the company made a profit but it was lower than expected did they make a lower than expected profit because of lower sales why were the sales lower is the industry declining was the snow too heavy to send the construction crews out did the company make a big investment to build a new plant that will in a few years yield even higher sales and profits what are the profits year over year increasing declining usually investors are willing to pay a premium that is more than expected for a stock in a company with robust growth   as you can see the mere fact that a company reported a profit is only one of many factors that determine the price of the shares in the market

i think the answer depends on whether you 're trying to get out of debt and stay out or if you just want this card paid off   that is are you changing the way you deal with money and debt for good if you just want this card paid off and you 're ok with going back into debt later then scott 's advice is one way to go   i 'd personally be nervous about leaving myself with no cash reserves at all    if you are planning to get out of debt and stay out then you do n't want to put yourself in a position where you 're tempted to go back into debt as soon as you hit a speed bump   so you need some cushion so that an emergency does n't push you right back to the credit cards   if you 've got a budget that you can live on and that covers your usual expenses and your job is relatively stable then $ 1000 is probably enough of a cushion for most things you can then pay off most of the credit card using the rest of your savings   if you 're in an unstable job situation then you 'll want to keep more if not all of your savings as protection against the instability   once the situation then throw the surplus savings at the debt $ 1000 does n't cover all possible emergencies but it 's generally a good tradeoff between prudence and paranoia

as the article states traditionally it 's a majority percentage of teens and immigrants makes sense my wife and i regularly volunteer with immigrants some documented and some not to assist in finding jobs and housing so that still holds true    but add to that the newer college grads who struggle to find any job    i do n't have a perfect solution i think most people pretend their agenda is the perfect solution so if the research shows and it does that mandated minimum wage raise eliminates jobs the solution lies elsewhere as far as livable wage goes that is partly determined by situation and partly by individual obviously the individual has to be responsible for their share frugality minimizing debt work ethic etc but what 's not in their control could be helped on a situation to situation basis what i mean is disadvantaged people needs to be defined before you can help them if disadvantage people means recently graduated students then minimize their biggest financial burden of school loan interest rates if it 's lower skilled workers like teens and some immigrants get rid of the minimum wage and allow them to work those lower paying jobs while gaining experience so on and so forth    as a business owner who makes around $ i can tell you i can't afford to hire help at $ to do simple tasks that would make me more productive that killed a job right there and it prevented me from freeing up my time to focus more on income generating work so i 'm poorer for it too as someone who volunteers with immigrants i ca n't tell you how happy the people i 've worked with would be to have more job opportunities

a futures contract is based upon a particular delivery date   in the case of a stock index futures contract is a cash settled futures contract based upon the stock index value at a particular point in time i.e. this is when the final settlement is determined in your example the s&p 500 spx is a price return index that is it is not affected by dividends and therefore dividends are not incorporated into the index value   dividends will affect the price of the constituent stocks not necessarily by the same amount as the dividend so they do have influence on the stock index value   since the dividends are known ahead of time or at least can be estimated this has already been factored into the futures price by the market in terms of the impact of a dividend by aapl aapl is 3.6 of the index   apple pays out dividends 4 times a year currently paying out $ dividends   assuming the market is otherwise steady and aapl drops by $ due to the dividend and apple is priced at around $ 105 this would result in a drop in the index of or around 0.35 points interesting fact   there are some futures contracts that are based upon total return indexes such as the german dax and the above logic would need to be reversed

an alternative options strategy to minimize loss of investment capital is to buy a put near the money around your original buy price with a premium less than the total dividend the value of the put will increase if the stock price falls quickly likely a large portion of your dividend will go towards paying the option premium this will however ensure that your capital does n't drop much lower than your buy price continued dividend distributions will continue to pay to buy future put options risks here are if the stock does not have a very large up or down movement from your original buy price causing most of the dividend to be spent on insuring your position it may take a few cycles but once the stock has appreciated in value say 10 above buying price you can consider either skipping the put insurance so you can pocket the dividend or you can bu put with a higher strike price for additional insurance against a loss of gains again this sacrifices much of the dividend in favor of price loss and still is open to a risk of neutral price movement over time

what explains the most of the future returns of a portfolio is the allocation between asset classes in the long term stock investments are almost certain to return more than any other kinds of investments for 40 + years i would choose a portfolio of 100 stocks how to construct the portfolio then diversification is the key you should diversify in time do n't put a large sum of money into your stock portfolio immediately if you have a large sum to invest spread it around several years you should diversify based on company size invest in both large and small companies you should also diversify internationally do n't invest in just us companies if you prefer to pick individual stocks 20 very carefully selected stocks may provide enough diversification if you keep diversification in mind during stock picking however careful stock picking can not be expected to yield excess returns and if you pick stocks manually you need to rebalance your portfolio occasionally thus if you 're lazy i would recommend a mutual fund or many mutual funds if you have difficulty finding a low cost one that is internationally diversified the most important consideration is the cost you can not expect careful fund selection to yield excess returns before expenses however the expenses are certain costs so prefer low cost funds almost always this means picking index funds avoid funds that have a small number of stocks because they typically invest only in the largest companies which means you fail to get diversification in company size so instead of euro stoxx 50 select stoxx 600 when investing to the european market etfs may have lower costs than traditional mutual funds so keep etfs in mind when selecting the mutual funds in which to invest for international diversification do not forget emerging markets it is not excessive to invest e.g. 20 to emerging markets emerging markets have a higher risk but they also have a higher return a portfolio that does not include emerging markets is not in my opinion well diversified when getting close to retirement age i would consider increasing the percentage of bonds in the portfolio this should be done primarily by putting additional money to bonds instead of selling existing investments to avoid additional taxes not sure if this applies to other taxation systems than the finnish one bond investments are best made though low cost mutual funds as well keep bond investments in your local currency and risk free assets i.e. select us government bonds whatever you do remember that historical return is no guarantee of future return actually the opposite may be true there is a mean reversion law if a particular investment has returned well in the past it often means its price has gone up making it more likely that the price goes down in the future so do n't select a fund based on its historical return instead select a fund based on low costs however i 'm 99 certain that over a period of 40 years stocks will return better than other investments in addition to fund costs taxes are the other certain thing that will be deducted from your returns research what options you have to reduce the taxes you need to pay 401-k was explained in another answer this may be a good option some things recommended in other answers that i would avoid

all other things being equal if you have two stocks both with a p e    of 2 and one has an eps of 5 whereas the other has an eps of 10 is    the latter a better purchase what this really boils down to is the number of shares a company has outstanding   given the same earnings p e a company with fewer shares will have a higher eps than a company with more shares   knowing that i do n't think the number of shares has much if anything to do with the quality of a company    it 's similar to the arguments i hear often from people new to investing where they think that a company with a share price of $ 100/share must be better than a company with a share price of $ 30/share simply because the share price is higher

you need to pay off the entire balance of as soon as possible this should be your primary financial goal at this point above anything else a basic structure that you can follow is this is the £ 1500 balance with the interest rate the obvious starting point here yes that is fine but all the cards and overdraft debts need to be treated with the same urgency what are the prospects for improving my credit score in say the next 6 12 months enough to get a 0 balance transfer or loan for consolidation this should not be a primary concern of yours if you want to move on with your financial life debt consolidation will not help you achieve the goals you have described home ownership financial stability if you follow the advice here by the time you get to the point of being eligible you may not see enough savings in interest to make it worth the hassle focus on the hard stuff and pay off the balances is that realistic or am i looking at a longer term struggle you are looking at a significant struggle if it was easy you would not be asking this question the length of time will be determined by your choices how aggressively you will cut your lifestyle take on extra jobs and place additional payments on your debt   by being that extreme you will actually start to see progress which will be encouraging if you go in half committed your progress will show as much and it will be much of your success will hinge on your mental and emotional toughness to push through the hard work of delaying pleasure and paying off these balances that is just my personal experience so you can take it or leave it the credit score will take care of itself if you follow this method so do n't worry about it good luck

the canada revenue agency describes in detail here what information businesses must generally include on their invoices so that gst hst registrants can claim input tax credits for the expenses quote sales invoices for gst hst registrants you have to give customers who are gst hst registrants specific    information on the invoices receipts contracts or other business    papers that you use when you provide taxable goods and services this    information lets them support their claims for input tax credits    or rebates for the gst hst you charged the page quoted continues with a table describing what specifically needs to be on a sales invoice based on the total amount of the invoice the requirements differ for total sale under $ 30 total sale between $ 30 to $ and total sale $ 150 or more for the total sale under $ 30 category the only things a sales invoice must contain to support an itc claim are 1 the provider 's business name 2 the invoice date and 3 the total amount paid payable i.e. when the total sale is under $ 30 there is no requirement for any gst hst amount to be indicated separately nor for a business number to be present on the invoice hence imho and i am neither an accountant nor a lawyer if your uber rides are for $ 30 or less then you should n't expect a gst hst number anyway and a simple invoice as described should be enough for you to claim your whether or not the provider is registered in fact for gst hst is beside the point for amounts over $ 30 you need a bit more while the page above specifies that the provider 's business number should be included beginning with the next level of total sales   there are exceptions to those rules described at another page mentioned exceptions to invoice requirements that specifically apply to the taxi limousine case quote exceptions to invoice requirements gst hst registrants are required to keep the necessary documentation    to support their claim for and rebates in certain circumstances    the documentation requirements have been reduced for taxi or limousine fares your books and records must show so at a minimum for fare in excess of $ 30 total you should ask the driver to note either a the amount of gst hst charged or b a statement that the fare includes gst hst the driver 's business number need not be specified consequently if your receipt for a ride in excess of $ 30 does not contain any such additional information with respect to gst hst then i would expect the receipt does not satisfy the cra 's requirements for supporting your itc claim i.e. keep your individual rides under $ 30 each or else get a better receipt from the driver when it is above that amount p.s it should go without saying but your rides of course must be considered reasonable business expenses in order to qualify for gst hst for your business receipts for rides of a personal nature are not eligible so be sure to maintain proper records as to the business purpose and destination for each ride receipt so claimed

commonly get good payouts from these things   first when companies are in some of bankruptcy or financial distress they are forced to pay more to retain certain personnel due to the nature of the situation if the executives left then nobody would be willing to come in and wind up the assets of the company it would end up costing even more money in the long run because you wo n't get talented people and you will have to bring in people with little to no knowledge of your company or your industry   second bankruptcy law provides very clear guidelines for the priority of different creditors and this is tied into the incentives that we want to encourage if secured creditors did not get priority then they would never lend and we would not have economic growth the reason equity shareholders are last in priority is because they took on the risk of owning the company

my point was that we have the safest debt for right i agree that we can still afford to spend money to fix the economy the problem is that the spending we have been doing so far is n't doing a whole lot considering what we are investing we have spent trillions and our gdp growth rate is two thirds what it was over the last 70 years if we were still at the beginning of the recovery that could be acceptable but it 's been three and a half years now we are going to need to start getting some bang for our buck to turn this around   if we are still doing the same thing two years from now investors may not have faith in the safety of the united states anymore they will realize we have taken on 30 years of deficits and then taken trillions more to save the economy if we are still stagnant the world will start to question how great our economy really is and whether we even deserve the world reserve currency   so yes i agree that we currently have the safest debt in the world and can try to save our economy through deficit spending i did off on a tangent but i think it was a necessary point we need to make sure that the deficit spending we do from here on in actually creates real value for the economy and gets real gdp growth    the reason i am sick of the argument is that many people seem to have this idea that the u.s. will always have the reserve currency and the world will always consider it to be the safest debt we can keep going this way for now but if we do n't back up that claim then sooner or later they wo n't buy it anymore i agree with the government spending but we need to spend in areas that are going to generate real gdp growth rather than randomly building projects and hoping for the best   edit so in other words i think i agree with you i just want to make sure people understand how things can get in the future and we do n't all buy into a sense of entitlement that we can spend whatever we want forever

you 're asking if lottery ticket can ever produce a positive expected value ev the short answer is no there 's an interesting article that goes into the details and is heavy on the math and graphs the key point even if you think you have a positive expected value due to the size of the jackpot being larger than the number of possible numbers as more tickets are purchased and the jackpot grows larger the odds of someone else picking the winner goes up and your ev goes down the article concludes it paints a picture for anyone    still holding out hope that a lottery ticket can ever be an    economically rational investment as the jackpot grows in value the    number of people who try to win it grows super linearly this human    behavior has a mathematical consequence even though the jackpot    itself can theoretically grow without bound there is a point at which    the ticket buying grows to such a fever pitch that the    expected value of the jackpot actually starts going down again

i 'll answer your second question it depends what your charity is for there are two types i emergency i.e. to respond to environmental or social disasters where it acts a bit like an insurance policy ii development i.e. where the intention is to subsidise something missing in the local economy a lack of insurance is certainly a problem for people who lose their homes and livelihoods to disaster   your donations can go far as for development aid we find little evidence of a robust positive correlation between aid and growth write two ex imf economists who stepped down as imf chief economist at the end of 2006 and who left the imf this year one of the most enduring and important questions in economics is whether foreign aid helps countries grow there is a moral imperative to this question it is a travesty for so many countries to remain poor if a relatively small transfer of resources from rich countries could set them on the path to growth but if there is no clear evidence that aid boosts growth then handing out more money makes little sense they conclude i do somewhat further in declaring that charity is equivalent to trade dumping   by artificially lowering the real cost of a particular good it ensures that there will be no local investment in that good   free clothes to africa has destroyed the local textiles industry   free doctors has resulted in more african doctors in new york than in the whole of africa so decide where your charity is going emergencies or development   then decide what you can afford   but your first investment should always be in yourself   if by making use of that investment you can benefit the economy and keep others around you employed and productive you will achieve far more

do n't start by investing in a few individual companies this is risky want an example i 'm thinking of a big company say $ 120 billion or so a household name and good consistent dividends to boot they were doing fairly well and were generally busy trying to convince people that they were looking to the future with new environmentally friendly technologies then they went and spilled a bunch of oil into the gulf of mexico yes it was n't a pretty picture if bp was one of five companies in your portfolio that day things would look a lot better if they were one of 500 or 5000 companies though so first aim for diversification via mutual funds or etfs i personally think you should probably start with the mutual funds you avoid trading fees for one thing it 's also easier to fit medium sized dollar amounts into funds than into etfs even if you do get fee free etf trading etfs can get you better expense ratios but the less money you have invested the less important that is once you have a decent sized portfolio tens of thousands of dollars or so then you can begin to consider holding stocks of individual companies take note of fees including trading fees commissions if you buy $ 2000 worth of stock and pay a $ 20 commission you 're already down 1 if you 're holding a mutual fund or etf look at the expense ratio the annualized real return on the stock market is about 4 a real return is after adjusting for inflation if your fee is 1 that 's about a quarter of your earnings which is huge and while it 's easy for a mutual fund to outperform the market by 1 from time to time it 's really really hard to do it consistently once you 're looking at individual companies you should do a lot of obnoxious boring stupid research and do n't just buy the stock on the strength of its brand name you 'll be interested in a couple of metrics the main one is probably the p e ratio price earnings if you take the inverse of this you 'll get the rate at which your investment is making you money e.g. a p e of 20 is 5 a p e of 10 is 10 all else being equal a lower p e is a good thing it means that you 're buying the company 's income really cheap however all else is seldom equal if a stock is going for really cheap it 's usually because investors do n't think that it 's got much of a future earnings are not always consistent there are a lot of other measures like beta correlation to the market overall riskier volatile stocks have higher numbers gross margins price to unleveraged free cash flow and stuff like that again do the boring research otherwise you 're just playing games with your money

no money is gone   the movement of the existing currency has slowed down   currency moves through the economy through deposits or loans to banks and withdrawal from banks as proceeds from loans or return of deposits   when a bank makes a loan they provide a balance in a bank account which is n't converted to hard currency until withdrawn   so those bank loans essentially count as currency and thus effectively multiply the stock of currency available   deposits into money market funds and those funds loans into the commercial paper markets have the same effect   banks and money funds are now making fewer loans   in particular they are not funding companies that invested in securitizations of home mortgages and credit card receivables but they are also lending less to businesses and consumers   because they are lending less they are effectively multiplying the currency less    think of deposited and lent currency as spare cycles on a desktop computer   you let your computer help decipher the genome when you are n't using it yourself   if you somehow feared that you would lose those cycles slowing down your own computing you would be less likely to lend those cycles out   there would still be the same number of computing cycles in the world but the stock of those available for actual computing would appear to be diminished   the technical term for this concept is monetary velocity and it is a crucial factor in the level of overall economic activity banking stability and inflation

it 's all about risk these guidelines were all developed based on the risk characteristics of the various asset categories bonds are ultra low risk large caps are low risk you do n't see most big stocks like coca cola going anywhere soon foreign stocks are medium risk subject to additional political risk and currency risk especially so in developing markets and small caps are higher risk more to gain but more likely to go out of business   moreover the risks of different asset classes tend to balance each other out some when stocks fall bonds typically rise the recent credit crunch being a notable but temporary exception as people flock to safety or as the fed adjusts interest rates when stocks soar bonds do n't look as attractive and interest rates may rise a bummer when you already own the bonds is the us economy with the dollar in the dumps while the rest of the world passes us by your foreign holdings will be worth more in dollar terms if you 'd like to work alternative asset classes real estate gold and other commodities etc into your mix consider their risk characteristics and what will make them go up and down a good asset allocation should limit the amount of down that can happen all at once the more conservative the allocation needs to be the less down is possible at the expense of the up as for what risks you are willing to take that will depend on your position in life and what risks you are presently are exposed to including your job how stable your company is and whether it could fold or do layoffs in a recession like this one whether you 're married whether you have kids where you live for instance if you 're a realtor by trade you should probably avoid investing too much in real estate or it 'll be a double whammy if the market crashes a good financial advisor can discuss these matters with you in detail

most funds keep a certain amount in cash at all times to satisfy outflows   net inflows will simply be added to the cash balance while net outflows subtract   when the cash gets too low for the manager 's comfort level depends on the typical pattern of net inflows and outflows as well as anticipated flows based on recent performance the manager will sell some of his least favorite holdings and when the cash gets too high he will buy some new holdings or add to his favorite existing holdings   a passive fund works similarly except the buys sells are structured to minimize tracking error

the statement can be true but is n't a general rule crashes and recessions are two different things a crash is when the market rapidly something when prices are out of equilibrium whether it be stocks a commodity or even a service   when the internet was new nobody knew how to design webpages so web page designers were in huge demand and insane price premiums i literally had college classmates billing real companies $ for marginal web skills eventually the market up and that industry collapsed overnight another example of a crash from the supply point of view was the discovery of silver in the western us during the 19th century these discoveries increased the supply of the commodity to the point that silver coin eroded in value and devastated small family farms who mostly dealt in silver currency recessions are often linked to crashes but you do n't need a crash to have a recession basically during a recession trade and industrial activity drop the economy operates in cycles and the euphoria and over optimistic projections of a growing or booming economy lead to periods of reduced growth where the economy essentially itself capital is a if not the key element of the economic cycle it 's a catalyst that makes things happen debt is one form of capital it 's not good not bad generally cheap capital ie low interest rates bring economic growth why if i can borrow at 4 i can then perform some sort of economic activity bake bread make computers assemble cars etc that will earn myself 6 8 or 10 on the dollar when interest rates go up economic activity slows because the higher cost of credit increases the risk of losing money on an investment the downside of cheap capital is that risk taking gets too easy and you can run into situations like the $ 2 m ranch houses in california the downside of expensive tight capital is that it gets harder for businesses to operate and economic activity slows down the effects of either extreme cascade and snowball

the number one reason to borrow is quite simple when you have no other choice the primary reason to do this is when renovations or additions must be made in a timeframe that precludes you being able to save enough money to pay cash 's example of a kid on the way with no space to put him is a very good hypothetical disaster recovery is another insurance does n't cover everything and can sometimes be slow to pay out and even if the payoff will rebuild the house exactly the way it was these situations are good opportunities to improve on what you had since you already have to call in the contractors to demo and rebuild the cost to do that is sunk and the incremental cost of improvements or even additional square footage is relatively minor other acceptable reasons to borrow are when cost of capital is very cheap a typical amortized heloc is pretty expensive when paid on schedule but if you can pay it off very early i.e. when you sell the home next month or you get a good deal on the interest rate a subsidized disaster recovery loan perhaps you have to be careful with these as they 're not intended to turn a burnt down into a mcmansion the cost of borrowing can be acceptable even if you had cash savings for the project you have other uses for the cash that can offset cost of borrowing this generally requires the first point to be true as well as it 's a general rule that borrowing $ 10,000 costs you more than you would gain by investing $ 10,000 but there are situations in which the reverse can be true if you have $ 10k in oil or major tech stocks right now it would probably be a bad move to liquidate them for home improvements if you can get a heloc at less than 6 you can realize a net gain in home value from the reno these situations are rare in cases of an already livable home flippers which make their living on renovating homes for a profit generally choose homes with obvious but easy to fix problems that depress home value because they look worse than they are if you bought your home without any such problems you probably paid something close to market value at the time and so you 're probably behind the curve however if you or your family in the case of an estate transfer have owned the home for a long time long enough for things to fall way out of date then you can catch up a lot of market value with one renovation where if the home had had two or three renovations along the way a reno now would n't gain you as much value

my question is how income tax is calculated for partial redemption same as normal the redemption should always be treated as fifo say you are buying 10 units every month i know the units maybe in fraction and price would be different every month and you are investing fixed amount after say 9 months you have 90 units now when you sell say 45 units you are actually selling 10 units from first 4 months and 5 units from 5th month so calculate the price at which you purchased these units this becomes your cost now when you sell you know the price so subtract the sell price from cost price this is your taxable income short term capital gains is taxed as per your tax bracket so add this taxable income to your other income and calculate taxes accordingly you have to pay tax in advance and not wait till year end you can do this online as well

a decade ago my main source of overdraft fees was due to the length of time between a purchase and the money actually being drafted out of my account i just could n't keep track of my balance at any given point in time without a ledger which i was n't going to keep these days i have my bank account set up to text me whenever i make a purchase and most of the time i receive that text within two minutes of receiving my receipt it 's much more up to the minute and i can keep easy mental tally   plus i 'm much better off than i was when i was 20 dictated

in general lump sum investing will tend to outperform dollar cost averaging because markets tend to increase in value so investing more money earlier will generally be a better strategy   the advantage of dollar cost averaging is that it protects you in times when markets are overvalued or prior to market corrections    as an extreme example if you done a lump sum investment in late 2008 and then suffered through the subsequent market crash it may have taken you 2 3 years to get back to even   if you began a dollar cost averaging investment plan in late 2008 it may have only taken you a 6 months to get back to even dollar cost averaging can also help to reduce the urge to time the market which for most investors is definitely a good thing

i 'd have a good look at how much anonymity an llc offers in your state as far as i 'm aware this varies from state to state out here in nv an llc owner 's privacy is supposedly fairly well protected but in other states not quite as much also keep in mind that while the llc offers some protection and i 'm a big advocate of this sort of structure if you 're taking larger risks that might have a big impact on your overall personal finances this might not apply to financing a lot of banks tend to require an llc 's owner to guarantee loans to an llc once they go over a certain amount or even in general do some research in this area because the llc would be worth less as a protective shield to you if you 're on the hook for the full amount of the loans anyway

probably because it 's a question of excel vs access not vba vs sql you probably do n't need vba for any of the that the op mentions   excel is the one tool everyone uses in finance cr and ssrs require tools and permissions that the average guy simply wo n't have and a level of expertise that is not useful for most front middle office analysis work   i usually see these done in excel ssrs and cr seem like way overkill for something done trivially and in excel whose presentation will change frequently anyway   depending on what op is talking about analysis is not reporting and flexibility and transparency usually win especially when you want to poke around the underlying data and with other people   ssrs and cr only make sense when you know what you 're looking for that the data is appropriate for it and you do n't expect it to change

i am admittedly not giving a scientific or mathematical analysis here just giving my anecdotal take on what i 've lived through i do n't know if my assessment of tripled is even accurate just that there 's a palpable sense of things being a lot more expensive amp it just seems to me that the cost of living has gone up quite a bit for average people from what it once was especially considering most of us now have cable bills internet costs and in my case several different cell phone bills for different members of the family i realize these are not necessities but they are important things that most people are now expected to have i did n't mean to imply that we 've had insane inflation amp i understand that these things are mathematically measured as both core inflation and cpi and by these measures things have held pretty steady it just seems to me that these sorts of indexes have not yet taken a lot of things into account regarding the realities of modern day living and their resultant expenses

the only downside is for the agents not you agents especially selling agents prefer the concession over the price reduction for their own interests   they get a commission on a higher purchase price   that and the recorded sales price for the house is a tad higher which incrementally increases the comps for the next sales when we moved the agent conditioned me to get ready to offer a concession should we decide to sell our previous home   we decided to rent that property and have someone else manage it but with regard to your questions the concessions are applied against your closing costs   when we bought our last house they specified caps on the closing costs so money will be typically be withheld or not contractually the concessions are n't a taxable gain   your basis in the property will be higher than if you get a price reduction but the lower basis hopefully means a higher capital gain when you sell

my bank 's bill payment system saves nothing more than writer 's and stamps   when a paper check is required they mail it but it 's drawn on my account just as if i 'd written it out by hand and mailed it myself   there is no temporary account and at the time of month when i take care of the bills my balance up and down depending on what 's cleared and what has n't   i 'm going back to mailing checks because it saves a day or two of time between payment initiation and check clearing which sucks   and electronic payments are n't much better   it recently took about five days for a payment to my car insurance company to be processed and the amount is finalized and subtracted in the bank 's website only after clearance   i ca n't know what i have without balancing the account every time iirc bill payment systems were a lot more seamless and user friendly when they first became widespread

well there are many papers on power spot price prediction for example it depends on what level of methodology you would like to use linear regression is one of the basic steps then you can continue with more advanced options i 'm a phd student studying modelling the energy price electricity gas oil as stochastic process regarding to your questions 1 mildly speaking it 's really hard due to its random nature   2 well i would ask what kind of measure of success you mean what level of predicted interval one could find successful enough 3 would you like me to send you some of the math based papers on 4 as i know the method is to fully capture all main characteristics of the price if it 's daily power price then these are mean reversion effect high volatility spike seasonality weekly monthly yearly   would you tell me what kind of method you 're using maybe we can discuss some shared ideas anna

i made an investing mistake many eight years ago specifically i invested a very large sum of money in a certain triple leveraged etf the asset has not yet been sold but the value has decreased to maybe one 8th or 5th of the original amount i thought the risk involved was the volatility i did n't realize that due to the nature of the asset the value would be constantly decreasing towards zero anyhow my question is what to do next   i would advise you to sell it asap you did n't mention what etf it is but chances are you will continue to lose money the complicating factor is that i have since moved out of the united states and am living abroad i.e. japan i am permanent resident of my host country i have a steady salary that is paid by a company incorporated in my host country and pay taxes to the host government i file a tax return to the u.s. government each year but all my income is excluded so i do not pay any taxes in this way i do not think that i can write anything off on my u.s. tax return also i have absolutely no idea if i would be able to write off any losses on my japanese tax return i 've entrusted all the family tax issues to my wife would this be possible   i ca n't answer this question but you seem to be looking for information on cross border tax harvesting if google does n't yield useful results i 'd suggest you talk to an accountant who is familiar with the relevant tax codes are there any other available options that would not involve having to tell my wife about the loss which would be inevitable if i were to go the tax write off route in japan this is off topic but you should probably have an honest conversation with your wife regardless if i continue to hold onto this asset the value will decrease lower and lower any suggestions as to what to do see above close your position asap for more information on the pitfalls of leveraged etfs finra what happens if i hold longer than one trading day   while there may be trading and hedging strategies that justify holding these investments longer than a day buy and hold investors with an intermediate or long term time horizon should carefully consider whether these etfs are appropriate for their portfolio as discussed above because leveraged and inverse etfs reset each day their performance can quickly diverge from the performance of the underlying index or benchmark in other words it is possible that you could suffer significant losses even if the long term performance of the index showed a gain

this greatly depends on the local laws and the insurance contract terms if i remember correctly my own life insurance policy does also have special terms in case i die within a year of applying so it does n't sound totally bogus for car loan insurance the amount of coverage and premiums were probably low enough for the insurer not to want to spend the money upfront on the thorough investigation but they probably do have a clause that covers them in case the insured passes away unreasonably quickly unreasonably for a healthy person of the given age that is

the easiest way to get started on a budget is just to track where you spend your money if you have set bills each month i would make a category for each of those to make sure you have enough to pay you can try and split up the remaining income into categories but the easiest way to start is just to track your spending for a month or two this gives you a birds eye view of what is actually realistic start with that total as your preliminary budget and then adjust as you go along to meet other financial goals we use for tracking our income

i interned for about six months at a firm that employed a few technical analysts so i 'll try to provide what little information i can since the bulk of the intra day trading was decided technical analysts had two main functions this basically boils down to my answer to your question there are still enough people trading firms etc who believe in candlestick charting and other visually subjective patterns that if you notice a trend pattern etc before the majority of traders observing you may be able to time the market successfully and profit this is becoming increasingly dangerous however because of the steps i outlined above over time the charting patterns that have been proven effective often in many firms individually since the algorithms are all proprietary are incorporated into computer algorithms so the traders you 're competing with to see the pattern are increasingly low latency computer less than a few blocks from the exchange summary candlestick charting along with other forms of subjective technical analysis has its believers and assuming enough of these believers trade the standard strategies based on the standard patterns one could conceivably time the market with enough skill to anticipate these traders acting on the pattern and therefore profit however the marginal benefits of doing so are decreasing rapidly as computers take over more trading responsibility   caveats   i know you 're in australia where the market penetration of hf algo traders is n't as high as in the us so it might be a few more years before the marginal benefits cease to be profitable that being said if various forms of technical analysis proved wildly profitable in australia above and beyond profits available in other markets rest assured that large american or british trading firms would already have moved in   my experience is limited to one trading firm so i certainly ca n't speak for the industry as a whole i know i did n't address candlestick charts specifically but since they 're only one piece of visual technical analysis i tried to address the issue as a whole   this somewhat ties into the debate between fundamental or technical analysis which i wo n't get into investopedia has a short article on the subject as i said i wo n't get into this because while it 's a nice debate for small traders at large trading firms they do n't care they want to make profit and any strategy that can be vetted whether it 's fundamental technical or will be vetted   i want to add more information to my answer to clear up some of the misconceptions in the comments including those talking about biased studies and a lack of evidence for or against technical analysis and candlestick charts i 'll explore this relationship further down   it 's important to keep in mind that charting methods including candlestick charts are visually subjective ways of representing data and that any interpretations drawn from such charts should ideally represent objective technical indicators a charting method is only as good as the indicators it 's used to represent therefore an analysis of the underlying indicators provides a suitable analysis for the visual medium in which they 're presented   one important study that evaluates several of these indicators is foundations of technical analysis computational algorithms statistical inference and empirical implementation by lo and lest anyone accuse its authors of bias i should point out that not only is it published by the national bureau of economic research a highly reputable organization within economics and finance but also that the majority of its authors come from mit 's sloan school which holds a reputation second to none this study finds that several technical indicators e.g. head and shoulder double bottom and various rectangle techniques do provide marginal value they also find that although   human judgment is still superior to most computational algorithms in the area of visual pattern recognition technical analysis can be improved by using automated algorithms since this paper was published in 2000 computing power and statistical analysis have gained significant ground against human ability to identify and exploit for visual pattern detection like candlestick charts   second i suggest you look into david 's book evidence based technical analysis applying the scientific method and statistical inference to trading signals he finds similar results to the lo et al paper in that some technical indicators do add value to the investment process but those that do are those that can be represented mathematically and thus programmed directly into trading algorithms thus bypassing visual tools like candlestick charts   he describes how studies including lo et al have found that head and shoulders patterns are worse than random i.e. you would earn higher returns if you simply traded at random that point is worth than repeating if a day trader is using a candlestick chart and using head and shoulders patterns as part of their he 's rolling the dice when he uses that pattern and returns that come from its application come from chance this reminds me of that old story about a company that sends out predicting the results of sports games complete with strategies and data to back up the predictions the company sends out several versions of the every game each predicting a different winner given a large enough sample size by the end of the season there are a few people who have received a that accurately predicted the winner for every game and they 're convinced the system is perfect the others were n't so lucky however relying on candlestick charts and ta patterns that are from the pre computerized era is reassuring to some traders and gives them a sense of control and beating the market but how long will chance remain on your side this is why i maintain that visual tools like candlestick charts are a slowly dying medium they certainly still add value to some trading firms which is why bloomberg terminals still ship with this functionality built in but as more and more research shows automated algorithms and statistical indicators can provide more value it 's also important to think about whether the majority of the value added by visual tools like candlestick charts comes in the form of profit or a sense of security to traders who learned the field using them over the past few decades   finally it 's extremely important to realize that the actions of retail investors in the equities market can not begin to represent the behaviors of the market as a whole in the equities markets alone trading firms and institutional investors dwarf retail investors and the difference in scale is even more vastly pronounced in derivatives and currency markets the fact that some retail investors use candlestick charts and the technical indicators they hope them provides nothing but minor anecdotal evidence as to their effectiveness
