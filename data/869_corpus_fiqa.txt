statistics are often tough to grasp specifically we need to understand the exact context and implication of the data and how it 's presented an example i look at real estate sales data for a given town and find that for    the last 10 years the average sale price has dropped every    year for these 10 what can i conclude   now to your data you do n't mention age   when we look at this chart combined with the next   the picture while still bleak is at least more clear nearly half of pre retirees have no retirement savings if that lower half is running close to zero the average for the upper half is nearly twice the reported $   even now there are important bits going people who have had no access to retirement accounts either through lack of company availability or self who just ignored them may very well have saved outside of retirement accounts you can see these graphs are tracking only 401(k ira and keogh accounts   last social security for the $ 30 k earner will replace nearly half their working income at retirement almost 65 if they work till 70 i do n't advocate counting on ss for the entirety of one 's retirement income but the way ss benefits are structured replacement benefits are far higher as a percent for lower wage workers as the system intended   to conclude median alone is too small a data point to be useful in my opinion this kind of information presented in these charts is far more preferable to get a fuller picture

no if your stock is called away the stock is sold at the agreed upon price you can not get it back at your original price if you do n't want your stock to be called make sure you have the short call position closed by expiration if it is itm   also you could be at risk for early assignment if the option has little to no extrinsic value although probably not but when dividends are coming make sure you close your short itm options if the dividend is worth more than the extrinsic value you are pretty much guaranteed to be assigned been assigned that way too many times especially in etfs where the dividends are n't dates are not always easy to find it happens typically during triple if you are assigned on your short option you will be short stock and you will have to pay the dividend to the shareholder of your short stock so if you have a covered call on and you are assigned your stock will be called away and you will have to pay the dividend

the 529 plan does outline your scenarios there are stipulations for providing the funds should the child get the scholarship if the child decides not to go into further education vocational and community schools count the money can be withdrawn with a 10 penalty and taxes paid on interest earnings taxes would n't have to be paid for contributions as taxes were already paid on that money by the gift giver the 529 could also be transferred to another child in the family including grandchildren   here 's an excerpt from you 'll never lose all of your savings a 529 plan offers tax free earnings and tax free withdrawals as long as the money is used to pay    for college if you end up taking a non qualified withdrawal you 'll    incur income tax as well as a 10 penalty but only on the earnings    portion of the withdrawal since your contributions were made with    after tax money they will never be taxed or penalized you can avoid the penalty if you get a scholarship there are a few special exceptions to the 10 penalty rule including when the    beneficiary becomes a u.s. military academy or    gets a scholarship in the case of a scholarship non qualified    withdrawals up to the amount of the tax free scholarship can be taken    out penalty free but you 'll have to pay income tax on the earnings    as founder joe likes to say the    scholarships have turned your tax free 529 investment into a    tax deferred 529 investment note a 529 is ideal for the sum of money you are looking at a proper trust set up by a lawyer will cost as much as $ 2000 to set up and would require an annual tax return both unnecessary burdens to make matters worse the trust counts as the child 's asset where financial aid is concerned the 529 counts but to a much lesser extent

i was told if i moved my 401k into a roth ira that school purposes is one reasons you can withdraw money without having to pay a tax incorrect   you will need to pay tax on the amount converted since a 401(k is pre tax and a roth ira is after tax   it will be added to your regular income so you will pay tax at your marginal tax rate is there any hidden tax or fee at all for withdrawing money from a roth ira for educational purposes   you still will need to pay the tax on the amount converted but you 'll avoid the 10 penalty for early withdrawal i know that tuition books and fees are covered for educational purposes can i take out of my roth ira for living expenses while i 'm attending school rent gas food etc room and board yes so long as you are half time but not gas food   possibly only room and board for staying on campus but i 'm not certain although i doubt you could call your normal house payment education expense with my 401k being smaller would it just be better to go ahead and cash the whole thing and just pay the tax and use it for whatever i need it for what is the tax if i just decide to cash the whole thing in   you pay your marginal tax rate plus a 10 penalty for early withdrawal   so no this is probably not a wise move financially unless you 're on the verge of bankruptcy or foreclosure where distress costs are much higher then the 10 penalty i ca n't answer the other questions regarding grants i would talk to the financial aid department at your school bottom line transferring your 401(k is very likely a bad idea unless you can afford to pay the tax in cash meaning without borrowing   my advice would be to leave your 401(k alone it 's meant for retirement not for school or living expenses ideally you should pay for as much as you can out of cash flow and do n't take out more student loans that may mean taking fewer classes getting another part time job finding a different cheaper school applying for more grants and scholarships etc   i would not in any circumstance cash out your 401(k to pay for school   you 'll be much worse off in the long run and there are much cheaper ways to get money

the reason the article recommends a roth 401k for those who have a long time until retirement is based on your salary marginal tax rates and effective tax rates and some assumptions you want to contribute to roth iras when your marginal tax rate now is better than your effective tax rate at the time of withdrawal   that is most likely to be true when your salary is smaller for you and your salary is most likely to be smaller compared to your future salaries when you have more years until retirement the article is presenting a rule of thumb    it wo n't hold true for everyone in every situation
# 299690
as other people have indicated traditional iras are tax deductable for a particular year please note though that traditional iras are tax deferred not tax free accounts meaning that you 'll have to pay taxes on any money you take out later regardless of why you 're making the withdrawal a lot of people mistakenly call them tax free which they 're not there is no such thing as a tax free retirement account really in terms of roth vs. traditional iras it 's pay now or pay later with the exception of special circumstances like this i recommend investing exclusively in roth iras for money that you expect to grow much or that you expect to produce substantial income over time just to add a few thoughts on what to actually invest in once you open your ira i strongly agree with the advice that you invest mostly in low cost mutual funds or index funds the advantage of an open ended mutual fund is that it 's easier to purchase them in odd increments and you may be able to avoid at least some purchase fees whereas with an etf you have to buy in multiples of that day 's asking price for example if you were investing $ 500 and the etf costs $ 200 per share you could only purchase 2 shares leaving $ 100 uninvested minus whatever fee your broker charged for the purchase the advantage of an etf is that it 's easy to buy or sell quickly usually when you add money to a mutual fund it 'll take a few days for it to hit your account and when you want to sell it 'll similarly take a few days for you to get your money when i buy an etf the transaction can occur almost instantly the fees can also be lower if the etf is just a passive index fund also there 's a risk with open ended mutual funds that if too many people pull money out at once the managers could be forced to sell stocks at an unfavorable price

there are many ways to value a business here is a simple method to get a ball park number on most businesses this business is made of two parts for the real estate for the business   i would consider this type of small business riskier than the stock market and so you should expect a higher return maybe 15 or 20 if the rental business makes $ 50k profit not revenue and that is 20 return of your investment the business is worth $ 250k if the business makes no money or if they only make money because they do n't take a salary then this is a hobby and not a business there 's no business to buy here and you are just bidding on the real estate to do with what you please the assets worth $ 600k and the business worth $ 250k would be added together for a fair sale price of $ adjust for your actual numbers and you should be able to get a ball park of what you think the business is worth if you do the math and it works out that you 'll make 1 3 on your business compare that to investing in other places if it works out that you 'll make 40 on your money that 's pretty awesome too

i ca n't think of any conceivable circumstance in which the banker 's advice would be true edit actually yes i can but things have n't worked that way since so his information is a little stale credit bureaus got their start by only reporting information about bad debtors the bureaus only store on your file what gets reported to them by the institution who extended you the credit this reporting tends to happen at 30 60 or 90-day intervals depending on the contract the bureau has with that institution all credit accounts are real from the day you open them i suspect the banker might be under the misguided impression the account does n't show up on your report become real until you miss a payment which forces the institution to report it but this is the institution wo n't report it until the 30-day mark at the earliest whether or not you miss a payment or pay it in full the cynic in me suspects this banker might give customers such advice to sabotage their credit so he can sell them higher interest loans laws were created for a reason

trusts are a way of holding assets with a specific goal in mind at its simplest a trust can be used to avoid probate a sometimes lengthy process in which a will is made public along with the assets a trust allows for fast transfer and no public disclosure depending on the current estate tax laws the death tax a trust can help preserve an estate exemption e.g. say the law reverts back to a $ 1 m exemption note this is $ 1 m per deceased person not per beneficiary my wife and i happened to have assets of exactly $ 2 m and i die tomorrow now she has $ 2 m and when she passes the estate has that $ 2 m and estate taxes are based on this total $ 1 m fully taxed but if we set up trusts that first million can be put into trust on my death the interest and some principal going to the surviving spouse each year but staying out of the survivor 's estate second spouse dies little or no tax due   this is known as a bypass trust another example is a trust say hypothetically my sister in law ca n't save a nickel to save her life spends every dime and then some so the best thing my mother in law can do to provide for her is to leave her estate in trust with specific instructions on how to distribute some percent each year this is not a tax dodge of any kind it 's strictly to protect the daughter from her own irresponsibility   a medical needs trust is a variant of the above it can provide income to a disabled person without impacting their government benefits adversely   this scratches the surface illustrating how trusts can be used there are more variation on this but i believe it covers the basics with the interest in this topic i 'm adding another issue where the trust can be useful in my article on my death please take a breath i described how an inherited ira was destroyed by ignorance the beneficiary fearing the stock market withdrew it all and was nailed by taxes he was on social security and no other income so by taking small withdrawals each year would have had nearly no tax due and could have avoided market risk by selling within the ira and buying treasuries or cds   he did n't need a trust of course just education the deceased his sister might have used a trust to manage the ira and enforce limited withdrawals mixing iras and trust is complex but the choice between a $ 2000 expense to create a trust or the $ 40 k tax bill he got is pretty clear to me he took pride in having sold out as the market soon tanked but he could have avoided the tax loss as well he was confusing the account in this case an ira but it could have been a 401(k or other retirement account with the investments it contained one can and should keep the ira in tact and simply adjust the allocation according to one 's comfort level   note inheritance tax laws change frequently and my answer above was an attempt to be generic the current 2014 code allows $ m to be left by one decedent with no estate tax

my view is from the netherlands a eu country con credit cards are more risky if someone finds your card they can use it for online purchases without knowing any pin just by entering the card number expiration date and security code on the back worse sometimes that information is stored in databases and those get stolen by hackers also you can have agreed to do periodic payments on some website and forgot about them stopped using the service and be surprised about the charge later debit cards usually need some kind of device that requires your pin to do online payments the ones i have in the netherlands do anyway and automated periodic payments are authorized at your bank where you can get an overview of the currently active ones con banks get a percentage of each credit card payment unlike debit cards where companies usually pay a tiny fixed fee for each transaction of say half a cent credit card payments usually cost them a percentage and it comes to much more a significant part of the profit margin i feel this is just wrong con automatic monthly payment can come at an unexpected moment with debit cards the amount is withdrawn immediately and if the money is n't there you get an error message allowing you to pay some other way credit card after all other bank account cash etc when a recent monthly payment from my credit card was due to be charged from my bank account recently someone else had been paid from it earlier that day and the money was n't there so i had to pay interest on something i bought weeks ago pro credit cards apparently have some kind of insurance i 've never used this and do n't know how it works but apparently you can get your money back easily after fraudulent charges pro credit cards can be more easily used internationally for online purchases i do n't know how it is with visa or mc issued debit cards but many us sites accept only cards that have number expiration date security code and thus my normal bank account debit card is n't conclusion definitely have one but only use it when absolutely necessary

more shares mean less volatility because it takes a larger number of trades a larger number of shares per trade or a combination of both to raise or lower the stock price institutional investors mutual funds pensions hedge funds other investment firms etc are the sorts of organizations with the large amounts of money needed to move a stock price one way or the other   but the more floating shares there are in a company the harder it is for one or two firms to move a stock price   a company with fewer floating shares would n't require as many trades or as many shares per trade to see wider swings in price when it comes to stock price insider trading is n't the same as manipulation   in the surprisingly few cases of insider trading that are prosecuted it tends to be an individual or small group with early access to information that the broader market does n't have being able to buy or sell ahead of the broader market   their individual sales are seldom if ever enough to noticeably move a stock price   they 're locking in profit or limiting a loss   manipulation might but does n't always insider trading if misinformation or truth is released for the purpose of creating a situation that can be profited from via a trade or trades

thing is it 's already explained in the letter in the end of the first paragraph tesla ’s annualized delivery rate should exceed 100,000 units by the end of next year emphasis mine   when i first saw the number i got excited but then i read the actual sentence realized what they meant and it 's still impressive but it 's not 3x increase in production yoy which would be absurd to expect esp when tesla 's trajectory has been just increases per year so far and into the mid term foreseeable future   then they explained it again on the cc elon said something like we 'll exit next year at a 100k rate but it 's hard to tell how steep the curve will be but we 'll probably have over 60k deliveries i think yeah probably   i emailed the author of this article and he still believes that tesla has unequivocally stated that they will produce and deliver 100k cars in 2015 but that 's simply not correct   i have some people who know press contacts within tesla working on it out though their efficacy at press communications has not been ideal at times in the past   if tesla did unequivocally state that they would deliver 100k cars next year after delivering just over 35k this year and 22k last year that would be enormous news and should have sent the stock to $ 300 today up 30 50%+ instead of the 4 it did go up   but it did n't send it that high because that 's just not what 's happening   i 'm extraordinarily bullish on tesla but 100k in 2015 is just not what 's going to happen   100k+ in 2016 though sounds about right   and is in line with every other estimate everyone has done for the past several years including tesla themselves   so yeah this number is n't really news but it 's nice to see them reiterate it

the assumption that bonds have been issued with a negative coupon is not correct or at least is has not occurred thus far   we 'll look at this future possibility in the final paragraph for now lets look at the current bond market the issuance of government bonds which carry a negative gross redemption yield is the result of governments issuing bonds at an issue price which exceed the nominal redemption price and any coupon yield receivable over the life of the bond   i can find no instances of bonds with a negative coupon though many have tiny positive coupon yields the short seller of a bond with a negative gross redemption yield will be liable to pay the buyer the interest amount determined by the coupon   if the short seller has borrowed the bonds in order to sell them then the short seller will receive the interest due from the lender to offset the interest paid to the buyer   if the short seller has not borrowed the bonds but has sold them using some sort of synthetic contract such as a contract for difference then the short seller will pay the coupon without receiving any offsetting payment i thought this was an interesting question and it will be interesting to see if at some time in the future governments do ever issue bonds with a negative coupon   to date this does not appear to have happened so what would happen if we assume that a government issues a bond with a negative coupon   the buyer of the bond would be required to pay the equivalent yield to the government according to the bond contract specification   if an investor sells short such a bond they would then become entitled to receive the interest from the buyer   if they have borrowed the bonds in order to sell them short then they would pay any interest received back to the lender this chain should eventually end with the ultimate owner lender paying the government their dues   if they have sold short using a synthetic contract then presumably they would keep the interest from themselves

a tax liability account is a common thing in my own books i track us based social insurance medicare and social security using such an account   at the time i pay an employee a tax liability is incurred increasing my tax liability account at the same time on the other end of the double entry i increase a tax expense account notably though the us irs does not necessarily require that the tax is paid at the time it is incurred   in my case i incur a liability twice a month but i only have to pay the taxes quarterly   so between the time of incurring and the time of remitting paying the amount is held in the tax liability account   at the time that i remit payment to the irs the transaction will decrease both my checking account and also on the other end of the double entry my liability account to answer your question in short use an expense account for your other side account

wikipedia has a good summary historically branch banking in the united states especially interstate branch banking was viewed by regulatory authorities and this was codified with the enactment of the act of 1927 which specifically prohibited interstate banking over the next few decades some banks attempted to circumvent 's provisions by establishing bank holding companies that operated so called independent banks in multiple states to address this the bank holding company act of 1956 prohibited bank holding companies headquartered in one state from having branches in any other state most interstate banking prohibitions were repealed by the interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 research has also found that anticompetitive state provisions restricted out of state growth when those provisions were more restrictive than the provisions set by the interstate banking and branching efficiency act or by neighboring states some states have also had restrictive bank branch laws for example illinois outlawed branches other than the main office until 1967 and did not allow an unlimited number until 1993

this would clear out a lot more 1 leverage is the act of taking on debt in lieu of the equity you hold not always related to firms it applies to personal situations too when you take a loan you get a certain age of the loan the bank establishes your equity by looking at your past financial records and then decides the amount it is going to lend deciding on the safest leverage in the current action leverage is the whole act of borrowing yen and profiting from it the leverage factor mentions the amount of leverage happening 10000 yen being borrowed with an equity of 1000 yen 2 commercial banks 10 to 1 > they do n't deal in complicated investments derivatives except for hedging and are under stricter controls of the government they have to have certain amount of liquidity and can loan out the rest for business investment banks 30 to 1 > their main idea is making money and trade heavily their deposits are limited by the amount clients have deposited and as their main motive is to get maximum returns from the available amount they trade heavily derivatives one of the instruments are structured on underlyings and sometimes in multiple layers which build up quite a bit of leverage and all of the trades happen on margins you do n't invest $ 10k to buy $ 10k of a traded stock you put in maybe $ 500 to take up the position and borrow the rest of the amount per se it improves liquidity in the markets and increases efficiency else you could do only with what you have so these margins add up to the leverage the bank is taking on

your total debt is equal to your total non credit debt student loans car loans + your total available credit    this is the truth of the low balance fear from lenders that you had heard about your credit utilization is across all of your cards    so if you have two cards both with 15 k limits and one is maxed out and one is empty that is 50 utilization    if you have both cards with 7.5 k balances that is also 50 utilization for the 8 cards that are paid off and still open after you buy a house i 'd close any cards you are n't using   not everyone will agree with this if possible i would close the 8 cards now and pay off the 15 k balance before buying a house   if it 's hard to pay it off now it will be harder when you have a mortgage and home maintenance costs if you want to buy the house before you pay off all of your credit card debt i 'd still close the 8 cards that are already paid off and pay down your last card to 4 k or less to get under 25 utilization the credit rating bureaus do not publish exactly how a different utilization rate of credit will affect your score but it is known that lower utilization will improve your score   fico calls this proportion of credit lines used proportion of balances to total credit limits on certain types of revolving accounts also the longevity of your credit history is based on type of account credit cards car loans etc so if you keep one credit card open you still keep your long history with credit cards on your credit report   fico calls this time since accounts opened by specific type of account

the reason diversification in general is a benefit is easily seen in your first graph   while the purple line betterment 100 stock is always below the blue line s&p and the blue line is the superior return over the entire period it 's a bit different if you retired in 2009 is n't it   in that case the orange line is superior because its risk is much lower so it did n't drop much during the major crash   lowering risk and lowering return is a benefit the closer you get to retirement as you wo n't see as big a cumulative return from the large percentage but you could see a big temporary drop and need your income to be relatively stable if you 're living off it or soon going to    now you can certainly invest on your own in a diverse way and if you 're reasonably smart about it and have enough funds to avoid any fees you can almost certainly do better than a managed solution even a relatively lightly managed solution like betterment   they take .15 off the top so if you just did exactly the same as them you would end up .15 per year better off however not everyone is reasonably smart and not everyone has much in the way of funds betterment 's target audience are people who are n't terribly smart about investing and/or have very small amounts of funds to invest   plenty of people are n't able to work out how to do diversification on their own while they probably mostly are n't asking questions on this site they 're a large percentage of the population   it 's also work to diversify your portfolio you have to make minor changes every year at a minimum to ensure you have a nicely balanced portfolio   this is why target retirement date portfolios are very popular a bit higher cost similar to betterment roughly but no work required to diversify correctly and maintain that diversification

idk why the comment before this got -10 and this one got + 30 when it 's all in the same vein   anyway the truth of the matter is regardless if trump is correct or not finding good solutions is n't about democracy democracy is about mitigating the risks of concentrated political power and granting the people a chance to influence the nation    however effective problem solving and finding the truth is about placing powerful people in their respective positions while considering their qualified opinions not everyone 's opinion should matter believe it or not democracy of capital causes misallocation democracy of information causes misunderstanding and why because we have unqualified opinions a doctor has a qualified opinion on health care and in a way so does a patient and perhaps an insurance company but a plumber who spends little time with his children does n't belong on the school board and a teacher does n't necessarily know anything about the coal industry   in the end our country is operated like a giant sub reddit where of people upvote this and that just because they feel like it we get a lot of important things right but we get some critical things incredibly wrong these stack up and produce problems of immense proportions with seemingly no answer for example health care and the government 's recommendation for diet in public schools as obvious examples with simple solutions that no one likes or agrees with   anyway the whole nation is sick from head to toe and the remedy is not democracy democracy is an tool it is neutral how we use it is how we benefit from it

a lot of questions but all it boils down to is banks usually perform t+1 net settlements also called global netting as opposed to real time gross settlements   that means they promise the counterparty the money at some point in the future within the next few business days see delivery versus payment and collect all transactions of that kind for this example say they will have a net outflow of 10 m usd   the next day they will purchase 10 m usd on the fx market and hand it over to the global   note that this might be more than one transaction especially because the sums are usually larger another indian bank might have a 10 m usd inflow they too will use the fx market selling 10 m usd for inr probably picking a different time to the first bank   so the rates will most likely differ apart from the obvious bid ask difference the dollar rate they charge you is an average of their rate achieved when buying the usd plus some commission for their forex brokerage plus probably some fee for the service accessing the global netting system is n't free the fees should be clearly and separately stated on your bank statement and so should be the fx rate back to the second example obviously since it 's a different bank handing over or or if it was your own bank they would have internally netted the incoming with the outgoing the rate will be different but it 's still a once a day transaction   from the you get they will subtract the average fx achieved rate the fx commissions and again the service fee for the global netting   the fees alone mean that the usd inr sell rate is different from the buy rate

i do n't know how taxes work in israel but i imagine it is relatively similar to taxes in the us in the us you need to pay taxes on investment earnings when you sell them or in this case trade them for something of value the amount that would typically would be taxed on would be the difference between how much you paid for the currency and the value of the item you traded it for   in theory there should n't be any difference in trading bitcoins versus dollars or euros reality is that they are rather weird and i do n't know what category they would fall into are they a currency or a collectors item i think this is all rather hypothetical because there is no way for any government to track digital currencies and any taxes paid would be based on the honor system   i am not an account and the preceding was not tax advice

if it was me i would sell the house and use the proceeds to work on pay off the second    you do n't speak to your income but it must be pretty darn healthy to convince someone to lend you k on two homes   given this situation i am not sure what income i would have to have to feel comfortable   i am thinking around 500k year would start to make me feel okay but i would probably want it higher than that think i can rent out the 1st house for $ 1500 and after property management fees take home about $ 435 per month that is not including any additional taxes on that income or deductions based on repair work etc so this is why   given that your income is probably pretty high would something less than $ 435 really move your net worth needle   no   it is worth the reduction in risk to give up that amount of passive income   keeping the home opens you up to all kinds of risk   your $ 435 per month could easily evaporate into something negative given taxes likely rise in insurance rates and repairs   you have a great shovel to build wealth there is no reason to assume this kind of exposure   you will become wealthy if you invest and work to reduce your debt

first the single worst reason to do anything is because most people are doing it the second worst thing is to take tax advice from a non tax pro ironic i understand but read on run through your 2015 tax return do you itemize already if not there 's a reason the standard deduction for a couple is $ 12,600 in 2016 so a renter is n't likely to have enough deductions to itemize even with a high state tax   for 2016 project your total interest from the mortgage and the year 's property tax then add your state income tax and last any charitable donations this total comprises the bulk of what people take on their schedule a. now since your current withholding assumes the standard $ 12,600 subtract this number and you 're left with the amount your taxable income will be reduced for the fact that you have the house last divide this number by $ 4000 the result is how many more withholding allowances you can claim one personal exemption a withholding allowance is exactly $ 4050 this year   for what its worth median home price for early 2016 was $ after 20 down a $ 152 k mortgage would cost about $ 6000 in interest the first year and maybe $ 3000 in property tax the average couple making $ 60,000 or so wo n't have a state bill much over $ 3000 so shy of some nice donations it 's easy to have a house yet still not itemize   of course if you have higher income and a more expensive home the numbers will be different   the best you can do is to get tax software or use an online service and estimate the 2016 return based on your numbers if you wish to post numbers via an edit to your question i 'm happy to update my answer a bit to your situation   note the form you 'll use to adjust withholdings the w4 offers a worksheet to perform the calculation   it asks in line 1 for your total itemized deductions then subtract the standard deduction then divide by $ 4050 pretty much what i suggested above

my family members particularly my aunt his daughter are telling me that when my grandpa dies they are taking my car bring this up with grandpa   if this is what he wants to have happen then help him make it happen before you finish paying $ 12,000 on a car worth only $ 6,000   let the aunt and other relatives deal with the remaining $ 12,000 if that is n't what he wants to have happen then work out how you and he can legally make sure that what he wants to have happen actually happens if the aunt or others bring it up make sure they understand that you still owe $ 12,000 on the car and if they get the car they also get the loan   if they refuse to pay the loan then make sure they know you will cooperate with the bank when they attempt to repossess the car up to and including providing them with keys and location this will hurt your credit and you will be on the hook for the remaining portion of the loan but you at least wo n't have to deal with all of it they 'll sell it at auction and your loan amount will fall a little but the best course of action is to work with grandpa and make sure that he understands the family 's threats how that will affect you since you 're on the loan and what options you 'd like to pursue

well put and honestly seemingly unavoidable it will be crazy if it truly does come to fruition if they fed treasury realize that they can not inflate their way out of this by printing more money and all of the nay of massive deflation get proven wrong    so the better question is this we believe know it 's coming so how do we prepare and strategically place ourselves to survive profit prosper from the coming collapse   as i see it re is a crap investment for the foreseeable future as oversupply and are not absorbed people have to live so rentals will be key but they have already quite a bit    stocks will likely trade sideways for awhile before likely tanking as the forced willing withdrawals start happening from the boomers so keeping it in stocks does n't sound overly positive unless a fairly aggressive put strategy is enforced    bonds are paying crap and after taxes barely inflation    for me personally and selfishly i have 20 years minimum for retirement so i 'm fine the market trending sideways or down it means that i 'm getting more bang for my dca buck and 20 + years from now i will be well positioned when the market eventually cycles back up    but for now where do we put our investments to protect and hopefully grow them as the mid term passes

interns are not hired to do work they are hired so that people at the company can get a look at their abilities in a real situation not an interview before hiring them for real this way instead of 30 of your new hires being a dud it 's more like 5 because the bad ones were filtered out in the intern process if you are self motivated and good enough then it 's quite possible that you will start getting real work while you 're at the company as opposed to throwaway assignments that nobody cares about once you 're in that position it means they trust you to actually accomplish something and you will be viewed as a hopeful hire assuming you like the company getting into that position is half the value of the internship so i 'd take it as is with one caveat ask them about schedule flexibility ahead of time explicitly for the purpose of making sure your class schedule works if they 're a decent place to work for they will probably grant you that point outright edit one more note if you 've got a favor to burn save it use it if you like the place and need to ask them for an h1b sponsorship or any other kind of immigration assistance

i 'm having a hard time getting worked up over this case   the underlying issue is a serious one but this case is the wrong     gt the affidavit was false simply false the employee had made no such claim   gt the prosecutors alerted a major newspaper about the search so there are photographs of agents carrying boxes from your office   that 's not government error   that 's malfeasance   this pisses me off    gt the agent ’s statement was false   the federal agent lied and destroyed a company in the process the lawsuit was against the prosecutors who acted on good faith   why did n't he try to sue the agent who lied   the prosecutors have qualified immunity which they need in order to do their jobs   otherwise they 'd be spending all day in court defending themselves rather than prosecuting cases     gt the appeals court said evidence that knowingly traded on inside information would give authorities probable cause to conduct a search but it was n’t needed in order to get a warrant   gt the affidavit alleges that some of ’s employees had traded on inside information and that there was at least a fair probability to think that his office was among the lg premises where evidence of an insider trading scheme would be found the appeals court said referring to level global   that 's why the appeals court threw out the case   they said the lying officer only accelerated the warrant which would have been issued anyway

let me add another consideration to the company 's side of the equation   not only is a 401 k a tool for the company to make them competitive when recruiting employees among other companies that offer that benefit it is also a good retention tool most company 's 401 k plans include a vesting period of at least 3 years sometimes more an employee that leaves the company before they are vested in the plan will have to give up some of the employer matched funds in the account this gives employees incentive to stick around longer and the company reduces the risk of turnover which can be costly in terms of training and recruiting this also factors into the reason why employers would rather give matching on the 401 k than a simple pay raise some of those employees are going to leave during the vesting period anyway and when that happens the employer got the benefit of motivating the employee but in the end got to keep some of the money

despite buffett 's nearly perfect consistent advice over the past few decades they do n't reflect his earliest days   his modern philosophy seemed to in the 1970s you can see that buffett 's earliest days grew faster at for those partners willing to take on leverage with buffett than the last half century at not only is buffett limited by size as its quite difficult to squeeze one half trillion usd into sub billion usd investments but the economy thus market is far different than it was before the 1980s   he would have to acquire at least 500 billion usd companies outright and there simply are n't that many available that satisfy all of his modern conditions the market is much different now than it was when he first started at graham because before the 1960s the economy thus market would collapse and rebound about every few years   this sort of variance can actually help a value investor because a true value investor will abandon investments when valuations are high and go all in when valuations are low   the most extreme example was when he tried to as quietly as possible buy up an insurance company selling for something like a p e of 1 during one of the collapses   these kinds of opportunities are seldom available anymore not even during the 2009 collapse as he became larger those investments became off limits because it simply was n't worth his time to find such a high if it 's only a bare fraction of his wealth   also he started to deviate from benjamin graham 's methods and started to incorporate philip fisher 's by the 1970s his investment philosophy was more or less   he tried to balance graham 's avarice for price with fisher 's for value all of the commentary that special tax or cheap financing are central to his returns are false   they contributed but they are ancillary as one can see by comparing the limited vs general partners leverage helps enormously but this is still a tangent buffett has undoubtedly built his wealth from the nature of his investments   the exact blueprint can be constructed by reading every word he has published and any quotes he has not   simply he buys the highest quality companies in terms of risk adjusted growth at the best available prices   quantitatively it is a simple strategy to replicate   nflx was selling very cheaply during the sells frequently at low valuations up and coming retailers frequently sell at low valuations etc the key to buffett 's method is emotional control and removing the mental block that price equals value price is cost value is revenue and that concept is the hardest for most to   quoting from the first link one here it is extraordinary to me that the idea of buying dollar bills for 40 cents takes immediately to people or it does n't take at all it 's like an if it does n't grab a person right away i find that you can talk to him for years and show him records and it does n't make any difference they just do n't seem able to grasp the concept simple as it is a fellow like rick who had no formal education in business understands immediately the value approach to investing and he 's applying it five minutes later i 've never seen anyone who became a gradual convert over a ten year period to this approach it does n't seem to be a matter of iq or academic training it 's instant recognition or it is nothing and i 'm convinced that there is much inefficiency in the market these graham and investors have successfully exploited gaps between price and value when the price of a stock can be influenced by a herd on wall street with prices set at the margin by the most emotional person or the person or the most depressed person it is hard to argue that the market always prices rationally in fact market prices are frequently nonsensical and finally   success in investing does n’t correlate with once you ’re above the level of 25 once you have ordinary intelligence what you need is the temperament to control the that get other people into trouble in investing there is almost no information on any who has helped buffett internally or even managed berkshire 's investments aside from louis simpson it is unlikely that buffett has allowed anyone to manage much of berkshire 's investments considering the consistent stream of commentary from him claiming that he nearly does nothing except read annual reports all day to the extent that he may have neglected his family to some degree and that listening to others will more likely hurt performance than help with the most striking example being his father 's recommendation that he not open a hedge fund after retiring from graham because he believed the market was topping and he absolutely his father

there are many questions and good answers here regarding investment choices the first decision you need to make is how involved do you intend to be in investment activity if you plan to be actively investing by yourself you should look for questions here about making investment choices if you intend to be a more passive investor look for posts by bogleheads who focus on broad focused low cost investments this is the optimal choice for many people if you are not comfortable managing investments at all you need to figure out how to find a competent and reasonably priced financial advisor to meet with and guide your investment strategy this advice generally costs about 1 2 of your total managed assets annually

there is no need for micropayments monthly payments or harassment   a loan agreement can be drafted that your mom makes one payment annually to you instead of monthly payments depending on what she and you might be comfortable   with this payment could be interest only or partly interest and part repayment   of principal   or you can set it up so that there is a balloon payment due when   the loan say in five years time and she pays back the entire   principal and accumulated interest if you trust her to pay back the money   you do n't need to ask for collateral or security and you do n't need to turn the debt over to a collection agency or send large men with baseball bats to call on mom if you just want mom to return the principal when she is ready to so so and do n't really want to charge her interest then set up the loan to require annual payment of interest only and the entire principal at   the end of the agreement then each year a few days before the   interest payment is due send her a check for the interest due as a gift   mom deposits the check in her account and sends back the interest payment to you so no harm no foul you have   made her a gift presumably less than the $ 13 k exemption she has paid you interest but there is no net transfer of money and as far as the irs are concerned this is a legitimate loan do keep copies of the paperwork though and be sure to report the interest payment on your income tax returns as income to you by extension if you do n't really want the money back set up the loan so that the annual payment is $ 13 k and is part the annual interest due and part the principal until the loan is paid off

assuming you are in the us and are an average joe the answer to your question is no investment costs do not reduce your taxable income for the year you make the investment they do factor in to the cost basis of your investment and so will affect your taxes in the year you sell the investment if you want to reduce your taxable income you could contribute the $ 5000 to a traditional ira or 401k assuming you qualify depending on where the account is held you may then be able to use that $ 5k to purchase stock in the company you are interested in the stock would be held in your ira or 401k account and would be subject to more restrictions than a normal brokerage account

disclaimer i am not an attorney and i have not 100 researched the law take any advise from an online forum with a grain of salt please consult an attorney tax specialist or the irs directly for any concrete answers afaik there is n't anything that would prevent you from starting a business simply owing back taxes should n't make a difference on how you make money whether that is working for yourself or someone else all the irs is concerned about at this point is that you still owe them when going through the process of forming an llc a couple of years back i do n't recall any personal tax information being brought up except when we were discussing possible loan options regarding loan options one important issue you may come into is if the irs has filed a lien against you a federal tax lien is the government ’s legal claim against your property when you neglect or fail to pay a tax debt the lien protects the government ’s interest in all your property including real estate personal property and financial assets a lien will exist on your credit report for 7 years after it is released the irs releases your lien within 30 days after you have paid your tax debt with a lien it will be very difficult to get a loan or other financing for your small business if this ends up being the case you can try to get a discharge or subordination on specific property that would allow lenders a claim on your property ahead of the irs otherwise you may find yourself relying solely on what money you currently have a big point is the irs 's threshold on filing a lien is $ 10,000 the fresh start initiative increased the irs notice of federal tax lien filing threshold from $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 however notices of federal tax liens may still be filed on amounts less than $ 10,000 when circumstances warrant since you currently owe over the past 3 years it is possible that adding another year in back taxes will cause the irs to file a lien if they have not yet already done so so it may be something to keep an eye on if you do plan on taking out a loan for your business

here is what i did and what i sent to my daughter    here is how to freeze your credit with the three reporting companies   1   transunion easiest and free go to if the site is down you may have to try later like late at night you will have to register on the site to do this i think on this one you need to also give them your previous address 2 equifax not so easy but works online costs $ 10 note your cost may vary depending on your state go to you will have to register i think this the one does not require the previous address because you have been in at our location for more than 2 years even though there is a section for it   3 experian toughest one to get done website is currently broken costs $ 10 note your cost may vary depending on your state   you will need to do it by phone takes 12 15 mins to get through the menus call 888 note there are long silent periods so do not hang up if they do disconnect you it should be right at the beginning and you just have to call back you will need to have your credit card number ready to enter at the end and you need to key in the digits fairly quickly do not pause once you start entering them and it will ask for a four digit expiration date for example aug 2019 is on the card

i 'm a manager of a charity shop so work with a wide range of unpaid volunteers which requires an especially soft touch most of the time everyone is different or people will just leave   it takes longer but the overall results are better and more long lasting     think of it like pushing a boat from the with your hand always applying a small pressure to get the boat to gradually move where you want rather than ramming into the side of a boat with a truck sure it 'll get you there quicker but will cause lasting damage   it 's also best to take it slow as you need time to learn the business and people   be clear about your approach with your boss managing their expectations is important   anyway here is what i 've learnt in my first year or so doing this job plus things i 've learnt along the way in my previous career as a software engineer radical career change where i 've managed people and been managed   1 be yourself   do n't pretend to be someone you 're not everyone will see right through you in an instant   you 'll change over time as you get used to managing people that 's fine but always be yourself through that   1 say thank you to everyone at the end of each day as you say goodbye   mean it   think of all the work they 've done today for you   1 spread the shit evenly   every job has crap parts make sure you and everyone else gets their fair share and no more   i regularly hoover clean the bathroom wash up and so on   1 ask do n't tell   if you orders people will do them but they 'll put no effort into it and you 'll distance yourself from them   ask if they could do something for you   it 's a nobody ever says no unless there is an issue which you need to deal with anyway   1 pick your battles   is it worth moaning at someone for that little   or can you get over that message another way   i.e. i do n't like people having drinks on the till counter so when i take over to cover for them for a break i just move it   after a while no drinks appear on the counter   1 be honest   if you do n't know say so ask for input   weigh up the options out loud then pick one explain why and go for it or better yet get the person that thought of it working with you not for you to implement it   if you 're wrong hold your hand up and try the other   1 always take responsibility when things go wrong that is actually your job   when things go well use you and   if things go badly sometimes i sometimes we but never   1 always be pro active with money   if you owe your staff money for any reason chase them to give it to them never let them chase you   if there even might be any problems at all with money let everyone know as soon as you know   go out of your way to ensure they get what they 're owed now not later   i just did this today actually i forgot to do expenses for someone and switched over the till so there was n't enough cash in the new till to cover it so i just took it from the money to bank and marked down why there was a discrepancy on the paperwork and will do the same tomorrow when that does n't match by the opposite amount   i should not do this at all but it 's the right thing to do   1 listen carefully   often employees have problems but wo n't bring them up either they do n't think anything will get done or they do n't want to get someone in trouble or something else   however if you listen and observe carefully often there are clues to the things that are bothering them and you 'll find ways to tackle them   1 do n't run a team meeting until you know everyone if you can avoid it   you do n't know shit about how the company works who the people are what makes them tick what they do and so on   all you 'll do is come across as a bit of a tool and distance yourself from them as boss   when you do run one just guide it do n't lead it   always hand over control of the conversation as much as possible except of course where you 've got things that they need to hear   1 never joke about your power   i.e. do n't mess about saying how you 'll fire them if blah or how you 'll give them all the shit work or mention pay etc   i had a boss that did that when drunk not in a serious way at all and he was very widely hated for pretty well nothing other than that   it served as a constant reminder that he 's separate from us   1 give people room but do n't be taken for a ride   if someone is late once fine i would n't even mention it   late again maybe i 'd make a light joke of it   late again we 'll have a chat always listen to what they have to say is there any way you can help   but do n't be taken for a ride   i 've had people pick me up on being late the very first time i was late and you know what i was more late for that job from then on than i 've ever been before or since   1 try to get your employees to come up with ideas to move the business forwards   it 's very easy to look at a business and say we need this that and the other doing like this   but you need to get your employees to buy into it or they just wo n't do it properly   it 'll be like getting blood out of a stone to start with but if you 're patient and support their ideas most people will come around   you need their input as they know their job better than you   1 edit always be clear what you want from people when   speak with them about the before hand to make sure they 're comfortable with it and think it can be done in the time   so many times i 've been given tasks with unrealistic deadlines the manager has n't wanted to listen to my protests then wonders why it did n't get done in time   it 's crazy really wanting something to be possible does n't make it so   a not so quick example   one volunteer said to me that we should halve the price of all the fiction books to .99 to compete with other shops   i personally do n't think that 's a good idea our shop has better quality stock and is much more organised but i have no evidence to the contrary and i honestly do n't really know so i say go for it and support it completely as a good idea   we tried it for a month and we made exactly the same amount of money sold twice as many books but no extra cash   so it was valuable to do and we discovered that maybe 1.49 might be a good option to try   but far more importantly they saw their ideas put into action right away and saw the results of that   it empowered them which is incredibly important for a wide variety of reasons that are too much to go into here but basically it makes them feel more respected enjoy their job more think more about the business and so on you know what it 's like when you 're empowered how good it feels   however it 's being empowered with the support that 's important something which you personally going into your new job do n't feel you have which leads to the anxiety and so on i 'm sure you 're feeling now   do n't put your employees in that position if you can help it   there is also another reason why i outright supported their idea from the offset   it did n't work although we did n't loose anything and i thought it would n't but i can say we tried   it was n't down to that one person they did n't feel bad that it did n't work because i was right behind it and it 's my job to take responsibility   if it had been their idea that had failed they would n't give any ideas ever again and everyone else would be put off too   as soon as anyone tries to take personal responsibility and they will stick to your guns in supporting them stronger than ever   now we 're getting a lot of ideas all the time they 're having in depth discussions amongst each other they 're pro active and so on   as a business we 're doing much better now because of it profits are up 15 from last year and we 've only just begun to kick things off and that 's going against a national trend downwards   we 've had several critical changes to our shop layout back room organisation results reporting stock handling processes and so on all from volunteer ideas and feedback   so the 15 is actually the tip of the iceberg what we 've got in place now should allow us to grow more quickly too   and remember you can make suggestions too of course but they 're just that suggestions   suggest them to your employees speak with several of them then get back to them when you 've made a decision   do n't say i 'm thinking of trying this say i was just thinking what about this   do you think it would work and talk about it   think of arguments against your idea see if they counter them and so on   now how many of these changes did i think of before hand and want to enact   about half so we 've got a significant number of successful ideas that i personally had n't thought of everyone 's happier and working harder for the business and we have a bright future   i have more ideas too and people listen to and respect them now just like i have with them   i think that 's the key to it all really   show your employees respect and they 'll show you it in return

i assume you 've looked into gold as an asset class which is considered to be a good in your portfolio at about 5 of investments because there are a lot of opinions around about that   but in terms of physical vs paper gold investment my experience has been that they 'll absolutely kill you on fees if you 're not careful i had a broker try and charge me $ they do it in the margins though so they 'll just sell at say $ 1,350 but buy at $ 1,200 just make sure you either know the market price when you walk in and stick to your guns or lock in a price ahead of time

i came to us as an international student several years ago and i have also experienced the same situation like most of the international students in finding ways to build credit history below i list out some possible approaches you may want to consider i. get a student job at campus recommended i think the best way is to get a student job in university say a teaching assistant or student helper in this case you can be provided with a social security number and start to build your own credit history ii get credit card you can also consider to apply for a credit card there are indeed some financial institutions that can provide credit cards for international students with no or limited credit scores requirement say discover and bank of america however it is relatively hard to get approved simply because hey may put more restriction in other aspects for example you may be required to keep sufficient bank balance above several thousand dollars during a period of time or you should prove that you have relatives with citizenship in us who can provide your financial aid if needed iii apply for a loan recommended getting a loan product is another alternative to get out of this difficult situation but most of people do n’t realize that there are some fintech start ups in united states that specifically focus on international loan financing one representative example is an online lending company that specializes in providing car loan for international students with no ssn or credit history i once used their loan product to finance a honda accord and reported my loan transaction records to us credit bureau during my repayment process later when i officially got my ssn number i found my credit history has been automatically and i do n’t have to start from all over again it never be an easy journey for international students to build credit history in united states what approach you should make really depends on you own situation i hope the information above can be useful and good luck for your credit journey

think again     all prosperity ultimately comes from the generation -the of wealth     we create wealth out of the ether when we take a thing physical which is worth little and turn it into a thing that is worth more with the power of an idea and the application of labor   on a macro scale that translates into the manufacturing sector   the manufacturing sector in the us has changed it 's not gone   it 's spectacularly healthy in a of new ways while all the old ones have died off or are dying a slow death   the new manufacturing sector demands skill not just attendance   unskilled work is drying up because under current laws unskilled people cost more to employ than they can possibly produce but someone with a skill in trade can get a job in half a heartbeat especially if they are willing to move to where the job is   no nation of any size can prosper without the internal generation of real wealth   the idea that we can be a nation of bankers and managers is laughable and is precisely what got us into our current situation   the future is and will always be in making new things   labor is not a word and it does not equate to a second class existence as pay rates are currently demonstrating   it was geniuses working in the trades who were the innovators and entrepreneurs that built american industrial power thus economic power in the first place     it will be again

to issue corporate grade bonds the approval process very nearly matches that for issuing corporate equity you must register with the sec and then generally there is a initial debt offering similar to an ipo i say similar in terms of the process itself but the actual sale of bonds is nothing like that for equities it would be rare for a partnership to be that large as to issue debt in the form of bonds although there are some that are pretty big but i suppose it is possible as long as they want to file with the sec    beyond that a business could privately place bonds with a large investor but there is still registration requirements with the sec   all that being said it is also pretty rare for public bonds to be issued by a company that does n't already have public equity and the amounts we are talking about here are huge the most common trade in corporate debt is a round lot of 100,000 so this is n't something a small corporation would have access to or have a need for generally financing for a smaller business comes from a bank

this question is predicated on the assumption that investors prefer dividends as this depends on who you 're speaking to   some investors prefer growth stocks some which do n't pay dividends so in this case we 're covering the percent of investors who like dividend paying stocks it depends on who you ask and it also depends on how self aware they are because some people may give reasons that make little financial sense   the two major benefits that i hear are fundamentally psychological dividends are like mini paychecks   since people get a from receiving a paycheck i would predict the same holds true for receiving dividends   more than likely the brain feels a reward when getting dividends even if the dividend stock performs lower than a growth stock for a decade the experience of receiving dividends may feel more rewarding plus depending on the institution they may get a report or see the tax information for the year and that also feels good some value investors do n't reinvest dividends as they believe the price of the stock matters stocks are either cheap or expensive and automatic reinvestment to these investors implies that the price of a stock does n't matter so dividends allow them to rebuild their cash after a buy   they can either buy more shares if the stock is cheap or keep the cash if the stock is expensive   think about warren buffett here he purchased $ 3 billion worth of shares of wells fargo at approximately $ 8 12 a share in 2009 from my memory as people were shocked that be bought into a bank when no one liked banks   consider how much money he makes from dividends off that purchase alone and if he were to currently believe wells fargo was overpriced he could keep the cash and buy something else he believes is cheaper   in these cases dividends automatically build cash post buying and many value investors believe that one should always have cash on hand this second point is a little tricky because it can involve risk assessment some investors believe that high dividend paying stocks like mo wo n't experience the huge declines of indexes like the spy   mo routed the spy in 2009 29 vs. 19 and these investors believe that 's because it 's yield was too desired it feels safer to them the index side would argue but what happens in the long run   the problem i have with this argument which is frequent is that it does n't hold true for every high yield stock though some high yield stocks do show strong resistance levels during bear markets

i usually would not say this but if you can just put down 20 i would do that and get a 15 year mortgage   the rates are so low on 15 year mortgage that you should be able to make more than the 3 in the market per year and make some money   i would n't be surprised if for 1/2 of the term of your loan you will be able to make that just in interest   basically i have done this for my house and my rental properties   so i have put my money where my mouth is on this    i have made over 9 each of the last three years which has made me $ 12,000 dollars above and beyond over what i would have paid in interest per year   so it a decision that net me $ 36,000 for doing nothing   now the market is going to be down some of those years so lets see how it works out but i have history on my side   its not about timing the market its about time in the market   and 15 years in the market is a pretty safe bet albeit not as safe as just dumping you money in the mortgage

money laundering alarms would definitely be raised way before you walking in with the cash to deposit every cash transaction over $ 10 k will be reported by the bank and not only banks have to report so the report will be sent when you withdraw the money as well but if the money is legitimately yours and you can show the sources then you should n't be worried there 's no law against having cash its just very hard to track down the cash money sources and if someone asks you and you can not show the proofs the problem would definitely be yours

i 'm curious so i 'm going to calculate it for my area i 'm in an average priced metro and a 2 bedroom apartment out here is going to cost you at least $ 1400 700 each with a and that 's if you go minutes from downtown it does n't really drop off any more than that the further you go out you 'll also still need renters insurance and to cover half the utilities lets tack on another $ 75 here conservatively at that far out you need a car and the insurance gas and maintenance costs that go with it assuming you go with something cheap say $ 5k with a payment around $ 120 a month + $ 60 a month for insurance another $ 60 for gas and accruing $ 30 a month for maintenance you 're going to need a cell phone and if you 're on a plan alone it 's not cheap with the big 4 providers so you 'll go with someone smaller for $ 50 a month even though the service is mediocre you 'll need to eat so being cheap and buying store brands and sale items you get your groceries down to $ 120 a month so that should cover the bottom level of 's pyramid which is far from glamorous that puts your living costs at $ a month being that it is a major metro minimum wage within the city is $ assuming you have a job that 's 40 hours a week that puts you at $ a month before taxes are withheld since you make so little taxes would only be around $ a month that leaves $ 49 for saving spending emergencies i live in a state that has very good support for the aca as well so the $ 300 credit roughly covers the cost of the monthly premium the deductible is obviously still impossible to pay but you do n't get hit with the penalty at year end and the hospital still gets mostly paid and you might just be able to avoid bankruptcy if the hospital is willing to negotiate the payment plan with you   so what are the conclusions here it 's possible to skate by for a short while assuming you can live without any social life stay healthy and have no emergencies   you also need the self discipline of a monk and to live in an area that supports a minimum wage relative to living costs and the aca

credit scoring has changed since the time of this question july 2017 and it is now possible that having a high available credit balance can negatively affect your credit score vantagescore will now mark a borrower negatively for having    excessively large credit card limits on the theory that the person    could run up a high credit card debt quickly those who have prime    credit scores may be hurt the most since they are most likely to have    multiple cards open but those who like to play the credit card    rewards program points game could be affected as well source

i mean it has n't really worked anywhere you do n't create wealth with socialism incentives are gone for any sort value creation   you 're already looking backwards at peak civilization once you 've gone down the socialism path everything ahead is fighting over what 's left   gt;an economics professor at texas tech said he had never failed a single student before but had once failed an entire class the class had insisted that socialism worked and that no one would be poor and no one would be rich a great the professor then said ok we will have an experiment in this class on socialism all grades would be averaged and everyone would receive the same grade so no one would fail and no one would receive an a.    gt;after the first test the grades were averaged and everyone got a b. the students who studied hard were upset and the students who studied little were happy but as the second test rolled around the students who studied little had studied even less and the ones who studied hard decided they wanted a free ride too so they studied little    gt;the second test average was a d no one was happy when the 3rd test rolled around the average was an f. the scores never increased as blame name calling all resulted in hard feelings and no one would study for anyone else all failed to their great surprise and the professor told them that socialism would ultimately fail because the harder to succeed the greater the reward but when a government takes all the reward away no one will try or succeed

i like a devil 's advocate   gt amazon made a brick and mortar acquisition which will now have a direct effect on consumers by trying to hamper which sites their customers try to access while on wifi and can also be seen as anticompetitive   this statement assumes that amazon intends to use the patented technology despite no evidence of such intent at the time of filing at the time the patent was granted which amazon has no control over or at the time of the wf purchase announcement   your reasoning has merit the patent only became relevant when amazon acquired an opportunity to use it    however it relies on assumptions that are n't necessarily correct or complete hence it is n't an objectively correct conclusion by any means    by including only the fact that the patent was recently granted timing lined up with wf acquisition the author promoted the idea that the patent is part of amazon 's plan with wf going forward    amazon may now have plans for using it in connection with wf or it may absolutely not there is presently working from the article itself no evidence to suggest any such plans exist outside the author 's mind i have zero doubt that they have considered using it btw i refer to actual plans to implement   i may be old fashioned or but the correct way to frame the situation is always completely and accurately including all relevant information     this allows readers to review the information and draw their own conclusions even if the journalist also shares his own conclusion

once you declare the amount the cbp officials will ask you the source and purpose of funds you must be able to demonstrate that the source of funds is legitimate and not the proceeds of crime and it is not for the purposes of financing terrorism once they have determined that the source and purpose is legitimate they will take you to a private room where two officers will count and validate the amount as it is a large amount and then return the currency to you for nominal amounts they count it at the cbp officer 's inspection desk once they have done that you are free to go on your way the rule for the us is any currency or monetary instrument that is above the equivalent of 10,000 usd so this will also apply if you are carrying a combination of gbp eur and usd that totals to more than $ 10,000

if i own shares of a company am i entitled to apply as position of    ceo sure but anybody else can apply too who decides the corporate board of directors who are nominally chosen by a vote of the stockholders i say nominally because in practice they are nominated by the current ceo and it 's very rare for stockholders to veto the ceo 's choice once in a while a group of stockholders will their own candidate for the board but they rarely win i 'd like to think there 's some socio corporate or investor relationship advantage to working or having the option to work in certain positions in said company especially by privilege or total outstanding share ownership numbers why simply holding a large number of shares does n't necessarily mean you know anything about running the business

in 1970 lots of people supported one senior on social security    now comparatively few people support that one senior   in the future demographic projections say we 're going to get to the point where there 's more than one senior on social security per working taxpayer   this is expected to be a problem since it 's a lot easier for a government to pay for one $ 5k social security check on five peoples $ 3k tax payment than it is for them to pay for one $ 5k ss check on three peoples $ 3k tax payment and everyone 's scratching their head wondering how they 're going to pay for one $ 5k ss check on one person 's $ 3k tax payment   these numbers are of course made up intended more as an illustration of the issue than an accurate summary of the numbers involved

okay you win the argument   i say this because i am giving up   the problem is this   seriously think about what i 'm saying   i say i have a problem with the way the system is   you say no this is wrong you should n't have a problem with how the system is because and then you go and describe the parts of the system and the reasons given for why those parts are the way they are   okay   that 's not an argument   that 's on a definition   your arguments are n't your own and that 's what proves you do n't know what you 're talking about   you need to stop pretending that because you just learned how there 's a money multiplier it must be this way because of some law of economics   it 's not   did you know that in the middle east for example they do not have this banking system   i 'm not trying to start an argument about the better system my point is that dude you do n't even know that and it undermines this whole determined little financial ecosystem you 're just assuming is a law of economic nature   also i never brought up any supposed need to go to a gold standard but nice try   further proof you are not really reading what i 'm saying and making assumptions   why   because you 're gullible and anything that seems establishment or widely accepted that 's what you go along with   everyone who is critical of the federal reserve system and its existence must be a tinfoil hat wearing anti who believes 9/11 was done by aliens   i get it believe me   if the fed 's job is to prevent the economy from collapsing overnight due to fluctuations in the price of money when why did it not collapse overnight before the fed existed   wait no   i 'm done   you win   this is all in your imagination anyway so i 'll let you have it   please go back and read my posts and just once sit back and say okay can i see any of this from this guy 's perspective   also we did not abandon the gold standard at bretton woods   seriously wtf   ugh i ca n't help you   go on and look up stuff you just learned and keep pretending to argue with people by something someone else said that sounds relevant into a paragraph with no real understanding of what you 're saying

because that s not how insurance works yes they make a profit but the only reason any single person can get a policy is because there is a pool of people large enough to spread the risk that means there needs to be healthy people too the bigger the pool the lower the cost if you 're still pissy at that point that it 's expensive it 's not the insurance company at that point its the actual costs of medical care that are expensive and require a policy as expensive as it is to cover those costs

staying in idaho you could pursue some additional degree and try to get a job with a bank in the area as an investment advisor of some sort however i have doubts as to whether or not you 'd be able to employ your creativity and test your own instincts in that sort of a position if you really want to get into the big money investment sector i 'd suggest a move to a financial hub chicago new york san francisco and getting a job programming for a big firm after obtaining some experience there you may be able to transfer to a more investment oriented position at the same firm or another and from there to a position where you can unleash your talent assuming you have some putting a degree in finance somewhere in the mix would help too consider the following you want to make $ low by running a fund with a 1 expense ratio high investing other peoples money you 're dealing with at least $ 5 million that 's a good chunk of change to be entrusted with that kind of money is kind of a big deal and you 'll need to get some people to believe in your capabilities you 're not likely to get that kind of trust working out of boise even if you 're just doing research for some fund manager you 're not likely to find too many of those in boise either

if thinking about it like a business you normally only pay taxes on net income not gross   so gross being all the money that comes in people giving you cash checks whatever get deposited into your account you then pay that out to other people for services advertisement at the end of the day what is left would be your profit and you would be expected to pay income tax on that   if you are just an individual and do n't have an llc set up or any business structure you would usually just have an extra page to fill out on your taxes with this info i think it 's a schedule c but not 100

from a budgeting perspective the emergency fund is a category in which you 've budgeted funds for the unexpected   these are things that were n't able to be predicted and budgeted for in advance or things that exceeded the expected costs   for example you might budget $ 150 per month for car maintenance and typically spend some of it while the rest builds up over time for unexpected repairs so you have a few hundred available for that   but this month your transmission died and you have a $ 3,000 bill you 'll then fund most of this out of your emergency fund   this does n't cover where to store that money though which leads me to my next point   emergencies are emergencies because they come without warning without you having a chance to plan the primary things you want in an emergency fund account are stability and quick access   you can structure investments to be whatever you think of as safe or stable but you do n't want to be thinking about whether it 's a good time to sell when you need the money right now   but the bigger problem is access when you need the funds on a weekend holiday anytime outside of market hours you 're not going to be able to just sell some stocks and go to an atm this is the reason why it 's recommended to have these funds in a checking or savings account usually the reason i mentioned the budgeting side first is because i wanted to point out that if you 're budgeting well most of the unexpected expenses you have should have been expected in a sense you can still plan for something without knowing when or if it will happen   so in the example of a car repair ideally you 're already budgeting for possible repairs if you own a home you 're budgeting for things that would go wrong budgeting for speeding tickets for surprise out of pocket medical costs etc these then become part of your normal budget they are n't part of the emergency fund anymore   the bright side about budgeting for something unexpected is that you know what that money is for and do you likely also know how quickly you 'll need it for example you know if you have unexpected medical costs that happen very quickly you 're not likely you need a bag of cash on a moment 's notice   so those last two points lead to the fact that your actual emergency fund the dollars that are for things you simply could not foresee will be relatively small a few thousand dollars or so in most cases if you 've got things structured like this you 'll be happy to have a few grand available at a moment 's notice   the bulk of the money you would use for other surprise expenses or things like 6 months of living expenses is represented in other specific categories and you already know the timeframe in which you need it probably enough time that it could be invested risk to taste in short by expecting the unexpected you can sidestep this issue and not worry so much about missed returns on the emergency fund

for an investment to appreciate in value one of two things needs to happen 1 demand for that particular item needs to increase 2 the supply of that item needs to decrease houses are good because everyone needs a place to live but there is a finite amount of land   no matter how much you invest in real estate ai n't   the trick there is to find an area that people are going to want to live in when you 're ready to sell   specific of wines and spirits are another good example because it 's literally impossible to create more of that vintage cars and most consumer goods usually do n't appreciate because they do n't last long enough   most cars are resold within three to five years after the initial purchase   this is also why jewelry is a good investment properly cared for it can last centuries without wearing out so look for something durable that has a limited supply

in theory yes so as long as someone will accept you as a very mature student you plan to never earn over a year for the next 30 years no longer wiped out at 65 you could get a loan slightly unless you fancy doing the course also if you did have to start paying it back since interest rates are currently 6.1 this means the loan is doubling potentially just under every 12 years approx as to the side question of is it fraud   i could n't say   is a student getting maximum loans but planning on being a jobless bum for the rest of their lives and never paying back loans also committing fraud   one could argue yes but i do n't believe a lack of ambition is currently illegal

none of that is filtered my way as a part owner sure it is it 's just not always obvious when a company makes money it either other then the fourth option the first three all increase the total value of the company   if you owned 1 of a company that was worth x and is now worth x+1 the value of that 1 ownership should go up as well one model of the value of a share of stock is the present value of all future cash flows that the company produces for its shareholders which would be either through dividends earnings provided that they are invested back into the company or through liquidation sale   so as earnings increase or more accurately as projected future earnings increase so does the value of a share of the company also note that the payment of dividends causes the price of a stock to go down when the dividend is paid since that 's equity cash that 's leaving the company reducing the value of the company by an equivalent amount of course there 's also something to be said for the behavioral aspect of investing meaning that people sometimes invest in companies that they like and sell stock of companies that they do n't like or disagree with e.g. 's

it 's not like most of the people working there will care if obama loses his job the chief position of a government agency who is selected by potus often is n't a person liked by the rest of the agency and they could n't care less if he was changed in 2013   for example in the cia the director was always chosen by the president and thusly the rest of the cia usually do n't fully respect them since they are just some random person from outside the agency who was put into power for political reasons they do n't like the director and likewise do n't care if potus changes and the director gets fired by the new guy    my point is that entire government agencies are not lying and cheating just to keep obama in office just because the director was appointed by obama does n't mean the entire organization will lie to help obama    i mean what if romney gets elected will the entire agency and it 's hundreds thousands of employees now immediately do a 180 and lie and cheat to keep romney in power the same workers that were doing illegal things to help obama and now going to on a whim break laws to help romney    these agencies are not machines they are made of hundreds of real people each with their own views just because obama chose the director does n't mean all those people are now his slaves willing to lie and cheat to help him    what 's to stop one of them from leaking the story to the media i would think there has to be at least one republican working there if the director told everyone that this quarter they were all going to lie to help obama stay in power pretty sure any republicans in the agency would leak that to the media if that story got out obama would be    no way the entire agency would go forward with a lie to help obama

to answer your question as far as what 's available in addition to your 401(k at work most financial types will say to contribute up to the match first you may qualify for a roth ira qualification is based on income if not then you may have to go with a traditional ira   you and your husband can each have one and contribute up to the limit each year   after that you could get just a straight up mutual fund and/or contribute up to limit on your 401(k my two cents this may sound counter intuitive and i 'm sure some folks will disagree but instead of contributing to your 401(k now take whatever that amount is and use it to pay extra on the car loan   also take the extra being paid on the mortgage and pay it on the car loan too   once the car loan is paid off then set aside 15 of your gross income and use that amount to start your retirement investing    any additional money beyond this can then go into the mortgage   once it 's paid off then you can take the extra you were paying plus the mortgage and invest that amount into mutual funds you may want to check out chris 's retire inspired book or podcast as well

i hate to say it and i will probably be downvoted to oblivion but i do n't think you can do anything   i 'm not an expert so i might be wrong but if greece or any euro country for that matters decides to exit the euro the currency will be dead within the week that from what i 've read in various newspapers will be an incredibly bad news for the european economy which will collapse in a very short period of time then the collapse would propagate more or less slowly more or less significantly to other economies especially china and us possibly middle east too   at that point you well we have a major economic would it really matter if you had a tiny bit more money than your neighbour if production stops goods do n't move that much anymore and your country is generally in such a deep shit that the potato famine will look like a day in   i agree with what other people are saying they will not allow the euro to fall they sounds like hidden but even if european leaders have taught us that we can expect the worse from them 2 world wars in the last centuries are just the quicker reminder of their stupidity there 's the americans the and so on   i think the worst thing you or anyone else in europe can do is panicking and moving their money around if the exchange rate with the euro is not fixed and nothing is you still have a chance to lose a significant amount of money in the short medium run in a worst case scenario   chill relax if you 're really desperate and think that things will go bad try turning a hobby into another job especially if you can do it online and can bring you a steady income eventually   tl dr if the world economy collapse you will still lose money live happy chill

that is such a vague statement i highly recommend disregarding it entirely as it is impossible to know what they meant their goal is to convince you that index funds are the way to go but depending on what they consider an active trader they may be supporting their claim with irrelevant data their definition of active trader could mean any one or more of the following 1 retail investor 2 day trader 3 mutual fund 4 professional investor 5 fund continuously changing its position 6 hedge fund i will go through all of these 1 most retail traders lose money there are many reasons for this some rely on technical strategies that are largely unproven some buy rumors on penny stocks in hopes of making a quick buck some follow scammers on twitter who sell newsletters full of bogus stock tips some ca nt get around the psychology of trading and thus close out losing positions late and winning positions early or never at all i myself use to do this i am certain 99 of retail traders ca nt beat the market because most of them to be frank put less effort into deciding what to trade than in deciding what to have for lunch even though your pension funds presentation is correct with respect to retail traders it is largely irrelevant as professionals managing your money should not fall into any of these traps 2 i call day traders active traders but its likely not what your pension fund was referring to day trading is an entirely different animal to long or medium term investing and thus i also think the typical performance is irrelevant as they are not going to manage your money like a day trader anyway so the important question becomes do active funds lose 99 of the time compared to index funds no no no no according to the wsj actively managed funds outperformed passive funds in 2007 2009 2013 2015 2010 was basically a tie so 5 out of 9 years i do nt have a calculator on me but i believe that is less than 99    what s interesting is that this false belief that index funds are always better has become so pervasive that you can see active funds have huge outflows and passive have huge inflows it is becoming a crowded trade i will spare you the about large crowds and small doors also index funds are so heavily weighted towards a handful of stocks that you end up becoming a anyway the s&p is almost indistinguishable from aapl earlier this year only 6 stocks were responsible for over 100 of gains in the nasdaq index do nt think fb has a good long term business model or that gilead and amzn are a cheap buy well too bad if you bought qqq because those 3 stocks are your now see here 6 that graphic is for mutual funds but your pension fund may have also been including hedge funds in their 99 figure while many do nt beat their own benchmark its less than 99 and there are reasons for it many have investors that are impatient fortress just had to close one of its funds whose bets may actually pay off years from now but too many people wanted their money out some hedge funds also have rules eg long only which can really limit your performance while important to be aware of this that placing your money with a hedge fund may not beat a benchmark that does not automatically mean you should go with an index fund so when are index funds useful when you do nt want to do any thinking when you do nt want to follow market news at all then they are appropriate

i know a guy on a much higher rate than me about £ 500 per day and he claims to pay around 18 tax which has me bewildered he will be showing expenses which are deductible check with your accountant about expenses which can be legally claimed as expenses this is the main benefit of operating through a limited company business expenses can be claimed which you can not do if you are a permanent employee your friend might also be claiming false expenses with a shady accountant if hmrc does decide to give a call he might have to pay n times the money he has saved till now and my suggestion is always ask your accountant first knows the legal stuff so would give you the legally correct options if you are n't comfortable with you can always change accountants holiday pay sick pay and job security you miss those that is why you are paid at a rate much higher than an employee   benefit of a limited company   you can arrange your salary to pay no paye and take the rest as dividends you have to pay paye on that secondly if you have a all of you can be paid dividends without paying you do n't cross the threshold

most other countries are worse off     your perception of what is a resource intensive lifestyle does not take into consideration future innovation or     government debt is large but not insurmountable   much of it is owned by the government itself social security trust fund and the federal reserve and by domestic banks    the crumbling infrastructure claim is often made but is rarely well so it 's hard to respond to     entitlements is a bit more complicated an issue due to political gridlock but i expect that at least minor changes will be made gradually that will help deal with this problem   if not major reform small things like pushing back the benefit age a year here and a year there repealing benefits for the wealthy reducing the size of cost of living adjustments reducing the amount that is paid out to higher earning recipients increasing the amount of yearly income that is subject to fica   these are piecemeal changes that both sides could agree to even in the current political climate   medicare is the bigger cost but how to deal with that is difficult to determine considering what 's going on with obamacare   municipal and state governments will not fail if they go bankrupt   most municipalities and states are able to balance a budget   it can be done but in some place it is n't because politicians do n't have enough backbone to say no   when they go bankrupt and are unable to borrow money they will have no choice and can blame their cuts on the banks who wo n't loan them money   that is unless the people running the federal government also have no backbone and decide to bail them out in which case we will have an enormous case of moral hazard on our hands   the economic dominoes in europe and china are not damaging the core of their economies   unless europe breaks apart violently and goes to war with itself or china has a civil war the basic aspects of their economy that make them a valuable part of the global economy will not go away   their productive capacities will remain intact and we 'll still want to buy stuff from each other     the beauty of free market capitalism is that it 's so adaptable and the fact that things are changing does not mean that everyone will be worse off   whether or not the us is above everyone else in the end is mostly irrelevant but the fundamental aspects of the us economy that make it among the strongest in the world will not change because of these things   our workforce will remain highly educated very productive and very innovative   we have the best farmland in the world and a lot of it enormous amounts of natural resources a relatively flexible and adaptable economy and a tremendous amount of wealth   there may be troubles related to certain institutions and governing bodies but remember that those things are not the economy   the economy is the people the things they can make the things they know and the things that they can do

if by being a millionaire you mean dollar millionaire then i doubt that it is really that easy in pakistani context at present the exchange rate is 107 pakistani rupees per us dollar so even with this exchange rate to have a million us dollars means having 107 million rupees of wealth now with this maths in mind you can very well calculate how much possible it is for an average 25 years old pakistani to have that much wealth and by the time you have 107 million pakistani rupees of wealth the exchange rate against the us dollar would have only gone up against pakistani currency that article which you have mentioned makes calculations in us context and dollar terms however if you talk only in terms of your country 's context then being a millionaire means having 1 million rupees of wealth and that is something which is quite achievable with your salary and within very short span of time

michael 's answer is correct the hdhp is like conventional insurance it is not like a health care plan that we 're all used to i.e. you do n't want to have it pay out if it pays out something bad has happened to you just like you hope to never make a claim on your homeowner 's disability or insurance that means something bad happened to you there are minor exceptions some may cover preventive care etc to some extent the bonus in the case of the hdhp is that you get to put money to cover the deductible into a tax deferred account the hsa is effectively a self insurance fund with the hdhp as backup here 's a concrete example say you have an hdhp with a $ 2500 deductible the monthly premium is $ 500 you put $ 3000 into your hsa scenario 1 you remain mostly healthy throughout the year you have a single doctor 's visit the doctor 's office submits a claim to your insurance the insurance does n't pay because you have n't met your deductible and you get a bill for $ 150 you write the doctor a check for $ 150 out of your hsa here you 've spent $ 6000 on your hdhp premiums contributed $ 3000 to your hsa and spent $ 150 of that on health care at the end of the year your hsa balance is $ in the following year assume you plan to contribute another $ 3000 to your hsa you can increase your deductible on the hdhp to $ 5000 since you 'll have $ 6000 in your hsa to cover out of pocket costs and your monthly premium might go down to $ 400 scenario 2 you are hospitalized for a week the hospital submits a $ 15000 claim to your insurance the insurance pays $ since your deductible is met after $ 2500 the hospital sends you a bill for $ 2500 for the balance you write a check to the hospital out of your hsa again you 've spent $ 6000 on your hdhp premiums and contributed $ 3000 to your hsa at the end of the year your hsa balance is $ 500 scenario 3 you are hospitalized for two days in december 2011 and then again for two days in january 2012 your deductible reset on january 1 2012 the hospital submits two claims to your insurance one in 2011 for $ 5000 and one in 2012 for $ 5000 the insurance company pays $ 2500 on the first one and you get a bill for the other $ 2500 same thing for the second one you 've got to meet the deductible all over again you write the hospital a check from your hsa to pay the first one then you 've only got $ 500 left in your hsa but you were planning to make another $ 3000 hsa contribution for 2012 anyway so you make the contribution write a $ 2500 check to pay the second bill and you 've now got a balance of $ 1000 in your hsa and since you 've met the deductible for 2012 you should have no more out of pocket expenses assuming your plan does n't have copays

putting a dollar amount on the valuation of a start up business is an art form that often has very little at all to do with any real numbers and more to do with your salesman abilities when talking with the vc that said there are a few starting points first is past sales the cost of those sales and a hopefully realistic growth curve   however you do n't have that so this gets harder do you have any actual assets   machinery computers desks patents etc   things that you actually own   if so then add those in   if this is a software start up code is an asset but without sales it 's incredibly hard to put a value on it   the best i 've come up with is how much would it cost for someone else to build it after they 've seen yours   yes you may have spent 5,000 hours building something but could someone else duplicate it or at least the major parts in 200 hours after seeing a demo   use the lower number if i was you i 'd look hard at my business plan   hopefully you were as honest as you can be when writing it and that it is as researched as possible   what is it going to take to get that first sale   what do you actually need to get there hint your logo on the side of a building is not a necessary expense   nor is really nice office space   once you have that first sale what is the second going to take   can you extrapolate out to 3 years   how many key members are there   how much is their contribution worth   at what point will you be profitable    next is to look at risks   you have n't done this before that 's huge i 'm assuming simply because you asked this question   another is competitors hopefully they already exist because opening a new market is incredibly hard and expensive on the flip side hopefully there are n't that many because entering a crowded market is equally hard and expensive   note each are possible but take radically different approaches and sums of money and $ 200k is n't going to cut it no matter what it is you are selling that said competition should be able to at least point you in the direction of a price point and estimate for how long sales take   if any are publicly traded then you have additional info to help you set a valuation   are there any potential regulatory or legal issues what happens if a key member leaves dies or is otherwise no longer available   insurance only helps so much if the one guy that knows everything literally gets run over   god help you if this person likes to go i bring risks up because you will have to them during this negotiation   for example asking for $ 200k with zero hard assets while trying to sell software to government agencies assuming a 3 week sales cycle will have you laughed at for naivety   whereas asking for $ 10 m in the same situation with a team that has governmental sales experience would likely work another big question is exit strategy do you intend to ipo or sell to a competitor or a business in a related category   if selling do you have evidence that the target company actually buys others and if so how did those deals work out   what did they look for in order to buy   exit strategy is huge to a vc and they will want to make several multiples of their money back in a relatively short amount of time   can you realistically support that for how much you are asking for   if not then going through an angel group would be better   they have similar questions but very different expectations the main thing is that no one knows what your business is worth because it is 100 unproven after 2 years and is therefore a huge financial risk   if the money you are asking for is to complete product development then that risk factor just went up radically as you are n't even talking about sales   if the money is purely for the sales channel then it 's likely not enough however if you know what it 's going to take to get that first sale and have at least an educated idea on how much it 's going to cost to repeat that then you should have an idea for how much money you want   from there you need to decide how much of the business it is worth to you to give up in order to get that money and voila you have a pre money valuation the real trick will be to convince the vc that you are right which takes research and a rock solid presentation and negotiating from there   no matter what offer a small percentage of the business for the money you want and realize you 'll likely give up much more than that a few things you should know usually by year 3 it 's apparent if a start up is going to work out or not   you 're in year 2 with no sales that does n't look good unless you are building a physical product have a competent team with hard experience doing this have patents at least filed a proven test product and hopefully have a few pre orders and just need cash to deliver   although in that situation i 'd probably tell you to ask your friends and family before talking to a vc   even would be better    $ 200k just is n't a lot of money and should be very easy to raise from friends or angels   if you ca n't then that speaks volumes to an institutional vc   a plus is having two or three people financially invested in the company more than that is sometimes a problem while having only 1 is a red flag if it 's a web thing and you 've been doing this for 2 years with zero sales and still need another $ 200k to complete it then i 'd say you need to take a hard look at what you 've built and take it to market right now   if you ca n't do that then i 'd say it might be time to abandon this idea and move on as you 'll likely have to give up 80%+ to get that $ 200k and most vcs i 've run into would n't bother at that level   which begs the question how did the conversation with the vc start   did you approach them or did they approach you   if the latter how did they even find out about you   do they actually know anything about you or is this a fishing expedition   if the latter then this is probably a complete waste of your time the above is only a rough guide because at the end of the day something is only worth what someone else is willing to pay   $ 200k in cash is a tiny sum for most vcs so without more information i have no clue why one would be interested in you i put a number of hard questions and statements in here   i do n't actually want you to answer me those are for you to think about   also none of this should n't be taken as a rather it should shock you into a realistic viewpoint and hopefully help you understand how others are going to see your baby    if the vc has done a bit of research and is actually interested in investing then they will bring up all the same things and likely more in order to convince you to give up a very large part of it   the question you have to ask yourself is is it worth it   sometimes it is often it 's not

pay off the credit cards   from now on pay off the credit cards monthly   under no circumstances should you borrow money   you have net worth but no external income   borrowing is useless to you    $ 200,000 in two bank accounts because if one bank collapses you want to have a spare while you wait for the government to pay off the guarantee   keep $ 50,000 in checking and another $ 50k in savings   the remainder put into cds   do n't expect interest income beyond inflation   real interest rates after inflation are often slightly negative    people ask why you might keep money in the bank rather than stocks bonds   the problem is that stocks bonds do n't always maintain their value much less go up   the bank money wo n't gain but it wo n't suddenly lose half its value either   it can easily take five years after a stock market crash for the market to recover   you do n't want to be withdrawing from losses    some people have suggested more bonds and fewer stocks   but putting some of the money in the bank is better than bonds   bonds sometimes lose money like stocks   instead park some of the money in the bank and pick a more aggressive stock bond mixture   that way you 're never desperate for money and you can survive market dips   and the stock bond part of the investment will return more at 70/30 than 60/40    $ 700,000 in stock mutual funds   $ 300,000 in bond mutual funds   look for broad indexes rather than high returns   you need this to grow by the inflation rate just to keep even   that 's $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 a year   keep the balance between 70/30 and   you can move half the excess beyond inflation to your bank accounts   that 's the money you have to spend each year   do n't withdraw money if you are n't keeping up with inflation    do n't try to time the market   much better informed people with better resources will be trying to do that and failing   play the odds instead   keep to a consistent strategy and let the market come back to you   if you chase it you are likely to lose money    if you do n't spend money this year you can save it for next year   anything beyond $ 200,000 in the bank accounts is available for spending   in an emergency you may have to draw down the $ 200,000   be careful   it 's not as big a cushion as it seems because you do n't have an external income to replace it    i live in southern california but would like to move overseas after establishing stable investments    i am not the type of person that would invest in mcdonald 's but would consider other less evil franchises maybe    these are contradictory goals as stated   a franchise meaning a local business of a national brand is not a stable investment   a franchise is something that you actively manage   at minimum you have to hire someone to run the franchise   and as a general rule they are n't as turnkey as they promise    how do you pick a good manager   how will you tell if they know how the business works   particularly if you do n't know   how will you tell that they are honest and wo n't just your money   or more honestly give you too much of the business revenues such that the business is not sustainable   or spend so much on the business that you ca n't recover it as revenue    some have suggested that you meant brand or stock rather than franchise   if so you can ignore the last few paragraphs   i would be careful about making moral judgments about companies   mcdonald 's pays its workers too little   google privacy   exxon is bad for the environment   chase collects fees from people desperate for money   tesla relies on government subsidies   every successful company has some way in which it can be considered evil   and unsuccessful companies are evil in that they go out of business leaving workers customers and investors i.e. you in the    regardless you should invest in broad index funds rather than individual stocks   if college is out of the question then so should be stock investing   it 's at least as much work and needs to be maintained    in terms of living overseas dip your toe in first   rent a small place for a few months   find out how much it costs to live there   remember to leave money for bigger expenses   you should be able to live on $ 20,000 or $ 25,000 a year now   then you can plan on spending $ 35,000 a year to do it for real including odd expenses that do n't happen every month   make sure that you have health insurance arranged    eventually you may buy a place   if you can find one that you can afford for something like $ 100,000   note that $ 100,000 would be low in california but sufficient even in many places in the us   think rural like the south or midwest   and of course that would be more money in many countries in south america africa or southern asia   even southern and eastern europe might be possible   you might even pay a bit more and rent part of the property   in the us this would be a duplex or a bed and breakfast   they may use different terms elsewhere    given your health do you need a maid cook   that would lean towards something like a bed and breakfast where the same person can clean for both you and the guests   same with cooking although that might be a second person or more   hire a bookkeeper accountant first as you 'll want help evaluating potential purchases   keep the business small enough that you can actively monitor it    part of the problem here is that a million dollars sounds like a lot of money but is n't   you are n't rich   this is about bare minimum for surviving with a middle class lifestyle in the united states and other first world countries   you ca n't live like a tourist    it 's true that many places overseas are cheaper   but many are n't including much of europe japan australia new zealand etc   and the ones that are n't may surprise you   and you also may find that some of the things that you personally want or need to buy are expensive elsewhere   dabble first and commit slowly be sure first   include rarer things like travel in your expenses    long term there will be currency rate worries overseas   if you move permanently you should certainly move your bank accounts there relatively soon perhaps keep part of one in the us for emergencies that may bring you back   and move your investments as well   your return may actually improve although some of that is likely to be eaten up by inflation   a 10 return in a country with 12 inflation is a negative real return    try to balance your investments by where your money gets spent   if you are eating imported food put some of the investment in the place from which you are importing   that way if exchange rates push your food costs up they will likely increase your investments at the same time   if you are buying stuff online from us vendors and having it shipped to you keep some of your investments in the us for the same reason   make currency fluctuations work with you rather than against you    i do n't know what your circumstances are in terms of health   if you can work you probably should   given twenty years your million could grow to enough to live off securely   as is you would be in trouble with another stock market crash   you 'd have to live off the bank account money while you waited for your stocks and bonds to recover

first if you have n't seen it yet check out the irs taxpayer advocate service 's i do n't have my refund page   it discusses different things that can go wrong with receiving your refund and what to do about it from your post it sounds like you 've tried all of the normal things to do and you 've tried calling in to the irs   what you might not know is that there are local irs offices that you can visit and talk to a real person face to face   hopefully you 'll find someone helpful there who can either explain to you what is going on or put you in touch with someone who can help   to find your local irs office go to the contact your local irs office page and click on the office locator button   office visits are generally by appointment only so you 'll need to call the number for the office you want to visit and make an appointment alternatively if you ca n't get anywhere with the irs you could contact the taxpayer advocate service which is an independent organization within the irs that exists to help people with disputes with the irs and they have an office in every state   you could try contacting them and seeing if they can help you with your issue to answer your question about this year 's tax return at least for the federal return your refund from last year does not really affect this year 's tax return   you should be able to file this year 's return no matter what happens with last year 's refund   that having been said you should get the refund matter straightened out as soon as you can good luck

as said by others buying shares of a company will not support it directly but let 's think about two example companies company a which has 90 stocks owned by supporters and company b which has only 1 of stocks owned by supporters both companies release bad news for example profits have decreased in company b most investors might want to sell their stock quickly and the price will plummet in company a the supporters continue believing in the company and will not want to sell it the price will drop less usually but it can drop even more if the sellers of company a are very desperate to get rid of the stock so why is it important for the company to have a high stock price in the short term it 's not important one example is that the company can release more stocks and receive more financing by doing that other reasons are listed here

the tax comes when you close the position if the option expires worthless it 's as if you bought it back for $ 0 there 's a short term capital gain for the difference between your short sale price and your buyback price on the option i believe the capital gain is always short term because short sales are treated as short term even if you hold them open more than one year if the option is exercised calling away your stock then you add the premium to your sale price on the stock and then compute the capital gain so in this case you can end up treating the premium as a long term capital gain see irs pub 550 search for writers of puts and calls

i think the math is wrong note that in scenario 1 you are only out of pocket $ 1000 while in scenario 2 you are out of pocket $ 1250   the contribution and the tax you paid with respect to it a better concept than tax rate is retention rate   this is the fraction of your money that the feds let you keep   and growth factor is the how much the investment grows so in scenario 1 you multiply $ 1000 by the investment growth factor and then by the retirement retention rate and in scenario 2 you multiply the same $ 1000 by the current retention rate and then by the growth factor since in your approximation the two are the same there is no saving

there 's a huge difference between can an person make a profit on the stock market and can an average person get rich off the stock market it is certainly possible for an average person to profit but of course you are unlikely to profit as much as the big wall street guys   an s&p 500 index fund for instance would be a pretty good way to profit   people with high powered tools may make a lot of money picking individual stocks and may even make some choices that help them when the market is down but it 's difficult to see how they could consistently make money over the long term without the s&p 500 also going up   the same applies to varying to various other index funds etfs and mutual funds i agree with littleadv that there is no single right thing for everyone to do   my personal take is that index funds are a good bet and i 've seen a lot of people take that view on personal finance blogs etc for whatever that 's worth   one advantage of index funds that track major indexes like the s&p 500 is that because they are and are perceived as macro indicators of the overall economic situation at least you 're in the same boat as many other people   on one level that means that if you lose money a lot of other investors are also losing money and when large numbers of people start losing money that makes governments take action etc to turn things around   on another level the s&p 500 is a lot of big companies if it goes down some of those big companies are losing value and they will use their big company resources to gain value and if they succeed the index goes up again and you benefit in other words index funds and large mutual funds etfs etc make investing less about what day trading focus on which is trying to make a hot choice for a large gain   they make it more about your wagon to an extremely large star that is powered by all the resources of extremely large companies so that when those companies increase their value you gain   the bigger the pool of people whose fortunes rise and fall with your own the more you become part of an investment portfolio that is i ca n't resist saying it too big to fail   that is n't to say that the s&p 500 ca n't lose value from time to time but rather that if it does go down big and hard and stay there you probably have bigger problems than losing money in the stock market e.g. the us economy is collapsing and you should begin stockpiling bullets and canned food

sorry missed this reply in with all the others apparently i touched some nerves and i saw the comment got linked to a libertarian sub    your argument assumes that there is no choice is n't a bedrock of libertarian policy self sufficiency slaves were called slaves because they were absolutely controlled through force and the threat of death or severe physical torture if you are trying to equate that to taxes and the penalties for not paying them then that truly is an argument from the extreme    i used an example of being a grown capable adult and living in a drug dealers house you have the ability to leave at any time if you wanted but there would be a cost of course moving is n't free and you might have to answer to the drug dealer if he had expectations of you however if you truly with how he was living and making his money would n't you try to change his ways and if you could n't would n't you leave otherwise are n't you implicitly endorsing his way of life

well this relates to how you interpret something 's value we can use that magazine and restaurant as an example for you the extra $ more on a decent meal or wine is worth it while $ 5 for a magazine entertainment on a train ride might not be this is how all markets work people make decisions about how they value something and hence choose to spend or not if you 're asking should i value certain things the way i do well that 's a different story   e.g. should i keep that picture frame for years in the attic to sell it for $ 3 on ebay later probably not worth it but again you are making that decision based on how you choose to value it so to answer your question how can i possibly care about this when my stock portfolio is losing or gaining $ 1000 a day and is it normal yes it is normal and we all care everyone makes these decisions throughout each day people will vary as to what they value something to be but all in all everyone does just what you explained here is something that you may find interesting it is about how we value money what color is your money if the pdf does n't work for you then try this link what color is your money alt link

we considered similar big renovations when putting our house on the market the answer turns out to be pretty simple unless you do renovation type work as your day job or have really good friends in the residential contracting business sell as is you will virtually never get back the full price of bringing in a gen con to renovate any space in your home you do that when you want to spend the extra to make your home exactly what you wanted so you can live in it for decades and get the enjoyment out of it if you 're trying to turn a profit with the renovation like house flippers do professionally you look for easy repairs buy good looking but inexpensive materials and do the labor yourself whether you sell to the market or to a specifically interested buyer is your call but i will caution you that a specifically interested buyer is going to be looking for a deal or a steal   when marketing our house we met with three different realtors the first one was very about what we could list for basically assuming that we could get the same price as a fully upgraded version of our same floor plan with a pool out back she also had a to do list a mile long and my wife and i both noticed that she looked very apprehensive about the house when looking around even as she us that selling it would be no trouble we eventually realized why she was so apprehensive and fired her before we got even halfway through her to dos which included major landscaping new kitchen floors and etc which would have cost us thousands and would not have gotten the house price even close to the target the second one took a look at our half finished and told us to stop everything we were doing to update the minor stuff like paint and fixtures saying we were putting on a pig she would market the house to some cash buyers she knew personally for about 80 of the list price our first realtor quoted and implied that we should be kissing her boots for finding us a buyer willing to take the house off our hands at all during the tour she pointed out problems with the house that were n't even there like foundation issues such as sloping floors in an attempt to scare us into going with her strategy we that out pretty quickly showed her the door at the end of the initial consult and never called back this by the way is the kind of thing you want to avoid unless your home is really dilapidated or torn apart with unfinished major it should have decent value on the market and you should n't have to resort to a cash buyer looking for a flip or a rental property on the cheap just like our third choice was just right he saw all the same comparables our house and recommended that we offer about $ 20k less than the fully upgraded version but still about $ 20k more than the second realtor was estimating targeting a real buyer and not an investor or flipper but at a price that would make the lack of upgrades more acceptable we finished the paint and finish projects we started brought in a weekend 's worth of scheduled and our house was under contract for full price within 3 days giving us the extra $ 20k worth of down payment to put into our new house in summary i highly recommend a realtor because the one we eventually listed with worked his butt off on the business side while we fixed up the house however make sure you find the right one realtors are ultimately in business for themselves and their ultimate interest is in getting your house sold and getting you into a new one that is what gets them paid some of them will do it the right way working the deal with other realtors and their prospective buyers to get you what you need others will take the easy way out at your expense either giving you bad advice about how to present and price your home so that you end up on the market for 6 months with no offers or handing your house to their business buddies at a discount

generically interest rates being charged are driven in large part by the central bank 's rate and competition tends to keep similar loans priced fairly close to each other interest rates being paid are driven by what 's needed to get folks to lend you their money deposit in bank purchase bonds so it 's again related there certainly is n't very direct coupling but in general interest rates of all sorts do tend to swing very roughly in the same direction at very roughly the same time so the concept that interest rates of all types are rising or falling at any given moment is a simplification but not wholly unreasonable if you want to know which interest rates a particular person is citing to back up their claim you really need to ask them

1 is this right pretty much though this is a really rudimentary way to think about it 2 if it is why is it that extensive services are provided by high margin companies competing for talent rather then lower margin businesses looking to boost their profits by reducing their expenditures on employees by cutting out the government it 's the polar opposite of that google and companies like that do things like have a day care center on premises   the company staffs a day care center which has costs then lets employees use it for free   this is a business expense for google and in relative terms a considerably large business expense that a lower margin business could no afford employer healthcare is a tax protected expense for employees via section 125 of the tax code   the company portion of the healthcare costs are a deductible business expense to the company as expected   healthcare is different than most other expenses because the employee can forego income before it 's effectively received which negates it from taxable income    this does n't work for something like food purchased at a cafe on a google complex   if employee money is being spent at a corporate cafe it 's taxable income being spent though the cost of running the cafe is a tax deductible business expense to the company there have been discussions in congress to assess a value as income to employees for services like on site child care and no cost employee to address your new example for example suppose john doe makes $ 100,000 a year taxed at a rate of 20 for a take home pay of $ 80,000 he spends $ 10,000 on food his employer corporation decides to give him all of his food and deduct it as a business expense costing them $ 10,000 but now they can pay john doe an amount so his take home pay will be reduced by $ 10,000 $ the company is now spending $ employing john doe for a savings of $ this would be an audit prone administrative nightmare   either you need john to submit receipts for reimbursement up to the $ 10,000 agreed upon amount which would require some kind of administrative staff or after a very short period of time john forgets the abstract value of the food cost arrangement that is only really benefiting the employer in the form of lower payroll expense and is away for more pay somewhere else anyway   the company may be saving $ 2,500 though again there will be an additional administrative expense of some sort but john is only saving $ 500 $ 0.20 $ 100,000 0.20

they are n't actually it appears to be a low interest rate but it does n't cover their true cost of capital it is a sales tactic where they are raising the sticker price principal of the car which is subsidizing the true cost of the loan likely 4 or higher it would be hard to believe that the true cost of a car loan would be less than for a mortgage as with a mortgage the bank can reclaim an asset that tends to rise in value compared to a used car which will have fallen in value this is one reason why you can generally get a better price with cash because there is a margin built in in addition to the fact that with cash they get all their profit today versus a discount of future cash flows from a loan by dealing with a bank or other lending company so if you could see the entire transaction from the inside the car company would not actually be making money the government rate is also so low that it often barely covers inflation much less operating costs and profit this is why any time you see 0 financing it is generally a sales tactic designed to get your attention a company can not actually acquire capital at 0 to lend to you at 0 because even if the nominal interest rate were 0 there is an opportunity cost as you have observed a portion of the sticker price is covering the real cost and subsidizing the monthly payment

i used to think that paying off ahead of time made sense but i no longer do at least in most cases   the upside is that you can get a return on your money equal to the mortgage interest rate it 's less than that in the us where mortgage interest is deductible so it 's roughly the mortgage interest rate 1 your marginal income tax rate   there are a few downsides the biggest is that cash is the most liquid asset you can have you can get at it with no restrictions if you put that cash into your house you are converting that into an asset with a lot of restrictions you ca n't get at it without fees nor can you get at it if you do n't have a job which is when you would need it most   so you are putting your money in a hard to get at place for a small interest rate i do n't think it is worthwhile edit one complication is pmi if you are currently paying pmi it may make sense to put money towards the mortgage until you get to 20 and can get rid of the pmi

you are missing the fact that the company can buy back its own shares for simplicity imagine the case that you own all of the shares of xyz corporation   xyz is very profitable and it makes $ 1 m per year   there are two ways to return $ 1 m to you the shareholder 1   the company could buy back some fraction of your shares for $ 1 m or   2   the company could pay you a $ 1 m dividend after 1 you 'd own all of the shares and have $ 1m. after 2 you 'd own all of the shares and have $ 1m. after 1 the total number of shares would be fewer but saying you owned less of xyz would be like complaining that you are shorter when your height is measured in inches than in so indeed a buyback is an alternative to a dividend furthermore buybacks have a number of tax advantages over dividends to taxable shareholders see my answer in can i get a dividend free lunch by buying a stock just before the ex dividend date and selling it immediately after   that said it is important to recognize the shareholders who are less savvy about knowing when to accept the buyback by correctly valuing the company can get burned at the profit of the savvy shareholders   a strategy to avoid being burned if you are n't price savvy is simply to sell a fraction in order to get your pro rata share of the buyback in many respects simulating a dividend but still reaping some but not all of the tax advantages of a buyback

gt no action is not an alternative mcconnell was quoted as saying we 've got the insurance markets all over the country including in this state   except that republicans are actively obamacare   trump has made it clear the mandate will not be politics trump signs executive order that could lift affordable care acts individual   with no mandate healthy people drop from the program and premiums news articles/2017 05 premiums rise as insurers fret over law s shaky future   gt if my side is unable to agree on an adequate replacement then some kind of action with regard to the private health insurance market must occur   i think democrats should consider help after republicans do three things   1 take steps to implement the law as it was passed   until republicans take ownership of the law they will just sabotage it again and blame democrats   2 officially admit that the aca was a compromise bill agreed upon by democrats and republicans over 31 meetings in the senate finance hearings   the republican opposition has been mainly political theater to deny a democrat president a victory   3 senator mcconnell himself must apologize for refusing to bring a vote on president obama 's supreme court nomination to the floor effectively stealing a supreme court seat   to make things right again he should agree democrats should block every republican supreme court nomination until the balance is restored   until i see these things i have no reason to believe this suggestion of from republicans is nothing more than an attempt to trick democrats to not be as destructive and selfish as they have been for the past eight years

the problem with a little bit of deflation is that it can turn into a lot of deflation very quickly   that i d the risk of the so called liquidity trap   a place where the fed truly does lose its power and depressions become possible   the us housing market is in a secular depression   people are n't buying despite record low rates because they assume the house will be cheaper next year   now imagine that across the entire economy   the longer you wait the cheaper things get   it sounds but the problem is that it is n't just you waiting it is everyone waiting all at the same time   so the economy such as it is grinds to a halt and jobs vanish and things get even cheaper   it is a cycle that is extremely costly to get out of   the last time we fell into a depression it took massive new government spending programs plus a world war to fully pull us out of it   some people might make the argument that you need a good long depression every now and then   they may say that in fact the great depression was the catalyst for policies that set america up for 70 years of solid economic growth   i 'm not so sure   i do look at our current situation with bailed out zombie banks and i have to wonder if just letting them all fail may have been better even though the short term pain would have been severe   we 'll probably know in about 5 years if they did the right thing

there are two types of 401(k contributions elective contributions which are the part put in by the employee and nonelective contributions which are the part put in by the company   elective contributions are summed across all the plans she is contributing to   so she can contribute $ 18,000 minus whatever she put in her 403(b additionally she can contribute 20 of the net profit of the company before the elective contributions as nonelective contributions these contributions must be designated as such you will notice that the irs document says 25 but that 's what you can do if her business is incorporated   for a sole proprietorship nonelective contributions   ends up being limited at 20 of profit additionally the sum of these two and her contribution to her 403(b can not exceed $ 53,000 example line 31 of her schedule c is $ 30,000 and she has contributed $ 10,000 to her 403(b maximum contribution to her solo 401(k is $ 18,000 $ 10,000 + 0.2 $ 30,000 = $ 14,000 her total contributions for the year are $ 10,000 from her 403(b plus $ 14,000 in her solo 401(k   this is less than $ 53,000 so this limit does not bind   if she made a ton of 1099 money her contribution maximum would follow the above until it hit $ 53,000 and then it would stop there the irs describes this in detail in publication 560 which also has a worksheet for figuring out your maximum explicitly   it 's unpleasant reading and the worksheets are painful but if you do it right it will end up being as i just described it   using the language of that publication hers is a qualified plan of the defined contribution variety

your question contains two different concepts fractional reserve banking and debt based money   when thinking of these two things i think it is important to analyze these items separately before trying to understand how the whole system works fractional reserve banking as others have pointed out fractional reserve banking is not a ponzi scheme   it can be fraudulent however   if a bank tells all its depositors that they can withdrawal their money at any time i.e. on demand and the bank then proceeds to loan out some portion of the depositors money then the bank has committed fraud since there is no way they could honor the depositors requests for their money if many of them came for their money at one time   this is true regardless of what type of money is deposited dollars gold etc   this is how most modern banks operate debt based money historically the fed would introduce new money by buying us treasuries   this means federal reserve notes are backed by us treasuries   i agree that this seems strange   does this mean if i take my frns to the fed i could redeem them for us treasuries   but us treasuries are promises to pay frns in the future   this makes my head hurt   reminds me of the definition for see here is an experiment   what if we wanted to recreate frns today and none existed   the us government would offer a note to pay 100 frns in one year and pay 5 interest on the note   the fed would print up its first 100 frns to buy the note from the us government   the us government would spend the frns   the first 100 frns have now entered into circulation   at the end of the note 's term the fed should have 105 frns since the government agreed to pay 5 interest on the note   but how is the us government going to pay the interest and principal on the note when only 100 frns exist   i think this is the central point to your question    i can come up with only two answers 1 the fed must purchase some assets that are not debt based 2 the us government must continue to issue debt that is purchased by newly printed frns in order to pay back older debt and interest   this is a ponzi scheme the record debt levels seem to indicate the ponzi scheme option was chosen

i feel dividends are better for shareholders the idea behind buy backs is that future profits are split between fewer shares thereby increasing the value not necessarily price that 's a market function of the remaining shares this that the company then retires the shares it repurchases but quite often buybacks simply offset dilution from stock option compensation programs in my opinion some stock option compensation is acceptable but overuse of this becomes a form of wealth transfer from the shareholder to management the opposite of shareholder friendly but let 's assume the shares are being retired that 's good but at what cost the company must use cashflow cash to pay for the shares the buyback is only a positive for shareholders if the shares are undervalued managers can be very astute in their own sphere running their business estimating a reasonable range of intrinsic value for their shares is a difficult and very subjective task requiring many assumptions about future revenue and margins a few managers like warren buffett are very competent capital but most managers are n't that good in this area and being so close to the company they 're often overly optimistic so they end up overpaying if a company 's shares are worth say $ 30 it 's not unreasonable to assume they may trade all around that number maybe as low as $ 15 and as high as $ 50 this is overly simplistic but assuming the value does n't change that the company is in steady state mode then the $ 30 point the intrinsic value estimate will act as a for the market price eventually it toward the value point well if management does n't understand this they could easily pay $ 50 for the repurchased stock heck companies routinely just continue buying stock with no apparent regard for the price they 're paying this is one of the quickest ways to shareholder capital overpaying for dubious acquisitions is another dividends on the other hand require no estimates they ca n't mask other activities other agendas they do n't transfer wealth from shareholders to management us companies traditionally pay quarterly and they try very hard not to cut the dividend many companies grow the dividend steadily at a rate several times that of inflation the dividend is an actual cash expenditure there 's no gaap reporting to get in the way of what 's really going on the company must be fiscally conservative and responsible or risk not having the cash when they need to pay it out the shareholder gets the cash and can then reinvest as he she sees fit with available opportunities at the time including buying more shares of the company if undervalued but if overvalued the money can be invested in a better safer opportunity

this is almost a question in financial engineering first i will note that a discussion of the greeks is well presented at these measures are first second and higher order derivatives or rate of change comparisons for information that is generally instantaneous bear with me for example the most popular delta compares prices of an option or other derived asset to the underlying asset price the reason we are able to do all this cool analysis is because the the value of the underlying and derived assets have a direct instantaneous relationship on each other because beta is calculated over a large period of time and because each time slice covered contributes equally to the aggregate then the difference in beta would really just be showing two pieces of information summarizing those two pieces of information into delta beta would not be useful to me for further discussion please see specifically look at the huge difference in calculation of ge 's beta using end of month returns versus calculation using day before end of month returns

i believe there is an overtime meal allowance that is if an employee works overtime defined as p.m. for a start or ten plus hours after the shift starts the company can provide a non taxable meal free of charge or give a reasonable allowance $ that must be spent outside on a meal no drinks this is because the employee is working extra hours at the convenience of the company lunches can be subsidized that is the company can provide lunch on company premises and must charge employees the direct costs of the food and preparing it but can forego charging for overhead e.g. the implied rent for the lunch facility and profit

overall i think it sounds like it 's worth it it 's hard to find that high of a rate on a checking account these days   it looks like you 're looking at this bank and i can see they have a few more requirements that seem a little tedious if you do n't do these things every month then you lose the great interest rate if you can think of an easy way to jump through these hoops and not forget then it 's probably worth it for example if you routinely eat out for lunch or buy a morning coffee you can use that card to pay for it set yourself a recurring reminder in your calendar or smartphone to remind you to login to the online banking site ultimately since this is an emergency fund it 's a good idea to keep it nice and liquid in a checking account you 're not likely going to find many other options that will give you a better and safe return and still keep your funds available for when you need them in summary it sounds like a good idea to me so long as you think you can reliably jump through their hoops

absolutely in fact all stock purchases of more than 5 of a company 's stock must be reported to the sec so assuming a and b are publicly traded companies in the us the purchase would likely be a matter of public record   there are probably special cases where this could cause problems however any case where a 's purchase of b 's stock or vice versa runs afoul of regulation would be one such case for example if company a wants to own a controlling interest in company b and appoint members of its board of directors and both companies were in the same heavily concentrated market regulators may frown on the potential for decreased competition such regulations may apply to any purchase of a controlling interest in a company though

in the other question the op had posted a screenshot circa 2010 from transunion with suggestions on how to improve the op 's credit score   one of these suggestions was to obtain retail revolving accounts   by this they are referring to credit accounts from a particular retail store   stores have been offering credit accounts for many years and today this usually takes the form of a store credit card   the credit card does not have the visa or mastercard logo on it and is only valid at that particular store   for example target has their own credit card that only works at target stores   the revolving part simply means that it is an open account that you can continue to make new charges and pay off as opposed to a fixed retail financing loan such as you might get at a high end furniture store where you obtain a loan for a single piece of furniture and when it is paid off the account is closed the formula for credit scores are proprietary secrets   however i have n't read anything that indicates that a store credit card helps your credit score more than a standard credit card   i suspect that transunion was offering this tip in an attempt to give the consumer more ideas of how to add credit cards to their account that the consumer might not have thought of   but it is possible that buried deep in the credit score formula there is something in there that gives you a higher score if you have a store credit card as an aside the op in the other question had a credit score of and was trying to make it higher   in my opinion this is pointless   remember that the financial services industry has an incentive to sell you as much debt as possible and so all of their advice will point to you getting more credit accounts and getting more in debt

can they reject a hundred dollar bill as a payment of debt no a creditor can not refuse payment in cash whatever denomination you use however when you 're buying stuff you do n't owe anything to the business owner there 's no debt so the above rule does n't apply as long as there 's no debt in existence the matter of payment is decided between two parties based on the mutual agreement the demand not to use large bills is reasonable in places like or taxi cab that are frequently robbed or at a small retailer that does n't want to invest into forgery detection and fraud prevention so the answer to this question is it the case where this practice of accepting small bills and    rejecting large bills is perfectly legal is yes you can find the full explanation on including code references

the stock market is generally a long term investment platform   the share prices reflect more the companies potential to be profitable in the future rather than its actual value   companies that have good potential can over perform their actual value   we saw this regularly   in the early days of the internet prior to the .com bust   companies would go up exponentially based on their idea 's and potential   investors learned from that and are demanding more these days   as a result companies that do not show growth potential go down companies that show growth and potential apple and google for 2 easy examples continue to go up    many companies have specific days where employees can buy and sell stocks   there are minor in the market on these days as the demand and supply are temporarily altered by a large segment of the owner base making trades   for this reason some companies have a closed pool that is only open to inside trades that then executes the orders over time so that the effect is minimized on the actual stock price   this is not happening with face book   instead many of the investors are dumping their stock directly into the market   these are savvy investors and if there was potential for profit remaining you would not see the full scale exodus from the stock   the fact that it is visible is scaring off investors itself   i can not think of another instance that has gone like facebook especially one that was called so accurately by many industry pundits

it should be pretty obvious that without knowing what sort of assets the company owns and what sort of net earnings are being generated it 's impossible to say what a $ 20k equity investment should get you in terms of ownership percentage    with that said you want to look at a few to several years of books look for trends   some things to understand that might be subtle red flags it 's extremely common for early stage investors to essentially make loans rather than strictly buying shares   in the worst case scenario creditors get to participate in liquidation proceedings before shareholders do   you may be better off investing in this business via a loan that 's convertible to equity at your discretion    single owner service companies are difficult because all of the net earnings go to the proprietor and that person maintains all of the relationships   so taking something like 5 years of net earnings as the value of the company does n't make much sense because you or someone else could n't just step in and replace the owner   granted you are n't contemplating taking over the business but it negates using an x years of net earnings valuation method   when you read about valuation there is a sort of overriding assumption that no single person could topple the operation which could n't be farther from the truth in single employee service companies   additionally understand that your investment in a single owner company hinges completely on one person 's ability and willingness to work it 's really vital to understand the purpose of the funds   someone will be hired   $ 20,000 could n't be even six months of wages put things in to perspective with a pad pen and calculator   do n't invest in the pipe dream of a friend of yours and definitely do n't hand this person the downpayment for their new house   the first rule of investing is do n't lose money this is n't emotional this is a dollars and cents pragmatic process why does the business need this money   how will you be paid back    personally i think it would be more to put $ 20k in a blender and watch it blend this is probably a horrible investment   the risk should just be left to credit card companies

i 'll address one part of your question there are other taxes that companies pay as well such as income tax but do n't charge to the customer as a fee so why are gross receipts taxes charged to the customer things like income tax ca n't be passed on to the consumer in a direct way because there 's no fixed relationship between the amount of the tax and the price of an individual product   income tax is paid on taxable income which will incorporate deductions for the costs the company incurred to do business   so the final amount of corporate income tax can depend on things unrelated to the price of goods sold like whether the business decided to their parking lot gross receipts taxes by definition are charged on the total amount of money taken in so every dollar you spend on an item at the store will be subject to the gross receipts tax and hence will cost the business 7 cents or x% where x is the tax rate   this means there is a direct link between the price you pay for an individual item and the tax they pay on that transaction   the same is true for sales taxes which are also often added at the time of sale of course businesses could roll all of these into the posted price as well   the reason they do n't is to get their foot in the door and make the price seem lower you 're more likely to buy something if you see it for the low low one time only price of $ 99.99 act now save big and then find out you owe an extra $ 7 at the register than if you saw $ 107 on the price tag

yes that 's what a classical intelligent conservative a rare breed in internet chat rooms would say and it is of course true as far as it goes this is a point where real conservatism as opposed to its internet actually touches base with the real left as opposed to its internet believe it or not many of the people you mention are doing exactly what you recommend the fly in the is that being on the left they do n't start with a rock hard belief that there is nothing wrong with the system that it is the best of all possible worlds and that all people have to do to solve the problems of a group and its individuals is to play along and put their nose to the    there are such things as social norms quite separate from laws and even in the most benevolent utopia there have to be and will be these vague of what one should do so your advise true as it may be only captures part of the solution a fuller solution goes beyond individual response and involves shifts in political power

simply put that 's not allowed    outside a retirement fund they simply do not provide a mechanism to pay that expense ratio separately   ergo any effort to pay that expense ratio would be classified as a new additional purchase of the fund you now must deal with   inside a retirement fund paying the expense ratio of the fund with cash would be treated as an additional contribution which may then violate contribution rules such as going over your contribution limit or contributing past age 70 1/2

why wo n't anyone just answer the original question the question was not about opportunity cost or flexibility or family expenses there are no right answers to any of those things and they all depend on individual circumstances i believe the answer to the question of whether paying off a 30-year mortgage in 15 years would cost the same amount as a 15-year mortgage of the same interest rate is yes but only if you pay it off on the exact same schedule as your supposed 15-year in reality the answer is no for two reasons the amortization schedule and the fact that the 30-year will always have a higher interest rate than the 15-year the way mortgages are amortized the interest is paid first essentially for most people the majority of the monthly payment is interest for the first half of the loan 's life this is good for most people because in reality most mortgages only last a couple years after which people refinance or move and for those first couple years the majority of one 's housing costs interest are tax deductible it is arguable whether this for one 's entire life is wise but that 's the reality of most mortgages so unless you pay off your 30-year on the exact same amortization schedule of your theoretical 15-year you will pay more in interest a common strategy people pursue is paying an extra monthly payment or more each year by the time you get around to chipping away at your principal in that way you will already have paid a lot more interest than you would have on a 15-year and really if you can afford to substantially pay down principal in the first year or two of your mortgage you probably should 've borrowed less money to begin with in theory if the rates were the same they 're not and if you paid the 30 off every month in the exact same way as you would've paid a 15 you wo n't you will pay the same amount in the end you have to decide if the flexibility is worth more to you than the cost savings   for example a 300k mortgage at 3.5 will have a monthly payment of for a 15-year and for a 30-year both will start with of that being in interest gradually declining with time what i think most people undervalue is the freedom and peace of mind that comes with a paid off or nearly paid off home and 15 years is a lot more tangible than 30 plus a lot cheaper over all if you can afford a 15-year mortgage without putting too much stress on your budget it is definitely the better option for financial security   and be careful of the index fund opportunity cost advice on average it may be a good idea when you look at the very long run historically but a lot of people get less than average returns depending on when they buy and what the market does in the short run there is no certainty around what returns you will get from the stock market but if you have a 30-year mortgage there is a lot of certainty around what you will owe every month for the next different mixes of investments make sense for different people and most people would be wise to get some exposure to the stock market for its returns and liquidity however if someone 's goal is borrowing more money for their house in order to invest more money in the stock market for their retirement they would actually be better served in achieving security and independence 15 years sooner

i would second the advice to not do this real estate ownership is complex to begin with involving a constant stream of maintenance financing and other decisions   it is difficult enough to do for a single individual or a family as a unit a couple but at least spouses are forced to compromise friends are not and you can end up with long running conflicts and financial transactions of any kind impose tensions on relationships and friendships are no exception if you want your friendship to do not sacrifice it to the financial arrangement which seems like a good idea at the moment my advice would be to steer clear no matter how attractive on the surface the deal might look focus on your own individual finances and use discipline and patience to save the amount needed for acquiring a separate investment property but it will be 100 yours and will save tons of headache since you are still considering this deal it 's a great time to politely change your mind and walk away believe me a few minutes of inconvenience will save you years of frustration good luck

as dilip has pointed out in the comment investing in commodities is to either delivery or buy lets say you entered into buying x quantities of soybeans in november contract is entered into may. in november if the price is higher than what you purchased for you can easily sell this and make money if in november the price is lower than your contract price you have an option to sell it at loss if you do n't want to sell it at loss you are supposed to take the physical shipment arrange for your own transport and store it in warehouse although there are companies that will allow you to lease their warehouse it very soon becomes more loss making proposition by doing this you can hold onto as long as you want or as long as the good survive and do n't rot it makes sense for a large wholesaler to enter into buy contracts as he would be like to get known prices for at least half the stock he needs similarly large farmers co operative societies need to enter into sell contracts so that they are against price fluctuations

ulip insurance plan ulip is unit linked insurance plan the premium you pay a small part goes towards covering life insurance the balance is invested into stock markets most ulip would give you an option to choose from debt funds 100 safe buy low returns 5 7 or equity high risks returns can be around 15 or a mix of both ulip are not a good way to save money there are quite a few hidden fees that actually reduce the return so notionally even if returns shown are great in effect it is quite less for example the premium you pay in first year say rs 10,000/- rs goes towards commission and say rs 100 goes towards insurance balance rs units are purchased in your account even if these grow by 20 you are still in loss the commissions go down year after year and stop at 5 then there is fund management fees that you do n't get to see there is maintenance fee that is from your balance   thus the entire method of charging is not transparent life insurance from there are broadly 2 types of life insurance plans money back endowment plan the concept here is again same you pay a premium and part of it goes toward insurance the balance invests in safe bonds every year a bonus is declared generally less than bank rate at the end of the plan you get more than what you paid in premium however if you had kept the same in bank fd you would have got more money back so if you die your nominee would get insurance plus bonus if you survive you get all the accumulated bonus pure term plan here the premium is quite less for the sum insured here if you die your nominee would get insurance if you survive you do n't get anything

every year you save your receipts track your expenses and when april comes around pay your taxes but what if you know of someone who is n't as honest as you are someone who on their income or information in order to be placed in a lower bracket   the internal revenue service irs estimates that americans underpay their articles tax by about $ billion every year according to barron 's the popular financial news website and magazine in fiscal 2009 the irs collected $ billion in enforcement revenue this process required the employment of thousands of revenue officers agents and special agents unfortunately this type of enforcement happens every year and often spans to multiple previous years in the end there is still a large amount of tax money that goes unpaid   there 's definitely a gap between the tax and the irs evaders are usually exposed due to a slip up on their part or a tip from a bystander if you 'd like to help close that gap you can but why should you and how is it done   why help the irs   nobody likes paying more than their fair share of taxes in order to compensate for others who intentionally evade theirs why should n't tax evaders give up a portion of their incomes to provide things that benefit the general good like roads and when you do reporting a tax cheat is like reporting a you 're just asking them to pay for something they 're trying to unfairly get for free   gather the evidence   the irs is not likely to pursue someone without good reason if the time and resources are going to be spent the odds need to be good that the efforts will result in a payoff besides determining who what where when and why the person his or her taxes the irs will need specific information type of violation availability of books or records having a hunch without supporting details just is n't good enough   also ensure that the evasion is financially significant enough for example stating that your neighbor failed to report a $ 50 babysitting earning is not going to interest the irs on the other hand if you work for a large business that you suspect is its income the irs will likely be very interested   blowing the whistle on a tax cheat   the irs may pay awards in exchange for valuable information that leads to the collection of taxes penalties interest or other amounts from the taxpayer according to the agency 's website there are various types of awards granted depending on the 's income level and classification business or individual the irs likely chooses to focus its efforts on these larger cases because they have a higher payoff it has also been suggested that higher income individuals have been found to cheat more frequently and for higher sums of money mostly because they tend to earn more self reported income   cover your assets   a complaint in order to spite an undesirable neighbor who does in fact pay taxes is not a good way to get revenge when you sign off on the irs form providing your report you are stating i declare under penalty of perjury that i have examined this application my accompanying statement and supporting documentation and that such application is true correct and complete to the best of my knowledge you do n't want to be found guilty of perjury   keep it legal   breaking into the cfo 's office at work to get evidence to support your claim is not a good idea the irs does n't want you to break the law to help find a tax cheat however if you are the bookkeeper for a company that is cheating on its taxes and part of your job involves working with documents that prove the company is cheating that paperwork would be acceptable to submit to the irs   while the irs wants to maintain your privacy if the case against the person you report ends up going to trial you could be asked to be a witness if you 're comfortable with that possibility go ahead and put your name on the report   reasons not to report a cheat   if your information is really just speculation it 's probably best to keep it to yourself as explained earlier in this article the irs does not have the resources to pursue your hunch   if you yourself are a tax cheat it might be best to stay in the clear there 's nothing that says that people who submit claims of cheating by others will have their own tax returns examined more carefully still it stands to reason that you would n't want to do anything to call irs attention to yourself if you 're not in compliance with its rules   if you helped plan or initiate the cheating of the person you are reporting it might be smart to think twice if you decide to report a crime in which you took part be prepared for the consequences and definitely do n't expect to receive a reward   as with many government processes there 's a lot of red tape to cut through therefore if you 're looking for fast cash you might want to look elsewhere it can take several years to complete an investigation of tax evasion and if there is no conviction there is no award not only does the irs have to determine guilt it has to actually collect the amount owed before paying you what 's more if the irs determines that your tip did not substantially contributed to the service 's detection and recovery of tax you will not receive an award   it 's also important to note that under some circumstances like attorney client confidentiality you may not be able to report tax cheating   other considerations   if you earn a whistle blower award it will need to be reported when you file your taxes if you 're blowing the whistle on your employer and you 're not planning to change jobs an irs audit could make your work situation extremely unpleasant this is n't to say that you should n't report someone who is cheating but it is something to consider   what 's next   if you decide to report the person or business you suspect of cheating use irs this form asks for basic information on the tax you are reporting the types of violations you believe to be committed the details of the violation and how you learned about it if you do not want to fill out this form you can also simply write the irs a letter if you are providing your name and want the possibility of receiving an award also submit irs form which is an application for the award   the bottom line   underpayment of federal income taxes and subsequently state income taxes is a serious problem the irs encourages people to submit tips by allowing anonymous submissions and offering generous rewards for who are willing to identify themselves if you can substantiate your claims and are willing to accept the potential consequences of reporting a tax cheat can be lucrative not only for the government but also for you   take control of your money    whether you ’re buying a home consolidating debt or planning a

obviously the best thing financially would be to continue using your present car unless it impacts you financially on a regular basis for example maintenance or breakdowns impacting your ability to work an unreliable car also impacts your freedom for example preventing you from taking road trips you might want to take or taking up free time with maintenance give thought to what it is about your present car that you dislike both to determine the value you gain from a new car and what 's most important to you anytime you buy a car you generally lose thousands of dollars simply driving it off the lot this is the profit which goes to dealers salespeople etc and not part of the actual value of the car cars also depreciate over time with most of the depreciation happening in the first few years of operation many of the newer model cars have additional expenses for example replacement $ 200 keys or electronic systems that can only be repaired at special facilities in addition if you have insurance other than the minimum third party required by law consider the rate increases and add up the long term impact of that imagine you had invested that money instead at 8 interest over the lifetime of the car if you do n't have insurance consider what you would do in the unfortunate situation where you were at fault in a collision could you afford to lose your investment even with safe responsible driving there is always the potential for road weather conditions or mechanical failures if you determine there is sufficient value to be gained from changing vehicles i would recommend that you buy a vehicle with history from someone privately doing appropriate background checks and consulting friends or family who know about vehicles and can provide feedback do research into the models which interest you ahead of time read online reviews every vehicle generally has known advantages and disadvantages which can take years to discover so buying an older vehicle gives you the advantage of knowing what to expect i would say there is probably a reasonable middle ground between using a 1991 vehicle you do n't like that 's as old as you are and getting a relatively new model look at what you value in the vehicle consider all the costs and find the balance that works best for you vehicles from 2000 2005 years are quite affordable and still 10 15 years newer than your car

different stocks balance dividend versus growth differently some have relatively flat value but pay a strong dividend utility stocks used to be examples of that model and bonds are in some sense an extreme version of this some especially startups pay virtually no dividends and aim for growth in the value of the stock and you can probably find a stock that hits any point between these this is the growth versus income spectrum you may have heard mentioned in the past investors took more of their return on investment as dividends conceptually a share of the company 's net profits for the year reflecting the share 's status as partial ownership if you wanted to do so you could use the dividend to purchase more shares via a dividend reinvestment plan or not but that was up to you these days with growth having been strongly hyped many companies have shifted much more to the growth model and dividends are often relatively essentially this assumes that everyone wants the money reinvested and will take their profit by having that increase the value of their shares of course that 's partly because some percentage of stockholders have been demanding growth at all costs not always realistically   to address your specific case no you probably are n't buying microsoft because you like its dividend rate you 're buying it in the hope it continues to grow in stock value but the dividend is a bit of additional return on your investment and with other companies the tradeoff will be different that 's one of the things along with how much you believe in the company that would affect your decision when buying shares in specific companies personally i mostly ignore the whole issue since i 'm in index funds rather than individual stocks picking the fund sets my overall preference in terms of growth versus income after that it 's their problem to maintain that balance

stop order is shorter term for stop loss order   the point being that is intended as a protective measure   a buy stop order would be used to limit losses when an investor has sold a stock short   meaning that they have borrowed stock and sold it in hopes that they can take advantage of a decline in the stock 's price by replacing the borrowed stock later at a cheaper price   the idea is to limit losses due to a rising stock price   meanwhile a sell stop order would be used to limit losses on a stock that an investor actually owns by selling it before the price declines further the important thing to keep in mind about stop orders is that they turn into market orders when the stop price is reached   this means that they will be filled at the best available price when the order is actually executed   in fast moving markets this can be a price that is quite different from the stop price a limit order allows an investor to ensure that they do not buy sell a stock at more less than the specified amount the thing to keep in mind is that a limit order is not guaranteed to execute a stop limit order is a combination of a stop loss order and limit order in that it becomes a limit order instead of a market order when the stop price is reached links to definitions stop order stop limit order limit order market order

that 's a good point what i should say is that pf does n't lose money on each gym user the way moviepass does my understanding is that moviepass gets a flat subscription fee from each user per month and then whenever a user wants to buy a movie ticket moviepass go out and purchase the movie ticket at full market value the same price that the customer would pay if they just went to the theater and bought one for example if a user pays $ 10 a month for a pass and decide to see two movies in that month they 've already lost money on that customer and two movies in one month is n't really crazy for some of the people who go enough that a monthly pass makes sense   and all this is assuming that ticket prices are lower than the subscription fee where i live the ticket prices are actually a little bit higher if moviepass was here even one movie would make me an unprofitable customer for them looking just at subscriptions of course   the data analytics play is the only viable strategy i can imagine for this i understand that certain business models rely on but i ca n't think of one where each customer that uses the service actually loses the business money

both of my primary home purchases were either at or close to asking price my first house was during the local seller 's market in 2001 2002 there were waiting lines for open houses in hindsight we bought more home than we needed at the time but that had nothing to do with offering asking price it was the market for the type of property location and features at that time my second house was a little after the peak in 2008 the value had come down quite a bit and the property was priced on the low side versus the comps to this day my second house still appraises higher than what we paid for it even though it was at asking price as a third example my brother in law got into a bidding war on his first home purchase and ended up buying it for above asking price this was normal for the houses in the area he was looking at with real estate like other people have said it really is important to either know the area you are looking at or to get an agent you trust and have them explain their reasons for their offer strategy through the comps yes agents need to make money but the good ones have been in the business a while and also live off of repeat business when you sell your house or refer friends and family to them agents do a lot less work when it comes to selling by the way so they would love for you to come back to them when it 's time to sell if i 'm not happy with the way things are going with my agent i would have a heart to heart with them and give them a chance to correct the relationship i 've spoken to a realtor friend in the past about getting out of buyer 's contracts and he told me it 's a lot easier as a buyer than a seller the buyer has most of the power during the process the seller just has what the buyer wants

i say before investing your real capital into the stock market play around on the virtual stock exchange game it let 's you invest with virtual capital and you can gain experience with the stock market i would n't start investing in stock until i 'm sure i can cover losses though if you do intend to invest stocks so early in your career then you should learn how to read sec filings not necessary but helpful in understanding how investors think such as documents so you can predict profitability and growth of companies you invest in once you become a veteran of the stock market game you probably wo n't need to read the sec filings into too much detail especially if you have a diverse portfolio good luck the one takeaway from this message would probably be stop and play around on virtual stocks before yourself in the real thing

i did this about 8 years ago with a buddy in chicago for the reasons specified in the original post   as other posters have suggested we discussed   a lot of the same questions listed above figured out the possible scenarios and then had a lawyer draw up a contract   we bought a 3 bedroom house and rented out the 3rd bedroom   overall it was a great experience   we both built equity while having a renter pay a third of the mortgage   plus the property tax and interest on the loan were tax deductible   compared with renting an apartment it made us   a lot more money   in the end we sold the house and split the profits   assuming you have the personalities to make it work i say go for it

it means $ 400 m expected revenue likely spread out over multiple years as it gets implemented and not entirely guaranteed to happen as they still need to fulfill the contract the impact on the stock price is complex it should be positive but nowhere close to a $ 400 m increase in market cap if the company is expected to routinely win such contracts it may have no significant effect on the stock price as it 's already priced in say if analysts expect the company to win contracts in this fiscal year and now they 've done 1/3 of that as expected

the market maker will always compare the highest bid and the lowest ask a trade will happen if the highest bid is at least as high as the lowest ask adding one share or a million shares at a higher asking price here $ 210 instead of $ 200 will not have any effect at all nobody will buy the share   adding a bid for one share or a million shares at a higher bid price will trigger a sale if you bid $ 210 for one share you will pay $ 210 for one of the shares that were offered at $ 200 if you have $ 210 million in cash and add a bid for 1,000,000 aapl at $ 210 you will pay $ 210 for all shares with an ask of $ then $ then $ until you either bought all shares with an ask up to $ 210 or until you bought a million shares   with aapl you probably bid the price up to $ 201 with a million shares so you made lots of people very happy while losing about 10 million dollars so let 's say this is a much smaller company   you have driven the share price up to $ 210 but there is nobody else bidding above $ 200 so nobody is going to buy your shares until some people think there is something going on and enter higher bids but then some people will take advantage of this and ask lower than your $ 210 and there will be more people trying to make cash by selling their shares at a good price than people tricked into bidding over $ 200 so it is most likely that you lose out   this completely ignores legality attempting to do this would be market manipulation and in many countries illegal i do n't know if losing money in the process would protect you from criminal charges

i guess i do n't understand how you figure that taking out a car loan for $ 20k will result in adding $ 20k in equity   a car loan is a liability not an asset like your $ 100k in cash   besides you do n't get a dollar for dollar consideration when figuring a car 's value against the loan it is by   in other words the car is only worth what someone 's willing to pay for it not what your loan amount on it is remember that taking on a loan will increase your debt to income ratio which is always a factor when trying to obtain a mortgage   at the same time taking on new debt just prior to shopping for a mortgage could make it more difficult to find a lender   every time a credit report hard inquiry is run on you it temporarily impacts your credit score   the only exception to this rule is when it comes to mortgages   in the u.s. the way it works is that once you start shopping for a mortgage with lenders for the next 30 days additional inquiries into your credit report for purposes of mortgage funding do not count against your credit score so it 's a in a way   you ca n't use this to shop for any other kind of credit but the purpose is to allow you a chance to shop for the best mortgage rate you can get without adversely impacting your credit in the end my advice is to stop looking at how much house you can buy and instead focus on a house with payments you can live with and afford   trying to buy the most house based on what someone 's willing to lend you leaves no room in the near term for being able to borrow if the property has some repair needs you want to furnish upgrade it or for any other unanticipated need which may arise that requires credit   do n't paint yourself into a corner   just because you can borrow big does n't mean you should borrow big i hope this helps good luck

you are missing a few variables from your calculation particularly implied volatility   even so it does not look like it would be too great a predictor even if incorporated   you should focus on calculating the option price at a different point in time with a different underlying price instead of using a total position value as that can be done afterwards i programmed and use the standard black scholes model to calculate expected returns    there are many tools online to help you without doing the programming or calculations yourself

housing prices are set by different criteria it can become memoryless the same as the stock if the criteria used to set its price in the past is no longer valid for example take phoenix or las vegas in the past these were considered attractive investments because of the economical growth and the climate of the area while the climate has n't changed the economical growth stopped not only there but also in the places where people buying the houses lived which is all over the world really what happened to the housing market dropped sharply and stays flat for several years now at the bottom so it does n't really matter if the house was worth $ 300 k in phoenix 5 years ago you can only sell it now for k and that 's about it the prices have been flat low for several years and the house price was $ 50 k but does it mean its going to stay so no once economy gears up the prices will go up as well so its not exactly memory less but the stocks are not memory less as well there is correlation between the past and the future performance if the environment conditions are similar the performance is likely to be similar for stocks however there 's much more environment conditions than the housing market and its much harder to predict them but even with the housing people were burnt a lot on the misconception that the past performance correlates to the future it does n't necessarily

i am going to clone an answer from another question that i wrote and refer you to an article in the wall street journal that i read this morning   what 's at stake in the greek vote summarizing the likely outcome of the situation if a euro exit looks likely after the election we will see a full fledged bank run greek banks would collapse the market exchange rate would likely be two or three drachmas to the euro which would double or triple the greek price of imported goods within a few days prices of assets including real estate assets would crumble those who moved their deposits abroad would be able to buy these assets cheaply leading to a significant regressive redistribution of greek wealth in short you 'd lose about two thirds of your savings unless you were storing them somewhere safe from the conversion the article also predicts difficulty importing goods other nations will demand to be paid in euro not drachma leading to disruption of trade and various supply shortages

this answer refers to the us investment landscape i 'm not sure your classification of funds as direct and regular accurately reflects the nature of the mutual fund industry   it 's not the funds themselves that are direct or regular   rather it 's the way an investor chooses to invest in them   if you make the investment yourself through your brokerage account you may say it 's a direct investment   if you pay a financial advisor to do this for you it 's regular for a given fund you could make the investment yourself or you could use an advisor note that many funds have various share classes   share classes may be accessed in different ways   the institutional class may be accessible through your 401(k or perhaps not even there for example   the premium class may require a certain minimum investment   some classes will have a front end load or back end load   each of these will have a different expense ratio and fees even though the money ends up in the same portfolio   these expenses are by law publicly available in the prospectus and in numerous other places   share classes with higher fees will earn less each year after fees just as you suggest   your intuition is correct on this point now there is one fee to be aware of that funds either have or do not have   that 's a 12b-1 fee   this fee is a kickback to financial advisors who funnel your money into their fund   if you use a financial advisor he or she will likely put your money into these funds because they have a financial incentive to do so   that way they get paid twice once by you and once by the mutual fund   it has been shown in the finance academic literature that funds without this fee dominate are better in some ways and in no ways worse than funds with this fee i suppose you could say that funds and share classes with a 12b-1 fee were designed for regular investment and those without were designed for direct but that does n't mean you ca n't invest in a 12b-1 fee fund directly nor that you ca n't twist your advisor 's arm into getting you into a good fund without a 12b-1   unfortunately if you have this level of knowledge then you probably do n't need a financial advisor

here is my personal opinion   please take what i say with a grain of salt   i 've been in your position before so i had to myself     with that said all your poor decisions were made in the past   certainly today there are consequences that you are facing for the decisions you made but still they were in the past   so you can eat and you can live   perhaps not to your liking but this is a rare opportunity   you see i am assuming your american we americans often feel that more in life means more happiness   but being in debt like you can show you that there is another path   just having enough     things like enjoying every bite of the meal you just ate or enjoying every moment while you 're not thinking about the poor decisions you 've made in the past will help you greatly in the future   i found that because of my debt problems living in the present moment was the only way i could stop myself from loosing all sanity   in fact because of that i started to not focus on how to get out of debt but how to live with debt   it became much easier once i was able to naturally accept that there is debt and it will be paid someday but this is how life is and it does n't bother me   i found that by letting it go eventually not only the mental problem but the debt began to solve itself     i know it sounds like jumbo but doing everything as a small step for example when you get in the shower today feel the hot water   i mean like really feel it   you have hot running water   think about the hot water and how good it is   this is the moment   maybe tomorrow you wo n't have hot running water but that 's ok because it 's not tomorrow it 's today   doing it like that with everything saved me from most likely something horrible   hth you a bit

you want to combine a set of techniques to avoid throwing food away consider setting aside a weekend day or other non busy time to do some food prep   check to see if there is anything in the fridge that needs to be used quickly and prioritize meals that use that item   make a weekly menu and get your groceries   chop all the vegetables and fruits you need for the week 's meals   cook meats that can be cooked in advance   chefs call the concept of having everything ready for making a meal mis en place   try to do yours in advance to you for cooking and also make you more likely to cook on those nights you 've been at the office late get to know and love your freezer   buy frozen meat in bulk and portion individually wrap 1/2 lb blocks of ground beef and chicken pieces in foil then store in freezer bags for example   get frozen packaged fish for seafood   boil a whole chicken shred the meat and have on hand for easy meals like tacos chicken pot pie pasta etc   do the same with beef or pork shoulder for pulled pork etc   freeze vegetables and fruits if you ca n't use them in time or buy frozen vegetables to begin with   you can even consider making like or and freezing for a homemade alternative to a frozen food aisle meal   you can even go all the way with freezer cooking cook with shelf stable items   rice pasta beans canned goods and other items can be made into major components of a meal when you do buy something perishable that does n't freeze well try to utilize it in more than one of your meals for the week   this works well for items like fresh if you do n't want to spend a lot of time cooking a source like is a great place to start many recipes there can be finished in under 10 minutes most are five ingredients or less and all are tasty and good for you this question from seasoned advice has a lot of great suggestions although geared towards a college student that you should consider

the trade off seems to be quite simple how much are you going to get if you sell it against how much are you going to get if you rent it out several people already hinted that the rental revenue may be optimistic i do n't have anything to add to this but keep in mind that if someone pays 45k for your apartment the net gains for you will likely be lower as well another consideration would be that the value of your apartment can change if you expect it to rise steadily you may want to think twice before selling now assuming you have calculated your numbers properly and a near 0 opportunity cost 45,000 right now per year the given numbers imply a return on investment of 14 years or 7.1 personal conclusion i would be surprised if you can actually get a expected net profit for an apartment that rents out at 6k per year but if you are confident the reward seems to be quite nice

there is no way you can directly defer that capital gains tax if you sell a property that is not your principal residence it will be taxed in the year in which it was sold it does n't matter what you do with the proceeds that tax will get paid now if you had adequate rrsp contribution room you could certainly put some money there and would get a deduction on your tax return that would offset this capital gains tax for example if you sold a property for $ 300 k that was originally purchased for $ 200 k then you would incur capital gains tax of $ 50 k assuming you were not claiming cca deductions if you took $ 50 k of your proceeds and put it in an rrsp it would offset the tax you pay now and essentially defer the tax on that $ 50 k of income until you withdraw hopefully at a lower marginal tax rate a spousal rrsp would work the same except it would be taxed at your spouse 's marginal tax rate when withdrawn either way you need to have sufficient contribution room in the rrsp for this to work check your notice of assessment to see how much room you have available

i 'm in agreement with what you write i think these are good questions   from my perspective i think the staggering growth of technology is both the cause and the answer to stagnating wage productivity increase conundrum today a small business will hire a secretary to use email and excel while in 1980 they would have hired a team of accountants with piles of ledger books we are paying less employees while accomplishing more    at the same time technology gives us all in the general public a higher standard of living through better phones more access to cheap free education better health care better infrastructure more cheaply than anyone in 1980 would have imagined   what happens when we get to the point that any person that is halfway capable and not on drugs can survive just fine in a 40 hour if we got to that point the normal of rate of growth and wage stagnation and economic mobility would there would be people happy to live a stress free life at that baseline survive just fine and there would be people working their butts off to acquire more than anyone might need    i think it all comes down to people wanting what someone else has and calling it unfair because they do n't seem to deserve it more than anyone else i think the real goal we should strive for is liberty and opportunity for anyone to pursue their form of improving their quality of life government intervention and distorted views of fairness tend to hinder that

6 is n't too high in terms of market rates at the moment however it 's a very subjective question whether it 's too high for you the real question to determine is if paying 6 can you make more than 6 return to cover the costs plus your profit as for a rule of thumb there 's none i know of however your best bet is to take the time to model it in excel not difficult   it 's different for each portfolio or investment something with a high standard deviation of returns is already high risk adding margin to it only makes it worse   so long story short is that it depends

i would say that all of the reasons you list in your question are valid and i would add the following you are in the landscaping business not the accounting business if you manage everything in spreadsheets at least one of you has to become the bookkeeper and leave the landscaping to the others spreadsheets are agnostic in how you use them so you have to turn them into an accounting system which means you 're now not only more of a bookkeeper but you 're also more of a developer too and even less of a accounting software is already developed by developers who understand accounting using it requires you to only perform the data entry tasks and then you can focus on the landscaping customer service sales and marketing etc things that actually contribute to your business   it is still good for you to understand basic accounting principles specialized accounting software will guide you through the process of learning and help you avoid making many of the costly mistakes you might have made in that learning process

as a new very small business the irs has lots of advice and information for you start at and be sure you have several pots of coffee or other appropriate aid against   by default a single member llc is disregarded for tax purposes at least for federal and generally states follow federal although i do n't know mass. specifically although it does have other effects if you go this route you simply include the business income and expenses on schedule c as part of your individual return on 1040 and the net se income is included along with your other income if any in computing your tax turbotax or similar software should handle this for you although you may need a premium version that costs a little more   you can elect to have the llc taxed as a corporation by filing form see in principle you are supposed to do this when the entity is formed but in practice aiui if you do it by the end of the year they wo n't care at all and if you do it after the end of the year but before or with your first affected return you qualify for automatic relief however deciding how to divide the business income profits into reasonable pay to yourself versus dividends is more complicated and filling out corporation tax returns in addition to your individual return which is still required is more work in addition to the work and cost of filing and reporting the llc itself to your state of choice unless until you make something like $ a year this probably is n't worth it 1099 reporting stripe qualifies as a payment network and under a recent law payment networks must annually report to irs and copy to you on form 1099-k if your account exceeds certain thresholds see   note you are still legally required to report and pay tax on your se income even if you are n't covered by 1099-k or other reporting self employment tax as a self employed person if the llc is disregarded you have to pay se tax that is effectively equivalent to the fica taxes that would be paid by your employer and you as an employee combined this is 12.4 for social security unless until your total earned income exceeds a cap for 2017 $ adjusted yearly for inflation and 2.9 for medicare with no limit plus additional medicare tax if you exceed a higher threshold and it is n't repealed and replaced if the llc corporation status it has to pay you reasonable wages for your services and fica on those wages like any other employer estimated payments you are required to pay most of your individual income tax and se tax if applicable during the year generally 90 of your tax or your tax minus $ 1,000 whichever is less most wage earners do n't notice this because it happens automatically through payroll withholding but as self employed you are responsible for making sufficient and timely estimated payments and will owe a penalty if you do n't however since this is your first year you may have a safe harbor if you also have income from an employer reported on w-2 with withholding and that withholding is to pay last year 's tax then you are exempt from the underpayment penalty for this year   if you elect corporation status then the corporation which is really just you must always make timely payments of withheld amounts according to one of several different schedules that may apply depending on the amounts i believe it also must make estimated payments for its own liability if any but i 'm not familiar with that part

a good reference to what encompasses securities are detailed in the securities act of 1933 which was enacted by the united states federal government one main exception which i would still consider securities for your purposes would be commercial paper these are exempt from the securities act because they mature in 270 days of less but they function much like bonds or promissory notes therefore though it would not encompass currencies and commodities it really comes down to the structure of the agreement for transferring or holding the particular kind of underlying asset

from your profile i see you are in israel the process is probably different from in the us   in the us an agent is usually happy to work with a buyer after all when i list a house there are potential buyers all over my state and elsewhere the best thing you can do is first have your financing in order a bank will be able to tell you how much you can afford and how much they 'll lend you if you approach an agent and tell them the exact range of price area you 're interested in and other specifics such as number of bedrooms etc that agent should be happy to find houses to fit your request   obviously an agent listing million dollar homes busy with those all day is not going to want to handle a buyer looking for a $ 200 k home but in the end the real estate agents are n't all listing high end and someone is moving the smaller houses as well often an office will have a call center where agents who are less busy will answer the phone hoping to get a client that will bring a sale that 's one way to go the other is word of mouth just ask others who you work with or socialize with if they know a good agent in my case i 'd be happy to get such a referral

you will owe tax on all but the deposit that was not taxed   e.g. you deposited $ for 3 years and deducted $ 5 k for each of 2 years the third $ 5 k   deposit was a nondeductible ira contribution which you reported to the irs by filing form 8606 with your tax return for that year now you convert the total balance of $ 18 k $ 15 k of contributions plus $ 3 k of interest gains in this case $ 5 k is not taxable income while the $ 13 k is taxable income this calculation is done on form 8606 for the year of the rollover edit in response to op 's comment the roth conversion is text based on the value of a day it was   converted one thing to be aware of is that you can re characterize up until the time you file your taxes for 2017 in april 2018 or with extension up until october   this offers you the opportunity to undo the conversion if for whatever reason the value is lower at the time you do your taxes or if the converted amount will put you into a higher tax bracket you do n't need to give the irs a reason it 's up to your discretion as dave note in a comment the conversion is n't all or none the recharacterization along with this fact help you to fine tune exactly how much in converted in hindsight

banks often offer cash to people who open savings accounts in order to drive new business their gain is pretty much as you think to grow their asset base a survey released in 2008 by uk based age concern declared that only 16 of the british population have ever switched their banks while 45 of marriages now end in divorce   till death do most part in the us similar analysis is pointing to a decline in people moving banks from the typical rate of 15 annually if people are unwilling to change banks then how much more difficult for online brokers to get customers to switch td ameritrade is offering you 30 days commission free and some cash 0.2 0.4 depending on the funds you invest   most people especially those who use the opportunity to buy and hold wo n't make much money for them but it only takes a few more aggressive traders for them to gain overall for financial institutions the question is straightforward how much must they pay you to overcome your switching cost of changing institutions   if that number is sufficiently smaller than what they feel they can make in profits on having your business then they will pay edit to elaborate the mechanism by which any financial institution makes money by offering cash to customers is essentially one of the law of large numbers   if all you did is transfer in say $ 100,000 buy an etf within the 30-day window or any of the ongoing commission free ones and hold then sell after a few years they will probably lose money on you   i imagine they expect that on a large number of people taking advantage of this offer    credit card companies are no different   more than half of people pay their monthly credit balance without incurring any interest charges they get 30 days of credit for free   everyone else makes the company a fortune td ameritrade 's fees are quite comprehensive outside of this special offer   besides transactional commissions their value added services include subscription fees administration fees transaction fees a few extra special value added services and then when you wish to cash out and realise your returns an outbound transfer fee however you 're a captured market   since most people wo n't change their online brokers any more often than they 'd change their bank td ameritrade will be looking to offer you all sorts of new services and take commission on all of it at most they spend $ to get you as a customer or to get you to transfer a lot more cash into their funds   and they get to keep you for how long   ten years maybe more   you think they might be able to sell you a few big ticket items in the interim maybe interest you in some subscription service this is n't grocery shopping   they can afford to think long term

you can take a queue from any sales opportunity and position it in ways that will still appeal to someone who intends to continue working perpetually here are some of the points i would make 401k matching funds are free money that you will have access to in ~20 years whether you retire or not long term savings that grow in the stock market turn into residual income that will add to your standard of living whether you retire or not there are tax advantages to deferring income if you are in a high tax bracket now you will have flexibility to withdraw that money in future years where you might have lower earnings for example in a future year you could take a sabbatical trip to europe for a few months without pay and draw on your savings during that time that you are not making money even if you do n't invest in a 401k you and max out hsa accounts if you are eligible and position that as money for medical expenses if you never have medical reasons to spend that money you can still withdraw at retirement age like a 401k or ira though it gets taxed as income if not used for qualified medical purposes at retirement time with an unwilling partner it 's difficult to make a lot of progress but if you have matching funds from your employer do make sure that you are getting at least those for yourself ultimately if he does n't want to save for himself you should for yourself there are no guarantees in life if he dies or leaves you must be prepared to take care of your own needs

one reason why you can get a better rate with a cd compared to a regular savings account is that they lock you into that account for the period of the cd you can get out of the cd early but you will forfeit some of the interest you also generally ca n't move a portion of the money out of the cd you have to pull it all out and then start a new cd with the portion you do n't spend you have to check the terms and conditions for that particular cd   some people use them to hold their emergency fund this is the 3 6 months of expenses you set aside in case of a major problem such as a medical emergency or a job loss the rate is better than the regular savings account so it can come closer to inflation the goal is preservation of capital not investing for the future so if you understand the risks and the cd is backed with the same guarantees as the savings account then it is a viable way to store some or all of the emergency fund

there is no fixed formulae its more of how much you can negotiate vs how many others are willing to work at a lower cost typically in software industry the rates for part time work would be roughly in the range of 1.5 to 2 times that of the full time work for the same job with the above premise roughly the company would be willing to pay $ 100,000 for 2000 hrs of part time translating into around $ 50 per hour how much you actually get would depend on if there is someone else who can work for less say at $ 30 at hour 1 the company does not have 2000 hrs of work and hence its engaging part time worker instead of full time at lesser cost

short answer   any long term financial planning e.g. mortgage and retirement planning   long answer inflation does n't really matter in short time frames on any given day you might get a rent hike or a raise or the grocery store might have a sale   inflation is really only relevant over the long term   annual inflation is tiny compared to large unexpected 10   however over 10 years even your large unexpected expenses will still average out to a small fraction of your spending compared to the impact of compounded inflation inflation is really critical when you are trying to plan for retirement which you should start doing when you get your first job   when making long term projections you need to consider not only your expected nominal rate of investment return e.g. 7 but also subtract the expected rate of inflation e.g. 3 alternatively you can add the inflation rate to your projected spending being sure to compound year over year when projecting your income 10 + years out you can use inflation to estimate your annual raises   up to age 30 people tend to get raises that exceed inflation thereafter they tend to track inflation if you ever decide to buy a house you need to consider the impact of inflation when calculating the total cost over a mortgage generally you can expect your house to appreciate over 30 years in line with inflation possibly more in an urban area so a simple mortgage projection needs to account for interest inflation maintenance insurance and closing costs you could also consider inflation for things like rent and income but only over several years generally rent and income are such large amounts of money it is worth your time to research specific alternatives rather than just guessing what market rates are this year based on average inflation while it is true that rent and wages go up in line with inflation in the long run you can make a lot of money in the short run if you keep an eye on market rates every year over 10 20 years your personal rate of inflation should be very close to the average rate when you consider all your spending housing food energy clothing etc

if you keep going over budget with your credit card then stop using the credit card if you plan to pay off the card every month then your balance should always be under whatever your budget is   for example if you budget to spend $ 500 then even though your card has a limit of $ 5,000 you will never carry a balance of over $ 500   most banks have an option to email and or text message you when you pass a certain balance threshold in this instance you would set two notices one when your balance exceeds $ 400 warning you that you 're close need to start paying closer attention and one when you exceed $ 500 additionally maybe you are n't ready to pay for everything with your credit card   i prefer to use mine just for groceries and then pay it off at the end of the month   whatever rewards you get for putting all of your purchases on the card are more than paid for when you cross your budget limit costing you more in interest and fees   perhaps starting with just one type of purchase groceries or gas are good choices as most consumers are fairly consistent in their purchases of both would allow you to ease into using the card until you get used to managing your budget with it personal finances are all about behavior not knowledge   do n't worry too much about slipping up right now and making a mistake just keep practicing good behavior with your credit card and soon managing your budget with it will be as natural for you as when you only used cash

the $ 3 k includes property tax right it looks like the mortgage alone will be about $ or so if your cal state tax is enough to put you into itemized deductions your mortgage and property tax are a write off and the $ 3k will actually be closer to the $ 2 k you are considering for rent   the wild card as i see it is that your budget is so tight that any unforeseen expenses will be charged as a long time homeowner i know these expenses sometime appear to be high and regular despite their random nature the money earmarked for credit card payments will go a long way to cover the tight budget you seem to have this and your decreasing support makes this look tight but not impossible the condition of the house would make or break the deal in my opinion

as others have alluded to but have n't said due to the lack of reputation points to spare you can take advantage of oil prices by leveraging up and using as much credit and margin as the banks and brokerages respectively will lend you people assume that the correct answer on this forum has to as conservative financial advice and this is not advice nor conservative futures contracts are readily available but they are expensive to obtain like a minimum entry of $ but if this expense is no such object to you then you can then obtain this contract which is actually worth 20x that and experience the price appreciation and depreciation of the whole contract the concept is similar to a downpayment on a mortgage you assume rock bottom oil prices but fortunately for you futures contracts will allow you to quickly change your bets from future price appreciation and allow you to speculate on future price depreciation so although the union workers will be protesting full time after the drilling company lays them off you will still be getting wealthier long options these are the best the difference with options amongst other speculation products is that options require the least amount of capital risk for the greatest reward with futures or with trading shares of an etf especially on margin you have to put up a lot of capital and if the market does not go your desired direction then will lose a lot and on margin products you can lose more than you put in being long options does not come with these a long march 2015 call option on uso etf can currently be bought for less than $ 200 of actual cash ie the trading quote will be less than $ 2.00 but this will cost you less than $ 200 and will be worth $ 1000 on a very modest rebound in prices the most you can lose is the $ 200 for the contract compared to $ on the futures or $ 100,000 that you do n't have in the futures market if oil really moves against you or compared to whatever large amount of cash needed to actually buy shares of an etf needed to make any decent return these are the most lucrative and fun and and ways to take advantage of rock bottom oil prices as an individual

there is actually a recent paper that attempted to buffett 's outperformance i 've quoted the abstract below berkshire hathaway has realized a sharpe ratio of higher than any other stock or mutual fund with a history of more than 30 years and berkshire has a significant alpha to traditional risk factors however we find that the alpha becomes insignificant when controlling for exposures to betting against beta and quality minus junk factors further we estimate that buffett ’s leverage is about on average buffett ’s returns appear to be neither luck nor magic but rather reward for the use of leverage combined with a focus on cheap safe quality stocks portfolio into ownership in publicly traded stocks versus wholly owned private companies we find that the former performs the best suggesting that buffett ’s returns are more due to stock selection than to his effect on management these results have broad implications for market efficiency and the of academic factors

there needs to be more numbers with your choices without those any answer is purely speculation assuming that india is much like the us you are almost always better to go with a company leased car   that is if you are not responsible for the lease if your employment ends with the company here in the us companies typically reimburse so tax free their employees for about 50 cents per mile or about 31 cents per   this barely covers the gas and insurance and falls way short when one includes and maintenance   so it is better to have the company to pick up all those costs       borrowing money on a car is just plain dumb no matter what the interest rate   so i would stick with choice number 1 or 3 depending on the arrangement for the company leased car the next question becomes how much you should spend for a car   i would say enough to keep you happy and safe but not much more than that until you are wealthy

another approach would be more personalized which is to measure the risk of missing your goals rather than measuring the risk of an investment in some abstract sense financial planners do this for example with monte carlo simulation software see they would put in a goal such as not running out of money before you die with assumptions such as the longest you might live and how much you 'll withdraw every year you 'd also assume an asset allocation the monte carlo simulation then generates random market movements over the time period considering historical behavior of your asset allocation and each run of the simulation would either succeed you are able to support yourself until death or fail you run out of money the risk measure is the percentage of simulation runs that fail you can do this to plan saving for retirement in addition to planning withdrawals then your goal would be to have x amount of money in real after inflation dollars perhaps and success is if you end up with it and failure is if you do n't the great thing about this risk measure is that it 's relevant and personal 10 chance of being impoverished at age 85 20 chance of having to work an extra decade because you do n't have enough at 65 these kinds of answers which is a lot easier to act on than the variance is 10 or the beta is 1.5 would you rather know your plan has a 90 chance of success or know that you have a variance of 10 both numbers are probably just guesses but at least the chance of success measure is actionable and relevant some tangential thoughts fwiw

typically banks look for a steady source of income or savings based on which they issue a credit card if you ca n't show that build a cash balance and show it for example if you have an ppf account with say sbi they issue you a card with a limit of around 50 of the balance in ppf no other documentation is required similarly if you have fixed deposits for a large amount quite a few banks would give you a credit card my wife has a credit card because she had a good balance around 100,000 inr for around a year the bank kept calling her and offered her a card
