dividend yields can also reflect important information about the company 's status for example a company that has never lowered or stopped paying dividends is a strong company because it has the cash earnings power to maintain its dividend regardless of the market ideally a company should pay dividends for at least 10 years for an investor to consider the company as a consistent payer furthermore when a company pays dividend it generally means that it has more cash than it can profitably reinvest in the business so companies that pay dividends tend to be older but more stable an important exception is reit 's and their ilk to avoid taxation these types of funds must distribute 90 of their earnings to their shareholders so they pay very high dividends just look at stocks like or to get an idea the issue here however is two fold so a high dividend can be great if it has been paid consistently or risky if the company is new or has a short payment history and dividends can also tell us about what the company 's status is   lastly taxation on dividend income is higher than taxation on capital gains but by reinvesting dividends you can avoid this tax and lower your potential capital gain amount thus limiting taxes   is an excellent paper on dividend yields and investing

hedging you have an investment and are worried that the price might drop in the near future you do n't want to sell as this will realise a capital gain for which you may have to pay capital gains tax so instead you make an investment in another instrument sometimes called insurance to offset falls in your investment   an example may be that you own shares in xyz you feel the price has risen sharply over the last month and is due for a steep fall so you buy some put option over xyz you pay a small premium and if the price of xyz falls you will lose money on the shares but will make money on the put option thus limiting your losses if the price continues to go up you will only lose the premium you paid for the option very similar to an insurance policy diversification this is when you may have say $ 100,000 to invest and spread your investments over a portfolio of shares some units in a property fund and some bonds so you are spreading your risks and returns over a range of products the idea is if one stock or one sector goes down you will not lose a large portion of your investment as it is unlikely that all the different sectors will all go down at the same time

focusing on options many people and companies use them to mitigate   when used as a hedge the objective is not to win big it is to create a more predictable outcome option traders win big by structuring trades with a high probability of success in this way they take 100 and turn it into 1000 with 100 small trades with a target profit of $   although options are a zero sum game a general theory among options traders is the stock market only has a 54 56 probability of skewed from 50 50 win loss because the market tends to go up over a long time frame using option trading strategies strategically you have more control over pop and you can set yourself up to win whether the security goes up down sideways    a quick and dirty measure of pop is an options delta   if the delta on a call option is 19 there is roughly a 19 chance your option will be in the money at expiration or a 19 chance of hitting a home run and your money   if the delta is 68 there is a 68 chance of a profitable trade or getting on base there are more variables to this equation but   i hope this clearly explains the essence

whatever you do you need to be saving a lot more to have a good chance at retirement at a reasonable age with a combined salary of $ 150,000 i 'd recommend in total that 's $ in tax advantaged accounts plus whatever you put into taxable accounts your $ 150,000 yearly income less $ in savings is still an income of $ 60,000 people live comfortably and raise families on a lot less consider how fortunate you are you could retire in 10 years if you wanted by increasing your savings and decreasing your expenses seriously i 'm speaking from first hand experience if you stay on your present course saving $ at a 7 real return you 'll need about 37 years to accumulate $ in today 's dollars which is enough to even if those student loans are forgiven that only knocks off about 2 years if you are in your late 30s now there 's a decent chance you 'll be dead before you retire as for buying a house or not this depends a lot on your personal circumstance and how the rental market in your city compares in your decision do n't forget to consider renting is not necessarily throwing money away any more than buying a house is if you take out a mortgage you 'll be throwing away a lot of money anyway look for a loan amortization calculator to see how much goes to interest versus principal for a $ 500,000 loan at a 3.5 rate you will be paying approximately $ 1400 per month in interest versus only $ 800 towards the principal when you deduct insurance taxes maintenance etc from that $ 800 you may find you are still throwing away most of your monthly payment on interest and expenses you would n't have if you rented the money you do save after interest and expenses is n't really saved housing markets go up and down but on average over the long term they go up just enough to keep up with inflation meaning a 0 real return if renting means less cash out of pocket per month you can put that extra cash towards investments that yield a much higher return sure you may need to continue making rental payments in perpetuity but you can save enough extra money to pay for the rental in investment income again it depends considerably on how the housing and rental markets compare where you live popular cities san francisco new york paris etc tend to favor renting unpopular cities detroit st. louis and rural areas tend to favor buying further reading mr. money mustache rent vs. buy if you have to ask you should probably rent

obviously you ca n't predict the future too much but it 's not too hard to figure out what is going to happen to mortgage rates in the short term mortgage rates are heavily influenced by 10 year treasury yields   you can find the daily 10 year rates here   it 's easy to see the direction they 've been moving recently   it usually takes a few days for mortgage rates to follow if the 10 year treasury yield is dropping although if it 's going up mortgage rates will go up faster than they will fall here 's a sample of all the 10 year treasury yields for the past 10 years   looks like a good time to get a mortgage or refinance you can also take a look at movements in mortgage backed securities here you can find a chart for fannie mae 3.0 mortgages   as the price goes up mortgage rates go down   think of it this way right now people are will to pay $ 103 for $ 100 worth of 3.0 mortgages that does n't really make sense because i could just loan you $ 100 at 3.0 and turn around and sell it for $ 103 immediately pocketing the $ 3 profit   the reason is because right now no one would willingly borrow money at 3.0 rates have fallen so much that if a bank has a customer paying them 3.0 on a mortgage other people are willing to pay a premium on that mortgage new mortgages are probably being written for 2.0 there is no current mortgage backed security for 2.0 fannie because rates have never been this low before

gt the paper which is yet to be published found that a 10 percent increase in airbnb listings can create an average percent increase in rents and an average percent increase in home prices the wall street journal reported   in the long term rents and property value go up at the same rate so if they 're saying that one is almost double the other the margin of error here could be very large

i can address what it means to pick off all those trades as littleadv have said it is absolutely true that professionals prey on less sophisticated market participants they are n't in the market for charity 's sake   if you 're not familiar with the definition of the word arbitrage look it up   one possible strategy that can be employed with hft machinery in order to arbitrage successfully in the stock market is to intercept orders that are placed on various exchanges in order to do this an hft organization watches all the transactions at once to find opportunities to buy low and sell high   a good explanation of it is described here in this ny times article i 'll paraphrase what that article lays out   stocks are traded through multiple exchanges the first key point to understand is that stocks listed on one exchange i.e. the nyse can be sold on multiple exchanges that 's where the actual i would like to sell 100 shares of ford stock is matched with i would like to buy 100 shares of ford stock there are multiple clearinghouses on the various exchanges your order gets presented to one exchange at a time an ideal market maker would like to look at the order books for a given stock say ford and see that in exchange a there 's a sell order for 100 shares of f at $ and in exchange b there 's a buy order for 100 shares of f at $   arbitrage market maker buys from a sells in b and pockets $ 0.05 100 $ 5 it 's not much but it was relatively risk free also scale this up to the scale of the us multiple stock exchanges and there are lots of opportunities to make $ 5 every second   computers are of course faster than people to tie it in completely with your question about picking off trades hft rigs can be set up and programmed to go faster than an average retail investor 's order   let 's say you execute the trade to buy 100 shares $ as a retail investor the hft rigs see your order starting to make the rounds of the different exchanges that your brokerage works through and go out in front in a matter of milliseconds finding the orders that are less than $ and less than or equal to 100 shares they execute a transaction buy them up sell to you and pocket the difference   you have been picked off   it 's admittedly not the only way to use hft equipment to make money but it 's definitely one way to do it

first consider the basic case of what you are asking you expect to have a future obligation to pay interest and you are concerned that the rate when you pay it will be higher than the rate today in the simplest case you could theoretically hedge that risk by buying an asset which pays the market interest rate as the interest rate rises increasing your costs your return on this asset would also increase this would minimize your exposure to interest rate fluctuations there are of course two problems with this simplified solution   1 the reason you expect to pay interest is because you need want to take on debt to purchase your house to fully offset this risk by putting all your money in an asset which bears the market interest rate would effectively be the same as just buying your house in cash 2 the timing of the future outflow is a bit unique you will be locking in a rate in 5 years which will determine the payments for the 5 years after that so unless you own this interest paying asset for that whole future duration you wo n't immediately benefit you also wo n't need want to buy that asset today because the rates from today to 2022 are largely irrelevant to you you want something that directly goes against the prevailing mortgage interest rate in 2022 precisely so in your specific case you could in theory consider the following solution you could short a coupon bond likely one with a 10 year maturity date from today as interest rates rise the value of the coupon bond for it 's remaining life of 5 years which has an implied interest rate set today will drop because you will have shorted an asset dropping in value you will have a gain you could then close your short position when you buy your house in 5 years in theory your gain at that moment in time would equal the present value of the rate differential between today 's low mortgage rates and tomorrow 's high interest rates there are different ways mechanically to achieve what i mention above such as buying forward derivative contracts based on interest rates etc but all methods will have a few important caveats 1 these will not be perfect hedges against your mortgage rates unless the product directly relates to mortgage rates general interest rates will only be a proxy for mortgage rates 2 there is additional risk in taking this type of position taking a short position trading on a margin requires you to make ongoing payments to the broker in the event that your position loses money theoretically those losses would be offset by inherent gains in the future if mortgage rates stay low go lower but that offset is n't in your plan for 5 years 3 5 years may be too long of a timeline for you to accurately time the maturity of your hedge position if you end up moving in 7 years then changes in rates between 2022 might mean you lose on both your hedge position and your mortgage rates 4 taking on a position like this will tie up your capital either because you are directly buying an asset you believe will offset growing interest rates or because you are taking on a margin account for a short position preventing you from using a margin account for other investments to the extent you max out your margin limit i doubt any of these solutions will be desirable to an individual looking to mitigate interest rate risk because of the additional risks it creates but it may help you see this idea in another light

there is a technique called the elliott wave which explains these shocks the reversal directions you are questioning are part of the pattern it is known as corrections the elliott wave is an indicator based on psychology of investors think about it this way if you see a huge up trend what are you most likely to do sell and make profit or continue this is why there is a shock before it continues many people will sell to be safe especially after hearing the bad news they wo n't risk it by learning the elliott wave you 'll be able to make an educated decision on whether or not to stay or leave here are websites on the elliott wave the elliott wave is helpful in any time frame and works well with momentum hope this helps

the value of debt is that it allows you to profit from the return of equity beyond the amount of actual net equity you own   of course this only works if the cost of borrowing is less than your return on equity   market timing matters a great deal but is n't accounted for in this view   for my answer i would like to hand wave away market timing considerations   one plausible justification is that you could default on your current home and then immediately go buy one of equal value   if you buy a new home of a lesser value due to lack of funds and then prices appreciate then you missed some opportunity cost but probably not $ 100k worth of it moving on here are some helpful assumptions i 'll make i 'll ignore performance of your portfolio after retirement and only seek to optimize f which will be your net worth upon retirement   in either case your current net worth is earning the r2 rate   we can convert this for both your current net worth and future savings using conversion formulas present to future value f = p annual to future value f = s 1 r2 adding these together is sufficient to obtain f in the case that you have no borrowing power   the case where you do not default and maintain your credit score is different due to an initial $ 100k penalty and the amortized value of borrowing power   in a completely theoretical sense you get an effective yield on all borrowed money   the future value will be the following f = a1 one step is missing however which is to convert this value the value of having a good credit score into present value to compare to value of your defaulting p of borrowing power = f = a1 now let 's put some specific values in   say that you can borrow $ 300k with your good credit history and this applies for the next 25 years after which you retire   the borrowing rate is 7 and the time value of money to you is 10   i would then calculate p of borrowing power = $ 58 k < $ 100 k this indicates that it would be more economical to default   of course some people might point out that it will be removed from your record after 7 years   if you plug 7 years instead of 25 years into the equation almost no assumptions about rates will lead to the option of keeping your house being preferable so in a nutshell the value of your credit is probably less than $ 100k in a purely mathematical sense   but there are other factors too   if you do n't have that borrowing ability maybe you would n't be able to borrow money to start the business of your dreams   if you are a rock star entrepreneur then time value of money to you could be 1,000 yield sure then maybe you could make the above numbers work to favor keeping the house   i 've also neglected ethics   as other people point out it would be like stealing from the bank

in terms of preserving good relationships one approach is to charge a nominal rate of interest maybe a few percent of the total and agree a time when it should be paid back this may actually make them feel better about borrowing them money especially especially if it is something like business loan or buying a house or car   if they need the money for a real crisis and they have no clear strategy for paying it back then it may just be better all around if you make it clear that it is a gift   what you do n't want to do is set up a situation where you are creating unnecessary problems down the road and that will very much depend on your individual relationship and how seriously you take the loan   here it is important that you are completely open and honest about the arrangement so take the time to make sure that both parties understand exactly what they expect from each other

thanks for the great response   the example with calculus is perfect group a is some students who will never ever get it no matter how much you teach and train them   as you know group b is some students who excel in calculus just by reading the book with no need for a professor to explain or teach them they probably exceed in understanding beyond the course objectives   group c most will be in the middle struggle and with efforts of the professor if the class is not more than 10 15 students and their own efforts they will eventually understand some will get c some will get b and few will get a.   which group will succeed with their career if it requires calculus   gt the messed up part is that professors are never formally taught to teach    true i was an professor while studying for my master 's in the end of the semester students had to evaluate their professors i got the 2nd best results after another part time professor and way above all tenured professors are you surprised by the way i was teaching introductory classes and i was working for the department i was teaching for as a research intern   as for professors who do n't know how to teach this was not an issue in the past and was not needed in the past i.e. it 's because of past traditions    in the past the role of the professor was not so much to teach in the sense and the way teachers teach today in elementary school attend and dance around every student 's special needs and go in a slow pace to accommodate make sure nobody is left behind   the role of the professor in the past being a real expert and full of knowledge far and beyond what is required was to plan and sequence what has to be taught in a pace that will meet the full agenda of the class no concern is given for students who ca n't keep the pace also the role was to challenge the students test then and answer any question they may have this includes debates over any topic related to the class material   gt i think the vast majority of work related skills that people develop are learned on the job   absolutely true or let 's put it this way the best school was is and will be a master and an apprentice which is somewhat still done in germany and is the only way medical students learn because no choice the life of others is in their hands    by the way masters have zero patience for who do n't show a promise masters also have little talent in teaching but masters have long term 1000 patience to show again and again correct again and again demand explain and challenge their   to the point the masters actually do n't do much work and instead just teach in their own special way

i am admittedly not giving a scientific or mathematical analysis here just giving my anecdotal take on what i 've lived through i do n't know if my assessment of tripled is even accurate just that there 's a palpable sense of things being a lot more expensive amp it just seems to me that the cost of living has gone up quite a bit for average people from what it once was especially considering most of us now have cable bills internet costs and in my case several different cell phone bills for different members of the family i realize these are not necessities but they are important things that most people are now expected to have i did n't mean to imply that we 've had insane inflation amp i understand that these things are mathematically measured as both core inflation and cpi and by these measures things have held pretty steady it just seems to me that these sorts of indexes have not yet taken a lot of things into account regarding the realities of modern day living and their resultant expenses

to me this sounds like a transaction where e already owns a company worth 400k and can therefore pocket the money from d and give d 25 of the profits every year there is nothing objective like a piece of paper that states the company is worth 400k. it is all about perceived value some investors may think it is worth something because of some knowledge they may have heck the company could be worth nothing but the investor could have some sentimental value associated to it so is it actually the case that e 's company is worth 400k only after the transaction it is worth what someone pays for it when they pay for it i the 400 k valuation is subjective in return the investor is getting 25 ownership of the product or company the idea is that when someone has ownership they have a vested interest in it being successful in that case the investor will do whatever he she can to improve the chances of success in addition to supplying the 100 k capital for instance the investor will leverage their network or perhaps put more money into it in the future is the 100k added to the balance sheet as cash perhaps it is an asset that may later be used to fund inventory for instance and would the other 300k be listed as an ip asset no see what i said about the valuation just being perception note that the above analysis does n't apply to all dragons den deals it only applies to situations where capital is exchanged for ownership in the form of equity

i have a car loan paid in full and even paid off early and 2 personal loans paid in full from my credit union that do n't seem to reflect in a positive way and all 3 were in good standing but you also   my credit card utilization is 95 i have a total of 4 store credit cards a car loan 2 personal loans so assuming no overlap you 've paid off three of your ten loans 30   and you still have 95 utilization    what would you do if you were laid off for six months   regardless of payment history you would most likely stop making payments on your loans   this is why your credit score is bad   you are in fact a credit risk   not due to payment history   if your payment history was bad you 'd likely rank worse   but simple fiscal reality is that you are an adverse event away from serious fiscal problems    for that matter the very point that you are considering bankruptcy says that they are right to give you a poor score   bankruptcy has adverse effects on you but for your creditors it means that many of them will never get paid or get paid less than what they loaned    the hard advice that we can give is to reduce your expenses   stop going to restaurants   prepare breakfast and from scratch and bag your lunch   do n't put new expenses on your credit cards unless you can pay them this month   cut up your store cards and do n't shop for anything but necessities   whatever furniture appliances clothes shoes etc you have now should be enough for the next year or so    cut your expenses   have premium channels on your cable or the extra fast internet   drop back to the minimum instead   turn the heat down and the a c temperature up so it cools less   turn off the lights if you are n't using them   if you move move to a cheaper apartment   nothing to do   get a second job   that will not only keep you from being bored it will help with your financial issues    bankruptcy will not itself fix the problems you describe   you are living beyond your means   bankruptcy might make you stop living beyond your means   but it wo n't fix the problem that you make less money than you want to spend   only you can do that   better to stop the spending now rather than waiting until bankruptcy makes your credit even worse and forces you to cut spending    if you have extra money at the end of the month pick the worst loan and pay as much of it as you can   by worst i mean the one with the worst terms going forward   highest interest rate etc   if two loans have the same rate pay the smaller one first   once you pay off that loan it will increase the amount of money you have left to pay off your other loans   this is called the debt snowball snowball effect    after you finish paying off your debt save up six months worth of expenses or income   these will be your emergency savings    once you have your emergency fund write out a budget and stick to it   you can buy anything you want so long as it fits in your budget   avoid borrowing unless absolutely necessary   instead save your money for bigger purchases   with savings you not only avoid paying interest you may actually get paid interest   even if it 's a low rate paid to you is better than paying someone else    one of the largest effects of bankruptcy is that it forces you to act like this   they offer you even less credit at worse terms   you wo n't be able to shop on credit anymore   no new car loan   no mortgage   no nice clothes on credit   so why declare bankruptcy   take charge of your spending now rather than waiting until you ca n't do anything else

the real answer is to talk to the bank in the case of the last car loan i got the answer is no when i asked them about rates they gave me a printed sheet that listed the loan rates they offered based on how old the car was period i forget the exact numbers but it was like new car 4 1 year old 4.5 2 3 years old 5 etc   i suspect that at most banks these days it 's not up to the loan officer to come up with what he considers reasonable terms for a loan based on whatever factors you may bring up and he agrees are relevant the bank is going to have a set policy under these conditions this is the rate and that 's what you get so if the bank includes the size of the down payment in their calculations then yes it will be relevant if they do n't than it wo n't the thing to do would be to ask your bank if you 're only borrowing $ 2000 and you 've managed to save up $ 11,000 i 'd guess you can pay off the $ 2,000 pretty quickly so as keshlam says the interest rate probably is n't all that important if you can pay it off in a year then the difference between 5 and 1 is only $ 80 if you 're buying a $ 13,000 car i ca n't imagine you 're going to over $ 80 btw i 've bought two cars in the last few years with about half the cost in cash and putting the rest on my credit card one for me and one for my daughter then i paid off the credit card in a couple of months sure the interest rate on a credit card is much higher than a car loan but as it was only for a few months it made very little real difference and it took zero effort to arrange the loan and gave me total flexibility in the repayment schedule credit card companies often offer convenience checks where you pay like 3 or so transaction fee and then 0 interest for a year or more so it would just cost the 3 up front fee

my feeling is that you 're basically agreeing to throw away a bucket of money for a lesson that does n't have to cost a penny like another commenter said you 're putting the cart before the horse   i once asked a similar question to a seasoned investor though i was n't in the position to toss my hard earned cash into the well yet he told me that the difference between the winners and losers is that the winners do n't need the money i 'm not trying to say that there 's a rich keep getting richer component here while like me get nada   the real nugget of wisdom he offered was that if anyone wants to do well as investors we must invest in a way that we 're not dependent on the money we have in the market instead manage risk carefully so that you do n’t get swept up in the emotional highs and lows   for you what i applaud is that you 're willing to do your research first and part of that should be anticipating how you will handle the anxiety when you put your money in at the wrong time or get out a little later than you should   what i understand now is that you do n’t need to be wealthy to not need the money you just need to invest smartly and leave your emotions out of it

as mentioned in several other answers the main reason for high rates is to maximize profit however here is another smaller effect the typical flow of getting money from an atm suppose you have a minute to consider the offer then in that time the currency may drop or rise which you can see from an external source of information therefore this opens a window for abuse for real major currencies these huge switches are rare but they do happen and when 1 or 2 minor currencies are involved these switches are more common just looking at a random pair for today to i immediately spotted a moment where the exchange rate jumped by more than 2 this may not be the best example but it shows why a large margin is desirable note that this argument only holds for when the customer knows in advance what the exchange rate would be for cases where it is calculated afterwards i have not found any valid excuse for such large margins except that it allows them to offer other services at a lower price because these transaction

there are some who argue that you should lease an electric car these factors are in addition to all the normal pros and cons of leasing vs. buying the technology is still new and is advancing rapidly in 2 3 years the newer model may have significantly improved features range and efficiency as well as lower prices if you are the type of person to upgrade regularly to the latest and greatest leasing can make it a smoother transition it is hard to predict the depreciation of the vehicles this is both because of the above factors but also because these kinds of cars are newer and so the statistical models used to predict their future values are less refined the models for predicting gas car prices have been for decades ev manufacturers have in the past made some mistakes in their residual value estimations when you lease a car you get essentially an option to buy the car at the future predicted residual value if at the end of the lease the market value of the car is higher than the residual value you can purchase the car at the predetermined price making yourself some extra money if the value is lower than the residual you can return the car or renegotiate i know a relatively large number of electric vehicle owners most or all of the ones who got the vehicle new leased it the rest bought used vehicles coming off lease which can also be a good deal

based on the information you gave there are dozens if not hundreds of possible theories one could spin about the rental market sure it 's possible that there are no listings because rental units on this street are quickly snapped up on the other hand it 's also possible that there are no listings because almost all the buildings on the street have been abandoned and aside from this one property that someone is tying to sell you the rest of the street is only by wild dogs and/or drug dealers or maybe the street is mostly owner occupied i.e. the properties are not being rented to anyone or maybe it 's a commercial district or maybe craigslist is n't popular with people who own property on this street for whatever reason maybe syracuse has a city ordinance that says property must be advertised in the newspaper and not on websites for all i know or maybe you missed it because nobody in syracuse calls it housing for rent they all call it apartments for rent or houses for rent or some local phrase or or or before i bought a property i 'd do more research than one search on one web site have you visited the property i do n't know how much you 're preparing to invest i have no idea what property prices are in syracuse but i 'd guess it 's at least tens of thousands of dollars surely worth making the drive to syracuse to check it out before buying

note i am making a usa assumption here keep in mind this answer does n't necessarily apply to all countries or even states in the usa   you asked two questions i 'm looking to buy a property i do not want to take a risk on this    property its sole purpose is to provide me with a place to live how    would i go about hedging against increasing interest rates to counter    the increasing mortgage costs to counter increasing interest rates obtaining a fixed interest rate on a mortgage is the answer if that 's available   as far as costs for a mortgage that depends as mortgages are tied to the value of the property home   if you want a place to live a piece of property and want to hedge against possible rising interest rates a fixed mortgage would work for these goals ideally i 'd like to not lose money on my property seeing as i will be    borrowing 95 of the property 's value so i 'd like to hedge against    interest rates and falling property prices in order to have a risk    neutral position on my property now we have a different issue   for instance if someone had opened a fixed mortgage on a home for $ 500,000 and the housing value plummeted 50 or more the person may still have a fixed interest rate protecting the person from higher rates but that does n't protect the property value   in addition to that if the person needed to move for a job that person would face a difficult choice move and sell at a loss or move and rent and face some complications renting is generally a good idea for people who 1 have not determined if they 'll be in an area for more than 5 10 years 2 want the flexibility to move if their living costs rises which may be an issue if they lose wages 3 do n't want to pay property taxes varies by state homeowner 's insurance or maintenance costs 4 enjoy regular negotiation something which renters can do before re signing a lease or looking for a new place to live   again other conditions can apply to people who favor renting such as someone might enjoy living in one room out of a house rather than a full apartment or a person who likes a change of scenes and moves from one apartment to another for a fresh perspective but these are smaller exceptions but with renting you have nothing to re sell and no financial asset so far as a property is concerned thus why some real estate agents refer to it as throwing away money which is n't necessarily true but one should be aware that the money they invest in renting does n't go into an asset that can be re sold

the number one reason to borrow is quite simple when you have no other choice the primary reason to do this is when renovations or additions must be made in a timeframe that precludes you being able to save enough money to pay cash 's example of a kid on the way with no space to put him is a very good hypothetical disaster recovery is another insurance does n't cover everything and can sometimes be slow to pay out and even if the payoff will rebuild the house exactly the way it was these situations are good opportunities to improve on what you had since you already have to call in the contractors to demo and rebuild the cost to do that is sunk and the incremental cost of improvements or even additional square footage is relatively minor other acceptable reasons to borrow are when cost of capital is very cheap a typical amortized heloc is pretty expensive when paid on schedule but if you can pay it off very early i.e. when you sell the home next month or you get a good deal on the interest rate a subsidized disaster recovery loan perhaps you have to be careful with these as they 're not intended to turn a burnt down into a mcmansion the cost of borrowing can be acceptable even if you had cash savings for the project you have other uses for the cash that can offset cost of borrowing this generally requires the first point to be true as well as it 's a general rule that borrowing $ 10,000 costs you more than you would gain by investing $ 10,000 but there are situations in which the reverse can be true if you have $ 10k in oil or major tech stocks right now it would probably be a bad move to liquidate them for home improvements if you can get a heloc at less than 6 you can realize a net gain in home value from the reno these situations are rare in cases of an already livable home flippers which make their living on renovating homes for a profit generally choose homes with obvious but easy to fix problems that depress home value because they look worse than they are if you bought your home without any such problems you probably paid something close to market value at the time and so you 're probably behind the curve however if you or your family in the case of an estate transfer have owned the home for a long time long enough for things to fall way out of date then you can catch up a lot of market value with one renovation where if the home had had two or three renovations along the way a reno now would n't gain you as much value

in some cases perhaps but in others not   several homes near me were sold over and over again during the bubble years at incrementally higher and higher sale prices the last owners in nearly all cases defaulted and the banks after dragging their feet for a couple of years finally foreclosed and sold the homes off cheap   in all but one of the distressed sale cases the people buying the houses now are in fact moving into them as their primary home the exception being a current resident who bought the adjacent home with the intentions of fixing it up amp renting it out i believe at least initially to a family member but in all cases in no small part due to the fact that they were able to purchase the properties cheap these new owners are investing substantial money into fixing them up new roof amp gutters new windows amp doors paint and/or siding often all new some landscaping etc   also from the perspective of our homeowners association all of these new people think our annual hoa fees are a bargain whereas the previous bubble era homeowners if having invested almost nothing they could truly be called that did nothing but whine and complain well and once they began defaulting on their mortgages they also defaulted on their hoa fees   so it 's a win win for our neighborhood we 're getting good solid residents who are planning on taking care of their properties the exact opposite of what you are claiming    the house flippers you decry were the ones buying with no money down during the bubble era and they nearly killed the neighborhood

i 'll answer but avoiding discussion of m1 m2 etc too pedantic i do n't believe you are asking about the lifetime of either coins or paper money i think you are referencing the fractional reserve system and how a good portion of the total money supply is created by the banks lending out their deposits in effect creating money my answer to you is that if all loans were simply paid off no mortgages no car loans etc the total money in the system would collapse to some reasonable fraction of what it is today 10 or a bit less this comes from the fact that the reserve requirement for most large banks is 10   i 'm referencing money but not bills or coins think about what you make in a year how much do you touch as paper money for my wife and me it 's no more than a few percent most goes from a direct deposit to online payments so this would be the subject of a different question altogether   let me know if this addresses your question

this is a complicated question that relies on the us india tax treaty to determine whether the income is taxable to the us or to india   the relevant provision is likely article 15 on personal services it seems plausible that your business is personal services but that 's a fact driven question based on your business model   if the online training is personal services provided by you from india then it is likely foreign source income under the treaty   the fixed base and 90 days provisions in article 15 would not apply to an india resident working solely outside the us the question is whether your us llc was a us taxpayer   if the llc was a taxpayer then it has an obligation to pay us tax on any worldwide income and it also arguably you from article 15 which applies to individuals and firms of individuals but not companies   if you were the sole owner of the us llc and you did not make a form election to be treated as subject to entity taxation then the llc was a disregarded entity   if you had other owners and did not make an election then you are a partnership and i suspect but can not conclude that the treaty analysis is still valid so this is fact dependent but you may be exempt from us tax under the tax treaty   however you may have still had an obligation to file forms 1099 for your worker   you can also late file forms 1099 reporting the compensation paid to your worker   note that this may have tax consequences on the worker if the worker failed to report the income in those years

this is n't negotiations anymore they are trying to change the deal after the fact stop negotiating and tell them they are bound to the agreement they signed they are leaning on you because they know you are small and likely ca n't fight them document every conversation do not allow them to keep pushing after they 've signed the agreement   they accepted your bid after giving your pricing to a competitor which is shitty and should have been your first red flag then they started working on you at that point your answer should have been we have a verbal agreement of x services for y price a different scope of work is not scalable and would require a new quote   at this point you can either accept that they will continue to beat you up or you can jam the contract down their throats until they agree or walk away    i 've been in a situation like this before a major multinational asked for bid pricing that was agreed to be estimated only based on very loose requirements then they handed us a contract with that pricing included as not to exceed   we ended up walking away it sounds like you may want to do the same if you can big companies often will have legal and departments that basically exist to fight any obligation to pay out money in our case shortly after we ran into someone in our industry who 'd worked with that company and they said to assume that company would reject 30 of all invoices we sent if nothing else to delay payment just a bit longer so they could keep earning interest on the money   also in the future i would n't turn away work until you are under a signed contract for a big project like this you ca n't rely on such a contract to come through if they drag feet and your schedule is full that 's on them or you bring in additional help or subcontract the work to deliver

i suppose it depends on how liquid you need and if you 're willing to put forth any risk whatsoever   the stock market can be dangerous but there are strategies out there that will allow you to insure yourself against significant loss while likely earning you a decent return   you can buy and sell options along with stocks so that if the stock drops your loss is limited and if it goes up or even stays where it 's at you make money a lot more than 1 annually of course there 's risk of loss but if you plan ahead you can cap that risk wherever you want maybe 5 maybe 10 whatever suits your needs   and as far as liquidity goes it should be no more than a week or so to close your positions and get your money if you really need it but even so i would only recommend this after putting aside at least a few thousand in a cash account for emergencies

no money is gone   the movement of the existing currency has slowed down   currency moves through the economy through deposits or loans to banks and withdrawal from banks as proceeds from loans or return of deposits   when a bank makes a loan they provide a balance in a bank account which is n't converted to hard currency until withdrawn   so those bank loans essentially count as currency and thus effectively multiply the stock of currency available   deposits into money market funds and those funds loans into the commercial paper markets have the same effect   banks and money funds are now making fewer loans   in particular they are not funding companies that invested in securitizations of home mortgages and credit card receivables but they are also lending less to businesses and consumers   because they are lending less they are effectively multiplying the currency less    think of deposited and lent currency as spare cycles on a desktop computer   you let your computer help decipher the genome when you are n't using it yourself   if you somehow feared that you would lose those cycles slowing down your own computing you would be less likely to lend those cycles out   there would still be the same number of computing cycles in the world but the stock of those available for actual computing would appear to be diminished   the technical term for this concept is monetary velocity and it is a crucial factor in the level of overall economic activity banking stability and inflation

let 's do a real example of leverage on the spy imagine you have $ 20 k today and plan on having $ 100 k by jan 2018   you could get 100 shares of spy and ride it out   maybe buying another 100 shares every few months until 2018 ending up with less than 500 shares to your name and zero cash in the bank or you could lever with dec 2017 leap calls they 'll expire in 2.5 years so you 'd have to re up sooner than your plan    with 20 k starting cash in my example we 'll go with 5 contracts to start with   if we choose the $ 230 strike they 'd cost $ 1250 each putting roughly $ at risk    the plan in is if the stock market goes up you 've got leverage   you are the proud owner of contracts worth 500 shares of spy and have only spent 1/3rd of your present day dollars   if the market goes down in the next two years sure you lost the entire $ but likely saved $ powder dry and can try your luck with the 2021 leaps    probably get down votes for this but i 'll even argue that proper use of leverage can very much reduce your risk    one truth is you 'll never get a margin call from holding long options

i do n't think there 's any federal law prohibiting them from allowing you to autopay more than your minimum   certainly there are federal laws telling them what to do with payments more than the minimum they must apply the leftover to the principal by default so the law does n't assume you ca n't overpay however federal law does require them to advance your next payment date if you overpay by a multiple of your minimum payment i.e. if your payment is $ 50 and you send them $ 100 you do n't have to make your next payment though interest still accrues of course   it 's possible navient is n't interested in implementing this functionality in their autopay who knows in any event assuming you have a bank that has functionality you may want to consider using that either for the extra or for the whole amount if navient is n't giving you a discount for autopay if so use that at least   your bank is happy to cut a check in any amount and send it on and navient is required to apply it to the principal   though if you do the autopay and billpay and are sending an extra amount less than a whole payment verify that they 're willing to accept amounts less than a full payment first not all lenders are

sorry i 'm a software engineer not an academic   my assumption is that you can measure things like average on a checkout line or number of widgets assembled on an assembly line and possibly the defect rate of those widgets or pounds of fries dumped in the trash because they got cold before being served relative to fries served is this not the case   in my field we measure things like the change in average time to launch or the revenue impact of features or the change in performance metrics etc they 're all proxy measurements though poor performers are generally much easier to spot than high performers mediocre performers can generally get through things but may not earn promotions etc

from my experience working in the family business the first step is to make sure you have the authority one of the problems i encountered was that we were given managerial positions were we not empowered to do anything which created many problems which comes to my second point make sure you have clear roles and responsibilities you have to know what you should be doing if you do n't find out asap what you and your other managers are supposed to do and lastly make sure there is accountability and every family member and employees must be treated equally so that if your employees   or you yourself do n't do something you are supposed to do you can be held accountable for your actions you wo n't believe how easy family members get special treatment how family members miss deadlines and nobody cares and how family members are managers when really they are just daddy 's spoiled being there to be peons not to think and facebook more than usual i recommend you read all literature you can get your hands on on dealing with family enterprises and how to deal with common issues good luck i for one am desperately searching for jobs outside the family business because i ca n't take it anymore

also in the next sentence what is buyers commission is it referring to the share holder or potential share holder and why does the buyer get commission   the buyer does n't get a commission   the buyer pays a commission   so normally a buyer would say i want to buy a hundred shares at $ 20   the broker would then charge the buyer a commission   assuming 4 the commission would be   so the total cost to the buyer is $ and the seller receives $ 2000   the buyer paid a commission of $ 80 as the buyer 's commission    in the case of an ipo the seller often pays the commission   so the buyer might pay $ 2000 for a hundred shares which have a 7 commission   the brokering agent or agents may share pockets a commission of $ 140   total paid to the seller is $ 1860    some might argue that the buyer pays either way as the seller receives money in the transaction   that 's a reasonable outlook   a better way to say this might be that typical trades bill the buyer directly for commission while ipo purchases bill the seller   in the typical trade the buyer negotiates the commission with the broker   in an ipo the seller does with the underwriter    another issue with an ipo is that there are more parties getting commission than just one   as a general rule you still call your broker to purchase the stock   the broker still expects a commission   but the ipo underwriter also expects a commission   so the 7 commission might be split between the ipo underwriter works for the selling company and the broker works for the buyer    the broker has more work to do than normal   they have to put in the buyer 's purchase request and manage the price negotiation   in most purchases you just say something like i want to offer $ 20 a share or i want to purchase at the market price   in an ipo they may increase the price asking for $ 25 a share   and they may do that multiple times   your broker has to come back to you each time and get a new authorization at the higher price   and you still might not get the number of shares that you requested    beyond all this you may still be better off buying an ipo than waiting until the next day   sure you pay more commission but you also may be buying at a lower price   if the ipo price is $ 20 but the price climbs to $ 30 you would have been better off paying the ipo price even with the higher commission   however if the ipo price is $ 20 and the price falls to $ 19.20 you 'd be better off buying at $ 19.20 after the ipo   even though in that case you 'd pay the 4 commission on top of the $ 19.20 so about $    i think that the overall point of the passage is that the ipo underwriter makes the most money by convincing you to pay as high an ipo price as possible   and once they do that they 're out of the picture   your broker will still be your broker later   so the ipo underwriter has a lot of incentive to encourage you to participate in the ipo instead of waiting until the next day   the broker does n't care much either way   they want you to buy and sell something   the ipo or something else   they do n't care much as to what    the underwriter may the stock as that maximizes their return   if they can convince enough people to overpay they do n't care that the stock falls the day after that   all their marketing effort is to try to achieve that result   they want you to believe that your $ 20 purchase will go up to $ 30 the next day   but it might not    these numbers may not be accurate   obviously the $ 20 stock price is made up   but the 4 and 7 numbers may also be inaccurate   modern online brokers are very competitive and may charge a flat fee rather than a percentage   the book may be giving you older numbers that were correct in 1983 or whatever year   the buyer 's commission could also be lower than 4 as the seller also may be charged a commission   if each pays 2 that 's about 4 total but split between a buyer 's commission and a seller 's commission

auto insurance is a highly personalized item so depending on your driving record and other factors $ 600 a month for full coverage may be as good as you can get look at the premium for each category and consider raising the deductible if you have some savings that could be used in the event that you have a claim also you 're not only buying insurance to cover the other person 's damage and medical expenses you 're paying for insurance for your car   brand new cars are more expensive to replace and thus insure than used cars leasing is effectively renting a car for a long period of time while the payments are less when the lease expires you 're going to have to decide whether to give up the car or buying it usually at a price much higher than market value    i 'm glad you discovered that the insurance would break your budget before it 's too late   my suggestion would be to look for a 1 2 year old car that 's less expensive to buy and to insure

your first scenario involving shareholders in a private corp being limited by a contractual agreement is common in practice frequent clauses include methods of valuing the shares if someone wants to sell first right of refusal you have to attempt to sell to the other shareholders before you can sell to a 3rd party and many others these clauses are governed by contract law ie some clauses may be illegal in contract law and therefore could n't be applied here a universal shareholders agreement is just the same as the above but applied to more people you would never get an already public company to convert to a universal shareholders agreement because even 1 share voting no would block it due to corporate law limiting the power of a corporation from abusing minority shareholder value in practice these agreements universally exist at the start of incorporation or at least at the first moment shares become available an example is the canadian mega construction company which is employee owned when the original owner transferred the corporation to his employees there was a usa in place which still today governs how the corporation operates   in theory you could have a public company where most shares are already owned by the founders and 100 of remaining shares are owned by a specific group of individuals in which case you may be able to get a usa signed but it would n't really happen in practice   note that while is broadly owned by a large group of employees it is not a public company because any random schmuck ca n't simply buy a share on the toronto stock exchange i assume most exchanges would prevent corporations from being listed if they had ownership restrictions like this

interestingly enough strategic default seems to be more common than one might think in california and there is actually a lot of information available on it to include a calculator that breaks down the numbers for you although affiliated with a law office speaking from a purely financial standpoint walking away only makes sense if it puts you in a better financial position than you were before while you had the mortgage if you look at the downsides of walking away the issues with the credit rating are will known but you need to take into account any open lines of credit you currently have as well as any need you might have to open a line of credit in the future if you currently have credit cards will the rates go up after the hit on the housing side of things you mortgage payment is currently a known quantity that will not change for the duration of the mortgage unless you do something to change it however it is fairly rare for rents to not change between years and if you want an apartment or house similar to what you currently have you might find that the rent will fluctuate quite a bit between years and in the long run the rent might run higher than your current mortgage payment likewise in the shorter term if the landlord runs a credit check they might adjust what the rent is or deny you the apartment on the basis of the black mark on your history for reasons that other have mentioned another item to take into account is if you need to get a job in the future depending upon what you do for a living this might be a non issue however if you are in a position of trust walking away from a mortgage payment will reflect negatively upon your character unless you have a very good reason for it this can lead to a loss of employment opportunities next if you walk away from the mortgage you are walking away from the current value of the home and any future value that the home might have if you like where you are living and are n't planning on moving to another part of the country you are gambling that the market will not recover or that you would reach parity with what you owe by the time you need to sell the house if you do plan on staying where you are and the house is in good repair then in the long run you might be giving up quite a bit of money by walking away these are a lot of factors to take into account though so its really hard to say one way or another if a strategic default is a good idea in the long run you might come out ahead but knowing when that date is can be difficult to calculate likewise in the long run it might adversely affect you and you might come to regret the decision   if the payments themselves are a bit too high perhaps you can refinance or negotiate with the bank for a lower payment if you get a better rate but keep your monthly payments the same then you might reach parity with the mortgage much faster which would also be to your advantage

owing taxes to two or more levels of government is n't double taxation it 's a feature of the american union i 'm not for this bill in general mostly for the timing and the loss of the highest bracket but both the state and federal governments have to generate revenue and basing rates on pure incomes with a few loopholes as possible is the most progressive way to do it by owing taxes unadjusted for other taxes paid there 's more incentive for states to lower local taxes and to balance state programs with federal programs and for state reps to more fairly redistribute federal transfers instead of targeting states with usually artificially low local taxes and fewer state programs usually republican

trusts are a way of holding assets with a specific goal in mind at its simplest a trust can be used to avoid probate a sometimes lengthy process in which a will is made public along with the assets a trust allows for fast transfer and no public disclosure depending on the current estate tax laws the death tax a trust can help preserve an estate exemption e.g. say the law reverts back to a $ 1 m exemption note this is $ 1 m per deceased person not per beneficiary my wife and i happened to have assets of exactly $ 2 m and i die tomorrow now she has $ 2 m and when she passes the estate has that $ 2 m and estate taxes are based on this total $ 1 m fully taxed but if we set up trusts that first million can be put into trust on my death the interest and some principal going to the surviving spouse each year but staying out of the survivor 's estate second spouse dies little or no tax due   this is known as a bypass trust another example is a trust say hypothetically my sister in law ca n't save a nickel to save her life spends every dime and then some so the best thing my mother in law can do to provide for her is to leave her estate in trust with specific instructions on how to distribute some percent each year this is not a tax dodge of any kind it 's strictly to protect the daughter from her own irresponsibility   a medical needs trust is a variant of the above it can provide income to a disabled person without impacting their government benefits adversely   this scratches the surface illustrating how trusts can be used there are more variation on this but i believe it covers the basics with the interest in this topic i 'm adding another issue where the trust can be useful in my article on my death please take a breath i described how an inherited ira was destroyed by ignorance the beneficiary fearing the stock market withdrew it all and was nailed by taxes he was on social security and no other income so by taking small withdrawals each year would have had nearly no tax due and could have avoided market risk by selling within the ira and buying treasuries or cds   he did n't need a trust of course just education the deceased his sister might have used a trust to manage the ira and enforce limited withdrawals mixing iras and trust is complex but the choice between a $ 2000 expense to create a trust or the $ 40 k tax bill he got is pretty clear to me he took pride in having sold out as the market soon tanked but he could have avoided the tax loss as well he was confusing the account in this case an ira but it could have been a 401(k or other retirement account with the investments it contained one can and should keep the ira in tact and simply adjust the allocation according to one 's comfort level   note inheritance tax laws change frequently and my answer above was an attempt to be generic the current 2014 code allows $ m to be left by one decedent with no estate tax

i wonder if these two concepts are compatible or mutually exclusive   the minimum wage should provide a decent living standard above the poverty line we should have as close to zero unemployment as possible   if those two statements are not compatible with each other then i do n't see how prohibiting eligible members of the workforce from an opportunity is at all desirable   yes this would mean that some individuals would be earning less money than it would take to make a decent living but those individuals know who they are we do n't   which means that they have the ability to make choices concerning their lives that we should n't try to anticipate   if minimum wage is not a decent wage for what they need they need to adjust their situation to change that   minimum wage was never intended to be a livable wage only the lowest amount you could pay someone   i would argue that if someone has been stuck earning minimum wage for more than 2 years they 're doing something wrong   either they 're not trying to advance or they 're not looking for a better job

in case other people arrive at this page wondering whether they should enable automatic reinvestment of dividends and capital gains for taxable non retirement accounts which is what i was searching for when i first arrived on this page you might want to review and you automatically reinvest the general idea is that assuming you plan to regularly manually rebalance your portfolio to ensure that all of the pieces of the pie are the relative sizes that you want there are approaches you can use to minimize taxes and also fees although at vanguard i do n't think that 's a concern if you choose a cost basis and manual reinvestment then you can go to change your dividends and capital gains distribution elections at

the most important thing to do when moving is to change your address with the post office this will forward most mail for a year and even automatically send change of address notices to many businesses that send mail to you if you do this and the irs needs to send you something over the next year you 'll get it   the irs does have a procedure for changing your address and you would want to do this if you are expecting something from the irs and are unable to do a change of address with the post office for some reason but if you do forward your mail and you are n't expecting a refund check i do n't think it is necessary the irs will get your new address when you file your return next year

when the strike price $ 25 in this case is in the money even by $ 0.01 your shares will be sold the day after expiration if you take no action if you want to let your shares go allow assignment rather than close the short position and sell the long position it will be cheaper that way if you want to keep your shares you must buy back the option prior to 4pm est on expiration friday first ask yourself why you want to keep the shares is it to write another option is it to hold for a longer term strategy assuming this is a covered call writing account you should consider rolling the option this involves buying back the near term option and selling the later date option of a similar or higher strike make sure to check to see if there is an upcoming earnings report in the latter month because you may want to avoid writing a call in that situation i never write a call when there 's an upcoming er prior to expiration good luck alan

the only advantage of changing all your money now to the new currency is that you might get a better conversion rate now than later so you get more of the new currency and you may pay a lower percentage fee for changing a larger sum of money however regarding the better conversion rate you will not know this except with hindsight the disadvantage of changing all at once is that if you have changed too much and need to change back to your own currency or a third currency you will be charged fees and lose on the conversion rate twice if you know how long you are going to be in the new country say 12 months maybe start by converting an amount you think you will be spending in a month if you spend more then you can change a bit more the next month or if you spend less change less the next month if you find you are spending similar amounts for the next month or so then you can budget on the amount you may be spending for the remainder of your stay and then convert this amount over if you have a little left over at the end of your stay maybe reward yourself with something or buy a present for someone special back at home if you need a little more just convert this amount in the last month or so

we can not know if you owe them anything but at the least i would expect that they do n't just say you owe us but we found out that we were supposed to pay you $ x but we paid you $ y which is more and then we can go from there   there are things like we should have paid you $ per hour for the last year but we paid you $ 12.50 per hour where you can tell them that by paying you that rate you assumed it was correct one you would n't have worked for less so they effectively gave you a raise on the other hand if they say you worked here for 38 hours a week but we paid you for 40 hours a week and you did indeed work only 38 hours then most likely they are correct

as dilip has pointed out in the comment investing in commodities is to either delivery or buy lets say you entered into buying x quantities of soybeans in november contract is entered into may. in november if the price is higher than what you purchased for you can easily sell this and make money if in november the price is lower than your contract price you have an option to sell it at loss if you do n't want to sell it at loss you are supposed to take the physical shipment arrange for your own transport and store it in warehouse although there are companies that will allow you to lease their warehouse it very soon becomes more loss making proposition by doing this you can hold onto as long as you want or as long as the good survive and do n't rot it makes sense for a large wholesaler to enter into buy contracts as he would be like to get known prices for at least half the stock he needs similarly large farmers co operative societies need to enter into sell contracts so that they are against price fluctuations

the point of short selling as a separate instrument is that you can you do it when you ca n't sell the underlying asset usually because you do n't actually own any of it and in fact believe that it will go down shorting allows you to profit from a falling price another non speculative possibility is that you do n't have the underlying asset right now and thus ca n't sell it but will get it at a certain point in the future e.g. because it 's bonds that you 've used to guarantee a loan or grain that 's still growing on your fields

tl;dr   it does n't matter   at a point of sufficient credit score your income is far more important for loan approval than your credit score apparently this was a big mistake because it caused my score to drop to 744 not really except for the of opening a margin account   a credit score of 744 is sufficient for the best rates credit score algorithms are dynamic and advice that may have been good in years past may not be applicable today   pay your bills and do n't have unnecessary credit that will lead to your best credit score    for me despite not following conventional wisdom i am enjoying the highest credit score of my life   i have closed accounts that are just unnecessary and have done some other things that the experts say i should not do to keep a high credit score however all that does n't matter   i do not have a need for credit and will likely never have a need beyond my rebate card   i feel like this is also true for you   what difference does it make if you have an or a 744   probably none   at that point your income counts more toward loan eligibility

do you have the option of paying cash for the phone to answer your question though essentially you have to use credit responsibly that does n't mean go get a slew of loans and pay them off as said a credit card is a good start i basically buy everything with a card and then pay it off every month when the bill comes out i actually have two and i alternate but that 's getting it should be noted that simply getting a card wo n't help your score in fact it may go down initially as the inquiry and new account opening may have a negative effect the positive effect will happen as you develop good payment behavior over time   one big thing you can do in your case is always pay your mobile bill on time having a good payment history with them will go a long way to prove you are responsible

congratulations on your raise is my employer allowed to impose their own limit on my contributions    that 's different from the irs limit no is it something they can limit at will or are they required to allow    me to contribute up to the irs limit the employer can not limit you you can contribute up to the irs limit your mistake is in thinking that the irs limit is 17 k for everyone that is not so you 're affected by the hce rules highly compensated employees these rules define certain employees as hce if their salary is significantly higher than that of the rest of the employees and limit the ability of the hce 's to deposit money into 401k based on the deposits made by the rest of the employees basically it means that while the overall maximum is indeed 17 k your personal and other hce 's in your company is lowered down because those who are not hce 's in the company do n't deposit to 401k enough you can read more details and technical explanation about the hce rules in this article and in this blog post

i have a degree in econ but that hardly makes me an expert here is what i understand well enough to feel comfortable stating   as you increase corporate taxes you decrease incentive for people to invest in corporations corporations are really a means of removing risk beyond initial investment to individuals who want to invest if you were to set the corporate tax rate at 90 as they do in the link you would see more alternative investments locally and an incentive to invest where taxation is n't as high think of it this way i could buy stock in apple but the corporate tax rate is 99 then i would be better off buying a piece of property to rent or a piece of stock in a country that has a normal corporate tax rate an exorbitant corporate tax rate would encourage me to take on more personal risk and start my own sole proprietorship even if i would be less qualified to do so than those in the corporation    if you want an alternative school of economics to study austrian wiki has a lot to offer    in my opinion the nyt article makes quality points and is economically sound the article is trash

for example if the dow s&p 500 nasdaq are all down does that necessarily mean the canadian stock will get negatively impacted or is it primarily impacted by the canadian market the stock makes up a very small part of the canadian market so it affects the overall market but this does n't mean that the overall market affects this stock so then the answer is no the stock price will not necessarily follow either us or canadian market indexes   however there can be major events which can affect the markets including the stocks which make up the markets will probably be more sensitive to canadian events than us events

hsa accounts come with various rules intended to ensure that the pre tax money you have opted to put into your hsa account is indeed used for appropriate purposes most employers do n't handle these accounts in house but contract with a company or bank who offers to take care of the details and the necessary accounting the money is simply sent to the bank and it is the bank that is responsible for ensuring that the money is indeed used appropriately now if you say that you want wells fargo to pick another bank as an example to handle your hsa account the   employer will likely need to have a   contract with wells fargo too and wells fargo will charge you fees to handle   the account also   whether you will be any happier with wells fargo 's fees for a one off hsa account versus chase 's fees where a smaller bulk rate might be charged is something that you should find out before approaching your employer with a request to have wells fargo handle your hsa account

people often have the wrong idea about how taxes apply to their money   there 's not really any such thing as pre tax or post tax income only pre tax and post tax uses of your income   this is somewhat hidden by the fact that we pay income tax based on our income for the year but if you look a bit closer you 'll notice that come april 15th almost every dollar you get to subtract from your gross income is n't defined by where it comes from but rather where it went there are a few special cases there like qualified dividends that that 's an entirely different issue   perhaps the most clear example of this is a traditional ira that you self fund from your savings account on april 14th for the prior tax year you 're putting dollars you 've already taken home into a pre tax account after the end of the calendar tax year and yet it all works out exactly the same tax liability wise there 's certainly an opportunity cost there as if you had contributed those dollars via a weekly payroll deduction   so when you manually fund a roth ira it has no effect on your tax liability except insofar as you do n't get to deduct it from your taxable income which you would n't if you had left it in a savings account   in the year you earned that money you paid taxes on it when you take it out you wo n't

yes 6 is a waste of money because some other brokers such as ib offer margin rates below 2    also to borrow money for even less than any broker 's margin interest rate one can do an transaction    this involves simultaneously shorting a stock and buying the for the same stock    when the futures contract expires you take delivery of the underlying stock to automatically close out your short position   until then you 've effectively borrowed cash for the cost of borrowing the stock which is typically less than 0.5 interest for widely traded ones   you also pay for the slight difference in price between the stock and the future which is typically equivalent to another 0.5 interest or less   the total often comes to less than 1 interest the only risk with this transaction is that the stock could become hard to borrow at some point so then you would have to pay higher interest on it temporarily or maybe even have to close out your short early   but it is extremely rare for large high volume stocks to become hard to borrow   the borrowing cost of spy has spiked above 5 on only a handful of days in the last decade

as a resident of new york state you will in addition to the federal income tax handled by the irs be responsible for state and local income taxes for new york the state tax forms are also used to determine your new york city tax if hr was either not aware of the local tax requirement for new york or you filled out the new york state version of the w-4 incorrectly you may have had too little tax withheld for new york state the refund from the irs is not dependent on the refund owe status for state and local taxes it is possible that your state taxes are fine but that you owe taxes to the city that tax you owe to the city will reduce the refund from the state and may require you to pay money to new york of course if you do itemize what you pay to the state and city may result in deductions on your federal form if you owe back taxes to the state or local government this could result in the irs seizing a federal refund but that does n't happen right away

in futures once you have established your position you will earn or lose money depending on what the underlying does   theoretically if you had no stop you could lose far more than you invested   an option will slowly lose all its value if the stock does not rise assume it is out of the money when purchased   depending on the strike it could rise substantially and you 'd still lose all your money   but you ca n't lose more than you put in   so options have limited risk compared to futures at the expense of a decaying time value that you will effectively be paying while holding the option

the tax court ruling todd mentioned was that you can only do one roll over in a period i.e. if you have already done a roll over even if it is between different accounts you can not do it again between any of your ira accounts for 12 months so for the loan trick to work you must ensure that you have n't done a roll over within the last 12 months and you 're not going to do a roll over within the next 12 months note that the tax court took into the consideration that the irs pub 590 was explicitly saying that you can do multiple roll overs as long as different accounts are involved the court ruled that the irs instructions are not a legal authority i.e. the irs can write in the instructions whatever they want but if it contradicts the law as it did in this case the law always prevails this is only for indirect rollovers where you actually get the money and then re deposit it within 60 days trustee to trustee rollovers are not limited this limitation is codified in 26 u.s. code

there 's no objectively correct answer to this question given your circumstances ideally the would put in 60 of the downpayment and 60 of the monthly maintenance costs and mortgage you and your partner would evenly split the 40 then it is very obvious however my guess is that this is n't going to be the situation without knowing the numbers i suggest that upon sale of the house the exact value of each person 's downpayment is immediately returned without interest what 's left of the equity is returned to everyone as per the amount they paid in mortgage the monthly maintenance costs are excluded from this calculation entirely you are of course free to take any other approach all three of you deem to be fair in my example consider a home that costs $ 200,000 your puts in $ 40,000 for a downpayment you put in $ 10,000 and your puts in $ 10,000 the mortgage payments are $ 1500/month your puts in $ 500 a month you put in $ 250 a month and your partner puts in $ 750 a month you sell the place for $ 300,000 after paying off the entire mortgage your gets $ 40,000 + $ 80,000 you get $ 10,000 + $ 40,000 your partner gets $ 10,000 + $ 120,000 keep in mind though that you may have to sell the house for a loss in which case some or all of the downpayment may not even be returned in fact you may end up having to cover money over and above the downpayment and the payments you 've made any good lawyer will make you consider this additionally any good lawyer will make you spell out under what circumstances people can force sale of the home

the answer to your question is no your credit rating is the way creditors let each other know whether you are in a good position and have a strong tendency to repay your debts not whether you are an easy target for making money on interest and penalties associated with failing to repay debts in full   the fact that you make your payments on time will definitely not lower your credit rating while the banks are not making as much money on you as they would if you carried a balance they are also not spending a lot of money on you nor losing a lot of money on people like you failing to repay debts   the transactions charged to the retailers cover the costs of operating your card and then a little bit   that is enough to make you worth keeping as a customer   they are happy with your arrangement the formula for credit rating computation is proprietary but we know what the factors are overall   making payments on time consistently is a positive not a negative factor   however they do look at the number of cards and overall mix of cards and other types of debt   for example if you have a very large amount of credit capacity in your cards and no mortgage that could possibly be a negative   if you have opened some of those accounts recently it could be a negative   if you have a larger number credit cards than they think is good that could be a negative there are other things as well that could be bringing your score down   probably worth it to take a look if you want to get an idea of what factors are adding positively and negatively to your credit score i 'd encourage you to visit creditkarma.com or another source intended to help you understand and improve your credit rating

while this is a totally personal decision i still think it would be a good idea to have some life insurance simply because you have someone that is currently dependent on your income   yes you have about 22 years in retirement but if you consider taxes and market risk there 's still some uncertainty there    also while your wife may be willing and able to work now will she want to do that for years just to earn living expenses    i would look at the costs on 10-year term life insurance and see if it 's worth the extra peace of mind to you and your wife   if your wife is fine with using your retirement as life insurance then you can probably be ok without it so to answer the question it may be acceptable but it 's generally a very cheap way to get a lot of peace i would not worry too much about the opinions of your parents unless they are going to pay for the insurance it 's your decision

one advantage of paying down your primary residence is that you can refinance it later for 10 15 years when the balance is low refinancing a rental is much harder and interest rates are often higher for investors this also assumes that you can refinance for a lower rate in the nearest future the question is really which would you rather sell if you suddenly need the money i have rental properties and i 'd rather move myself than sell the investments because they are income generating unlike my own home so in your case i 'd pay off primary residence especially since the interest is already higher on it would be a harder decision if it was lower

price is decided by what shares are offered at what prices and who first   the buyer and seller are both trying to find the best offer for their definition of best within the constraints then have set on their bid or ask the seller will sell to the highest bid they can get that they consider acceptable the buyer will buy from the lowest offer they can get that they consider acceptable the price and whether a sale purchase happens at all depends on what other trades are still available and how long you 're willing to wait for one you 're happy with and may be different on one share than another at the same time if the purchase could n't be completed with the single best offer and had to buy from multiple offers this may have been easier to understand in the days of open outcry pit trading when you could see just how chaotic the process is but it all boils down to a high speed version of seeking the best deal in an old fashioned marketplace where no prices are fixed and every sale requires or at least offers the opportunity for negotiation fred sells it five cents cheaper then why are n't you buying from him he 's out of stock well when i do n't have any my price is ten cents cheaper maybe i wo n't buy today or i 'll buy elsewhere maybe i wo n't sell today or maybe someone else will pay my price sam looks interested ok ok i can offer two cents more three sam looks really interested two and a half and throw in an apple for susie done and the next buyer or seller starts the whole process over again open outcry really is just a way of trying to shop around very very very fast and electronic reconciliation speeds it up even more but it 's conceptually the same process either seller gets what they 're asking or they adjust and/or the buyer adjusts until they meet or everyone agrees that there 's no agreement and goes home

this falls under value investing and value investing has only recently picked up study by academia say at the turn of the therefore there is n't much rigorous on value investing in academia but it has started however we can describe valuations in short valuations are randomly distributed in a log variance gamma fashion with some reason nonsense mixed in you can check for yourself on   you can basically download the entire us market and then some with many financial and technical characteristics all in one spreadsheet re fisher he was tied for the best monetary economist of the 20th century and created the best price index but as for stocks he said this famous quote 12 days before the 1929 crash stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau i do not feel there will be soon if ever a 50 or 60 point break from present levels such as bears have predicted i expect to see the stock market a good deal higher within a few months    irving fisher ph.d. in economics oct. 17 1929 edit value investing has almost always been ignored by academia   irving fisher and other proponents of it before it was codified by graham in the mid 20th century certainly did n't help with comments like the above   it was almost always believed that it was a sucker 's game the bigger sucker game to be more precise because value investors get destroyed during recession collapses   so even though a economy would allow value investors and everyone never to suffer collapses value investors are looked down upon by academia because of the inevitable yet nearly always collapse   this expresses that sentiment perfectly it did n't help that benjamin graham did n't care about money so never reached the heights of buffett who frequently with bill gates as the richest person on the planet   buffett has given much credibility and academia finally caught on around in 2000 or so after he was proven right about a pending tech collapse that nearly no one believed would happen at least that 's where i begin seeing papers being published into value concepts   if one looks harder academia 's even taken the torch and discovered some very useful tools yes investment firms and fellow value investors kept up the information publishing but they are not academics the days of professors throwing darts at the stock listings and beating active managers despite most active managers losing to the market anyways really held back this side of academia until buffett entered the and embarrassed them all with his club 's performance in the article which is still relatively ignored   before that it was the obsession with beta the ratio of a security 's variance to its covariance to the market a now abandoned theory because it has been utterly discredited the of beta have embraced the p b not giving the satisfaction to buffet by the p e.    tiny technology firms receive ridiculous valuations because a long surviving tiny tech firm usually does n't stay small for long thus will grow at huge rates   this is why any solvent and many insolvent tech firms receive large valuations risk adjusted they should pay out huge on average   still most fall by the dead and those 100 p s valuations quickly crumble valuations are influenced by growth   one can see this expressed more easily with a growing perpetuity where p is price i is income r is the rate of return and g is the growth rate of i.   rearranging r looks like here one can see that a higher p relative to i will dull the expected rate of return while a higher g will boost it it 's fun for us value investor traders to say that the market is totally inefficient   that 's a stretch   it 's not perfectly inefficient but it 's efficient   valuations are clustered very tightly around the median but there are mistakes that even us little guys can exploit and teach the smart money a lesson or two if one were to look at a distribution of rs see that they 're even more tightly packed   so while it looks like p es are all over the place industry to industry rs are much more well clustered tech finance and frequently have higher growth rates so higher p es yet average rs   utilities and non have lower growth rates so lower p es yet average rs

a public company should have a link for investor relations which should help provide a trail of basis if this is a matter of company buyout takeover etc   this gets you close but if you do n't have an exact date it will just be close not exact   one clean way out of this assuming the goal is to get rid of the stock and move on is to donate the shares to charity you will take the present value as a deduction and be done you can use a charitable gift fund such as those offered by schwab or fidelity so if say the shares are worth $ 20 k and you typically donate $ 5 k per year the fund lets you do this transaction at once then send to the charities you wish over the next few years

i would advise against both at least in the way you are discussing it you seem to be talking about day trading speculating in either stock or currency markets this seems ill advised in each trade one of three things will happen you will end up ahead and the person you buy from sell to will end up behind you will lose and the counterparty will win or you both will lose due to trading fees that said if you must do one stick with stocks they have a reason to have positive returns overall while currency trade is net zero additionally as you said if it sounds like you can gain more with less money that means that there are many more losers than winners how do you know you will be a winner a lot of the reason for this idea that you can gain a lot with less is leverage make sure you understand it well on the other hand it may make sense to learn this lesson now while you have little to lose

in my opinion if you are doing long term investing this is a non issue   the difference of hours in being able to trade an etf during the day vs. only being able to trade a traditional mutual fund at day end is irrelevant if you are holding the investment for a long time if you are engaging in day trading market timing or other advanced controversial trading practices then i suppose it could make a difference for the way i invest index funds long term set it and forget it etfs have no advantage over traditional mutual funds

your question contains two different concepts fractional reserve banking and debt based money   when thinking of these two things i think it is important to analyze these items separately before trying to understand how the whole system works fractional reserve banking as others have pointed out fractional reserve banking is not a ponzi scheme   it can be fraudulent however   if a bank tells all its depositors that they can withdrawal their money at any time i.e. on demand and the bank then proceeds to loan out some portion of the depositors money then the bank has committed fraud since there is no way they could honor the depositors requests for their money if many of them came for their money at one time   this is true regardless of what type of money is deposited dollars gold etc   this is how most modern banks operate debt based money historically the fed would introduce new money by buying us treasuries   this means federal reserve notes are backed by us treasuries   i agree that this seems strange   does this mean if i take my frns to the fed i could redeem them for us treasuries   but us treasuries are promises to pay frns in the future   this makes my head hurt   reminds me of the definition for see here is an experiment   what if we wanted to recreate frns today and none existed   the us government would offer a note to pay 100 frns in one year and pay 5 interest on the note   the fed would print up its first 100 frns to buy the note from the us government   the us government would spend the frns   the first 100 frns have now entered into circulation   at the end of the note 's term the fed should have 105 frns since the government agreed to pay 5 interest on the note   but how is the us government going to pay the interest and principal on the note when only 100 frns exist   i think this is the central point to your question    i can come up with only two answers 1 the fed must purchase some assets that are not debt based 2 the us government must continue to issue debt that is purchased by newly printed frns in order to pay back older debt and interest   this is a ponzi scheme the record debt levels seem to indicate the ponzi scheme option was chosen

as others have pointed out it sounds like the problem is n't the accessibility of your money the problem is willpower so address that instead how   willpower is both a finite resource and a resource that can be increased like muscle strength   since willpower is finite break down the problem into as many pieces as possible then address only one of those pieces at a time be more sensible with my money is nebulous vague and large there 's no place to start   so break it apart first thing is the one example in your question you go out on payday with friends coworkers intending to only buy a couple of beers alcohol lowers willpower and end up blowing through far more so what about making a rule to not go out on payday   nice idea but that might still be too hard to do if you have a habit of going out with them on payday then this has become your community and you will feel the of not going out with them as well as the social pressure from them to do as you 've always done   so set up a different habit for that night one that both involves the obligation of going there instead and other people who will expect you to be there some examples would be a sport that happens to practice or compete on payday nights or some charity that happens to need you at that time   once you 've broken that habit and in the resulting of your wallet look for other similar leaks i 'm going to guess that all your money gets spent on going out to pubs as opposed say to buying bric a you do n't need if so then you need to face that you 've adopted a pub going culture and that your community has shrunk to just those kind of people it may seem like you have a lot of people in your life but if all it takes to lose connection to all of them is to stop going to pubs then you really do n't your human connections essential for an enjoyable life are too fragile too focused so if that 's the problem branch out diversify the communities you 're part of i 've already mentioned sport church is another good one i mean a living church the kind where the people are always doing stuff together and it 's fun to go to not the other kind where everyone sits in a pew for an hour a week and rushes the exits as soon as possible other possibilities are reaching out to neighbors or becoming politically involved   hmmm i started writing about willpower but i 'm ending up at community at your core do you feel like if you did n't spend this way that you would n't have any friends

from accounting perspective an unpaid bill for internet services according to the accruals concept is recorded as a liability under current liabilities section of the balance sheet also as an expense on the income statement   so to answer your question it is both a debt and an expense however this is only the case at the end of the period if you manage to pay it before the financial period ends this is simply an expense that is financed by cash or other liquid asset on the balance sheet such as prepayment for example for private persons you are generally given some time to pay the bill so it is technically a debt internet provider would list you as a debtor on their accounts but this is not something to worry about unless you are not considering to pay this bill in which case your account may be sold as part of a factoring and you will then have a debt affecting your credit rating

you can hold a wide variety of investments in your tfsa account including stocks such as but if the stocks are being purchased via a company stock purchase plan they are typically deposited in a regular margin account with a brokerage firm a few companies may issue physical stock certificates but that is very rare these days that account would not be a tfsa but you can perform what 's called an in kind transfer to move them into a tfsa that you open with either the same brokerage firm or a different one there will be a fee for the transfer check with the brokerage that currently holds the stock to find out how costly that will be assuming the stock gained in value while you held it outside the tfsa this transfer will result in capital gains tax that you 'll have to pay when you file your taxes for the year in which the transfer occurs the tax would be calculated by taking the value at time of transfer minus the purchase price or the market value at time of purchase if your plan allowed you to buy it at a discounted price the discounted amount will be automatically taxed by your employer 50 of the capital gain is added to your annual income when calculating taxes owed   normally when you sell a stock that has lost value you can actually get a capital loss deduction that is used to offset gains that you made in other stocks or redeemed against capital gains tax paid in previous years or carried forward to apply against gains in future years however if the stock decreased in value and you transfer it you are not eligible to claim a capital loss i 'm not sure why you said tfsa for a family member as you can not directly contribute to someone else 's tfsa account you can give them a gift of money or stocks which they can deposit in their tfsa account but that involves that extra step of gifting and the money stocks become their property to do with as they please now that i 've hopefully answered all your questions let me offer you some advice as someone who also participates in an employee stock purchase plan holding stock in the company that you work for is a bad idea the reason is simple if something terrible happens to the company their stock will plummet and at the same time they may be forced to lay off many employees so just at the time when you lose your job and might want to sell your stock suddenly the value of your stocks has gone way down so you really should sell your company shares at least once a year and then use that money to invest in your tfsa account you also do n't want to put all your eggs in one basket you should be spreading your investment among many companies or better yet buy index mutual funds or etfs which hold all the companies in a certain index there 's lots of good info about index investing available at canadian couch potato the types of investments recommended there are all possible to purchase inside a tfsa account to shelter the growth from being taxed edit here is an article from that talks about transferring stocks into a tfsa it also mentions the importance of having a diversified portfolio

money has to come from somewhere   it ca n't just appear   so if there is really an aunt at an agency and she is sending checks then she is writing checks from that company and stealing from that company   if that is the case then the person with whom you are in contact would be using you to launder money hide its illegal origin and when the aunt was caught you would be also if it is really being done between countries then it might be more difficult for them to find you but it is still illegal however it is also likely that your contact may be using a common scam as described by another answerer that of asking for money in return for a cashier 's check   although cashier 's checks were designed to be safer than regular checks in that they wo n't bounce if it is a fake cashier 's check it was never worth anything in the first place   when the bank tries to claim the cash from the other bank and finds it does n't exist or there is no record of that check then the effect is similar to that of a personal check bouncing the bank will want the money back if you have already given a portion of that money to your contact chances are when your find this out he will be long gone   i would not have anything further to do with this person good luck

credit cards have three important advantages none of them are for day to day borrowing of money safety credit cards have better fraud protection than checks or cash and better than most debit check cards if you buy something with a credit card you also get the issuer 's think visa assurances that your will get the product you paid for or your money back at almost any time if a product you buy is not what you expect you can work with the issuer even if the store says screw you security credit cards are almost universally accepted as a security against damages to the vendor hotels car rentals boat rentals etc will accept a credit card as a means of securing their interests without that you may have to make huge deposits or not be able to rent at all for example in my area you can not rent a car on debit or cash you must use a credit card around here most hotel rooms require a credit card as well this is different from area to area but credit cards are nearly universally accepted emergencies if you 're using your credit card properly then you have some extra padding when stuff goes wrong for example it may be cheaper to place a bill on a credit card for a couple months while you recover from a car accident than to deplete your bank account and have to pay fees bonus some cards have perks like miles points or cash back some can be very beneficial you need to be careful about the rules with these bonuses for example some cards only give you points if you carry a balance some only give miles if you shop at certain stores but if you have a good one these can be pretty fantastic a 3 cash back on purchases can make a large difference over time

theta is a variable in options pricing theta aka time decay decreases over time the reason of this is that you have to think of the option as insurance it is a hedge against actual holdings in an asset would you pay more or less for insurance that covers you for a year 's time would you pay more or less for insurance that covers you for a week the answer is that the market will pay less for insurance that covers them for a lower period of time this is one of several ways of thinking about it there is also the probability that the option will be profitable at all the further out in the future the more likely it will be profitable and people will pay a premium for it there are other variables in the black scholes formula and it is the most widely used options pricing formula but keep in mind the geniuses that made up the formula blew up their hedge fund thinking they could sell the options at an inflated premium from their own formula to everyone ironic really

's answer is quite good and for your own specific situation you might begin by being about what you are getting for investing a few thousand dollars   with the exception of paul graham 's y there are very few opportunities to invest at that type of level and y provides a lot of other assistance besides their modest initial investment    i can tell from your post that you think like an investor   it is highly unlikely that the entrepreneurial programmers that you will be backing will be wired that way    from the modest amount that you are investing you are unlikely to be the lead investor in this opportunity   if you are interested in proceeding simply stick along for the ride examining the terms and documents that more significant investors will be demanding   remain positive and supportive but simply wait to sign on the dotted line until others have done the heavy lifting for more insights into startups themselves see paul graham 's essays at   he 's the real deal and his recent essays will provide you with current insights about software startups good luck

you need to negotiate with your broker to allow you to do more exotic order types   one in particular i recommend is a hidden aka iceberg order   you enter two numbers   the first is the number of shares for your entire order the second is the amount that will be displayed in the book this is the tip of the iceberg the remaining shares are hidden below the surface the maker taker rule applies as follows the amount displayed will receive the rebate for providing liquidity   the amount hidden will be charged the fee for taking liquidity example you want to sell 10,000 shares total   you enter a hidden order for 10,000 shares with 1,000 displayed   on the level 2 screen traders will see 1,000 shares and those shares will stay displayed there until the entire order is filled   you receive a rebate for 1,000 shares you pay the brokerage fee for 9,000 shares also like one of the previous posters mentioned only trade high liquidity stocks   large market cap companies with high volume   this is why day traders love tesla amazon netflix etc large market cap high volume and high volatility   easy to catch $ 10 + moves in price hope this helps happy trading

one reason this happens is due to dividends if the dividend amount is greater than the time value left on a call it can make sense to exercise early to collect the dividend   deep in the money puts also may get exercised early there 's usually little premium on a deep in the money put and the spread on the bid ask might erase what little premium there is if you have stock worth $ 5,000 but own puts on them that will give you $ 50,000 upon exercise and no spread to worry about the interest you can gain on the $ 50k might be more than the little to no time value left on the position even at several weeks to expiration

you could have the buyer go to the bank with you so that he can get evidence that the loan will be paid in full and that the lien will be lifted the bank wo n't sign over the title and lift the lien until the loan is paid back in full has a pretty good section about this note not affiliated with the actual dmv selling to a private party though more effort will be required on your part selling a car with a    lien privately could net you a higher profit here are a few things    you 'll need to consider to make the process easier   include the    details of the lien in your listing you 'll list an advertisement for    your car just as you would any other vehicle with the addition of the    lien information that buyers will need so as to avoid confusion   sell    in the location of the lienholder if possible if the bank or    financial institution holding the lien is located in the area you 're    trying to sell this will make the transaction much easier once you    make an agreement with the buyer you can go directly to the lender to    pay off the existing lien ownership can then be transferred in person    from the financial institution to the buyer   consider an escrow    service if the financial institution is n't in your area an escrow    service can help to ensure a secure transaction an escrow service    will assume responsibility for receiving payments from the buyer and    will hold the title until the purchase is complete advantages of an    escrow service include payoff services which will do most of the    work with the financing institution for you title transfer services    which can help to ensure a safe and legitimate transaction and provide    the necessary paperwork once the sale is complete

no expert here but my guess is because of the shear scale and wide impacts this would cause   a ban is a pretty severe step so companies and individuals need to take steps to move in that direction gas stations gas truckers oil refineries auto shops dealerships manufacturers auto parts stores are among the many many affected   if they required that change to happen in three years it would be catastrophic we spent a century getting ourselves into this mess ca n't hastily jump out

you are wildly over estimating your taxes   first remember that your business expenses reduce your gross income   second remember that taxes are progressive so your flat 35 only applies if you 're already making a high salary that pushed you into the higher brackets of us and ca i think the deeper problems are 1 you are expecting a super early start up with no finished product to pay you the same as a steady job including health insurance and 2 you are expecting kickstarter to independently fund the venture the best source of funding is yourself   if you believe in this venture and in your game design abilities then pay for most of the costs out of your own savings   cut your expenses to the extent you can you may want to wander over to startups se to get more perspective and ideas on your business plan

the middle class needs support not eroding negative interest rates would work for starters in getting that corporate profit capital moving in society not this avoidance of responsibility from above by passing the buck to the people by the same token therefore voting more is not going to solve things quicker why say politics will not fix this and then declare vote someone in to change it fast after throwing a few figures and at us a convoluted nonsensical waste of time

perhaps this is lasting result of the recession   i realize that the article specifically states that lego notably grew and profited through the recession however other parts of society and other markets did n't now years later perhaps those other scenarios are affecting lego 's market   specifically i 'm drawing a parallel to my personal experience my kids were born just before the recession their grade is the largest grade in the school system every grade behind them the kids born during the recession is significantly smaller whatever the was people were having fewer kids during the recession    further although the general view is that the recession is over and the stock markets are back household spending and income continues to stagnate   with fewer kids and a reluctance to spend perhaps people in the us and europe just are n't buying as many premium toys

what folks here do n't get is it 's generally in the industries interest to not mislead as you may have noticed folks do n't like being mislead yes it happens but the large majority of companies consider it in their interests to label clearly   are you aware that general foods is strongly lobbying to mandate gmo labeling or that the pork industry is making a strong hopefully successful effort to change the rules about natural nitrites so that they 're labeled like any other i 'm guessing you 're not and instead are just making unfounded assumptions

the most common usage of interest rate swaps is by corporates who issue bonds   most us investors e.g. insurance companies amp pensions want fixed rate bonds so that they know what their interest income will be for the life of the investment   many financial issuers prefer to have their liabilities be floating rate so that they will benefit if the fed keep interest rates at zero for a long time   so the financial issuer issues the fixed rate bond the insurance company buys it and the issuer converts the obligation to floating with an interest rate swap

yeah this is an awfully petty article the writer wants to make a big deal about the safety and security of her methods and why that 's a bad thing but it is n't bought 500,000 copies of her single on itunes because she did n't promote it and it would have otherwise   do n't get me wrong there 's a certain flair and style to less mainstream marketing campaigns but if you 're trying to sell an album 's quality on how weird you sold the album you 're going to fail it 's not like everybody can be and release progressively shit just for the hell of it   why even criticize the current album release trends it 's one of the best parts of music if i 'm a fan of taylor swift then i do n't need to worry about following some bullshit or cracking a code or checking her facebook the day her no promotion album is released and being lucky enough to notice i want a few reminders every couple days so i can get excited i want a single to drop so i can get a feel for the general tone and theme of the album and see if i want to buy    being different for the sake of being different is no better than liking something just because everybody else does

disclaimer i 'm not a tax professional or an expert on s corps however i do have my own s corp and my decision process for taking a distribution has nothing directly to do with k-1 past or present or profit and loss   if i have extra cash in my s corp i take a distribution   assuming i do my taxes correctly the money will be taxed whether i take a distribution or leave it in the business so it really comes down to how much cash the business requires to continue operating and meeting its expenses

it totally depends on when your expenses hit and whether you might have a larger stock than necessary if you run your projections against the monthly save and the intervals of when you 'll need the money you might be able to extract some stock from the account   i recommend making this a bit simpler i operate this with an account which is a complete aggregate of expenses that i know i have several times per year or once every two years but are not monthly or part of a weekly non fixed expense budget cap instead of tracking each expense individually and saving for it create a spreadsheet that lists out all of these expenses sum them and then divide by 12 when i first opened this account i added a one time deposit to to make sure i would never need to pull money from another source for these expenses as new expenses come into existence that i should plan for annually i simply add them to this list and adjust the monthly auto deposit to the account this also adjusts my single number weekly budget   to make it easy whenever i see an expense on my list on my amex or debit i simply initiate a withdrawal from the savings and it will balance out my weekly or monthly budget expenses   the goal of my account is to simply avoid anti windfalls that are known quantities insurance annual eye exam flush amazon prime etc that would throw a wrench in weekly monthly budget and expense planning the more variables you can remove from your weekly monthly the more regular it becomes and the more likely you will be able to stick to a budget

what benefit do i get from buying a share the value of any financial asset is its ability to generate cash in the future and thus the value of a share is heavily influenced by the dividends it pays and the equity value   the equity value can be calculated different ways two common ways are to just take book value meaning assets liabilities or you can look at the projected free cash flows of the company discounted back to the present time voting rights do n't typically influence a share price except in hostile takeover scenarios meaning someone buys up a lot of shares to have more influence in company decisions

i believe mrchrister 's answer is correct   since they 're fdic insured they are legit   second on the seemingly too good to be true rate they 're basically making up the difference on other fees not necessarily paid by you in order to offer you the higher than market rate i 'd like to point out two things not mentioned about the current rate offer though the high apy advertised is only on balances up to $ 25,000 anything over that threshold is at a lower 1.01 apy the offer also states in the footnotes rates may change after the account is opened you might want to see if they have a good history of paying higher than average interest rates you would n't want to switch only to find out the promotional rate was a teaser that soon gets reduced

it 's not abnormal for a company that is as young as yours seems to be it seems based on what little i know that you have debts or accounts payable that were formerly covered by the $ 200 cash but now are n't because you paid it to yourself for now you 're entitled to pay yourself a draw or a salary but if you continue to do so without earning money to cover it your company will fail

this is more an /r personalfinance question but i 'll give my 2 cents no matter what the fund you invest in is going to be subject to risk so you could end up losing money it would definitely be a gamble    if you have other debt at higher apr than the loan it could be beneficial to pay that off using extra loan proceeds

and what 's the cost of living in silicon valley   how long are the work days how abundant the vacation time   most of the publicly held companies there apparently have solid sources of revenue but for all too many start up companies where 's the value proposition   as i 've learned from first hand experience a high salary is n't as great as it sounds in an expensive area to live and silicon valley is up there with new york washington dc and boston for the really expensive areas of america   like color are being given a second third or fourth shot at the game because it ’s a big game says bill color ’s chief executive officer the prizes are pretty darn huge there are fundamental changes happening in information because of facebook and mobile devices    how does this not sound like a speculative bubble to people
