the decision whether this test is or is not met seems to be highly dependent on the specific situation of the employer and the employee   i think that you wo n't find a lot of general references meeting your needs there is such a thing as a private ruling letter where individuals provide specific information about their situation and request the irs to rule in advance on how the situation falls with respect to the tax law   i do n't know a lot about that process or what you need to do to qualify to get a private ruling   i do know that versions of at least some of the rulings are published   you might look for such rulings that are close to your situation i did a quick search and found two that are somewhat related as regards your situation my non expert understanding is that you will not pass in this case unless either a the employer specifies that you must live on the west coast or you 'll be fired b the employer would refuse to provide space for you if you moved to boston or another company location or c you can show that you could not possibly do your job out of boston   for c that might mean for example you need to make visits to client locations in sf on short notice to meet business requirements   if you are only physically needed in sf occasionally and with reasonable notice i do n't think you could make it under c although if the employer does n't want to pay travel costs then you might still make it under a in this case

i 'm not a tax professional but as i understand it you are not expected to commute from san francisco to boston   if your employer has not provided you with an external office then yes you have very likely met the convenience of the employer test however to take the home office deduction there are many requirements that have to be met you can read more at the nolo article can you deduct your home office when you 're an employee thanks keshlam the home office deduction has many nuances and is enough of an irs red flag that you would be well advised to talk to an accountant about it   you need to be able to show that it is exclusively and necessarily used for your job another thing to remember as an employee the home office deduction if you take it will be deducted on schedule a line 21 unreimbursed employee expenses among other miscellaneous deductions   deductions in this section need to exceed 2 of your adjusted gross income before you can start to deduct   so it will not be worth it to pursue the deduction if your income is too high or your housing expenses are too low or your office is too small compared to the rest of your house or you do n't itemize deductions

i actually had a similar situation when i tried to buy my house i paid off all my loans and was proud of my debt free status i had no car note no student loans absolutely no debt but i did have a bank issued credit card usaa not chase but i assume the same may apply    when i tried to get a home loan they told me i had absolutely no information on my credit report aka i had no credit the mortgage lender had no idea what was going on nor did i or anybody else it took a lot of research before i realized that the credit bureaus use a formula for the credit rating that involves a lot of things but if you have n't had a current line of credit reported to the agency in over a year maybe it was longer i did n't have anything for 3 years you are n't going to have a credit score    because i was debt free i was also credit report free and eventually the credit bureaus had nothing to go on and my score disappeared the bank issued credit card was on my credit report but they did n't report monthly balances so the bureaus could n't use it to determine if i was paying off the card or if i even had a balance on it it was essentially not doing my credit any favors despite what i had thought in short based on the fact that you have no debt in her name and you have taken on all debt in your own name its very plausible that she has no credit rating anymore it wo n't take long to get it back once you have anything on your credit that 's actually reported the formula can kick back in and look at credit history as well as current credit and she 'll be fine

i 'll tackle number 2 it 's one which many academics dismissed as an impossibility after all how could that be rational what could cause negative yields ie effectively giving an entity cash and paying for the privilege of doing so is something we 've experiencing currently fear back in the financial crisis investors were actually paying to store their cash in treasuries because of the   fear that if they left it with a bank they might not get it back    what about the fdic insurance you may ask quite logically the problem is that we 're talking about massive entities like pension funds asset managers corporations who normally would store some think millions billions in cash and cash equivalents bank accounts money market funds short term paper they really are n't protected so they do what turns out to be the rational thing which is pay a premium on safe assets ie us gov't bills to guarantee you get most of your money back   the same thing is currently happening with german front end paper as europeans pull their money out of banks periphery assets and search for safety   hope that helped

gt;so i would like to ask you which at this project poor management skill of oracle staffs or plan of oregon are worse to be accused   i believe there is an increased burden on the employer oregon to effectively manage the scope of the work required for the project that the contractor oracle is working   otherwise the contractor has plausible for being able to provide deliver a quality working solution   gt;or do you think that plan was made mainly by oracle   i think the plan was mostly made by oracle with the requirements given by oregon and that 's where things seem messy   my gut tells me though that when an employer hires a contractor for the creation of a fully integrated enterprise system that the employer essentially signs their financial life away to the project in a way that the contractor of indirect or direct damages that come from the result of unforeseen implementation requirements or issues   oracle has been around long enough to know how to legally cover their asses   if there is anything that oregon may have traction on it would be a few of their fraud claims given that oracle has made two wiki with federal agencies of ~$100 amp ~$200 million since 2011 which were from allegations of fraud or false claims   such claims by oregon may be supported by the fact that they allegedly have a former oracle employee who can substantiate the poor quality of the product they were giving to oregon but that blame might go back to oregon 's specifications which i have no insight into   as someone who has witnessed a couple of employer and contractor relationships between public amp private entities my hope out of all of this is that   sales people for contractors think twice before over promising technology solutions that their company ca n't fully deliver on given resource constraints or lack of employer specifications   employers hiring such entities manage them expectations plus the overall project effectively while accepting personal accountability amp responsibility   i think the only people who have a clear picture of what was going on were anyone from either party who were on the front lines of managing the project developing the systems or running them

rebalance is across asset classes which are mutually independent like stocks and bonds they may be inversely correlated at times as when stocks go down bonds go up stock bond split is good for a young investor say in 30s some suggest as a good stock allocation percentage here rebalance is done when say the asset away more than say 3 to 5 again just a rule of thumb e.g. if due to a recent run up in stocks aa could become then you sell stocks to buy bonds to make the aa and since this method always sells the winner you automatically make gains selling high and buying low s&p 500 index gives decent diversification within stocks you want a total bond fund to take care of the bond side of your aa

from my experience it is much easier to start as a self employed rather than a limited company you almost have no paperwork and self assessment can be done online in as little as 20 minutes from personal experience   on the other hand having a limited company grants you a pile of papers to fill in from the start and almost certainly needing an accountant to do your taxes   regarding the income tax if you have no profits you will pay no tax and that will leave you only with national insurance that is only about £ 70 for 3 month better check with hmrc for the exact figure so if you do n't have a good enough reason to do a ltd start as a self employed you can always change to limited company later

probably not though there are a few things to be said for understanding what you are doing here   primerica acts as an independent financial services firm and thus has various partners that specialize in various financial instruments and thus there may exist other firms that primerica does n't use that could offer better products   now how much do you want to value your time as it could take more than a few months to go through every possible insurance firm and broker to see what rate you could get for the specific insurance you want   there is also the question of what constitutes best here   is it paying the minimal premiums before getting a payout   that would be my interpretation though this requires some amazing guesswork to know when to start paying a policy to pay out so quickly that the insurance company takes a major loss on the policy similarly there are thousands of mutual funds out there and it is incredibly difficult to determine which ones would be best for your situation   how much risk do you want to take   how often do you plan to add to it   what kind of accounts are you using for these investments e.g. iras or just regular taxable accounts   do tax implications of the investments matter thus i 'd likely want to suggest you consider this question how much trust do you have that this company will work well for you in handling the duty of managing your investments and insurance needs   if you trust them then buy what they suggest   if you do n't then buy somewhere else but be careful about what kind of price are you prepared to pay to find the mythical best as those usually only become clear in hindsight when it comes to trusting a company in case there are more than a few factors i 'd likely use questions how well do they answer your questions or concerns from your perspective   do you feel that these are being treated with respect or do you get the feeling they want to say what the heck are you thinking for asking that in a kind of perspective structure of meeting do you like to have an agenda and things all planned out or are you more of the we 'll figure it out kind of person   this is about how well do they know you and set things up to suit you well tone of talk do you feel valued in having these conversations and working through various exercises with the representative   this is kind of like 1 though it would include requests they have for you employee turnover how long has this person been with primerica   do they generally lose people frequently   are you ok with your file being passed around like a hot potato   not that it necessarily will but just consider the possibility here reputation can be a factor though i 'd not really use it much as some people can find those bad apples that are n't there anymore and so it is n't an issue now   in some ways you are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you   there are more than a few companies that want to get a piece of what you 'll invest buy and use when it comes to financial products so it may be a good idea to shop around a little

can they reject a hundred dollar bill as a payment of debt no a creditor can not refuse payment in cash whatever denomination you use however when you 're buying stuff you do n't owe anything to the business owner there 's no debt so the above rule does n't apply as long as there 's no debt in existence the matter of payment is decided between two parties based on the mutual agreement the demand not to use large bills is reasonable in places like or taxi cab that are frequently robbed or at a small retailer that does n't want to invest into forgery detection and fraud prevention so the answer to this question is it the case where this practice of accepting small bills and    rejecting large bills is perfectly legal is yes you can find the full explanation on including code references

please refer to this question to understand the basics of how an order is matched how do exchanges match limit orders   now most of the times even block orders follow the same matching criteria i think you are assuming that for every large buy order there is a matching large sell order this is not true      so on the buy side at various point in times there were buy orders with single order more than 10,000 shares on the sell side to fulfil these orders there may or may not be a single order of 10,000 more often there will be quite a few smaller orders or 500 1000 or whatever amount that are present in the queue based on the amount time sort order or even partially matching out of a sell order of 10,000 similarly when there is a large sell order of more than 10,000 these may not have got filled in by a large buy order but by smaller buy orders etc    so if you average out the amounts on the buy side and the sell side there would definately be a difference the analysis of this difference is as indicated in your question buy price is more than sell price and hence people are bullish

firstly if you 've formed a limited company you do n't need to register as self employed   you 're an employee and shareholder of the company and your taxes will be handled that way registering as self employed is only necessary if you 're operating as a sole trader i.e. without a company secondly you absolutely do want to get set up correctly with hmrc as soon as possible whether you 're a company or a sole trader   ignoring the legal question your worry about paying taxes when you have no income is if you 're not making any money there wo n't be any tax to pay   furthermore it seems likely that the business is currently losing money   those losses if correctly recorded can be carried forward and offset against future profits so not only do you not have to pay tax now but you can reduce the tax you pay later when the money does start rolling in

the idea behind this move is to avoid or mitigate long term deflationary pressure and to boost the competitiveness of swiss exporters this is primarily a swiss based initiative that does not appear likely to have a major impact on the broader eurozone however some pressure will be felt by other currencies as investors look to purchase ie this is not a great scenario for other countries wanting to keep their currencies weak in terms of personal wealth if you hold swiss f then you are impacted however 1.2 is still very strong most analysts cite 1.3 as more realistic so there seems little need for a reaction of any kind at the personal level at this time although diversity as ever is good it should also be noted that changing the peg is a possibility and that the 1.3 does seem to be the more realistic level if you hold large amounts of swiss f then this might cause you to look at your forex holdings for the man in the street probably not an issue

yes they need expansionary monetary policy to help them with their internal devaluation    however this involves leaving the euro so there are additional costs to the normal costs of inflation they are experiencing some of these costs right now as capital is fleeing the country and it will get worse if when they really leave it 's also worth keeping in mind that greece does n't have very good institutions it 's why they are in this mess in the first place so it 's hard to say that they 'll be able to leave the euro and devalue without also trying out policies that will lead to hyperinflation   internal devaluation is possible without expansionary monetary policy but it takes some time and the capital flight in anticipation of taxes neo drachmas means that meanwhile there is also little investment in the economy in the meantime

that something you are signing means you are liable for the mortgage payments yes all of them if he ca n't or wo n't pay at any point   the limit on what the bank will lend him based on his salary is there for a reason they do n't expect him to be able to keep up repayments if they lend him more or more precisely there 's a big risk that he wo n't do n't forget that even if he up and down to you that he can afford them interest rates can rise this is a 25 or 30 year commitment you would be making interest rates are at a historic low and the only way from here is up in my living memory rates have been 12 or even 15 as a very rough rule of thumb for every £ 100k borrowed every additional 1 on the interest rates costs an additional £ 100 on your monthly payment   also the transitional arrangement is not without its own fees and the bank wo n't let him simply take you off the mortgage unless they are convinced he can keep up the repayments on his own which they clearly are n't also thanks to for the additional good point that being on the hook for your friend 's mortgage will prevent you from being able to get a mortgage yourself while the liability still exists or at least severely limit your options no matter how many times you protest but i 'm not paying any money for that it wo n't help   another point there are various schemes available to help first time buyers by signing up for this you would exclude yourself from any of those schemes in the future

thanks for your additional comments sam that is helpful here is an overview of what you can and can not do with an fsa as it applies to your situation the government intends that a general health fsa be used to cover expenses that are usually out of pocket when you are covered by a qualifying health plan it is funded with pre tax dollars and is on a use it or lose it basis however an hsa is itself a form of health coverage that is tax advantaged and the balance can be invested because of this an hsa is not considered by the government to be a health plan that qualifies for use with a general health fsa however this means that a given covered person can not have both of these simultaneously in your wife 's case if you have an hsa and she has traditional health benefits with an fsa this is not considered a problem since she can only use the fsa money for expenses incurred by members of your family on her plan however if she were to join you on the hsa which sounds like it could be a good idea overall she would need to wind down her fsa and would not be able to fund it for the next year this could be a problem if you have a lot of money in the fsa that she is n't able to spend prior to joining the hsa the reason why the government does n't want one given person covered by both an hsa and given access to an fsa at the same time is that they are both tax advantaged what they intend is that people can set aside money pre tax which they will use to pay their non covered health expenses if someone had both there would be two potential problems if you do ultimately want your wife to be on the hsa see if you can spend what is left in her fsa as it will end when she ends her health coverage with her employer if the amount you stand to lose is significant you may need to wait another year until your next open enrollment period or life event such as the birth of a child to enroll her on your hsa it is also likely that her premium on the hsa will be lower which could impact the effect of ending her fsa recently there has also been a rule change regarding what is called a limited use fsa these are fsas that are used for qualifying expenses such as dental and vision that can be used together with an hsa this may be something that is helpful to you and/or your wife on the hsa if your employer offers this as a possibility please note that unlike retirement accounts you can not rollover funds between fsa plans offered by two different employers as each fsa is a separate benefit fund that is on a use it or lose it basis again because the government wants to restrict tax advantaged contributions to what you are likely to spend you may also find the article here helpful to learn more about fsa hsa combinations and limited use fsas i hope this helps

it lowers the cost of capital   debt is generally a cheaper form of financing and in addition you have the benefit of interest being tax deductible   assume you have no capital to expand an existing business   how do you fund it   you could sell issue some stock to outside investors for cash or inject your personal cash into the business if you have it or you can borrow the money   general the borrowing is cheaper as debt investors need a lower return than equity investors because debt is less risky has claims on the business assets before equity holders than equity

any deductable expense will reduce your taxable income not your tax payable your example 1 above is correct and gives you 100 deduction it is like having a business where your sales are $ 100,000 and your expenses in making the sales is $ 40,000 the expenses are your tax deductions and reduce your profits on which you pay tax on to $ 60,000 if your example 2 was correct then the situation above would change that you would pay say $ 30,000 tax on $ 100,000 sales then apply your deductions or expenses of $ 40,000 so that you would pay no tax at all and in fact get $ 10,000 back in your return in this case the government would not be collecting any taxes but paying out returns to everyone your example 2 is incorrect

with 150 k € to invest to become a landlord you have several options pay for 100 of one property and you then will make a significant percentage of the monthly rent as profit each month that profit can be used to invest in other things or to save to buy additional properties at the end of the 21 years in your example you can sell the flat for return of principal minus selling expenses or even better make a profit because the property went up in value pay 20 down on 5 flats and then make a much a smaller profit per flat each month due to the mortgage payment for each one at the end of the 21 years sell the flats assuming that a significant portion of the mortgage is paid off each flat will sell for more than the mortgage balance thus you will have 5 nice large profits when you sell something in between 1 and 5 flats each has different risks and expenses with 5 rental properties you are more likely to use a management company which will add to your monthly cost

you can not just decide to declare bankruptcy and make the debts go away bankruptcy proceedings under chapter 7 include accounting of all of your assets and income and all of your debts and dividing all your assets and income except for amounts left for your own support between the debtors so if you can i.e. capable pay the debts off there 's nothing magical in bankruptcy that will make it any better for you you will still pay the debts off except that now you will also have the huge and much heavier stain of bankruptcy for chapter 7 the length it stays on the credit report is 10 years not 7 under chapter 13 the procedure is less drastic does n't include complete liquidation of all of your assets but the result is equally not as good you still pay all your debts but they may be reorganized interest rates change durations change some things can still be charged off but not likely if you actually have the capability to pay chapter 13 stays on your credit report for 7 years

my recommendation is to not ask for a credit increase but just increase the utilization of one card if you have multiple cards and decrease the utilization of the others and continue paying off all cards in full each month   in a   few months you   will likely be offered a credit increase by the card that is getting increased use   the card company that is getting the extra business knows that you are paying off big bills each month and keeping your account in good standing and they will likely offer you a credit increase all by themselves because they want to keep your business   if no offer is forthcoming you can call the card company and ask for a credit increase if they refuse tell them that you will be charging very little on the card in the future   or even canceling your card though that will cause a hit on your credit score because of their refusal and switch your high volume to a different card

if the interest rate on the student loan is lower than inflation then the student loan will be cheaper the longer you take to pay it    this is now a very rare instance but there were programs and loan consolidation opportunities in the 's that allowed savvy student 's to convert their loans to have an interest rate of around 1.5 right now the inflation rate is actually quite low but it 's not expected to stay there and was n't that low just a few years ago so in the long run this type of debt will only be cheaper the longer it takes to pay off it is risky as others point out as it ca n't be written off in bankruptcy but there are other situations where it can be written off more easily than other debts so on balance the risks are n't better or worse than other loans in general   for specific individual situations the risk equation might work out differently though further student loans are n't considered traditional debt by some lenders for specific lending opportunities thus allowing you to go into greater debt for certain types of purchases   whether this is good for you or not depends on the importance of the purchase if you need to buy a house and the interest rate is higher than your student loan rate it will be better financially to pay off the house first while paying the minimum on the student loans    if you have no other debt with a higher interest and the student loan interest is higher than inflation there is no reason to delay paying off the student loan

since then i had gotten a job at a supermarket stocking shelves but recently got fired because i kept zoning out at work this is not a good sign for day trading where you spend all day monitoring investments   if you start focusing on the interesting math problem and ignoring your portfolio you can easily lose money   not so big a problem for missed buy opportunities but this could be fatal for missed sale opportunities   realize that in day trading if you miss the uptick you can get caught in a stock that is now going down    and i agree with those who say that you are n't capitalized well enough to get started   you need significantly more capital so that you can buy a diversified portfolio diversification is your limitation not hedging   let 's say that you make money on two out of three stocks on average   what are the chances that you will lose money on three stocks in a row   one in twenty seven   what if that happens on your first three stocks    what if your odds at starting are really one in three to make money   then you 'll lose money more than half the time on each of your first three stocks   the odds do n't favor you    if you really think that finance would interest you consider signing up for an internship at an investment management firm or hedge fund   rather than being the person who monitors stocks for changes you would be the person doing mathematical analysis on stock information   focusing on the math problem over other things is then what you are supposed to be doing   if you are good at that you should be able to turn that into a permanent job   if not then go back to school somewhere   you may not like your schooling options but they may be better than your work options at this time    note that most internships will be easier to get if you imply that you are only taking a break from schooling   avoid outright lying but saying things like needing to find the right fit should work   you may even want to start applying to schools now   then you can truthfully say that you are involved in the application process   be open about your interest in the mathematics of finance   serious math minds can be difficult to find at those firms    given your finances it is not practical to become a day trader   if you want proof pick a stock that is less than $ 100   found it   write down its current price and the date and time   you just bought that stock   now sell it for a profit   ignore historical data   just monitor the current price   missed the uptick   too bad   that 's reality   once you 've sold it pick another stock that you can afford   do n't forget to mark your price down for the trading commission   a quick search suggests that $ 7 a trade is a cheap price   realize that you make two trades on each stock buy and sell so that 's $ 14 that you need to make on every stock   keep doing that until you 've run out of money   realize that that is what you are proposing to do    if you can make enough money doing that to replace a minimum wage job then we 're all wrong   borrow a $ 100 from your mom and go to town   but as others have said it is far more realistic to do this with a starting stake of $ 100,000 where you can invest in multiple stocks at once and spread your $ 7 trading fee over a hundred shares   starting with $ 100 you are more likely to run out of money within ten stocks

it 's not like bankers and politicians forget what happened then and the biggest causes of the 2008 crash began in the mid 90 's and early 2000 's nobody went to prison for the crisis because there was no one who actually committed criminal acts people were just stupid and figured debt would be forever cheap and the market would never decline and the regulations that are being rolled back actually made big banks more powerful because only they could afford the compliance costs   just like after 2008 your best bet in dealing with a crash is just hold everything you own because if you sell into a decline you have less money to buy when the market rebounds

there are only two ways to increase your savings you are young and both of these are likely to happen you will be promoted and get raises and your loans will be paid off removing the loan payment it would seem that you need only to wait a year or so and there will a lot more than $ 87 left over each month and your savings will grow almost without any action from you but somehow that is not what happens in real life as people get older they need more than they did before larger home more expensive things etc and they never manage to get around to saving so it 's great that you are wondering how to do it but you are not truly making it a priority you mention that you also pay spend for friends the internet play joy cloth gifts book etc and this entirely optional spending is the difference between such precision and 90 of your salary in other words it is 17 18 or more than your rent think about that for a moment every month you spend more than your rent on friends play joy books and good old etc if you were to cut that in half you could save 8 or 9 of your salary maybe after your next raise you can get that up to 10 how can you cut that optional fun stuff in half well i do n't know because i do n't know what it is and i suspect you do n't either so track it for a month or two are you getting takeout food or coffee every day are you always the one who pays when you go out with friends do you eat in restaurants a lot do you always wear the latest buy $ 500 shoes pay people to do your nails or dye your hair buy a new phone every year have the top end phone plan top end cable plan you have to know where that worth of money goes every month then you can figure out how to send some of it to savings instead   in some ways you are in a hard generation your parents did n't need to save for their retirement because they had you and they know you will send money home for them but you probably do n't expect the same from the children you do n't have yet so you have to save for yourself this is a challenge if you were saving the money you send your parents you 'd be fine yet you do n't want to reduce what you send they need it still people have faced bigger challenges and overcome them start by understanding where your fun money is going then look at how to send some aim for half of that to savings instead you wo n't regret it

hopefully this $ 1000 is just a start and not the last investment you will ever make assuming that there are a couple of big questions to consider one what are you saving for are you thinking that this is for retirement 40 or 50 years from now or something much sooner like buying a car or a house you did n't say where you live in the u.s. if you put money into an ira or a 401k or some other account that the government classes as a retirement account you do n't pay taxes on the profits from the investment only on the original principal if you leave the money invested for a long period of time the profits can be many times the original investment so this makes a huge difference   like suppose that you pay 15 of your income in state and local taxes   and suppose you invest your $ 1000 in something that gives a 7 annual return and leave it there for 40 years of course i 'm just making up numbers for an example but i think these are in a plausible range and i 'm ignoring the difference between regular income tax and capital gains tax etc etc it does n't change the point if you put the money in a classic ira you pay 0 taxes the year you open the account so you have your full $ 1000 figure that compound interest for 40 years you 'll end up with crunch crunch crunch the numbers $ then you pay 15 when you take it leaving you with $ the end result with a roth ira is exactly the same feel free to crunch those numbers but now suppose you invest in a no retirement account so you have to pay taxes every year your original investment is only $ 850 because you have to pay tax on that and your effective return is only because you have to pay 15 of the 7 so after 40 years you have crunch crunch $ quite a difference but if you put money in a retirement account and then take it out before you retire you pay substantial penalties i think it 's 20 if you plan to take the money out after a year or two   that would really hurt two how much risk are you willing to take the reality of investment is that almost always the more risk you take the bigger the potential returns and vice versa investments that are very safe tend to have very low returns as you 're young if you 're saving for retirement you can probably afford a fairly high amount of risk if you lose a lot of money this year odds are you 'll get it back over the next few years or at least be able to put more money into investments to make up for it if you 're 64 and planning to retire next year you want to take very low risk investments in general investing in government bonds is very safe but has very low returns corporate bonds are less safe but offer higher returns stocks are a little more of course different companies have different levels of risk new start ups tend to be very risky but can give huge returns commodities are much higher risk buying on margin or selling short are ways to really leverage your money but you could end up losing more than you invested mutual funds are a relatively safe way to invest in stocks and bonds because they spread your risk over many companies three how much effort are you willing to put into managing your investments how much do you know about the stock market and the commodities market and international finance and so on and how much are you willing to learn if your answer is that you know a lot about these things or are willing to dive in and learn a lot that you can invest in individual stocks bonds commodities etc if your answer is that you really do n't know much about all this then it makes a lot of sense to just put your money into a mutual fund and let the people who manage the fund do all the work

here 's another way that i look at it   say you and me were 50 50 partners in a small business suppose we wanted to expand our business but that needed money someone let 's call him warren has the money we need hence in return for the money we offer warren an equal stake in the business   i.e. all three of us own 33 stake now for both you and me our stake reduced from   50 that it was before warren 's entry to only 33 now   while that reduction in our share may seem at first sight a bad deal for us we both agreed to give warren his share consciously not out of altruism but because it made business sense to helps us expand   ergo what matters is not just your share of the pie but the size of the pie itself and hence dilution of stake can make sense under certain circumstances   two small points a this does n't   in any way show the dilution must make sense only that it can sometimes make sense b of course in the case of a large corporation they do not need your personal approval for the dilution but hey neither do they ask you when they buy a new plant or start a new product

congratulations on being in such good financial state   you have a few investment choices if you want very low risk you are talking bonds or cds with the prime rate so low nobody is paying anything useful for very low risk investments   however my opinion is that given your finances you should consider taking on a little more risk a good step is a index fund which is designed to mirror the performance of a stock index such as the s&p 500 that may be volatile in the short term but is likely to be a good investment in the longer term i am not a fan of non index mutual funds in general the management charge makes them a less attractive investment   the next step up is investing in individual stocks which can provide very big gains or very big losses   the motley fool site has a lot of information about investing overall

yes it is possible to withdraw money from your roth ira before retirement but i would n't necessarily advise you to do so   here 's the good news and the bad news the good news unlike a traditional ira money contributed to a roth ira is done so on an after tax basis meaning you do n't benefit from a tax deduction on contributions so the money you withdraw from your roth ira will not be taxed entirely as ordinary income in fact you are allowed to withdraw the amount of your original contributions also known as basis without any taxes or penalties let 's imagine you originally deposited $ 9000 of that current $ 10 k total value then in such a case $ 9000 could be withdrawn tax and penalty free the bad news when it comes to the investment earnings the other $ 1000 in my example   it 's a different story   since you would n't be age 59 1/2 at the time of withdrawal any money taken out beyond your original contributions would be considered a non qualified withdrawal and subject to both ordinary income taxes plus a 10 early withdrawal penalty   ouch perhaps you might want to restrict your withdrawal to your original contributions   i would imagine if you 've had the account for such a short period of time that much or all of your account value is original contributions anyway a good article about the rules for early ira withdrawals is about.com 's tax penalty for early distribution of retirement funds note if your roth ira funds were the result of a rollover from another account type other rules may apply see roth ira wikipedia for more detail search for rollover regarding the withdrawal process itself and the timing you should check with your account custodian on how to proceed

i assume by that you mean gradually buying the same mix of funds over time   if that 's the case there is no rational reason to do this    dollar cost averaging is an artifact of the way most people fund their 401(k   i would not consider it a viable strategy   neither does wikipedia   let 's say you have $ 100,000 that you add $ 10,000 at a time   when you add money one of three things can happen since you ca n't predict the future there 's no mathematical justification for buying in segments   there 's just as much chance that your funds will be worth more or less so on average it should make little to no difference    in fact given the time value of money there is a slight   advantage to investing it all now so you can capture any future returns   you can always rebalance later to capture gains on some funds and purchase funds that are down to hopefully catch them on a rebound

you start taking on some big risks when go to absolute zero unlike your plane analogy you do n't have to fly or not fly you can opt to take a safer hybrid form of transit or to extend the analogy now you 're driving or walking instead of flying which per mile traveled is statistically more risky even if the plane feels and looks riskier   consider reading up a bit on the risks of all cash bonds including shortfall and inflation yes real estate is a hedge but most of your portfolio is still exposed to inflation why not also buy some treasury inflation protected securities via a bond fund why not put 25 in the stock market to help do well when the markets do well   i think if you do some reading on this you 'll find yourself shocked at the risks of being all cash fwiw i 'm a relatively conservative voice on investing subreddits the guy who is usually saying hey be sure to keep some so i 'm all about a safe balanced portfolio but tilt too far in either direction and you take on more risk not less   you mentioned a pension and real estate those are presumably good inflation hedges and relatively stable holdings the pension especially suggests you can take more stock risk since you have that stable bond like holding   the thing to me is that you would be all in during the good times if you 're this risk adverse when you see warning signs i 'm curious were you 100 stocks before totally on off like that seems kinda intense

i would say that there is no real difference   asset management companies that is part of large banking groups usually seat in separate entities and operate independently from the rest of the bank assuming proper procedures and regulators usually check that are in place they will not share information with the rest of the bank and their assets are clearly segregated from the rest of the bank they have the same fiduciary duties as an independent am and are probably using the broker dealer services of other banks as well as their parent reputation is a key issue for banks and conflict of interests are usually managed properly independence also comes and goes the corporate history of is a good example was once an independent asset manager in 2003 it merged with lehman brothers thus loosing its independence when lehman went bankrupt in 2008 nb did not join its parent company in bankruptcy and did not lose the assets of its clients the company continued to operate until it was acquired by the management finally it is mostly a question of marketing and positioning

you need to talk to an accountant who practices tax accounting someone who is an enrolled agent ea with the irs and possibly an attorney who specializes in tax law   there are multiple issues here and the executor of your father 's estate might need to be involved here too   presumably you were a minor in 2007 since the transactions took place in a custodial account and perhaps you were a dependent of your father in 2007   so were the transactions reported on your father 's 2007 income tax return or did he file a separate income tax return in your name you say you have a w2 for 2007 so you were   earning some income in 2007 this complicates matters it is necessary to determine who has the responsibility to file income tax returns for a minor with earned income above all i urge you to not file income tax returns on your own or using a tax return preparation program or after talking to a tax return preparation service where you will likely get someone who works on a seasonal basis and is unlikely to be familiar with tax law as of 2007

while you would probably not use your atm card to buy a $ 1 m worth mansion i 've heard urban about people who bought a house on a credit card while ca n't say its reliable i would n't be surprised that some have actual factual basis i myself had put a car down payment on my credit card and had i paid the sticker price the dealer would definitely have no problem with putting the whole car on the credit card and my limits would allow it even for a luxury brand the instruments are the same there 's nothing special you need to have to pay a million dollars you just write a lot of zeroes on your check but you do n't need a special check for that large amounts of money are transferred electronically wire transfers which is also something that regular people do once or twice in their lives what might be different is the way these purchases are financed rich people are not necessarily rich with cash most likely they 're rich with equity own something that 's worth a lot in this case instead of a mortgage secured by the house they can take a loan secured by the stocks they own this way they do n't actually cash out of the investment yet get cash from its value it is similarly to what we regular mortals do with our equity in primary residence and helocs so it is not at all uncommon that a billionaire will in fact have tons of money owed in loans why because the billions owned are owned through stock valuation and the cash used is basically a loan secured by these stocks it might happen that the stocks securing the loans become worthless and that will definitely be a problem both to the now and the bank but until then they can get cash from their investment without cashing out and without paying taxes and if they 're lucky enough to die before they need to repay the loans they saved tons on money on taxes

using us tax code given that your profits are less than 250 k given that you lived in that home over two years then yes the 150 k is tax free    that is your money in the us note   i wo n't get into all of the specifics but basically you need to live somewhere 2 years   you get 250 k per person up to 500k.   most enhancements count as money towards the home   so most all of your 12k should be discounted   however there is a lot of fine print in this and a lot of interpretation on what is normal upkeep and what is an enhancement

what might make more sense is to capture your losses   sell out the funds you have move into something else that is different enough that the irs wo n't consider it a wash sale and you can then use those losses to offset gains you can even carry them forward    you would still be in the market just having made a sort of sideways move   a month or two later once you are clear of wash sale rules you could shift back to your original choices   this answer presumes you are in the us or somewhere that lets you use losses to offset gains

does keynesian economics say that there is no demand   keynesian economists like paul krugman say so   if the correct application of keynesian economics says the us has insufficient demand while the country 's balance of payments has a deficit of several hundred billion dollars a year then the theory is seriously wrong otoh if there is no lack of demand while unemployment is high then the theory is also wrong   where is the right interpretation of keynesian economics that would account for both a sluggish economy and a big balance of payments deficit   the only explanation i can imagine is that production costs are too high

the federal reserve is not the only way that money can be printed every bank does fractional reserve banking thereby increasing the money supply every time they make a new loan there 's a number called the reserve requirement which limits how much money each bank can create lowering the reserve requirement allows banks to create more money raising it will destroy money but banks can also destroy money by calling in loans or being less willing to make new loans   so when you look at the number of banks in the us and the number of loans they all have it 's impossible to figure out exactly how much the money supply is expanding or contracting

there are far more questions to be addressed here than one answer can address let me work backwards and start with the easy part i make $ 120k yr what can i afford you are making $ 10k mo a great income a well written mortgage will allow you to use 28 for housing that 's the mortgage property tax insurance and hoa on $ 2800 let 's take out $ 500 for prop tax and just $ 300 for insurance i 'll even ignore hoa for now the remaining $ will fund a mortgage of $ 400k. that 's not close to a $ 700 k condo   a $ 550 k mortgage would cost $ and $ 3600 with tax and insurance $ 4100 with hoa over 40 of your gross and a sign that you are in over your head   the real question is why you 'd want to do this $ rent means you can save $ in addition to what you already save if you stay put

i d like to start by saying you re still doing this yourself and i do nt actually have all the info required anyway do nt send it but   descriptive statistical measures provide a thorough discussion of the meaning and interpretation of the four descriptive measures required in your analysis 1 arithmetic mean 2 variance 3 standard deviation and 4 coefficient of for example how are these measures related to each other in order to develop this discussion you may want to chapters 2 and 3 of your textbook this topic is an important part of your report can be easily interpreted i m guessing the mean is simply just the observed and then projected stock price for future models the standard deviation determines the interval in which the stock price fluctuates so you have like a curve and then on this curve theirs a bunch of normal distributions modeling the variance of the price plotted against the month   also the coefficient of variation is just so just read up on that and relate it to the meaning of it to the numbers you have   actually my stats are pretty rusty so make sure you really check into these things   but otherwise the formulas for part 4 is simple too you can compare means of a certain month using certain equations but there are different ones for certain situations   you can test for significance by comparing the differences of the means and if its outside of your alpha level then it probably means your company is significantly different from the sp index take mu of sp mu of   you can also find more info on interpreting the two different coefficients your given if you look up comparing means of linear regression models or something

it depends on the relative rates and relative risk ignore the deduction you want to compare the rates of the investment and the mortgage either both after tax or both before tax your mortgage costs you 5 a bit less after tax and prepayments effectively yield a guaranteed 5 return if you can earn more than that in your ira with a risk free investment invest if you can earn more than that in your ira while taking on a degree of risk that you are comfortable with invest if not pay down your mortgage see this article mortgage prepayment as investment for example the borrower with a 6 mortgage who has excess cash flow would do well to use it to pay down the mortgage balance if the alternative is investment in assets that yield 2 but if two years down the road the same assets yield 7 the borrower can stop allocating excess cash flow to the mortgage and start accumulating financial assets note that he 's not comparing the relative risk of the investments paying down your mortgage has a guaranteed return you 're talking about cds which are low risk so your comparison is simple if your alternative investment is stocks then there 's an element of risk that it wo n't earn enough to outpace the mortgage cost update hopefully this example makes it clearer for example lets compare investing $ 100,000 in repayment of a 6 mortgage with investing it in a fund that pays 5 before tax and taxes are deferred for 10 years for the mortgage we enter 10 years for the period 3.6 if that is the applicable rate for the after tax return $ 100,000 as the present value and we obtain a future value of $ for the alternative investment we do the same except we enter 5 as the return and we get a future value of $ however taxes are now due on the $ of interest which reduces the future value to $ the mortgage repayment does a little better so if your marginal tax rate is 30 you have $ 10k extra cash to do something with right now mortgage rate is 5 ira cd apy is 1 and assuming retirement in 30 years if you want to plug it into a spreadsheet the formula to use is substitute your own values note the minus sign before the cash amount make sure you use after tax rates for both so that you 're comparing apples to apples then multiply your ira amount by to get the value after you pay future taxes on ira withdrawals

one year is short term short enough that trying to predict returns is a crap shoot frankly if you will need the money in one year i would n't touch anything riskier than a money market account $ 5000 also is n't enough to give you much flexibility in achieving a balanced portfolio since the minimal initial purchase for mutual funds is often around $ 2500 i 'm not sure whether etfs would give you any more flexibility so on grounds of both size and time horizon i have to recommend against this plan the risk of losing money with insufficient time for gains to balance that risk is simply too high others may feel differently of course but that 's the best advice i can offer

i ca n't say specifically about charities to help greece if someone on here has specific knowledge please chime in the only shortcut i know to tell if a charity is legitimate is to consult one of the ratings type groups that monitor charities for example for explicitly christian charities there 's a group called the council for financial accountability to be a member in good standing a charity has to meet a bunch of criteria like having an independent board of directors i.e. you ca n't start a charity make yourself the president and your brother in law the vice president and you 're not answerable to anyone else their fund raising and administrative costs ca n't be more than a certain percentage of total income etc there are similar groups with similar standards for more general charities i 'm not naming any of those groups because there 's a potential catch how reputable is the group that rates other people 's reputations and i do n't want to recommend someone without knowing years ago i came across a news story about an organization that rated colleges and that had given one particular college their top rating but the news story said investigators found that that one college was the only college they ever gave a rating to and that their address was the same as the college 's address it turned out of course that the college was a scam the other method is to take some time to investigate the charity   for starters get a copy of their annual report or their newsletter if they 're total frauds often they do n't have an annual report or a newsletter of course a fraud could make up beautiful flyers describing all the wonderful work they do with pictures of people they helped and detailed case histories and it 's all complete fiction but that 's more work than most con men go to i 've gotten lots of for contributions from people who call on the phone or come to my door or send an email if the message does not have a logo a mailing address and phone number reasonably coherent english and a fair amount of text describing what they do i do n't give them anything they could be a new start up that has n't had time to prepare these things they could believe that pretty flyers are a waste of money and they want to put all their resources into helping the needy but more likely it 's a scam that somebody through together in his basement of course the best thing is if you personally know people who are officers in the organization well assuming you personally know them and you know that they are honest people if you know the president and you know he 's a sleazy con man you might want to stay away from that group see if you can find information about the charity in the news or on line if they 're being investigated for fraud by the justice department you might want to avoid them etc maybe you 've thought this through but you also might want to think about exactly who in greece you want to help and what your philosophy of charity is do you want to help people who lost their jobs because of the economic problems there and who are now unemployed do you want to donate to the government to help them balance the budget do you want to help support an or a homeless shelter or give money directly to needy people etc and one piece of unsolicited advice unless you have millions to give and i 'm assuming you do n't as you said your first gift would be $ 50 i 'd pick one or two charities and give regularly to them i think you can do more good by giving $ x per month to a single charity than to give to a different charity every month you make more difference

say the rate is 6 and the payment is $ 500/mo if the bank credits on the day received the .5 per month is $ 2.50 for the whole month in other words pulling in the payment by the full 30 days will save you about $ 2.50 the whole loan may be costing $ but you can only impact the amount one payment at a time   to be clear you need to find out exactly how they credit you some loans do not accept partial payments separate from the normal payment if a $ 500 payment is due that 's the time to prepay principal but they might not accept say $ 200 each week   as a side note mortgages typically do n't credit the way you 'd hope i have a standard 30 year mortgage and whether i send the payment a full 15 days early or 14 days late the next month shows a balance that i can pull from an amortization table assuming all payments are on the 1st of the month if i were you i 'd make a full payment 2 weeks early then check your balance and see what the impact was just to be sure

the notion that you can put product on the web and sit back and watch the money roll in is a myth plain and simple   if you put content on the web and expect people to pay money for your products t shirts etc you have to do the work to get your stuff seen by people and preferably the right kind of people who will buy your stuff that means you need to know your market and provide something that they are eager to pay for this does n't necessarily mean buying advertising to direct traffic to your site there are plenty of no cost ways to bring people to your web site but instead of costing $ $ the cost is in effort and time that you have to put into it also keep in mind that the more participants you have in your production and fulfillment pipeline the less you will make off every sale hands off production services like or cafe press do everything for you all you have to do is provide the artwork   however they also take all the income and pay you a rather percentage of sales   you can get a larger percentage of sales if you do more of the work yourself like handmade items sold on etsy   but then you 're doing work maybe you 'll get $ 1 for each t shirt you sell   if you just upload your artwork to the production service and type in some product description text into their web sales catalog how many sales will you make in the first month   most likely somewhere between zero and two   why should anyone buy your shirt over the tens of thousands of other designs carried by the same production service   it 's your responsibility to tell people about your stuff and send them to the site to buy it   and that means it 's not a passive income for truly passive income invest in bank cd 's treasury bonds or in stocks that pay dividends   the only problem with that is you have to have money to make money this way

everyone is telling you how to manage your finances good for them that 's not an answer to your question the real answer solves how to get your money to travel the bank likely might extend you a loan especially if you have assets greater than the amount borrowed   however a better solution or alternative if the bank 's rate are too high or they simply wo n't give it to you is to go to a p2p lending platform these are in the uk and us if i remember correctly there was a canadian platform called or the point here is this go borrow money at a lower rate than your credit card there are other alternatives than p2p you can google these just make sure the rate is lower than your credit card pay the card off and go on vacation just make sure you can pay it all off eventually otherwise you 'll be swimming in debt you ca nt pay

in the case of regulated exchange traded options the writer of an options contract is obliged to maintain a margin with their broker and the broker is obliged to maintain a margin with the clearing house   institutional writers of options will deal directly with the clearing house in the event that the writer is unable to make a daily margin call the broker or clearing house may automatically close out all of their positions using existing margin held   if there was a shortfall the broker or clearing house would be left to the client writer to make good on their obligations none of this effects the position of the original buyer of the options contract   effectively the buyer 's counterparty is their broker 's clearing house account

let ’s try the more straightforward approach again   the current state of economics does n’t take into consideration the human condition   as you have done yourself it refuses to even admit that the human condition should be a factor it considers   but when humans are in dire we find their economic position is directly against their human condition   which of these two will win   hint not the current economic system unless it starts accounting for and being tolerant of the human condition   how could i possibly know that   humans created the economic system   it is not an innate part of their condition contrary to what many would suggest   when faced with two opposing forces humans will almost always destroy the weaker of the two to end the conflict   humans can not destroy the human condition   feelings do have an impact on the economy   trust and loyalty love and hate all impact it   when we let the economy lead to suffering we design its own downfall   if the economic system could instead be seen as only a trade structure that backs off when other influences come to bear it could survive   but the current capitalist structure tries to place money above all else   so of course it is seeing problems

you will maximize your expected wealth by investing all the money you intend to invest as soon as you have it available do n't let the of dollar cost averaging induce you to allocate more much money to a savings account than is optimal   if you want the positive expected return of the market do n't put your money in a savings account   that 's especially true now when you are certainly earning a negative real interest rate on your savings account dollar cost averaging and putting all your money in at the beginning would have the same expected return except that if you put all your money in earlier it spends more time in the market so your expected return is higher   your volatility is also higher because your savings account would have very low volatility but your preference for investment tells me that you view the expected return and volatility tradeoff of the stock market as acceptable if you need something to help you feel less stress about investing right away think of it as dollar cost averaging on a yearly basis instead of monthly   further you take take comfort in knowing that you have allocated your wealth as you can instead of letting it away in real terms in a bank account

my opinion including the value of depreciating property one owns in a net worth calculation is silly but could be interesting you do n't expect your tv or laptop to gain value   instead you expect them to decrease in value every year until you replace them   anything you expect to hold or increase in value art a house etc is a different story if you 'd like to really get anal about this you can track your net worth like a business would track its balance sheet   i 'm not going to go into detail but the general idea is that when you purchase an item you debit the cost from cash and add the value paid to assets so your net worth does n't change when you make a purchase    you then depreciate the value of the item under assets according to a depreciation schedule   if you plan on replacing your laptop every three years you might subtract 33 of the value every year    this could be an interesting exercise i.e. even if you make money your net worth may decrease because of all the depreciating junk you own but my hunch is that it would n't be worth the effort it requires

construction loans are typically short term that then get rolled into conventional mortgages at the end of the construction period since the actual construction loan is short term you can not combine it with a long term land loan as well you could do the two separate loans up front to buy the land and finance the construction then at the end roll both into a conventional mortgage to close out the land and construction loans this option will only work if you do all three through the same lender trying to engage various lenders will require a whole new refinance process which i very much doubt you would want to go through these are sometimes called combo loans since they aggregate several different loan products in one transaction not a lot of places do land loans so i would suggest first find a lender that will give you a land loan and set an appoint with a loan representative explain what you are trying to do and see what they can offer you you might have better luck with credit unions as well instead of traditional banks

price is decided by what shares are offered at what prices and who first   the buyer and seller are both trying to find the best offer for their definition of best within the constraints then have set on their bid or ask the seller will sell to the highest bid they can get that they consider acceptable the buyer will buy from the lowest offer they can get that they consider acceptable the price and whether a sale purchase happens at all depends on what other trades are still available and how long you 're willing to wait for one you 're happy with and may be different on one share than another at the same time if the purchase could n't be completed with the single best offer and had to buy from multiple offers this may have been easier to understand in the days of open outcry pit trading when you could see just how chaotic the process is but it all boils down to a high speed version of seeking the best deal in an old fashioned marketplace where no prices are fixed and every sale requires or at least offers the opportunity for negotiation fred sells it five cents cheaper then why are n't you buying from him he 's out of stock well when i do n't have any my price is ten cents cheaper maybe i wo n't buy today or i 'll buy elsewhere maybe i wo n't sell today or maybe someone else will pay my price sam looks interested ok ok i can offer two cents more three sam looks really interested two and a half and throw in an apple for susie done and the next buyer or seller starts the whole process over again open outcry really is just a way of trying to shop around very very very fast and electronic reconciliation speeds it up even more but it 's conceptually the same process either seller gets what they 're asking or they adjust and/or the buyer adjusts until they meet or everyone agrees that there 's no agreement and goes home

how you should record the mortgage payments depends on if you are trying to achieve correct accounting according to the standards or if you are just tracking everything for you and your friends if you 're just keeping track for personal reasons i 'd suggest that you set up your check or journal entry your preference how you 'd like it to be recorded   then memorize that transaction   this allows you to use it as many times as you need to without having to set it up each time   also note there is no way to record a transaction that decreases cash and increases equity if you 're trying to keep track of everything according to accounting standards which it should be if you 've set up an official business then you have a lot more tracking to do with each payment   mortgage payments technically do not affect the equity accounts of the owners   each mortgage payment should decrease the bank balance increase interest expense and decrease the mortgage balance not to mention tracking any escrow account you may have   the equity accounts would be affected if the owners are contributing funds to the bank account but equity would increase at the time the funds are deposited not when the mortgage payments are made hope this helps

you are correct   credit card companies charge the merchant for every transaction   but the merchant is n't necessarily going to give you discount for paying in cash   the idea is that by providing more payment options they increase sales covering the cost of the transaction fee   that said some merchants require a minimum purchase for using a credit card though this may be against the policies of some issuers in the u.s. i have no idea about india also correct   they hope that you 'll carry a balance so that they can charge you interest on it   some credit cards are setup to charge as many fees as they possibly can   these are typically those low limit cards that are marketed as good ways to build up your credit   most are basically scams in the fact that the fees are outrageous update regarding minimum purchases apparently visa is allowing minimum purchase requirements in the u.s. of $ 10 or less   however it seems that mastercard still does not allow them for the most part   moral of the story research the credit card issuers policies   a further update regarding minimum purchases in the us merchants will be allowed to require a minimum purchase of up to $ 10 for credit card transactions   i am guessing that prompted the visa rule change mentioned above more detail can be found here in this answer along with a link to the text of the bill itself

the quickest way to approach this question is to first understand that it compares flows vs. levels market size is usually stated as an annual or other period figure e.g. the market size of will be $ in 2019   this is a flow figure market capitalization is a level figure at any given point in time e.g. the market cap of the company was $ 20 million at the end of its last fiscal quarter confusion sometimes occurs when levels and flows are used loosely for comparisons   it is common for media to make statements such as joe billionaire is worth more than the gdp of   that is comparing a current level net worth with an annual flow gdp with this in mind there are a variety of conditions where a company 's equity market value will exceed its market size   the most extreme example is an innovating development stage enterprise say a biotech company developing a new market for a new product the current market size may be nil while the enterprise is worth something greater the primary reason however for situations where a company 's equity market cap is greater than its market size is usually that the financial market expects the enterprise and oftentimes its market though this is n't necessary to grow substantially over time and hence the discounted value of the company may be greater than the current or near future market size a final example   us annual gdp which comprises of much more than corporate incomes and profits for 2014 was about $ while the nation 's total equity market value in 2014 was $ both according to the world bank   that latter figure also does n't include the trillions of corporate debts these companies have issued so the total market cap of us inc. is substantially greater than $

if you 're getting the same total amount of money every year then the main issue is psychological i mean you may find it easier to manage your money if you get it on one schedule rather than another it 's generally better to get money sooner rather than later if you can deposit it into an account that pays interest or invest it between now and when you need it then you 'll come out ahead but realistically if we 're talking about getting money a few days or a week or two sooner that 's not going to make much difference if you get a paycheck just before the end of the year versus just after the end of the year there will be tax implications if the paycheck is delayed until january then you do n't have to pay taxes on it this year of course you 'll have to pay the taxes next year so that could be another case of sooner vs later but it can also change your total taxes because in the us and i think many other countries taxes are not a flat percentage but the more you make the higher the tax rate so if you can move income to a year when you have less total income that can lower your total taxes but really the main issue would be how it affects your budgeting others have discussed this so i wo n't repeat

there are many different reasons to buy property and it 's important to make a distinction between commercial and residential property historically owning property has been part of the american dream for multiple reasons   but to answer your questions value is not based on the age of the building however it can be in a historic district in addition the price of something and it 's value may or may not be directly related for each individual buyer owner because that becomes subjective some buildings can lose there value as time passes but the depends on multiple factors area condition of the building overall economy etc so it 's not that easy to give a specific answer to a general question   before you buy property amongst many things it 's important to determine why you want to buy this property what will be it 's principal use for you that will help you determine if you should buy an old or new property but that pales in comparison to if the property will maintain and gain in value also if your looking for an investment look into reit real estate investment trust these can be great why because you do n't actually have to carry the mortgage which makes that ideal for people who want to own property but not have to deal with the everyday ins and outs of the responsibility of ownership like rising cost it 's important to note that the cost of purchase and cost of ownership are two different things but invariably linked when buying anything in the material strata of our world you can find publicly traded reits on the major stock exchanges hope that helps

if you are careful you do n't need to spend much more than the cruise price   the cruises i 've been on they biggest extra was soda and alcohol mainly wine with dinner   if you are fine drinking water or iced tea there is no need for that food extras like ice cream at the pool may be an extra charge as well the way it works is that your room key acts like a credit card and gets charged to your room   its easy to run up a big bill if you are n't paying attention so you may want to keep track of it as you go along   you can also go to the office at any time and find out your current account generally the cruise automatically charges a certain amount per day for tips for your room and dining room attendants   you are expected to tip for spa services another extra charge and shore excursion guides   shore excursions vary greatly depending on what you are doing   maybe $ 50-$100 per person for a bus tour to much more than that for things like diving or fishing   you can also either book tours yourself or just get off and wander around   it depends where you are going   many times the ships dock far away from anything you might want to see   there are generally taxis or to the tourist places but that is another charge   internet is generally charged by hour and quite expensive several dollars per hour   part of the attraction for me is completely so i generally do n't bother   on older ships you probably are limited to the internet lounge   some of the newer ships have wi fi in the state rooms as well the drinks on board are n't cheap but not outrageous either   probably similar to an upscale club   they also have a daily drink special which is cheaper   technically you are n't allowed to bring your own alcohol on board   if you buy something in a port you need to check it with them   this policy may vary by cruise line but has been true on the princess and costa cruises i 've been on   that said as long as you are low key they probably wo n't know or care

just the amount contributed to the roth 401k that you rolled over not the conversions from regular 401k traditional ira for those there are holding period limitation of 5 year from conversion the earning on it or the employer 's match neither of these can be withdrawn without penalty as a non qualified withdrawal however i 'd suggest not to withdraw from roth ira unless you 're sleeping on a bench in a park and beg strangers for a piece of bread this is the best retirement investment you can make while you 're in the lower tax brackets and withdrawing it would reduce dramatically your tax free retirement income

institutional investors are the elephant in the room when they sneeze everyone else catches cold they 're fine if they 're buying after you do they 're not bad if you want to buy after they sell en masse but when you read about moves of 10 percent 15 percent or more in a single day it 's because a bunch of institutional investors all decided to do the same thing on the same day   that 's more volatility than most people can stomach fewer institutional investors in a stock mean fewer chances of those things happening

according to the article the irs issued a stop work order for the contract with equifax while it an investigation i have to assume that the contract laid out termination provisions so it 's likely that the irs is making sure that they do n't do anything which appears to be a breach of contract and gives fuel to equifax to sue frustrating i know   what i really like is the statement released by equifax following the decision by the irs we remain confident that we are the best party to perform the services required in this contract    how delusional do you have to be to make a bold statement like that after what happened

got it i can definitely see how it can come across that way especially with all of these big tech companies lining up against the proposal my understanding is that a lot of that is more driven by their size than anything else the media focuses on the impacts to amazon and facebook because they 're huge companies and it 's easier to get information on them   but when it comes to who would get hurt the most by removing nn it 's actually small businesses and startups that would suffer the most in a world without net neutrality isps would be able to provide access to web services at different speeds for example if you are a comcast customer if comcast has a deal with amazon prime they can make it so that your access to competing services like netflix and hulu are moving so slow that it will be hard to use anything other than amazon prime video   now if that happens it will be annoying for companies like facebook netflix google etc to have to pay extra for internet users to be able to use them but they could do it they have the money the people who would struggle are people who own smaller businesses and smaller websites when they 're just starting out they wo n't have the money to pay the isps to let people access them and as a result they could be essentially locked out of many marketplaces this is the argument made by people who say that removing net neutrality will stifle small business removing the regulation would create this built in structural advantage for large established businesses and leave smaller businesses locked out

gt the 20 million people added to healthcare is a number they boast and brag about when they do nt realize from a study i m having a hard time so take it with a grain of salt roughly 65 of those people could afford health insurance prior to the aca just chose not to buy and because of the mandate were forced to    yes that is one of the reasons i supported the aca the problem of rising health care costs as one of the sources i linked to showed is the free rider problem too many people walk into the emergency room uninsured or they get emergent care that they are not covered for and the hospitals jack up the prices greatly in the hopes of getting a larger portion reimbursed by medicare now who pays for that medicare reimbursement you and i of course the taxpayers do and we pay a heavily artificially inflated version of that price this is the most jacked up form of universal health care but that is what the gop if fighting to    gt i also know that for me health insurance prior to the aca was significantly lower roughly 50 cheaper and that does nt even begin to touch the hikes a lot of people i know saw    i have no doubt this is true and another reason that i support the aca not because it equates to higher prices for you but because for the first time it made younger adults actually responsible for their medical bills when the aca was enacted we had a guy in our company who was about 23 years old he saw his insurance costs go up by 50 we covered is insurance increases because we supported him however what we found when we went back and compared the insurance that he had with the insurance that he has is that the first policy did n't cover anything but the most extreme circumstances it was a junk policy that left the taxpayer liable for a lot of stuff response x rays medicine etc there was nothing in there for preventative care which as the study i linked showed greatly impacted health for the worse    gt they have some of the lowest income tax rates in the world   again switzerland has lower tax rates than the us but they do n't even crack the top 20 when it comes to countries with low countries with the lowest tax rates in the edges out the regions other oil rich state to come in second place but still loses out to one other most of the countries in that list are relatively poor countries to the average citizen with weak infrastructure many of those countries are in which the ruling family controls the number one source of income oil so there is no taxes they just skim their money right off the top these are not countries that we would want to live retire in    switzerland succeeds with low taxes because they have a very efficient universal health care system and they have almost no military to fund    gt while i do not own my own company or have anything to do with r&amp;d i can for a fact disprove your theory   again speaking in this denotes that you can disprove every situation possible to show that government is worse than commercial as i said if you thought that before you entered my industry you quickly see the flip side of that coin    your example is a perfect example of that so you work in construction an industry in which commercial is notorious for a contract whether to government or to private and then running into unexpected that cause the job to go over schedule over budget these companies succeed because there are a very small number of providers that can accomplish certain jobs so they tend to stick around just like the big banks even though they are n't the best    its not like the government just sits around and takes it i know of at least one federal contractor who went to federal archive id for fraudulently winning contracts in my part of the country    gt the private sector will always have a need to innovate and that need will always be filled with or without the government the only difference is the private sector wo nt keep throwing money at an unsustainable rate like the government does because if they do nt see results its not worth funding   and this is why the government can succeed in areas that commercial can not this is why government got the first people on the moon not commercial this is why we have already sent missions to mars whereas musk is going to make those trips more efficient it is because government has tremendous resources that they can throw at a problem even the richest man in the world will run out of money before he can solve the big problems as i told a poster earlier spent over $ 1 t working on the problem in iraq afghanistan this was the number one killer of our troops there were many inventions that came out of this there is no company in this world that had the resources to tackle this problem solely what the government does a great job in is the troops and assembling resources to tackle a major task that would be by the individual    gt i d also like to add you are near the same

i do n't have all the answers on a illiquid stock such situations do arise and there are specific mechanisms used by exchanges to match the order it is generally not advisable to use market order on illiquid stock there are lots of different variations here i guess this comes down to specifications for individual exchanges but i 'm wondering if there 's a standard here or a way to approach it from basic rules that clears up all these situations there are quite a few variations and different treatments market order that are placed when the market is closed or just around market opening are traded at market open price that each exchange has a formulae to calculate in the process market buy are matched to market sell at the exchange calculated price not all order get matched and there could be spill over 's these are then matched to limit orders is this determined based on which sell order came first or based on which would result in the best deal for the incoming buyer generally market orders have highest priority of execution

while i agree with ben a lot i feel like his answer is really poor here you do not call a number to give your credit card information out for a refund   that is ridiculous   just from his answer he has had 5 cases of fraud lately you should know that you should n't follow this advice i personally do n't ever give my credit card number over the phone unless it is the very very very last resort   it is not just about money and safety but it is about time   every time that you give your number out over the phone there is a chance that the employee on the other end by either scam or legitimate business will use or sell your info   so you need to determine if the time saved by doing a transaction over the phone is worth hours days of your time if your card has a fraud issue   and note that fraud sometimes is easily negated but if done smartly can be hard to prove via a quick call or email to card company what should you do tell company that you will simply get the refund through your credit card company and if we go back to time element   you fill out form on card website   card company goes back to vendor and says why are you asking for card numbers via email   card company either cancels vendor contract or more likely helps them understand the technology available so they do n't have to do this   therefore that quick form that you filled out will now keep this company from bugging you again   by going through their archaic systems you are enabling their behavior

first of all it 's quite common place in gnucash and in accounting in general i believe to have accounts that represent concepts or ideas rather than actual accounts at some institution   for example my personal gnucash book has a plethora of expense accounts just made up by me to categorize my spending but all of the transactions are really just entries in my checking account as to your actual question i 'd probably do this by tracking such savings as negative expenses using an expense account and entering negative numbers   you could track grocery savings in your grocery expense account or if you want to easily analyze the savings data for example seeing savings over a certain time period you would probably want a separate grocery savings expense account edit regarding putting that money aside here 's an idea   let 's say you bought a $ 20 item that was on sale for $ 15   you could have a single transaction in gnucash that includes four splits one for each of the following actions decrease your checking account by $ 20 increase your expense account by $ 20 decrease your discount savings expense account by $ 5 and increase your savings account where you 're putting that money aside by $ 5

personally i solve this by saving enough liquid capital aka checking and savings to cover pretty much everything for six months but this is a bad habit a better approach is to use budget tracking software to make virtual savings accounts and place payments every paycheck into them in step with your budget the biggest challenge you 'll likely face is the initial implementation if you 're saving up for a semi annual car insurance premium and you 've got two months left that 's gon na make things difficult in the best case scenario you already have a savings account which you among your various expenses this does mean you need to plan when it is you will actually buy that shiny new macbook pro and stick to it for a number of months much more difficult than buying on credit especially since these retailers hate dealing in cash

since you mention the religion restriction you should probably look into the stock market or funds investing in it owning stock basically means you own a part of a company and benefit from any increase in value the company may have and loose on decreases provided you sell your stock and you also earn dividends over the company 's profit if you do your research properly and buy into stable companies you should n't need to bother about temporary market movements or crashes do pay attention to deterioration on the businesses you own though when buying stocks you should be aiming for the very long run as mentioned by victor do your research i recommend you start it by looking into value stocks should you choose that path

alternatives like free market capitalism i 'm not convinced that the chinese model is superior to any alternatives especially capitalism the western world was built on free market capitalism and china was left in the dust for decades under the regime china 's strange mix of communism and capitalism has definitely benefited their economy but it was n't the communism part that did it it was opening their economy that did it i ca n't see how the bureaucracy and control of the state has benefited their economy beyond keeping everyone in the dark about the actual of their economy it seems like government planned expansion and development is just a scheme to pump money into their economy to keep it afloat i think it 's a bubble and it 's bound to pop at some point with potentially catastrophic consequences i 'm not normally some doom but the chinese economy looks like a house of cards from the outside without further critical analysis

they return capital to investors every year to keep the fund size smaller since there are a set number of money making opportunities in the space   in other words if they will make $ 1 billion per year regardless of invested capital why not lever up a few times so you do n't have to put as much in

actually the rate of change could be more or less constant but you might have a minimum price that represents your fixed costs   so you might sell a for $ 1 which is ridiculous in terms of per unit pricing to cover fixed costs and add $ for each step in size to cover variable costs cost of raw materials and packaging so a 2 lb bag would be $ 2 a 5 lb bag would be $ 3.50 a ton would be $ etc   at the end of the day you want the marginal revenue the price that you charge for each additional pound to be more than the marginal cost the price per pound it takes to produce the bag   any amount over that goes towards your fixed costs the cost you 'd incur if you sold zero product rent utilities overhead etc it 's not an exact science and there are many variables that go into pricing

the current tax regime   not sure if you are being serious or facetious but   us citizens and resident aliens abroad filing individuals international taxpayers us citizens and resident aliens abroad filing requirements   gt;if you are a u.s. citizen or resident alien living or traveling outside the united states you generally are required to file income tax returns estate tax returns and gift tax returns and pay estimated tax in the same way as those residing in the united states   in contrast corporations do n't pay taxes on profits earned abroad until repatriation economy corporate taxes inversion index.html economy corporate tax   so guess what they never do   this is why literally every large us multi national corporate person pays next to nothing in taxes   it is quite obvious that this is a violation of the spirit if not the letter of tax law     that simple fix would wipe out massive amounts of government debt and force multi national corporations and their shareholders to become engaged stake holders in the efficiency of government   but if unlike w-2 paid human counterparts you can dodge all taxation who cares if the government is using funds efficiently   that is incentive to actually game the system to force the government into wasteful spending because the subsequent fallout of increased taxation and/or failure of the state can be dodged without consequence

cfds should not be used as a buy and hold strategy which is risky enough doing with shares directly however with proper money and risk management and the proper use of stop losses a medium term strategy is very plausible   i was using cfds in the past over a short time period of usually between a couple of days to a couple is weeks trying to catch small swings with very tight stops i kept getting due to my stops being too tight so had too many small loses for my few bigger wins and yes i lost some money almost $ 5k in one year i have recently started a more medium term strategy with wider stops trying to catch trending stocks i have only recently started this strategy and so far have 2 loses and 3 wins just remember that you do get charged a financing fee for holding long position overnight buy for short position you actually get paid the funding fee for overnight positions my broker charges the official interest rate + 2.5 for long positions and pays the official rate 2.5 for short positions so yes cfds can be used for the longer term as long as you are implementing proper money and risk management and use stop losses just be aware of the implications of using margin and all the costs involved

how do i leave 0 tip and not feel guilty or make anyone feel bad the wages of restaurant staff is not within the control of the wait staff in fact the irs assumes that restaurants where tipping occurs will receive at least 8 of their gross receipts in tips irs topic number tips withholding and reporting if the total tips reported by all employees at your large food or    beverage establishment are less than 8 percent of your gross receipts    or a lower rate approved by the irs you must allocate the    difference between the actual tip income reported and 8 percent of    gross receipts among the employees who received tips so as little sense as it may make tipping is baked into the us tax code there 's no way you can refuse to tip in an establishment where tipping is the practice and not make someone feel bad since it will have a real impact on their earnings if you are serious about your principles you should exclusively patronize restaurants with a no tipping policy they are becoming more common if you patronize restaurant where tipping is expected and refuse to tip then people will suspect that it 's less about your principles and more about being a free rider

most items used in business have to be depreciated you get to deduct a small fraction of the cost each year depending on the lifetime of the item as per irs rules that is you can not assume a one year life for an electronic item   even if it will be obsolete in three months   some items can be expensed you get to deduct the entire cost in the first year but then if you do n't stay in business e.g. you get a job paying wages and are no longer self employed you have to recapture this and pay taxes on the amount recaptured in the later year   with respect to consumer type electronics such as an ipad or laptop it helps to have a separate   item for personal use that you can show in case of an audit

put options for kids you have a big box of candy bars you saved up your allowance to get a lot of them so you could have one whenever you want one but you just saw a commercial on tv for a new toy coming out in one month your allowance alone wo n't buy it and you want that toy more than you want the candy so you decide that you 'll sell the candy to your friends at school to buy the toy now you have a choice you can sell the candy now and put the money in your piggy bank to buy the toy later or you can save the candy and sell it in a month when you actually need the money to buy the toy you know that if you sell all the candy you have today you can get 50 cents a bar that 's not quite enough to buy the toy but your allowance will cover the rest   what you do n't know is how much you might be able to sell the candy for in a month you might be able to get 75 cents a bar if you did you could pay for the toy with just the money from the candy and even have some left over but you might only be able to sell them for 25 cents each and you would n't have enough to buy the toy even with your allowance you 'd like to wait and see if you could get 75 cents each but you do n't want to risk getting only 25 cents each so you go to your father he and his co workers like these candy bars too so he 'd be willing to buy them all and sell them to his friends the way you 're planning to do with yours you ask for the option to sell him all the candy bars for 50 cents each in one month if you find out you can get more for them at school you want to be able to take that deal but if you ca n't sell them for 50 cents at school you 'll sell them to your dad now your dad knows that he could have the same problem selling the candy at 50 cents or more that you are afraid of so he offers a compromise if you pay him $ 5 now he 'll agree to the deal you figure that even without that $ 5 between your allowance and the candy money you can still buy the toy so you take the deal   in one month you can offer the candy at school if nobody will pay 50 cents you can sell the candy to your dad when you get home but if the kids at school will pay 50 cents or more you can sell it all at school either way you have enough money to buy the toy and you can also choose which price to accept but you had to pay your dad $ 5 and you ca n't get that back so if it turns out that you can sell the candy at school for 50 cents same as today then because you paid the $ 5 you do n't end up with as much as if you 'd simply waited in the financial market this type of option is a put option someone who owns something that 's traded on the market like a stock can arrange to sell that stock to someone else at an agreed on price and the seller can additionally pay some money to the buyer up front for the option to not sell at that price now if the stock market goes up the seller lets the contract expire and sells his stock on the open market if it goes down he can exercise the option and sell at the agreed upon price to the buyer if however the stock stays about the same whether he chooses to sell or not the money the seller paid for the option means he ends up with less than he would have if he had n't bought the option call options for kids let 's say that you see another ad on tv for another toy that you like that was just released you check the suggested retail price on the company 's web site and you see that if you save your allowance for the next month you can buy it but in school the next day everybody 's talking about this toy saying how they want one some already have enough money others are saving up and will be able to get it before you can you 're afraid that because everyone else wants one it 'll drive up the price for them at the local store so that your month 's allowance will no longer buy the toy so you go to your dad again you want to be able to use your allowance money for the next month to buy the new toy you 're willing to wait until you actually have the money saved up before you get the toy but you need that toy in a month so you want your dad to buy one for you and hold it until you can save up to buy it from him but you still want it both ways if the price goes down in a month because the toy 's not so new anymore and people do n't want it you do n't want to spend your entire month 's allowance buying the one from your dad you just want to go to the store and buy one at the lower price you 'll pay him $ 5 for the trouble right now whether you buy the toy he got you or not your dad does n't want to have a toy he 's not using sitting around for a month especially if you might not end up buying it from him so he offers a different deal in one month if you still want it he 'll stop by the store on his way home and pick up the toy you 'll then reimburse him from the allowance you saved up if it ends up costing less than a month 's allowance so be it but if it costs more than that you wo n't have to pay any more this will only cost you $ 3 because it 's easier for him but because he 's not buying it now there is a small chance that the item will be out of stock when he goes to buy it and you 'll have to wait until it 's back in stock you agree on the condition that if you have to wait longer than a month for your toy because he could n't get one to sell you he pays you back your $ 3 and knocks another $ 5 off the cost to buy the toy from him the basic deal to buy something at an agreed price with the option not to do so is known as a call option someone who wishes to buy some stocks bonds or commodities at a future date can arrange a deal with someone who has what they want to buy them at a specific price the buyer can then pay the seller for the option to not buy the counter offer dad made where he will buy the toy from the store at whatever price he can find it then sell it to you for the agreed price is known as a naked call in finance it simply means that the seller who is in this case offering the option to the buyer does n't actually have what they are agreeing to sell at the future date and would have to buy it on the open market in order to turn around and sell it this is typically done when the seller is confident that the price will go down or wo n't go up by much between now and the date of the contract in those cases either the buyer wo n't exercise the option and will just buy what they want on the open market or they 'll exercise the option but the difference between what the seller is paying to buy the commodity on the market and what he 's getting by selling it on contract is within the price he received for the option itself if however the price of an item skyrockets the seller now has to take a significant real loss of money by buying something and then selling it for far less than he paid if the item flat out is n't available the buyer is usually entitled to penalties for the seller 's failure to deliver if this is all understood by both parties it can be thought of as a form of insurance

td will only sell the stock for you if there 's a buyer there was a buyer for at least one transaction of at least one stock at but who said there were more obviously the stocks later fell i.e. there were not that many buyers as there were sellers what i 'm saying is that once the stock passed reached the limit the order becomes an active order but it does n't become the only active order it is added to the list and to the bottom of that list obviously in this case there were not enough buyers to go through the whole list and get to your order and since it was a limit order it would only execute with the limit price you put once the price went down you got out of luck   that said there could of course be a possibility of a system failure but given the story of the market behavior it just looks like you and lost on a bet

this answer assumes you 're asking about how to handle this issue in the usa i generally downvote questions that ask about a tax legal issue and do n't bother providing the jurisdiction in my opinion it is extremely rude seeing that you applied for an llc i think that you somehow consider it as a relevant piece of information you also attribute some importance to the ein which has nothing to do with your question i 'm going to filter out that noise as an individual sole proprietor whether under llc or not you can not use fiscal years only calendar years it does n't matter if you decide to have your llc taxed as s corp as well still calendar year only c corp can have a fiscal year and you probably do n't want to become a c corp so the year ends on december 31 and whether accrual or cash you can only deduct expenses you incurred until then also you must declare the income you got until then which in your case will be the full amount of funding again regardless of whether you decided to be cash based or accrual based so the main thing you need to do is to talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state and learn about the tax law relevant to your business and its implications on your actions there may be some ways to make it work better and there are some ways in which you can screw yourself up completely in your scenario so do get a professional advice

do n't buy a house as an investment buy it if because it 's the housing you want to live in do n't improve a house as an investment improve it if because that makes it more comfortable for you to live in it it 's a minor miracle when a home improvement pays back anything close to what it cost you unless there are specific things that really need to be done or undone or its design has serious cosmetic or functional issues that might drive away potential buyers a bit of will find you much more realistic estimates of typical average payback on home improvements remember that contractors are tempted to overestimate this the contractor i 've used who seems to be fairly trustworthy does n't report much more than 60 for any of the common renovations and yes that 's really 60 not 160

in the other question the op had posted a screenshot circa 2010 from transunion with suggestions on how to improve the op 's credit score   one of these suggestions was to obtain retail revolving accounts   by this they are referring to credit accounts from a particular retail store   stores have been offering credit accounts for many years and today this usually takes the form of a store credit card   the credit card does not have the visa or mastercard logo on it and is only valid at that particular store   for example target has their own credit card that only works at target stores   the revolving part simply means that it is an open account that you can continue to make new charges and pay off as opposed to a fixed retail financing loan such as you might get at a high end furniture store where you obtain a loan for a single piece of furniture and when it is paid off the account is closed the formula for credit scores are proprietary secrets   however i have n't read anything that indicates that a store credit card helps your credit score more than a standard credit card   i suspect that transunion was offering this tip in an attempt to give the consumer more ideas of how to add credit cards to their account that the consumer might not have thought of   but it is possible that buried deep in the credit score formula there is something in there that gives you a higher score if you have a store credit card as an aside the op in the other question had a credit score of and was trying to make it higher   in my opinion this is pointless   remember that the financial services industry has an incentive to sell you as much debt as possible and so all of their advice will point to you getting more credit accounts and getting more in debt

unless your investments are held within a special tax free account then every sale transaction is a taxable event meaning a gain or loss capital gain loss or income gain loss depending on various circumstances is calculated at that moment in time gains may also accrue on unrealized amounts at year end for specific items in general in the us gains do not accrue at year end for most things moving cash that you have received from selling investments from your brokerage account to your checking account has no impact from a tax perspective

as others have pointed out it sounds like the problem is n't the accessibility of your money the problem is willpower so address that instead how   willpower is both a finite resource and a resource that can be increased like muscle strength   since willpower is finite break down the problem into as many pieces as possible then address only one of those pieces at a time be more sensible with my money is nebulous vague and large there 's no place to start   so break it apart first thing is the one example in your question you go out on payday with friends coworkers intending to only buy a couple of beers alcohol lowers willpower and end up blowing through far more so what about making a rule to not go out on payday   nice idea but that might still be too hard to do if you have a habit of going out with them on payday then this has become your community and you will feel the of not going out with them as well as the social pressure from them to do as you 've always done   so set up a different habit for that night one that both involves the obligation of going there instead and other people who will expect you to be there some examples would be a sport that happens to practice or compete on payday nights or some charity that happens to need you at that time   once you 've broken that habit and in the resulting of your wallet look for other similar leaks i 'm going to guess that all your money gets spent on going out to pubs as opposed say to buying bric a you do n't need if so then you need to face that you 've adopted a pub going culture and that your community has shrunk to just those kind of people it may seem like you have a lot of people in your life but if all it takes to lose connection to all of them is to stop going to pubs then you really do n't your human connections essential for an enjoyable life are too fragile too focused so if that 's the problem branch out diversify the communities you 're part of i 've already mentioned sport church is another good one i mean a living church the kind where the people are always doing stuff together and it 's fun to go to not the other kind where everyone sits in a pew for an hour a week and rushes the exits as soon as possible other possibilities are reaching out to neighbors or becoming politically involved   hmmm i started writing about willpower but i 'm ending up at community at your core do you feel like if you did n't spend this way that you would n't have any friends

in addition to the answer by craig sometimes brands are owned by publicly traded companies which have a very diverse product portfolio in case of microsoft their stock price and dividend will not be controlled solely by that one product they make but also by their many other products plus a billion other factors which can influence a stock price so when you want to bet specifically on the success of windows phone then betting on the microsoft corporation as a whole might not achieve that goal however you can also try to find companies whose success depends indirectly on the success of the product that can be suppliers someone who makes a specific part which is only used for windows phones companies which make windows phone specific accessories or software developers who make applications which specifically target the windows phone ecosystem when the product portfolio of these companies is far narrower than that of microsoft they might be more dependent on the success of windows phone than microsoft themselves but as always keep in mind that the success of their products is not the only factor which decides the stock value of a company the stock market is far more complex than that

almost any kind of tax will cause market distortions if market distortions discourage activities which would have produced wealth society will lose out not only on the money which was taken by the tax but also on the wealth which could have been but was n't produced if those setting tax policy seek to maximize the amount of revenue that is made available for each dollar that the tax costs society taxing money which is being used to produce more wealth will go against that goal   further most of the things that companies do with their money to produce wealth end up generating taxable income for someone   if a company deducts from its taxes the money it pays to an employee who then has to pay taxes on that money the government ends up collecting about the same taxes as it would collect if the company did n't hire the employee and thus did n't take the deduction the effects of taxes on markets should be one of the most important factors considered when setting tax policy if one tax would cost society $ 1.05 for every dollar raised and another would cost society $ 5.00 for every dollar raised a wise policy would favor the first over the second   unfortunately politics often dominates over economic rationality

canada did not introduce income taxes before world war i.   specifically deficits forced them to in the later part of the war the conservatives opposed income tax as they wanted to attract immigrants primarily from the united kingdom and the united states as opposed to eastern europe and they wanted to give their preferred choice of some incentive to come to canada expenses forced the to re consider their options and in 1917 the government imposed a temporary income tax to cover expenses despite the new tax the canadian government ran up considerable debts during the war and were unable to forego income tax revenue after the war ended with the election of the king led liberal government much of the national policy was dismantled and income tax has remained in place ever since so from a canadian point of view they were introduced as part of the war effort

that all sounds very nice but the whole point of this conversation and this thread was that a person does not choose the circumstances in which they were born    biologically yes you are right we are a product of the generations that came before us but does that mean that we can blame a poor child for being born poor is it that child 's fault that they their families can not afford good education or even good food    are you actually suggesting that it is acceptable to tell a suffering child sorry you should have chosen better parents   i really hope that is not what you are implying

the basis of homeowner 's insurance pricing is the or amount of insurance   this pertains to the cost to rebuild the dwelling in the event of a total loss   the standard coverages e.g. contents loss of use medical payments liability are calculated relative to this amount   consequently the is selected by the value of the dwelling   this is why it is important that if parts of the dwelling are upgraded that the cost of those upgrades are taken into account the question is not one of denying claims should a loss occur unless the nature of the upgrade is such that policy should not have been underwritten in the first place   this can happen if for example the homeowner builds an extension onto the house that damages the structural integrity of the dwelling in the end the is still just an estimate but the takeaway is that like scheduled personal property jewelry rare collectibles or other endorsements every home and homeowner has slightly different insurance needs and it is in your interest to tailor your coverage to be as accurate as possible in reflecting your needs   insurance is not a one size fits all product consequently the selection of sufficient coverage for your mix of risks is only prudent   now if after you get a quote back and you find that the premium is too high you can typically select a deductible that can reduce it but you have to consider what amount of exposure you are willing to retain   you should shop around too   different insurers use different methods and criteria to price their products so even if the coverage is substantially similar the premiums may vary   for example some insurers ask whether you own a dog exposure to liability claims but others do not   some insurers put more weight on your dwelling 's geographic location exposure to fire theft wind hail than others

to many question and they are all treated differently i was wondering how the logistics of interest and dividend payments are handled on assets such as mortgages bonds stocks    what if the owner is some high frequency algorithm that buys and sells bonds and stocks in fractions of a second when the company decides to pay dividends does it literally track    down every single owner of that stock and deposit x cents per share in    that person 's bank account this sounds absolutely absurd and seems    like it would be a logistical nightmare in stocks the dividends are issued periodically the dividend date is declared well in advance as on end of the day on dividend date the list of individuals or entities who own the stock is available with the stock exchange registrar of the companies to this list the dividends are credited in next few days weeks via banking channel most of this is automated what if the owner is some high frequency algorithm that buys and sells bonds and stocks in fractions of a second on bonds things work slightly differently an bond is initially issued for say 95 discount of 5 and payment of 100 after say 5 years so when the person sells it after an year he would logically look to get a price of 96 of course there are other factors that could fetch him a price of or so every change in ownership factors in the logical rate of interest the person who submits in on maturity gets 100   for the homeowner i 'm assuming he she still makes mortgage payments to the initial bank they got the mortgage from even if the bank no longer owns the mortgage in this case does the trader on the secondary market who owns the mortgage also come back to that bank to collect his interest payment this depends on how the original financial institution sells the mortgage to new institutions generally the homeowner would keep paying initial financial institution and they would then take a margin and pay the secondary investor if this was collateral as mortgage backed security it is a very different story

the most common use of non deductible traditional ira contributions these days as joetaxpayer mentioned is as an intermediate step in a backdoor roth ira contribution contribute to a traditional ira and then immediately convert it to a roth ira which if you had no previous pre tax money in traditional or other iras is a tax free process that achieves the same result as a regular roth ira contribution except that there are no income limits this is something you should consider since you are unable to directly contribute to a roth ira due to income limits also i want to note that your comparison is only true assuming you are holding tax efficient assets ones where you get taxed once at the end when you take it out if you are holding tax inefficient assets like an interest bearing cd or bond or a stock that regularly produces dividends in a taxable account you would be taxed many times on that earnings and that would be much worse than with the non deductible traditional ira where you would only be taxed once at the end when you take it out

the company says it 's out of their control it is n't all they have to do is to instruct hsbc to send a certain amount of gbp and then hsbc must send gbp   obviously the bank does n't like that because they make money through the conversion that 's not your problem when told to send gbp they must send gbp   depending on what your relationship with that company is you lost money because they did n't send the gbp at the very least they sent you four percent less in euros than they should have sent you so send them a bill for the difference it 's unfortunate that your bank charged for the conversion euro to gbp but fact is that less than the agreed amount arrived at your bank and that 's the responsibility of the sender

i think that there is insufficient infrastructure to support a company the size of gm selling only electric cars they would be making a huge assumption that people actually want what they 're offering and that the vast majority of the us will have the infrastructure to support it in a meaningful way   imagine if intel said you know what we 're only going to make cell phone processors from now on cell phones are the future and they 're more energy efficient so that 's all we 'll be making in 5 years   do you really think that so many people will stay loyal to the brand rather than jumping to amd or some other competitor who actually makes full size processors that their business will stay afloat at its current size   i 'm also going to guess that the segment of people who buy american and are loyal to general motors as a company has a pretty small overlap with people who want a glorified golf cart what about all the people that need big work trucks with hauling power that can run all day sounds like they 're being left out in the cold and i 'm sure ford would be thrilled to pick them up with the gas trucks they can produce throwing away an entire segment of your customer base is n't a very strong move when you 're trying to keep a business afloat hydrogen fuel cells sound nice but i have n't seen any proof that the technology has been developed enough to actually run a car in normal day to day they 're making a promise that nobody has delivered on   electric cars are a fine offering in addition to the internal combustion engines that still run the world but to replace them completely they 're nowhere close to that and the expenses to get that sort of project into full swing would bankrupt gm even if poor sales do n't   i think the big mistake is that people are looking at tesla 's success and attributing it to a huge consumer thirst for electric cars rather than to the savvy marketing and hype that formed around elon musk it 's a cult of personality people want a tesla because it 's cool they do n't want a leaf because it 's so darned economical gm obviously does n't get that

a share of stock is a share of the underlying business if one believes the underlying business will grow in value then one would expect the stock price to increase participants in the stock market in theory assign value based on some combination of factors like capital assets cash on hand revenue cash flow profits dividends paid and a bunch of other things including intangibles like customer loyalty a dividend stream may be more important to one investor than another but essentially non dividend paying companies and thus their shares are expected by their owners to become more valuable over time at which point they may be sold for a profit edit to add let 's take an extremely simple example of company valuation book value or the sum of assets capital cash etc and liabilities debt etc suppose our company has a book value of $ 1 m today and has 1 million shares outstanding and so each share is priced at $ 1 now suppose the company over the next year puts another $ 1 m in the bank through its profitable operation now the book value is $ 2/share suppose further that the stock price did not go up so the market capitalization is still $ 1 m but the underlying asset is worth $ some extremely rational market participant should then immediately use his $ 1 m to buy up all the shares of the company for $ 1 m and sell the underlying assets for their $ 2 m value for an instant profit of 100 but this rarely happens because the existing shareholders are also rational can read the balance sheet and refuse to sell their shares unless they get something a lot closer to $ 2 even more if they expect the company to keep getting bigger in reality the valuation of shares is obviously much more complicated but this is the essence of it this is how one makes money from growth as opposed to income stocks you are correct that you get no income stream while you hold the asset but you do get money from selling eventually

there are two reasons to do a reverse split   those partial shares will then be turned into cash and returned to the investors for large institutional investors such as mutual funds or pension funds it results in only a small amount of cash because the fund has merged all the investors shares together if the company is trying to meet the minimum price level of the exchange they have little choice if they do n't do the reverse split they will be delisted if the goal is to reduce the number of investors they are using one of the methods of going private a publicly held company may its equity securities when they    are held by less than 300 shareholders of record or less than 500    shareholders of record where the company does not have significant    assets depending on the facts and circumstances the company may no    longer be required to file periodic reports with the sec once the    number of shareholders of record drops below the above thresholds a number of kinds of transactions can result in a company going    private including

do i have to explain the source of all income on my taxes yes you do say the of and mary the argued to the irs that the money was n’t income and so it should not be taxed as such the irs was n’t swayed by the couple ’s argument the case went to federal court and the irs won found property and money has been considered taxable income ever since the irs plainly states that taxpayers must report all income from any source even income earned in another country unless it is explicitly exempt under the u.s. tax code this covers a wide range of miscellaneous income including gambling winnings according to the decision money you find is n’t explicitly exempt the tax impact wo n’t be significant if you find an item of property with a fair market value of only $ 500 and are in the 25 tax bracket you ’ll owe the irs $ 125 $ 500 x .25 = $ 125 however if you are a finder and keeper of $ 10,000 your tax burden will be $ 2,500 $ 10,000 x .25 = $ 2,500

do you think your 403b will earn more than the mortgage interest rate   if so then mortgage seems the way to go conservative investment strategies might not earn much more than a 3 4 mortgage and if you 're paying 5 6 it 's more likely you 'll be earning less than the mortgage from another point of view though i would probably take a loan anyway just from a security standpoint you have more risk if you put a third of your retirement savings into one purchase directly whereas if you do a 10 15 year loan you 'll have more of a cushion   also if you do n't outlive the mortgage you 'll have had use of more of your retirement income than otherwise though i do wonder if it puts you at some risk if you have significant medical bills which might require you to liquidate your 403b but would n't require you to sell your house so paying it off has some upside also as notes in comments you should consider the taxation of your 403(b income   if you pull it out in one lump sum some of it may be taxed at a higher rate than if you pulled it out more slowly over time which will easily overwhelm any interest rate differences   this assumes it 's not a roth 403(b account if it is roth then it does n't matter

the right answer to this question really depends on the size of the transfer   for larger transfers $ 10k and up the exchange rate is the dominant factor and you will get the best rates from interactive brokers ib as noted by paul above or oanda listed by under $ 10k currencyfair is probably your best bet while the rates are not quite as good as ib or oanda they are much better than the banks and the transaction fees are less   if you do n't need to exchange the currency immediately you can put in your own bids and potentially get better rates from other currencyfair users below $ 1000 xe trade also listed by has exchange rates that are almost as good but also offers eft transfers in and out which will save you wire transfer fees from your bank to send or receive money to from your currency broker   the bank wire transfer fees in the us can be $ outgoing wires on the higher end so for smaller transfers this is a significant consideration you need to look into if you are receiving money in us ing direct and many brokerage accounts do n't charge for incoming wires but unless you have a commercial bank account with high balances expect to spend $ minimum for outgoing   european wire transfer fees are minimal or zero in most cases making currencyfair more appealing if the money stays in europe below $ 100 it 's rarely worth the effort to use any of the above services use paypal or whatever is easiest update   as of december 2013 currencyfair is temporarily suspending operations for us residents following our initial assessment of regulatory changes in the united states including changes arising from the dodd frank act currencyfair will temporarily withdraw services for us residents while we consider these requirements and how they impact our business model   this was a difficult and very decision but we are confident we will be able to resume services in the future the exact date of re activation has not yet been determined and may take some time we appreciate your patience and will continue communicating our status and expected return

any publicly traded financial instrument can be sold short in theory   there are however many regulations associated with short sales of us equities that may prevent certain stocks from being sold short at certain times or through certain brokers some examples the most basic requirement this is n't a regulation it 's just the definition of a short sale is that you or your broker must have access to someone willing to loan you his her shares   if you are interested in shorting a security with few shares outstanding or low trade volume there may simply not be enough people in the world willing to loan you theirs   alternatively there may be a shareholder willing to loan shares but your broker may not have a relationship with the clearing house that shareholder is using   a larger better different broker might be able to help threshold securities list since 2005 each day certain securities are not allowed to be sold short based on their recent history of liquidity   basically if a certain number of transactions in a security have not been correctly settled over the past few days then the sec has reason to believe that short sales which require extra transactions are at higher risk of falling through circuit breaker a.k.a alternative uptick since 2011 during certain market conditions exchanges are now required to reject short sales for certain securities in order to prevent market crashes market abuse

here i thought i would not ever answer a question on this site and boom first ten minutes   first and foremost i am in the automotive industry specifically one of our core is finance department management consulting and the sales process both for the sale of the care as well   as   the financial transaction first and foremost new vehicle gross profits are nowhere near 20 for the dealership   in an entry level vehicle like say a toyota corolla there is only a   few hundreds of dollars in markup from invoice to   there is also something called that dealers get for achieving certain goals such as sales volume these are usually pretty easy to hit as a matter of fact i have never heard of a dealer not getting the hold back on a deal   this hold back is there to cover overhead for the car the cost of getting it ready to sell having a lot to park it on making it ready for delivery offset some of the cost of sales labor   etc   most dealerships consider the portion of the invoice to not be part of the deal when it comes to   negotiations   certain brands such as kia and chrysler have something called dealer cash these payouts are usually stepped according to volume and vary by dealer location past history how the guys at the factory feel that day and any number of combinations   then there is csi or customer service index payments these payments are usually made every 1/4 are on the parts statement not the sales doc and while they effect the dealers bottom line they almost never affect the sales managers or sales persons payroll so they are not considered a part of the cost of the car   they are however extremely important to   the dealer and this is   why after you have your new car they want you to bring in your survey for a free oil change or something   if you are going to give a bad survey they want to throw it away and not send it in if you are going to give a good survey they want to   make sure you fill it out correctly   this is because lets say they ask you on a scale of 1 10 how was your sales person and you put a 9 that is a failing score dumb i know but that is how every factory csi score system i have seen worked   according to nada the average new vehicle gross profit including hold back and dealer cash is around $   no where near 20   dealerships would love it if they made 20 on your new diesel at around $   one last thing there is something on the invoice called wholesale finance reserve   this is the amount of money the factory forwards to the dealership to offset the cost of financing vehicle on the floor plan so they can have it for you to look at before you buy   this is usually equal to around 3 months of interest and while you might buy a vehicle that has been on the lot for 2 days they have plenty that have been there much longer so this equals out in a fair to run store general that know what they are doing can make this really pad their net profit to statement on to incentives there are basically 3 kinds   cash to customer in the form of rebates dealer cash in the form of incentives to dealerships based on volume or the of a vehicle and incentive rates or leases   the rates are pretty self explanatory as they advertised as such example 0 for 60 months   leased are harder to figure out and usually not disclosed as they are hard to explain and also a source of increased profit   leases are usually powered by lower cost of money called a money factor think of it as an interest rate that is discounted from the lease company or a subsidized residual   subsidized are virtually on domestic vehicles due to their poor resell values   a subsidized residual works like this you buy a toyota camry and the automotive lease guide says it has a residual at 36 months of 48   well toyota motor credit says we will give you a residual of 60 basically subsidizing a 2 increase in residual   since they do not expect to be able to sell the car at auction for that amount they have to set aside the 2 as a future expense   what does this mean to you it means a lower payment   also a good rule of thumb if you are told a money factor by your salesperson to figure out what the interest rate is just multiply it by 2400   so if a money factor is give of you know your actual interest rate is a little bit lower than illustration purposes only money factors are much lower than that right now so how does this save you money well a lease is basically calculated by multiplying the msrp by the residual and then subtracting that amount from the capitalized cost which is the price paid for the car trade in + payoff + rebate down payment   that is the depreciation   then you divide that number by the term of the loan and you have the depreciation amount   so if you have 20 k cc and 10 k r your d = 10 k 36 = monthly payment   for the rest of the monthly payment you add i think been a long time since i did this with out a computer the residual plus the cc for $ 30,000 mf of = 107 for a total payment of 404 ish   this is not completely accurate but you can use it to   make sure a salesperson finance person is not trying to do one thing and   say another as so often happens on leases 0 how the   heck do   they make money at that well its simple   first in 2008 the fed made all the captive lenders into actual banks instead of whatever they were before   so now they have access to the fed 's discounting window which with todays monetary policies make it almost free money   in the past these lenders had to go through all kinds of hoops to raise funds and   securitize loans even for super prime credit   those days are essentially over   now they get their short term money just like bank of america does   eventually they still bundle these loans and sell them   so in the short term you pay for the 0 by giving up part or all of your rebate   this is really important do not give up your rebate for 0 unless it makes sense to do so   when you can get the money at 2.5 and get a $ rebate customer cash on that or 0 take the cash   first of all make the finance guy gal show you the the difference in total cost they can do do this using the federal truth in lending disclosures on a finance contract   secondly how long will you keep the vehicle   if you come out ahead by say $ 1500 by taking the lower rate but you usually trade out every three years this is not going to work   also and this is important if you are involved in a situation with a total loss like a stolen car or even worse a bad wreck before the breakeven point you lose that price break   finally on judging what is right for you just know that future value of the vehicle on for resell or trade in will take into effect all of these past rebates and value the car accordingly   so if a vehicle depreciates 20 a year for the first 3 years the starting point will essentially be $ less than you actually paid   using rough numbers how does this help the dealers and car companies   well while a dealer struggles to make money on new cars the factory makes all of their money on the   new cars and the new car financing   while your individual loan might lose money that money is offset by the loss of rebate and i think ford does actually pay ford motor credit company the difference in the rate   the most important thing is what happens later now has 2500 loans with people with perfect credit   they can now use those loans to with people with not so perfect credit that they financed at and buy that money with interest rates in the range   well that is a hell of a lot of profit   how does it help the dealership well the more super prime credit they have in their portfolio the more subprime credit the banks will buy for them   this means they have more loans originated that are more profitable for them   say you come in for the 0 but have 590 credit score they get to buy the deal because they have a good portfolio and you win because the dealer gets to buy the money at say 9 and sell it to you at say 12 making the spread   you win there because you actually qualified for a rate of around 18 with a subprime company like santander or capital one yes that capital one so   you save a ton on your overall cost of the car any dealership that is half way well run makes as much or money in the finance and insurance office than the rest of the dealership   when you factor in what a good director can do to get deals done with favorable terms that really goes up   think about that the guys sitting a desk drinking coffee making more than the   service department guys all put together well that was long winded but there i broke down the car business for whoever read this far

1- wells fargo does not own our current mortgage   they have bundled it and sold it as an investment 2- they make their money from servicing the loan   even if they only get $ 50 per month to service it 3 of our monthly payment that adds up to $ per month if they have a million homes under management   that is $ 600 million per year for each million homes being serviced 3- managing the escrow gets them additional profit because they can invest it and earn 2 3   if 1,000,000 homes have an average balance of $ 2,000 in their escrow accounts they can earn up to $ 60 per year or $ annually they make $ 1,000 every time they refinance the home   this is the approximate profit after paying real closing costs   refinance those million homes and you make a cool billion in profit 5- they also want to be sure that they keep us as a customer   by lowering our payment they decrease the likelyhood that we will refinance with someone else and we are less likely to default   not that they lose if we default because they do n't own the loan they make additional profit by paying off the old loan they do n't own it remember then packaging and selling the new mortgage   since they are selling it as a security they sell for future value meaning they sell our $ 200,000 loan for a valuation of $   this means that they sell for $ 200,000 plus some fraction of the additional $ 160,000   let 's say they only want a 10 premium of the $ valuation   that means they sell our $ 200,000 loan for $   they pocket $ 36,000   if they make a million of these transactions every year that is $ 36 billion dollars in profit so wells fargo refinances one million homes every year and they make $ initial profit for selling the loan with absolutely no risk plus $ for doing the loan $ annually to service the loan very little risk since it is being paid by the owner of the loan as a service fee if they can retain the loans for their entire life keep us from refinancing with someone else they can make $ that is billion dollars in servicing fees the profit they make in a refinance is much greater than the money then can make by holding the loan for 30 years

i 'm starting to think that the catalyst for a correction will be if corporate tax reform does n't go through    from what i can tell the market has already priced in a near 100 chance of a substantial corporate tax rate cut in the near future   i think if it becomes clear that it just wo n't happen a lot of analysts will adjust their models and their fair valuations come back down to earth

a libertarian 's take on the above passage    as long as capitalism is actively working businessman and are synonymous and neither is bad neither will be able to stay in business without benefitting society by keeping willing customers   so where does the above ideal fall apart   adam smith himself warned about natural monopolies think rockefeller carnegie and yet i personally would n't call them demons     yet i ca n't think of a single example of one of them today yet we still have a massive number of demons obstructing capitalism   the real demons are government sanctioned     giant barriers to entry permits certifications extensive tax code licenses etc are only the beginning     a patent grants an automatic 20-year monopoly for better or for worse   for medicines probably worse   did you know you can patent a fucking gene now   government supported     software and design patents are so broad it 's trivial for any established firm to put a out of business simply through legal bullying   what if the people are unhappy with which defense contractor the gov't picks to do work in iraq   is that capitalism   the government pretty much gave at&amp;t a blank check to own the entire internet backbone as long as they promised to invest the money and not dump it to their shareholders cough   cable tv trusts corruption at its finest   my family only has the choice of a single cable provider because of the gov't approved anti competitive practices   zip code   not exactly a remote area either   all the above examples are clear abuses of power and none would disagree other than the direct beneficiaries   where does the libertarian perspective diverge from the keynesian one then   keynesians believe that we need rules in place to prevent companies from exploiting positions like these   libertarians believe that the government should not have the power in the first place to enable these abuse methods to arise in the first place

i 'm going to make an educated guess on 1 money markets invest in bonds with a very short time to maturity an mma at a bank will be invested in government bonds yields on these bonds are really low right now thus the yield on that mma is going to be pretty low when you make a deposit in a savings account the bank uses some of that money to lend back out to its customers in the form of car loans mortgages etc these rates are higher so the bank is willing to pay you a bit more than the yield mma so they can use your money for these loans for 2 your time window is short so there are n't really a lot of options for you keeping your money where it is will actually cost you money in fees you can do as i suggested in my comment above close the current savings account that 's hitting you with fees and open a free high yield savings account you might get 1.1 if you average $ 60k in the account over the next 6 months you 'll earn $ 200 250 after taxes you did n't ask about cds but lately shorter term cds are paying less than savings accounts going out to a year will get you just above the rate on a high yield savings account two years just a little more these are outside your goal window so they are n't an option for you

when you give a gift to another person or receive a gift from another person there is no impact on your taxes you do not have to report certain amounts in your income including the following    gifts and inheritances if you give a gift to a charity or similar organization you can reduce your taxes it is my recollection that when a family member gives a large amount of money to a child tax on the income that money earns typically interest should be paid by the giver not the child but i ca n't find any publications to that effect on the cra site there is a bit of language about gifts from an employer that are really employment income gifts and other voluntary payments 1.3 the term gift is not defined in the act in common law jurisdictions the courts have said that a bona fide gift exists when    is a voluntary transfer of property    donor freely of his or her property to a donee and    donee no right privilege material benefit or advantage on the donor or on a person designated by the donor 1.4 whether a transfer of property has been made voluntarily is a question of fact in order for a transfer to be considered voluntary there must be no obligation to make such a transfer amounts received as gifts that is voluntary transfers without consideration and which can not be attributed to an income earning source are not subject to tax in the hands of the recipient 1.5 however sometimes individuals receive a voluntary payment or other valuable transfer or benefit by virtue of an office or employment from an employer or from some other person in such cases the amount of the payment or the value of the transfer or benefit is generally included in employment income pursuant to subsection or paragraph see also guide guide taxable benefits and allowances similarly voluntary payments or other transfers or benefits received by virtue of a profession or in the course of carrying on a business are taxable receipts if the people in question are adults who are not related to each other and do n't have a business or employment relationship then you should find that regardless of the amount of the gift neither giver nor recipient will have a tax consequence

i 'm looking to leave my corporate finance position in the next several months looking at positions externally with more responsibilities in the same realm or to move to a financial services type role in consulting or similar a lot of job postings call out financial modeling as a desired skill what specifically is meant by this modeling cash flows estimating given some assumptions valuation i 'm in excel all day in my role but still ca n't seem to make sense of what i should be doing to prepare for a next step in my early career the models i typically work with involve calculating accruals or analyzing margin data in my corporate environment which has become very stale as of late thanks
