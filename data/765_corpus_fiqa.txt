generally it would be an accountant specifically in the case of very private or unorganized which is even worse person forensic accountant since there 's no will it will probably require a lawyer as well to gain access to all the accounts the accountant i would start with a good estate attorney who in turn will hire a forensic accountant to trace the accounts

gt why would he have had to have known about sony 's patent application he explicitly stated he did n't know about it until after it was awarded   as i noted the whole timeline simply doesn't match up with reality at all no matter how desperately one the timeline into trying to make it plausible   i think he has not only at the least dramatically his own memory and the story but that most probably he was entirely mistaken as to what actually happened in the first place   again at best and even this is a a rather dubious stretch i think junior maybe came up with a crude almost like drawing of the of an idea relative to crt 's after reading some pop science article about crt 's and then daddy who was apparently a wall street lawyer his son by having a patent attorney look at it and then came back and told junior some cock amp bull story about having been beaten to the patent   and it probably did n't go any further than that other than in the imagination of a teenager   who then repeated the story and slowly modified and later it as the years went on   gt;how many kids his age do you think were even coming up with crappy unoriginal tv designs and how many of those went on to become marketing guys   lol   go to any sizeable bar and talk to a number of people ask them if they ever had an idea that was later patented and became a big time thing you 'll end up with hundreds of similar well i had this idea once for stories and a lot of them will come from when they were teens or twenty somethings very few of them have even a tiny kernel of truth   now granted most of them will not talk about having applied for a patent but than again most of them did n't have an father who was a well connected lawyer either   gt;he could reason and understand about technology its potential and its impact in a way that a lot of ceo 's at the time could n't   actually all of the evidence is that he was essentially clueless about even rather basic technology in the extreme   as the apple ceo he was a fish out of water but given that the advertising amp pr people had already once done the let 's dress up our ceo as a technical visionary with jobs they simply did their best to repeat the same thing with even less basis in reality with sculley   and of course subsequently he 's been on and trying to capitalize on that bullshit ever since   he probably should have just gone back to the beverage amp advertising world but by then i think he had begun to believe his own pr myth and his ego just would n't allow for admitting the truth

it seems that you 're asking for a legal tax advice and i vote to close the question as off topic for that this is not the place but on the second thought i will share some of the ideas i have provided of course that you will not consider them as any sort of tax advice whatsoever and will not rely on it for any tax planning without verifying with a licensed professional taking 401k money out just like that means that you are going to pay your taxes on that money plus additional 10 penalty as @joetaxpayer said this rarely makes economic sense however taking 401 k money out to pay your medical bills which would otherwise be deductible pay attention to the nuances does n't trigger the penalty it looks like in your case you might unfortunately have a chance to use this provision another case when you can withdraw money without penalty is disability which according to what you describe is unfortunately a situation you 're very likely to find yourself in also you can withdraw funds as income for a substantial period of time and under certain conditions it will not be subject to the 10 penalty of course leaving it to the beneficiaries as mentioned by others is another and very valid option see publication 575 for specific details and be sure to consult a tax professional before doing anything

the reason that stock buybacks are not considered insider trading is because the offers are open to all on equal terms to everyone outside the company even if the company knows inside information it 's not supposed to tell it and company executives are not allowed to tender shares unless they had previously set up a blind selling program on if that 's actually the case no one investor is better informed than another and hence there is no insider trading the issue of inside trading is that insiders are better informed

some thoughts on your questions in order duration you might want to look at the longest dated option often a leap for a couple reasons one is that transaction costs spread plus commission especially spread are killer on options so a longer option means fewer transactions since you do n't have to keep rolling the option two is that any fundamentals based views on stocks might tend to require 3 5 years to relatively reliably work out so if you 're a fundamental investor a 3 6 month option is n't great over 3 6 months momentum short term news short etc can often dominate fundamentals in determining the price one exception is if you just want to hedge a short term event such as a pending announcement on drug approval or something and then you would buy the shortest option that still expires after the event but options are usually super expensive when they span an event like this strike strike price on a long option can be thought of as a tradeoff between the max loss and minimizing insurance costs that is if you buy a deeply in the money put or call the time value will be minimal and thus you are n't paying so much for insurance but you may have 1/3 or 1/2 of the value of the underlying tied up in the option and subject to loss if you buy a put or call at the money then you might have only say 10 of the value of the underlying tied up in the option and subject to loss but almost the whole 10 may be time value insurance cost so you are losing 10 if the underlying stock price stays flat i think of the deep in the money options as similar to buying stocks on margin but the implied interest costs may be less than consumer margin borrowing rates and for long options you ca n't get a margin call the at the money options are more like buying insurance and it 's expensive the commissions and spreads add significant cost on top of the natural time value cost of the option the annual costs would generally exceed the long run average return on a diversified stock fund which is daunting undervalued overvalued options pt 1 first thing is to be sure the options prices on a given underlying make sense at all there are things that should hold for example a synthetic long or short should match up to an actual long or short these kinds of rules can break for example on linkedin after its ipo when shorting was not permitted the synthetic long was quite a bit cheaper than a real long usually though this happens because the arbitrage is not practical for example on the shares to short were n't really available so people doing synthetic shorts with options were driving up the price of the synthetic short and down the price of the synthetic long if you did actually want to be long the stock then the synthetic long was a great deal however a riskless arbitrage buy synthetic long short the stock was not possible and that 's why the prices were messed up another basic relationship that should hold is put call parity undervalued overvalued options pt 2 assuming the relationship to the underlying is sane synthetic positions equivalent to actual positions then the valuation of the option could focus on volatility that is the time value of the option implies the stock will move a certain amount if the time value is high and you think the stock wo n't move much you might short the option while if the time value is low and you think the stock will move a lot you might buy the option you can get implied volatility from your broker perhaps or for example has a bunch of data on option prices and the implied components of the price model i do n't know how useful this really is though the spreads on options are so wide that making money on predicting volatility better than the market is pretty darn hard that is the spread probably exceeds the amount of the mispricing the price of the underlying is more important to the value of an option than the assumed volatility how many contracts each contract is 100 shares so you just match that up if you want to hedge 100 shares buy one contract to get the notional value of the underlying multiply by 100 so say you buy a call for $ 30 and the stock is trading at $ 100 then you have a call on 100 shares which are currently priced at $ 10,000 and the option will cost $ 30 you are leveraged about 3 to 1 this points to an issue with options for individual investors which is that one contract is a pretty large notional value relative to most portfolios

cat has always had plants in il hq is in grew up there several members of my family work for them and plants all over the place canada probably had other things going against it at the time they pulled out depending on the timing it 's quite likely that the exchange rate had shifted such that even without a raise the workers were effectively costing the company considerably more   articles like that seem to leave out all sorts of details for instance i only saw one point where salary was increased and it was n't anywhere near a 60 increase more like 15 which is n't entirely unheard of there 's also what looks like a one time cash payment bonus for a good year 3 4x salary is n't unheard of in executive bonus land it 's also highly variable and not guaranteed year to year the rest would be in stocks and options the trick there is that the amounts of those were probably determined when he signed his contract the reason it makes for a big raise is because the stock price has gone up though it 's down nearly 20 over the last month may kinda sucked for the stock market   you also need to look at whether the profits are higher because of higher volume and possibly more workers better margins better deployment of capital etc and when there 's talk about asking worker to pay more for their health care is it more as a raw dollar amount or more as a percentage of the health care costs as to defined benefit pensions personally i 'd rather have a 401k the problem with defined benefit pensions is that you 're tied to that company for life put in your 40 years and then retire with 80 pay or whatever it is leave after 4 or 5 and you 've pretty much got nothing with a 401k leave after 4 or 5 and you have what you 've put away + what the company matched

i do n't see a tag for united states so i 'm having to assume this is us taxes   it does n't matter what app you use irs trades are all calculated the same first you have to report each trade on a 8949 and from that the totals go into a schedule d.   short term trades are stocks that you 've kept exactly one year or less long term trades are for 1 year + 1 day or more   trades where you sold a stock for a loss then bought that stock back again under 30 days do n't get to count as a loss   this only affects realized capital gains and losses you do n't count fees first take all of your short term gains then offset them by all of your short term losses   do the same for long term gains and losses   short and long term gains are taxed at different rates   you can deduct losses from short term to your long term and vice versa   then you can deduct the total losses up to $ 3000 household $ 1500 married filing separately per year on your regular income taxes or other dividend taxes   if you have over $ 3000 in losses then you need to carry that over to subsequent years edited per dave 's comments thanks dave

as you pointed out in reference to cost cutting fiduciary lawsuits come out when things go wrong when directors successfully increase stock value everyone including shareholders is happy    i 'm not sure exactly where the best place is to look for such cases but here 's what my google fu yielded   example the media business excerpts from ruling in paramount paramount is sold to viacom at a lower price than 's offer shareholders sue paramount claims they were looking out for long term but shareholders sued them for screwing them out of maximal share value   example law on the fiduciary duty of directors to maximize the wealth of corporate dodge v. ford motor co ford had a majority share in his company and wanted to stop paying dividends to shareholders so he could expand his business at trial ford testified to his belief that the company made too much money and had an obligation to benefit the public and the firm ’s workers and customers the court disagreed as his motor company was set up for profit not charity ford was ordered to resume paying dividends   interestingly i found many more lawsuits where corporations sacrificed long term for short term it seems once incorporated this is where the internal incentives and pressures lead many managers lawsuits are merely one of these pressures

i would like to bring up some slightly different points than the ones raised in the excellent answers from joetaxpayer and littleadv   the estate can be the beneficiary of an ira indeed as has been pointed out this is the default beneficiary if the owner does not specify a beneficiary but a testamentary trust can not be the designated   beneficiary of an ira a testamentary trust that meets the requirements laid out on page 36 of publication 590 is essentially a pass through   entity that takes distributions from the ira and passes them on to the beneficiaries    for the case being considered here of minor beneficiaries the distributions from the   ira that pass through   the trust must be sent to the legal or other custodians of the minors utma accounts and said must invest these sums for the benefit of the minors and hand the monies over when the minors reach adulthood minors are not responsible for their support and so these monies can not be used by the legal guardian for the minors living expenses except as provided for in the utma regulations when the minors become adults they get all the accumulated value on their utma accounts and can start taking   the rmds personally after that and blowing them on motorcycles if they wish   thus the advantage of the testamentary trust is essentially that it lets the trustee of the trust to decide how much money over and above the rmd gets distributed each year   the minors and soon to be young adults can not take the entire ira in a lump sum etc but must abide by the testamentary trustee 's ideas of whether extra money over and above the rmd should be taken out   in any given year how much discretion is allowed to the trustee is also something to be thought through carefully but at least the rmd must be taken from the ira and distributed to the minors utma accounts or to the persons as they reach adulthood each year   regardless of whether the traditional ira goes to beneficiaries   directly or through a testamentary trust its value as of the date of death is still included in the estate and estate tax   might be due however beneficiaries can deduct the portion of estate tax paid by the estate from the income tax that they have to pay on the ira withdrawals estate planning is very tricky business and even lawyers very competent in estate and trust issues fall far short in their understanding of tax law especially income tax law

the company gets the proceeds from the sales of shares on the open market if a company is selling 1,000,000 shares at $ then they will receive $ from the underwriter minus some fees that the underwriter will collect the part that ties into valuation is to consider what percentage is the company selling of itself that is coming from its own holdings if the company is putting out 10 of its shares in the ipo from treasury holdings on a $ 10b valuation then it will get $ 1b minus the fees i 'd suspect where i worked in late 1990s early 2000s had an ipo where the underwriter did a bridge loan and the ipo so that the company did n't get all the money raised but did get enough to run operations for a while before ending operations public offering notes that after an ipo other offerings would be called seasoned equity offering that may or may not be as they could come from new or existing shares

starting with small amount of money is definitely a good idea as it is a fact that majority of the online traders lose their initial investment no wonder that for example in the uk fca decided to make steps to raise the chances of clients staying in business by limiting leverage to and trading leveraged products is risky and you will lose some or all your money with very high chance but that does n't mean necessarily it is a bad investment to trade on your own imagine you have a $ 1000 account and you trade max lot fx position at once maximum = $ 10.000 position size that is 1:10 leverage max beginner steps are very challenging and exiting but turning back to your initial question is there a better way to invest with a small amount of money obviously you could purchase a cheap etf that follows a broad market index or an already existing successful portfolio

apply for a secured credit card several financial institutions provide these including most banks gives you a way to search filter for these cards quite easily   you will need to deposit funds to cover your credit limit   deposit as much as they allow i believe it is   pay for everything with the card   monitor your balance due and keep paying it off to bring the balance due down so you can continue using your card i know you mentioned your area requires you to be 19 not sure if that still applies if you are applying online in another state also there 's no real reason to get a card with an annual fee in this case the main reason for an annual fee would be a lower interest charge simply do n't get charged interest and you 'll be better off with not having to pay for a card annually good luck

for child benefit but apparently if i do that then my wife will stop getting the automatic national insurance stamp each year and will lose years of state pension you probably got this wrong according to citizen 's advice you can choose not to receive any child benefit if you do n't want to pay the extra tax however hmrc is encouraging you to still fill out a child benefit claim form even if you choose not to actually receive any child benefit payments from them this is because filling your claim form for child benefit can help you build up national insurance credits which can help protect your future state pension this is particularly important if you 've stopped work to look after children full time it can also help protect your entitlement to other benefits such as guardian 's allowance and ensure your child is automatically issued with a national insurance number before their 16th birthday completing a child benefit claim form will make it easier for payments to start again if your circumstances change and your income falls below the £ 50,000 limit as for self assessment if you decide to continue getting child benefit you 'll have to fill in a self assessment tax return this is when you 'll have to declare you were getting child benefit and pay the extra tax known as the high income child benefit charge you 'll have to register for self assessment if you are not already registered you can choose to pay the tax charge either the following is important    it is your responsibility to pay the extra tax even if you do n't hear from hmrc source

both of these terms do refer to your profit they 're just different ways of evaluating it first your definition of capitalization rate is flipped   as explained here it should be on the other hand as explained here so cap rate is like a reverse unit cost approach to comparing two investments   if house a costs $ 1 m and you 'll make $ 50 k profit from it yearly and house b costs $ 1.33 m and you 'll make $ 65 k profit from it yearly then you can compute cap rates to see that a is a more efficient investment from the point of view of income vs. amount of money you have stuck in this investment and unavailable for use elsewhere profit margin on the other hand cares more about your ongoing expenses than about your total investment   if it costs less to maintain property b than it does to maintain property a then you could have something like so b is a more efficient investment from the point of view of the fraction of your revenue you actually get to keep each year certainly you could think of the property 's value as an opportunity cost and factor that into the net profit margin equation to get a more robust estimate of exactly how efficient your investment is   you can keep piling more factors into the equation until you 've accounted for every possible facet of your investment   this is what accountants and economists spend their days doing

your assumptions are flawed or miss crucial details an employer sponsored 401k typically limits the choices of investments whereas an ira typically gives you self directed investment choices at a brokerage house or through a bank account you are correct in noticing that you are limited in making your own pre tax contributions to a traditional ira in many circumstances when you also have an employer sponsored 401k but you miss the massive benefit you have you can rollover unlimited amounts from a traditional 401k to a traditional ira this is a benefit that far exceeds the capabilities of someone without a traditional 401k who is subject to the ira contribution limits your rollover capabilities completely gets around any statutory contribution limit you can contribution at time of writing $ 18,000 annually to a 401k from salary deferrals and an additional $ 35,000 from employer contributions for a maximum of $ 53,000 annually and roll that same $ 53,000 into an ira if you so desired that is a factor this should be with the borrowing capabilities of a 401k which vastly exceeds an ira again the main rebuttal to your assumptions is that you are not necessarily paying taxes to fund an ira

typically as an individual you ca n't just decide you want to lend out some securities there is a lot of legalities that must take place in order to engage in such a transaction it 's a regulated industry and the contractual obligations that exist between borrower and seller are taken care of ahead of time by the broker with their client prior to any actual transaction taking place i say typically becuase i 'm guessing that if you are a large enough client and own a substantial block of shares i really mean a lot you may be in the unique position of being able to lend out i 'm not sure what the logistics of this would look like but i think the brokerage house would approach you and negotiate a borrowing rate in that situation you may negotiate lending to the the brokerage house and not necessarily directly to the borrower

debit cards with the visa or mastercard symbol on them work technically everywhere where credit cards work there are some limitations where the respective business does not accept them for example car rentals want a credit card for potential extra charges but most of the time for day to day shopping and dining debit cards work fine however you should read up the potential risks a credit card gives you some security by incorrect fraudulent charges from your account and credit card companies also help you reverse incorrect charges before you ever have to pay for it if you use a debit card it is your money on the line immediately any incorrect charge even takes your money from your account and it is gone while you work on reversing the charge any theft and your account can be cleaned out and you will be without money while you go after the thief many people consider the debit card risk too high and do n't use them for this reason however many people do use them it is up to you

gt upfront investment cost to create a contemporary business is challenging today and this is before a firm anticipation of the cost of labour declining in developed nations    yes today   but i think part of this future is where these costs come down due to advanced technology   look at 3d printing as an example   it 's new and expensive now but when these things are $ 99 at staples and capable of printing high quality plastic parts you essentially give every single person the ability to buy a cheap factory for his home   this helps greatly distribute and the means of production and possibly even get around copyright and with open source like   this is how i see the future in the world described in the video   cheap advanced technology that replaces human labor   when the cost of a labor robot is in the price range of 90 of the public you wo n't have to work   every human will have robots working on their behalf   i think the video warns of a future where these robots exist but they 're only owned by the rich   i think that 's the wrong prediction   that is n't how technology works   they even go over that in the video   how computers every year get cheaper and more powerful   same goes with 3d printing they get more powerful and cheaper by the day   same will go for labor robots   so it 's not that every person is going to have to operate their own small business though it will probably increase entrepreneurship which is a great thing it just means that each individual will have the means to produce without actually laboring

whatever you choose for a remedy my first impulse is to suggest bankruptcy you should protect your retirement plans   these are immune from most collection actions the exception being govt debts e.g. taxes and student loans   the sad part is that the student loans wo n't go away except by paying them off   miss one payment and it will you for 10 years   bankruptcy will stop you from getting a home loan for only two years   unless you have the discipline to live like a monk for a decade it sounds like you 're headed for a train wreck   the kids will have to cut back to junior college or some other method of reducing costs and as hard as it sounds do n't cosign for any more student loans kids are more resilient than you think and they 'll probably come up with their own solutions like scholarships work study and off campus jobs   i hate to keep beating the bankruptcy horse but at least that way you could still keep your house and car   otherwise you risk losing either or both from missed payments   i actually hope that you can avoid bankruptcy so i suggest first you talk to a financial adviser or bankruptcy attorney to see if this is in fact right for you but if it 's just the shame of the letter b then consider that pride does n't keep a roof over your head or food in your belly

your math is correct as you point out because of the property of multiplication roth and traditional iras offer the same terminal wealth if your tax rate is the same when you pull it out as when you put it in   roth does lock in your tax rate as of today as you point out which is why it frequently does not maximize wealth most of us have a higher tax bracket when we are saving than when we are withdrawing from savings there are a few other potential considerations advantages of a roth roth and traditional iras have the same maximum contribution amount   this means the effective amount you can contribute to a roth is higher $ 5,500 after tax instead of before   if this constraint is binding for you and you do n't expect your tax rate to change roth is better roth iras allow you to withdraw your contributed money not the gains at any time without any tax or penalty whatsoever   this can be an advantage to some who would like to use it for something like a down payment instead of keeping it all the way to retirement   in this sense the roth is more flexible as your income becomes high the deductibility of traditional ira contributions goes to zero if you have a 401(k at work you can still contribute but ca n't deduct contributions   at high incomes you also may be disallowed from contributing to a roth but because of the backdoor roth loophole you can make roth contributions at any income level and preserve the full roth tax advantage which type of account is better for any given person is a complex problem with several unknowns like future tax rates   however because tax rates are generally higher when earning money for most people who can contribute to them traditional iras maximize your tax savings and therefore wealth edit note that traditional ira contributions also reduce your agi which is used to compute eligibility for other tax advantages like the child care tax credit and earned income credit   agi is also often used for state income tax calculation in retirement traditional ira distributions may or may not be state taxable depending on your state and circumstances

there are many considerations before deciding on the best place for your funds how liquid do you need the funds to be    if this is for an emergency fund i would keep at least some in an account that you have instant access to   what is your risk volatility tolerance would you be ok with the value dropping by as much as 30 in a year knowing that over time you 'll probably earn 8 12 on it   if not then equity funds or other stock investments are probably not the best move for you do you need the funds now or are they for long term retirement savings are you eligible to fund an ira that would defer your taxes until you withdraw the funds from the account but there are age restrictions that you must heed to avoid penalties are cds a good idea they do pay decent interest but in return for that you lock up your funds for a set period of time   all that to say that there are many facets to determining the best place for your funds   if you provide more specifics you can get a more specific answer

you should definitely favor holding bonds in tax advantaged accounts because bonds are not tax efficient the reason is that more of their value comes in the form of regular periodic distributions rather than an increase in value as is the case with stocks or stock funds with stocks you can choose to realize all that appreciation when it is most advantageous for you from a tax perspective additionally stock dividends often receive lower tax rates for much more detail see tax efficient fund placement

this is n't the movies killing someone 's family to pressure them into doing something for you is one thing but that tactic does n't work when you 're trying to get someone to give you something they do n't have let 's say they kill his daughter or brother or parents what then how is he going to magically raise $ 3 m go to a bank ask a friend tell the police btw i find it interesting that his partner in that company was a police chief it 's not like he had the money but was just hiding it either he simply had no way of paying and they knew it they probably worked with him for a while to get paid back and he could n't get it done maybe even tried gambling as the last option some other loan shark sure as hell is n't going to give you a loan to cover the loan you already ca n't pay back they basically got fed up and decided to punish him by taking his life   keep in mind him being killed bc of debt is purely my suspicion it could 've just been some random murder is n't the safest of places

pros cons before the housing bubble the conventional wisdom was to buy as much home as you could afford thereby borrowing as much you can afford   because variable rates lead to lower mortgages they were preferred by many as you could buy more house    this of course lead to many people losing their home and many thousands of dollars a bubble is not necessary to trigger a chain of events that can lead to loss of a home   if an interest only borrower is late on a payment this often triggers a rate increase   couple that with some other things that can happen negatively and you are up $ hit 's creek imo it is not wise

first of all dilip 's answer explains well how the business deductions generally work for most big expenses you depreciate it however in some cases you need to capitalize it which is another accounting method when you capitalize your expense it becomes part of the basis of the product you 're creating since you 're an engineer this might be relevant for you talk to your tax adviser how exactly you deduct depreciate capitalize things and what expense goes which way depends greatly on the laws and jurisdictions even in the us different states have different laws and the irs and state laws do n't have to conform unfortunately for example the limitations on sec 179 deduction in 2010 2011 were 20 times higher on federal level than in the state of california this could have lead to cases where you fully deducted your expense on your federal tax return but need to continue and depreciate it on your state return or vice versa good tax adviser is crucial to avoid or manage these cases

if the market rate and coupon were equal the bond would be valued at face value by definition not 100 true but this is an exercise and that would be tangent to this discussion   since the market rate is higher than the coupon rate the value i am willing to pay drops a bit so my return is the same as the market rate   this can be done by hand a time value of money calculation for each payment discount by the years till received at the market rate to get the present value for each payment and sum up the numbers   the other way is to use a finance calculator and solve for rate   the final payment of $ 10,000 ignore final coupon just now is $ ^ 5 in other words that single chunk of cash is worth 10 less if it 's one year away if 2 years away etc   draw a timetable with each payment and divide by 1.1 for each year it 's away from present if the 9 coupon is really 4.5 twice a year it 's $ 450 in 6 month intervals and each 6 mo interval is really 5 you discount   short durations like this can be done by hand a 30 year bond with twice a year payments is a pain   welcome to money se

the government could actually do either one to expand the money supply as necessary to keep up with rising productivity an increased labor supply   the question is merely political in the case of the us printing money involves convincing politicians to spend it   while we currently run a deficit there is a large lobby within the us who are incredibly anti deficit and are fighting against this for no good reason   if the money supply were left in their hands we would end up with a shrinking money supply and rapid deflation on the other hand the fed can simply bypass the politicians and control the money supply directly by issuing bonds   it 's easier for them they do n't have to explain it to voters only to economists and it gives them more direct control without any messy political considerations like which programs to expand or cut

a credit card is a way to borrow money that 's all sometimes the loans are very small $ 5 and sometimes they are larger you can have a credit card with a company bank or whatever that you have no other relationship with they 're not a property of a bank account they are their own thing the card you describe sounds exactly like a debit card here and you can treat your canadian debit card like your french credit card you pay for things directly from your bank account assuming the money is in there in canada many small stores take debit but not credit so do be sure to get a debit card and not only a credit card now as to your specific concerns you are n't going to forget to make a wire you 're going to get a bill perhaps a paper one perhaps an email and it will say here is everything you charged on your credit card this month along with a date which will be perhaps 21 days from the statement date not the date you used the card pay the entire balance not just the minimum payment by that date and you 'll pay no interest the bill date will be a specific date each month eg the 23rd so you can set yourself a reminder to check and pay your bill once a month building a credit history has value if you want to borrow a larger amount of money to buy a car or a house or to start a business unlike the us it does n't really have an impact on things like getting a job if you use your card for groceries you use it enough no worries in 5 years it is nice to look back and see never paid late mostly paid the entire amount each month never went over limit never went into collections and so on in my experience you can tell they like you because they keep raising your limit without you asking them to if you want to buy a $ 2500 item and your credit limit is $ 1500 you could prepay $ 1000 onto the credit card and then use it or you could tell the vendor you 'd rather use your debit card or you could pay $ 1500 on the credit card and then rest with your debit card lots of options in my experience once you get up to that kind of money they 'd rather not use a credit card because of the merchant fees they pay

typically your statement will break down each of the balances that carry a different rate so you 'll see them lumped into the 0 line or two separates lines with different rates for each if you do n't see it on the statement a quick call to your bank should clarify it for you if i had to guess i would lean towards the fee likely being at 0 also but if it is n't typically you would pay the minimum + $ 350 on your next statement because only amounts over the minimum go towards principal of the highest rates first at least this is true in the us for personal accounts of course this is something your bank should be able to clarify as well balance transfer tip i always recommend setting up automatic payments when you take advantage of a balance transfer offer the reason is oftentimes buried deeply in the terms and conditions is an evil phrase which says that if you miss a payment they have the right to revoke the promotional rate and start charging you a higher rate that would be bad enough if it happened but to make things worse i believe the fee you paid for the transfer is not returned to you so set up an auto payment each month for at least the minimum payment and if you can afford it divide the total transferred by the number of months and pay that amount each month assuming you do n't pay interest on the fee $ 17,500 1.02 18 = $ month that way you 'll have it paid off just in time to not have any higher interest when the promotional rate expires if you do n't know if you can afford the higher amount each month set it to the max you know for sure you can afford and make additional payments whenever you can

whether it is better to buy or to rent depends on several factors   most of them are fairly uncertain but calculations can be made to see how they play out in the long term for insight into their impact the results below are made on the basis that both the buyer and the tenant spend the same amount in this case $ per month   the buyer pays his mortgage and when it 's all paid for he switches to investing $ per month at the fund deposit rate   meanwhile the tenant pays rent and invests whatever remains from $ per month at the fund deposit rate the amount $ is set by the mortgage case and used by buyer and tenant for equal comparison taking some hopefully not too unrealistic rate estimates these are the calculation all percentages are expressed as effective annual rates plot of buyer 's and tenant 's accumulated assets over time the simulation extends for twice the term of the mortgage   if the investment fund can return 7 and a $ 900 rental is comparable to a $ 300,000 house then there is n't much of a compelling case either way lowering the expected fund return shows a different picture   sticking with the fund return lowering the rent brings the tenant 's asset accumulation closer to the buyer 's   if there is a particular set of inputs you would like to see plotted i 'm sure i could add another example to this post there is also an interactive version of the calculation which you can find via this page   however unlike the examples above which include a deposit and grant it just explores the simple case of a 100 mortgage the aim is just to see how rate variations affect asset value over time

it 's best to roll over a pension plan you do n't want to pay the penalties especially when you are young rolling over into another scheme or rolling over into a scheme that is somewhat self directed would avoid the penalty and could help you achieve higher returns should you feel you will perform better making regular monthly or biweekly contributions is imperative so that you catch compounded returns on your investments since you state that you are inexperienced i would suggest rolling over into the new scheme and sitting with the pension advisor for the company ie etc telling them some key information like your age in how many years you expect to retire your current income your desired pension income per year and such will greatly help them ensure that you come as close to your goal as possible providing nothing horrendous happens in the market

bit hesitant to put this in an answer as i do n't know if specific investment advice is appropriate but this has grown way too long for a comment the typical answer given for people who do n't have the time experience knowledge or inclination to pick specific stocks to hold should instead invest in etfs exchange traded index funds what these basically do is attempt to simulate a particular market or stock exchange an s&p 500 index fund will generally attempt to hold shares in the stocks that make up that index they only have to follow an index not try to beat it so are called passively managed they have very low expense ratios far below 1 and are considered a good choice for investors who want to hold stock without significant effort or expense and who 's main goal is time in the market it 's a contentious topic but on average an index and therefore an index fund will go even with or outperform most actively managed funds with a sufficiently long investment horizon which you have these may be ideal for you trading in etfs is also typically cheap because they are traded like stock there are plenty of low fee online brokers and virtually all will allow trading in etfs my broker even has a list of several hundred popular etfs that can be traded for free   the golden rule in investing is that you should never buy into something you do n't understand do n't buy individual stock with little information it 's often little more than gambling the same goes for trading platforms like do n't use them unless you know their business model and what they stand to gain from your custom as mentioned i can trade certain funds for free with my broker but i know why they can offer that and how they 're still making money

as proposed buy 100 oz of gold at $ spot = sell 1 aug 2014 future for $ = $ profit $ 1,600 alternative risk free investment 1 year cd 1 would earn $ on $ investment rate from ads on real profit all you are really being paid for this trade is the difference between the   profit $ 1,600 and the opportunity for $ in risk free earnings   that 's only $ 360 or around    pitfalls of trying to do this many retail futures brokers are set up for speculative traders and do not want to deal with customers selling contracts against delivery or buying for delivery if you are a trader you have to keep margin money on deposit   this can be a t note at some brokerages but currently t notes pay almost 0    if the price of gold rises and you are short a future in gold then you need to deposit more margin money   if gold went back up to $ that could be $   if you need to borrow this money the interest will eat into a very slim profit margin over the risk free rate    since you ca n't deliver the trades have to be reversed   although futures trades have cheap commissions the bid ask spread even at 1 grid is not so minimal   also there is often noisy in the price   the spot market in physical gold may have a higher bid ask spread you might be able to eliminate some of these issues by trading as a or for delivery   good luck finding a broker to let you do this but the issue here for gold is that you 'd need to trade in depository receipts for gold that is acceptable for delivery instead of trading physical gold   to deliver physical gold it would likely have to be tested and certified which costs money by the time you 've researched this you 'll either discover some more costs associated with it or could have spent your time making more money elsewhere

wow where to start   your ad hominem attack was when you shifted away from the discussion and started questioning me on whether or not i had been around low skilled workers and even going as far as to give a judgment on if was around average people the definition is of an argument or reaction directed against a person rather than the position they are maintaining you went away from the topic and instead directed your argument at me which has nothing to do with my position on minimum wage you seek to discredit me as to say my views are invalid because in your opinion i have n't had enough experience with low skill workers it does n't matter if i have or had n't one 's experience or lack thereof with low skilled workers does n't make their position any more wrong or right this is a textbook example of ad hominem   your straw man was when you shifted the position to suggest things i did n't say in order to argue against them the definition is an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent 's real argument you say i assumed things i never even mentioned such as your claim that i would say rich people did n't earn their success and that poor people were not at fault for their low achievement once again no where did i suggest this and this suggestion by you away from my argument on paying people a live able wage basically one could say this was brought up by you to argue about something you felt would be easier to defeat   there were clear reasons i threw those fallacies out you tell me i do n't know what i 'm talking about yet you do n't even get it right and overlook everything that was stated smh   your whole response keeps proving my point once again you are so focused on whether i 've had experience working with or managing people nice goal post moving btw as if that makes your position more qualified ad hominem again when the reality is i can have a rational thought about something by reading up on logical and rational positions on this and seeing what the statistics and research say oh by the way i have had multiple economics classes in college did you i read up and studied this stuff and my tests and papers on it so now what does my collegiate backed economics understanding now outweigh the fact you just simply hired some low skilled workers   there are many topics out there you and i have no experience with but we can have a well thought out position on them because we talk to experts and read up on the research let me restate this again just because you have more experience with low skill labor does not make you any more qualified over me to have a smart logical and rational understanding of the effects of raising the minimum wage the same with the fact that just because i probably have had more collegiate studies on economics than you it does n't mean my position is any more right than yours or someone else 's   gt;you read a study that is incredibly biased and take it to the grave   this gave me a laugh because it 's the equivalent of your arguments do n't agree with mine so clearly your 's is the biased one dude we all are biased and stand for things you are just as biased as me i do n't have to give equal time to every position out there as if both are equal it 's often a false equivalence to do so anyways for example the idea that we should not raise minimum wage more because poor people are lazy and undeserving does not deserve the same consideration as inflation has caused the purchasing power of workers on the minimum wage to decrease to levels where they can not afford to live and thus now must seek out tax payer backed public assistance programs in order to make ends meet so a solution would be to raise the minimum wage   last your argument against raising the minimum wage comes down to i do n't think they deserve it because some people do n't work hard and my response is i do n't give a shit if someone works that job no matter how low skilled it is they deserve to be paid at a level that is live able other than that it 's their fault if they do n't do a good job and get fired   have you ever considered why the minimum wage came about in the first place it was to keep businesses in check because they were taking advantage of people and paying them poor wages wages were so low that some would argue they were technically slave wages yet as inflation rises and the purchasing power falls instead of bumping those wages back up people like you sit there and are like nah they are lazy and do n't deserve it trust me i know a guy that 's lazy that works those jobs he 's dumb too and does n't have a high school diploma you argument one again is just attacking their character with no consideration of statistical analysis and the economic effect of a change in the minimum wage    now to step away from the whole argument you and i have different values you do n't value people at low skilled levels as if their job is almost worthless yet you need them for your business sure you smile and say hello to the guy that brings you your burger or your coffee but the reality is you mostly do n't care about him in your mind if he only makes $ 7.25 then you have the right to assume that he does n't work hard and is undeserving of proper pay unless he 's proven it in some way to you your mindset is a problem because you are okay with people and then you assume whatever negative traits about them that you can as your justification for it   i do n't give a shit about how many houses have been built in houston or how many painters your friend brought to seattle it 's completely irrelevant to all of this

gave an excellent answer let me add a little analogy here that might help suppose you bought a car from joe 's auto sales you pay your money do all the paperwork and drive your car home the next day joe 's goes bankrupt what affect does that have on your ownership rights to your car the answer is absolutely none same thing with stocks and a stock exchange a stock exchange is basically just a store where you can buy stock once you buy it it 's yours that said there could potentially be a problem with record keeping if you bought a car from joe 's auto sales and joe went out of business before sending the registration paperwork to the state you might find that the state has no record that you legally own the car and you could have difficulty proving it likewise if a stock exchange went out of business without getting all their records properly updated their might be an issue actually i think the bigger concern here for most folks would be their broker and not the stock exchange as your broker is the one who keeps the records of what stocks you own long term in practice though most companies are responsible enough to clean up their paperwork properly when they go out of business and if they do n't a successor company or government regulators or someone will try to clean it all up

you 'd be mistaken to this there is any morality involved in most corporations neither positive nor negative running a business is amoral some business missions have a moral intent such as pharmaceuticals health organization etc but all have an amoral   it 's fairly simplistic the purpose of a business is to produce a profit at some point all successful well functioning businesses will work down their list of ways to produce a profit after they 've established market share a lasting brand customer loyalty finances well in the black and eventually look towards capital preservation in most bodies with a large monetary wealth capital preservation becomes a key focus in other words once you master the art of making money you then need to master the art of keeping it   thus the ability to then focus on these things to continue to just pay taxes is like running an efficient but leaky ship the more you preserve the longer you 'll be around and the more power you 'll yield to stick around    this last point is also important to keep in mind unlike you or i a company will basically last forever well at least until society collapses you or i are only here until we die and whatever wealth we have we may try to preserve for our kids or next of kin a corporation is always here the people in the corporation amp it 's owners change hands but the corporation survives frankly any business that is n't aiming to make a profit is either going to fail quickly or is by definition a non profit   here is where i would believe the government plays a balancing role to reign in the power of corporations lest they rival their own but any good corporation will handle that problem as well regulatory capture anyone   also consider that for the most wealthy among us it 's probably not about the money anymore it 's now probably about the game this is certainly where the get that manic edge on the rest of us

couple points 1 since the roth is after tax you can effectively contribute more than you could with the traditional ira before hitting the limits so in your example if you had extra money you wanted to invest in an ira you could invest up to $ more into the roth but only $ 500 more into the traditional current limits are $ 5,500 per year for single filers under 50 your example assumes that you have exactly $ 3,750 in spare money looking for an ira home   2 the contributions but not earnings can be withdrawn from the roth at any time penalty and tax free   3 the tax rate lock in can be significant especially early on when you are at a relatively low tax bracket say 15 but expect to be higher at retirement   4 traditional iras and 401(k are taxed as ordinary income so you go through the tax brackets even if the marginal rate is 25 the effective rate may be lower if you have a roth conceivably you could reduce the amount you need to withdrawal from the trad to reduce the effective tax rate on those of course subject to minimum distributions and all that this is more an argument to have a mix of pre- and post tax retirement accounts than strictly a pro roth reason

when the index is altered to include new players exclude old ones the fund also adjusts the largest and i would say most important index funds are whole market funds like all world ex us or vt total world stock or all japan   and similarly for bonds reits etc   so companies do n't leave or enter these indexes very often and when they do by an initial offering or bankruptcy it is often at a pretty small value some older indices like the djia are a bit more arbitrary but these are generally not things that index funds would try to match more narrow sector or country indices can have more of this effect and i believe some investors have made a living from index arbitrage   however well run index funds do n't need to just blindly play along with this you need to remember that an index fund does n't need to hold precisely every company in the index they just need to sample such that they will perform very similarly to the index   the largest company in the s&p 500 is not likely to have all that much of an effect on the overall performance of the index and it 's likely to be fairly correlated to other companies in similar sectors which are also covered by the index   so if there is a bit of churn around the bottom of the index it does n't necessarily mean the fund needs to be buying and selling on each transition   if i recall correctly it 's been shown that holding about 250 stocks gives you a very good match with the entire us stock market

buying a car is a very big financial decision   there are three major factors to decide which car to buy pick two because you ca n't have all three   you can either have a reliable car that has cheap running costs but will be expensive to buy or a cheap car that is unreliable   if you are mechanically minded then reliability might not be that important to you   however if you must get to work on time every day then owning a car that breaks down once every six months might be something you wish to avoid there are a lot of hidden costs that should be thought about very carefully when considering purchasing a car in my country annual car registration costs are around $ 650   i budget around $ 1000 for maintenance each year a major + minor service and some extra repair work   when i factor in an amount for depreciation that brings the running costs of the car to somewhere between $ 1500 and $ 2000 per annum before i 've driven it anywhere generally i will fill up my car for $ 50 around once a month i do n't drive too often which makes my total cost of ownership somewhere around $ 2500 per annum   when i was driving my car to work daily the petrol costs were much higher at around $ 50 per week which made my somewhere around $ 4500 p.a and this is on an extremely reliable fuel efficient 2006 model car which cost me $ 18k to purchase   i have no debt on this car   but the car itself is a liability   any car will be a liability i understand that petrol prices are ridiculously low in the us and probably registration is lower as well   in this case you will need to adjust your figures and do the maths to work out what your annual cost of ownership will be there are three alternatives to car ownership to consider which may save you money public transportation and car pooling are highly recommended from a financial perspective though you may not have access to either in your situation   moving closer to work may also be an option though for many jobs this may increase your cost of living if you decide that you do need a car and decide that $ 2000 is not going to get you the car you feel you need $ 2000 usually does not get you much you will need to decide how to finance the car you will want to avoid most dealer based finance deals   be very wary of any dealer offering interest free finance as they usually have some pretty nasty conditions getting a loan from your parents or another family member is usually the best option   otherwise consider getting a personal loan which will have a lower interest rate than a credit card or dealer finance another option could be to get a credit card on an interest free promotional deal which you could pay down before the interest kicks in   be warned though these deals usually require you to pay off your whole balance before the due date or they will back charge interest on the whole amount in short these are the decisions that you will need to make

why do banks charge a significantly lesser rate for a 15 yr fixed mortgage than a 30yr though they know it will not earn them the same amount of money   a simplistic model of where banks get the money to lend to borrowers is that they borrow money from investors that want to earn a return on the money that they provide   the actual mechanics of that process are much more complicated but the gist is that if those investors want to tie their money up for a longer period they expect to get a higher return thus 30-year mortgages require a higher interest rate than 15-year mortgages   in addition the usual consensus in the market is that interest rates will rise in the future so interest rates for longer term loans are higher   while it 's true that the bank gets more money overall from a higher rate mortgage the fact that that additional money does n't come until several years into the loan and that money loses value over time due to inflation makes a lower rate 15 year mortgage roughly equivalent to a higher rate 30-year mortgage

it depends on how you place your stop order and the type of stop orders available from your broker if you place a stop market order and the following day the stock opens below your stop your stock will be stopped out at or around the opening price meaning you can potentially end up with quite a large gap if you place a stop limit order say you place your stop at $ 10.00 with a limit price of $ 9.90 and if the price opens below $ 9.90 say at $ 9.50 your limit sell order of $ 9.90 will be placed onto the market but it will not be executed until the price goes back up to $ 9.90 or above the third option is to place a guaranteed stop loss and as specified you are guaranteed your stop price even if the price gaps down below your stop price you will be paying an extra fee for the guaranteed stop loss order and they are usually mainly available with cfd brokers so if you are in the usa you might be out of luck

for starters if you 're not making any money doing something it 's a hobby it sounds like you want to work for the current owners making them money as a hobby if that floats your boat go crazy    show enough motivation and they may offer to sell you the business for $ 1 or some other surprisingly low dollar figure this will seem like a gift worth dropping out of school for but be extremely careful before getting excited    odds are when you take over the business you end up assuming their debts too mortgages rent payments back payroll equipment loans leases and possibly any back late payments from before your takeover     use your first few weeks as an academic study for a school project get a copy of their books find out where the consistent money is and see how to grow that they may be selling games at a loss because their crowd consistently buys enough beer to cover expenses or maybe the money from that stupid crane game covers the electric bill for the whole place because bill has a problem    learn study and ask more for information as payment than cash the only way it make real money is to actually take over ownership of the place so take the long view and build toward that instead of a salaried manager gig or something

there are a lot of good answers above all of them will probably work for you in some way or another one point to note from the procrastination theme is that you could invest your free money that you have currently in some investment instrument which would require you to do some paperwork etc to get out this way the immediate cash flow is decreased and also invested now from each budget save a small amount for the things that you would like to buy give this small savings some months to accumulate so that you can afford only one of the items that you want to buy or target an item that you want to buy after the money is accumulated if you still want to buy the item then you probably should one point of note is that budgeting is also important on a monthly basis pete has provided excellent suggestion in this regard

this is actually a very good point any money that is spent on an employee in excess of the bare minimum required for them to perform their job should be viewed as a component of total rewards you can directly extend op 's logic to any other form of compensation or benefits why let public employees take pto except for when mandated by federal or state law why not target the 10th percentile of the market for all federal jobs why provide employees with retirement benefits the answer to all of the above is that all elements of a total rewards package are necessary to attract retain and develop good employees       i 've done consulting in the sphere of organizational structure design and development i 've seen the type of employees that a bare bones total rewards philosophy attracts and i 'm not sure that i want them working for the public

historical volatility of a stock is going to be based on past performance basically its current trend   that can be useful but really is no indication of how it will perform in the future   especially with a big swing in the market now if you 're talking about implied volatility iv of an options contract that 's a little different   iv is derived from an option ’s price and shows what the market implies about the stock ’s volatility in the future thus it is based on the actions of active traders and market makers   so it gives you a bit more insight into what 's going on but at times has less to do with fundamentals i guess a good way to think of iv based on options contracts is as an educated opinion of the market as a whole with regards to how much that stock could likely move over a period of time options expiration also note that iv represents the potential for a stock to move but it does not forecast direction i do n't know of any studies off the top of my head but i 'm sure there have been plenty

first it 's much safer to be shorting stocks over $ 5 than stocks under $ 5   i use 3 indicators to show that a stock has topped out and about to drop key is the timing cause the initial drop is often the biggest more close you get in at the top the higher the risk using charts only    macd indicator   i use the when it reaches a peak height and the next day it is down 1 step if you wait til the macd lines cross you are pretty late imho   need to get in earlier timing is everything    needs to topped out and above 67 meaning over bought   do not buy when rsi is high above 70 often stocks go on a run up when rsi is over 70    i use rsi or to confirm my status on rsi i like to see that all 3 indicators agree this gives me a 75 chance that the stock will drop it may take a day or 2 so you need patience

gold may have some intrinsic value but it can not be accurately determined by investors by any known valuation techniques in fact if you were to apply the dividend discount model of john williams a variation of which is the basis of discounted cash flow dcf analysis and the basis of most valuation techniques gold would have zero intrinsic value because it produces no cash flow legendary focus investor warren buffett argues that investing in gold is pure speculation because of the reason mentioned above as others have mentioned gold prices are affected by supply and demand but the bigger influence on the price of gold is how the economy is gold is seen as a store of value because according to some it does not lose value unlike paper currency during inflation in inflationary times demand increases so gold prices do go up which is why gold behaves similar to a commodity but has far less uses   it is difficult to argue whether or not gold gains or loses value because we ca n't determine the intrinsic value of gold and anyone who attempts to justify any given price is pulling blinders over your eyes it is that over history gold represents wealth and that in the past century and the last decade gold prices rise in inflationary conditions as people dump dollars for gold and it has fallen when the purchasing power of currency increases many investors have talked about a gold bubble by arguing that gold prices are inflated because of inflation and the fed 's money policy and that once interest rates rise the money supply will contract and gold will fall but again nobody can say with any reasonable accuracy what the fair value of gold at any given point is   this article on seeking alpha gives a quick overview but it is also vague because gold ca n't be accurately priced   i would n't say that gold has zero intrinsic value because gold is not a business so traditional models are inappropriate but i would say that gold certainly does n't have a value of $ 1,500 and it 's propped so high only because of investor expectation   in conclusion i do not believe you can accurately state whether gold is undervalued or overvalued you must make judgments based on what you think about the future of the market and of monetary policy but there are too many variables to be accurate consistently

banks worry that the large gift might be a loan that is ultimately expected to be repaid if so that affects the cash flow of the recipient and makes it more difficult to make the mortgage payments to the bank   in some cases of course it is an informal loan dad advances a large $ x to son to use as a but does not charge interest and the expectation is that the money will be returned in smaller chunks as and when the son can afford to repay dad    in some cases dad truly means it as a gift but son feels an obligation to repay the money if not explicitly then by paying for the first few months of dad 's nursing home stay etc   so banks like to have an explicit document such as a copy of a letter from dad saying that this money is a gift and some assurance that this is on the up and up    if the amount is larger than the maximum gift that can be given each year without having to file a gift tax return then some assurance that a gift tax return will be filed is helpful mentioning this in the letter is good it indicates that there are no secret or secret agreements to the effect that this is in fact a loan with or without regular repayments

seems to me you do n't have a ton of great choices but of them keep going as you are   if when the car becomes unusable without significant expenses stop using it   buy another junker and use that to get by until your loan is paid off   from now until then put aside a few hundred or whatever you can if more each month towards the anticipated purchase   when you do buy this junker pay in cash no loan   just get something that will take you to work and that includes bike if that 's a possibility   when you can sell the no longer usable car to finish paying off the loan start aggressively paying off the current loan with the eye of getting it down to where you 're not underwater anymore   then sell the car and dispose of the loan and buy a better replacement   scrimp and save and cut everything eat cheaply and never out cut your personal expenses everywhere you can   if you get another $ 250 a month towards principal you can probably be no longer underwater in about a year get a personal loan today for the amount that you 're underwater and immediately sell the car   this gets you out of the loan and car the quickest and if you think the car will devalue significantly between now and when you might be not underwater anymore this might be the best option   but it 's the most expensive likely you 'll pay 12 to 20 on the difference   now 12 of $ 5000 is less than 5 of 15000 so it might actually be a good financial deal but you 'll probably have to shop around to get 12 15 with a 660 though it 's probably possible   you 'll still be without a car at this point though so you 'd have to buy another one or live without for a while and you 'd still have a payment of some sort but perhaps a more manageable one $ 5000 12 5 years means something a bit over $ 100 a month for example i recommend that if you can get by without a car for a while option 2 is your best bet   all of these will require some financial care for a while and probably cutting back on expenses for a year or two but realistically you should n't expect anything else   get a budgeting app if it will help see how to do this as far as getting out of the loan without paying it i do n't recommend that at all   your credit will be ruined for at least seven years and 660 is not bad at all really and then would take   yet more years to recover   you will likely be sued for the balance plus collection costs beyond repossession   the consequences would be far far worse than just paying it off and i mean that financially as well as ethically

gt;so i would like to ask you which at this project poor management skill of oracle staffs or plan of oregon are worse to be accused   i believe there is an increased burden on the employer oregon to effectively manage the scope of the work required for the project that the contractor oracle is working   otherwise the contractor has plausible for being able to provide deliver a quality working solution   gt;or do you think that plan was made mainly by oracle   i think the plan was mostly made by oracle with the requirements given by oregon and that 's where things seem messy   my gut tells me though that when an employer hires a contractor for the creation of a fully integrated enterprise system that the employer essentially signs their financial life away to the project in a way that the contractor of indirect or direct damages that come from the result of unforeseen implementation requirements or issues   oracle has been around long enough to know how to legally cover their asses   if there is anything that oregon may have traction on it would be a few of their fraud claims given that oracle has made two wiki with federal agencies of ~$100 amp ~$200 million since 2011 which were from allegations of fraud or false claims   such claims by oregon may be supported by the fact that they allegedly have a former oracle employee who can substantiate the poor quality of the product they were giving to oregon but that blame might go back to oregon 's specifications which i have no insight into   as someone who has witnessed a couple of employer and contractor relationships between public amp private entities my hope out of all of this is that   sales people for contractors think twice before over promising technology solutions that their company ca n't fully deliver on given resource constraints or lack of employer specifications   employers hiring such entities manage them expectations plus the overall project effectively while accepting personal accountability amp responsibility   i think the only people who have a clear picture of what was going on were anyone from either party who were on the front lines of managing the project developing the systems or running them

with regard to your edit although i did n't downvote one way to reduce the security risk is to separate the payment from the ability to drain your account   a considerable part of the security risk is inherent in giving people a number which is directly linked to a bank account where you keep all your money   if you do n't want that risk do n't do that   instead of or in addition to trying to reduce the chance of fraud you can reduce the impact of fraud even if it occurs by not paying for things using the details of an account where you have all your money   trying to protect against fraud while keeping all your money in the account is sort of like carrying around thousands of dollars in cash in your wallet and then worrying about how to defend against robbery   yes you can carry a weapon or hire a but it 's probably simpler to just not carry that much money in the first place you already mentioned one solution with your option 1 which is to just keep a small amount of money in a separate account and use that for online payments   assuming you can easily transfer money in and out of this account via online banking this effectively is what you say you want in your edit you log in to your bank online but rather than informing it you 're about to make a payment you just transfer money in   you 'll probably have to keep a small amount of money in the account to keep it open but if this is an important issue for you that should n't be that big a deal another solution is a credit card   with a credit card you simply make the payment online   in the us if the merchant or someone else stealing the info makes fraudulent charges the credit card company assumes the liability and the consumer suffers only the inconvenience of having to get a new card issued   i do n't know what the uk laws are regarding credit vs. debit fraud but some sites i found seem to suggest that credit cards have fraud protection in the uk as well   this is probably worth looking into if you are concerned about fraud

update unfortunately citibank have removed the standard account option and you have to choose the plus account which requires a minimum monthly deposit of 1800 sterling and two direct debits absolutely there is   i would highly recommend citibank 's plus current account   it 's a completely free bank account available to all uk residents there are no monthly fees and no minimum balance requirements to maintain   almost nobody in the uk has heard of it and i do n't know why because it 's extremely useful for anyone who travels or deals in foreign currency regularly in one online application you can open a sterling current account and deposit accounts in 10 other foreign currencies when i opened mine around 3 years ago you could only open up to 7 accounts at any one time citibank provide a visa card which you can link to any of your multi currency accounts via a phone call to their hotline unfortunately not online which frequently annoys me but i guess you ca n't have everything   for usd and eur you can use it as a visa debit for usd eur purchases for all other currencies you ca n't make debit card transactions but you can make atm withdrawals without incurring an fx conversion best of all for your case a free usd cheque book is also available you can fund the account in sterling and exchange to usd through online banking   the rates are not as good as you would get through an fx broker like xe.com but they 're not terrible either you can also fund the account by usd wire transfer which is free to deposit at citibank but the bank you issue the payment from will likely charge a swift fee so this might not be worth it unless the amount is large enough to justify the fee if by any chance you have a citibank account in the us you can also make free usd transfers in out of this account subject to a daily limit

i would just do a loan for a different number of years on your new mortgage for example if you just spent 10 years paying off your first house then for your second close the first mortgage upon selling and then open a 20 or 25 year mortgage and the loan end date as well as the payment should remain similar this would be more do able if you paid ahead a little to compensate all the early on interest you have to eat so if you want to finish around the same time you could look into doing that since you 'll have more equity to make a stronger down payment

so how is it that american citizens working overseas get taxed but american companies holding profits overseas do n't or foreign companies making profits within the us for that matter i do n't really think we should be protectionist but i do think corporations should be paying a fair share of taxes needed to support infrastructure social and legal framework

i 'm surprised nobody else has suggested this yet before you start investing in stocks or bonds buy a house not just any house but the house you want to live in 20 years from now in a place where you want to live 20 years from now but you also have to be savvy about which part of the country or world you buy in i 'm also assuming that you are in the usa although my suggestion tends to apply equally anywhere in the world why simple as long as you own a house you wo n't ever have to pay rent you do have to pay taxes and maintenance of course you have a guaranteed return on investment and the best part is because it 's not money you earn but money you do n't have to spend it 's tax free even if the house loses value over time you still come out ahead and if you live abroad temporarily you can rent out the house and add the rent to your savings although that does make various things more complicated you only asked for options so that is mine i 'll add some caveats ok now here are the caveats

i 'd suggest you avoid the roth for now and use pretax accounts to get the greatest return i 'd deposit to the 401(k enough to get as much match as permitted then use a traditional ira you should understand how tax brackets work and aim to use pre tax to the extent it helps you avoid the 25 rate if any incremental deposit would be 15 money use roth for that most discussions of the pre tax post tax decision talk about 2 rates that at the time of deposit and time of withdrawal there are decades in between that should n't be ignored if you have any life change a marriage child home purchase etc there 's a chance your marginal bracket drops back down to 15 that 's the time to convert to roth just enough to top off the 15 bracket   last i would n't count on that pension there 's too much time until you retire to count on that income few people stay at one job long enough to collect on the promise of a pension that takes 30 + years to earn and even if you did there 's the real chance the company cancels the plan long before you retire

companies do both quite often   they have opposite effects on the share price but not on the total value to the shareholders   doing both causes value to shareholders to rise ie any un bought back shares now own a larger percentage of the company and are worth more and drops the per share price so it is easier to buy a share of the stock   to some that 's irrelevant but some might want a share of an otherwise expensive stock without paying $ 700 for it as a specific example of this apple appl split its stock in 2014 and also continued a significant buyback program apple announces $ repurchase program oct 2014 apple stock splits in june 2014 this led to their stock in total being worth more but costing substantially less per share

i wo n't repeat what 's already been said but i agree that it 's a good move to take advantage of the free financing so long as you read the fine print carefully keep the money designated to pay off this debt and not use it for anything else and make sure to pay it off before you get with some bad interest one thing that has n't been mentioned is that this kind of offer can help build credit   you mentioned that you already have excellent credit but for someone who has good credit this could be an account that if used carefully could give their credit a boost by adding to their history of on time payments

i tend to agree with rocky 's answer   however it sounds like you want to look at this from the numbers side of things   so let 's consider some numbers i 'm assuming you have the money to buy the new car available as cash in hand and that if you do n't buy the car you 'll invest it reasonably   so if you buy the new car today you 're $ 17 k out of pocket   let 's look at some scenarios and compare   assuming if you buy the new car today then after 1 year you 'll have if you keep the old car after 1 year you get after 2 years you have and after 3 years you 're at or in other words nothing depletes the value of your assets faster than buying the new car after 1 year you 've essentially lost $ 5 k to depreciation     however over the short term the immediate cost of the tires combined with the continued depreciation of the old car do reduce your purchasing power somewhat you wo n't be able to muster $ 25 k towards a new car without chipping in a bit of extra cash and inflation will tend to drive the cost of the new car up as time goes on   so the relative gap between the value of your assets and the cost of the new car tends to increase though it stays well below the $ 5k that you lose to depreciation if you buy the new car immediately   which is something that you could potentially spin to support whichever side you prefer i suppose though note that i 've made some fairly pessimistic assumptions   in particular the current u.s. inflation rate is under 1 and a new car may depreciate by as much as 25 in the first year while older cars may depreciate by less than the 8 assumed   and i selected the cheapest new car price cited and did n't credit the tires with adding any value to your old car   each of those aspects tends to make continuing to drive the older car a better option than buying the new one

yes   the simplest option to track your spending over time is to familiarize yourself with the reports menu on the   take a look specifically at the reports > income expense > income statement report which will sum up your income and spending over a time frame defaults to the current year in each report that you run there is an options button at the top of the screen   open that and look on the general tab you 'll be able to set the time frame that the report displays if you wanted to set it for the 2 week block since your last paycheck for example   other features you 're going to want to familiarize yourself with are the expense charts statements the cash flow report and the budgeting interface which is relatively new although there is a bit of a learning curve to using this last feature most of the good ideas when it comes to tracking your spending are independent of the software you 're using but can be augmented with a good financial tracking program   for example in our household we have multiple credit cards which we pay in full every month   we selected our cards on specific benefits that they provide such as one card which has a category for cash back at certain business types   we keep that card set on restaurants and put all of our eating out expenses on that card   we have other cards for groceries gas etc   this makes it easy to see how much we 've spent in a given category and correlates well with the account structure in gnucash

for new shares to be successfully sold the price has to be below market price if you currently own shares of that company you should always get an option to buy those newly sold shares at that discounted price the number of options depends on the relative number of shares you hold lets say you own 100 out of 1000 shares currently priced at $ 10 100 new shares are to be sold at $ 9 since you are holding 10 of all shares you have the option i.e. the right to buy 10 new cheaper shares 10 of 100 before anybody else can buy them theoretically the money you save by getting the shares at a discounted price is equal to the money you lose by the share 's value being diluted so if you 're a shareholder and the company is increasing it 's capital you 're given the right to go with it

you 're saying that you 're thinking of keeping 35 in cash if you expect the market to plummet in the next few months and then head up again this would be a smart strategy hold on to a bunch of cash then when the market hits bottom buy then as it goes back up collect your profits in practice the long term trend of the market has been up for as long as there has been a stock market bear markets tend to be relatively short usually just a few months or at most a year or two before the market gets back to where it was if you are smart enough to predict when there will be a decline and how long it will last you 're smarter than 99 of the professionals never mind the amateurs personally i keep only trivial amounts of cash let 's see right now about 2 of my assets if you 're more active in managing your retirement accounts if you really watch the market on a monthly basis or more frequently and adjust your assets according it would make sense to keep a larger cash reserve and use it when the market goes down but for the average person i think it would be a big mistake to keep anywhere near 35 of your assets in cash in the long run you 'll probably lose out on a lot of potential growth

based on my experience with which is a development platform for automated trading strategies and therefore can be easily be used for backtesting your personal strategy i can give a little insight into what you might look for in such a platform   is a coding environment which reads data feeds from a variety of sources more on that in the second point and runs the code for your strategy on that data and gives you the results the data could be imported from a live data feed or from historical data either through numerous api 's csv excel etc you can write your own strategies using the custom c libraries included with the software which spares you from implementing your own code for technical indicators basic statistical functions etc getting the data is another issue you could use joe 's strategy and calculate option prices yourself although you need to exercise caution when doing this to test a strategy however there is no substitute for backtesting a strategy on real data markets change over time and depending on how far back you 're interested in testing your strategy you may run into problems the reason there is no substitute for using real data is that attempting to replicate the data may fail in some circumstances and you need a method of verifying that the data you 're generating is correct and realistic calculating a few values comparing them to the real values and accordingly is a good idea but you have to decide for yourself how many checks you want to do more is better but it may not be enough to realistically test your strategy disclaimer lest you interpret my post as a shameless plug for the platform i 'll state that i found the interface awful it looked vaguely like office 2000 but ten years too late and the documentation woefully incomplete i last used the software in 2010 so it may have improved in the intervening years but your mileage may vary i only use it as an example to give some insight into what you might look for in a backtesting platform when you actually begin trading a different platform is likely in order   that being said it responded fairly quickly and the learning curve was n't too steep the platform was n't too expensive at the time about $ 700 for a license with no data feeds i think but i was happy that the cost was n't coming out of my pocket it 's only gotten more expensive and i 'm not sure it 's worth it

it sounds for the most part you are a buy and hold type investor and continue to contribute monthly   i follow the same philosophy and continue to contribute monthly as well   i use as my online broker for trading it costs a penny per share with a minimum cost of $ 4.95 so if you only buy 100 shares you will still pay $ 4.95 up to a maximum of $ per trade so if you buy 10,000 shares you only pay $ three trades at $ 4.95 per month across the year would be $   this is assuming you are trading less then share each trade   so switching to questrade would save you an additional $ per year   multiply over number of year before you retire plus compound interest which could accrue and that can quite a bit of extra savings you pay nothing else to questrade either   no management fees etc   you manage the accounts

the cost will be around $ if you do it correctly it in florida and can be over a $ 1,000 if you do it in new york new york is more expensive due to a publication requirement that new york has for llc ’s   the price ranges i ’ve given include filing state fees getting a tax id number ein operating agreement membership certificates registered agent fees and publication fees if done in new york each state also have licensing boards and city fees that are applicable so you would want to also make sure that you are keeping compliant there yearly paperwork to keep the llc running wo n’t be so expensive expect the state to charge a yearly fee and require some basic information to be submitted   i had a quick look at florida and with someone filing it for you expect around $ 200 to $ 250 a year plus registered agent fees   if you are late in florida the penalty is $ 400 so you definitely would want a service that provides compliance calendar notifications to make sure you are on time with fees in regards to bookkeeping and taxes yearly tax filing will start at $ 250 to $ 500 for an llc and move up from there depending on the services being offered and the amount of time of work   i recently referred someone to an accountant that will charge $ 250 to file an almost zero tax return on an llc   i think $ 40 an hour is a little low for a bookkeeper but it all depends on where you are   i know in some major cities expect $ 75 an hour or higher so the expectation in miami and manhattan will probably be more expensive than and if you doing a little business do n’t expect the cost to be too much on the bookkeeping so breakdown $ fl $ 1,000 ny registration of llc + any business license city or other registrations $ 250 yearly fee + yearly registered agent + any business licenses city or other fee $ 500 tax return + bookkeeping fee banks will charge more than a personal account so expect $ 120 a year plus in regards to service i would look at companies that specialize in foreigners setting up   businesses in the us because they will have services designed to help you more than services that primarily specialize with us clients you are going to have some different needs based on not having a social security number or establishing from overseas

i think they 're compounding the interest daily that means you have to look at the number of days between payments to judge how much the interest charge is from february 3 to march 2 is 28 days 2012 was a leap year from march 2 to april 3 is 32 days that 's an increase of about 14 in number of days between payments which accounts reasonably well to the difference in interest charge   daily compounding also explains the minor fluctuations in the other interest charges i think if you compute interest day for each month you 'll find that it is indeed decreasing over time

it 's always hard to know the exact policy terms but as a general rule there are two main contributions to insurance payouts the first part covers expenses aimed at restoring the situation to its previous state pre incident this may include repair work and materials etcetera the second part kicks in when it 's not reasonably possible to repair the damage or at least not in a financially efficient way in this case the insurer can decide to pay out the decrease in value this is in fact very common in car accidents where the car is a total loss   in your case it 's quite possible that your roof even with the two partial repairs is in a worse condition than it was before the storm for instance the new shingles may not match the old ones exactly thus the value of your home has decreased despite the reasonable repair attempt and as mhoran_psprep points out there can be hidden damage as well which is a liability if you 've accepted the cash payment in lieu of a full repair you also accept the roof in its new condition

bank a only care about the credit limit at bank b when determining the maximum amount of credit they will grant you   in theory you might be able to convince them that by cancelling the other card they should increase the limit on their card   of course since you owe too much money to do a balance transfer before the cancelling of a card you will need them increase the limit first they will have to decide if your income credit usage history credit core and age of your account with them justifies the increase i do n't think you have a good plan for using the increased debt it is way to risky but if you have enough income to save 3 k a month you might be a good candidate for a higher credit limit

the bank does n't have to do anything it is your responsibility to provide the proof of insurance it is the agent 's job which you through your hoa dues paid for to provide that proof to you you should n't be registering with they say so in the first sentence on the registration page unit owners do not register here if you own an existing property    and have received a letter from your lender requiring an annual    renewal updated certificate for an association that has recently    expired please forward that letter to to receive    instructions to place your order if your request is a new loan of any    kind please contact your lender and request that they either contact    us to place this order or register below so you can try that route sending an email to and see if it works it does cost money in the range of $ i used a different similar service at the time and they charged $ 75 for this if it does n't you can try and work with the insurance agent there are some ways to persuade them california has very strong traditions of consumer protections in this case i suggest checking out this site let the insurance agent know that as the hoa member they 're working for you and that in the next hoa meeting you will raise a request to change the insurance agency also remind the agent that the ca insurance commission will knock on their doors to ask why they do n't provide you with the proof you need if the hoa management company does n't help you you can remind them that they too can be fired this can be done and is n't even all that hard there 's a lot of competition in the hoa management market and it would n't be too hard to find a new management company the hoa management company should have provided you the proof of coverage when they renewed the policy

you ask a question is there any real purpose in purchasing bonds and then appear to go off on a rant before the question is closed by members here let me offer this   this chart reflects the 10 year bond rate from 1960 2004 give or take the coupon rate was over 4 asset allocation suggests a mix of stocks and bonds seeking to avoid the risk of having all of one 's eggs in one basket to that end the simplest approach is a stock bond mix over time a 70/30 mix provides nearly 95 of the long return but with a much lower volatility   i 'm not going to suggest that a 2 10 year bond is an exciting investment but bonds may have a place in one 's portfolio i 'm not going to debate each and every point you attempted but 5 is especially questionable if you feel this is true you should short bonds or you should at least 99 of the time do you have data to back up this statement

a lot of smaller and/or weaker countries did not have much choice when germany and france decided to rename the german mark as the euro as most of their trade was already in marks   it was even common for their population to have their savings in marks    so the question was do we wish to have to use the euro    with or without a seat on the board it was a no brainer for them at the time the uk has a lot of trade with the usa and other countries outside of the euro zone so we are unlikely to have to join the euro     so in the end it comes down to this point   if the british voters trust a uk government they elected more or less than an government mostly elected by people in the other countries i do n’t think the uk will be joining the euro anytime soon but everything can and will change with the passage of time   after all the usa used to be part of the pound trading zone and please can you pay us all the back dated tax you stop paying after a little tea party update given what has just happen to grease and spain and the conservative party has the most seats in the uk parliament i do n’t think the uk will not be joining the euro for the next 5 years at least

assuming you would still have a line of credit it makes plenty of sense to pay off the loan you 're paying 16 percent for money you do n't need right now pay it all off and you can start rebuilding your savings account so what do you do in a future emergency well first off you can use the savings you have rebuilt up to that point to fund some portion of it the rest you can borrow again as long as you have a line of credit somewhere the icing on the cake though is that once you stop carrying a balance your credit card purchases will have grace periods again once that grace period kicks in it 's an effective short term free loan and if you really wanted to you could move money that would otherwise immediately go to purchases into savings the difference is that you 're paying in full again and are n't charged any interest on the float just remember that if you fail to pay in full by the due date they charge retroactive interest and fees an alternative is to find a way to consolidate your credit card bill into a collateralized loan helocs for example the rates are much cheaper than your cc bill but require you to have some equity in the home one thing to consider is that helocs are an open line of credit that ca n't be easily taken away the interest is also tax deductible unlike your credit card interest there 's also unsecured lines of credit from banks and credit unions and if you have the credit score the can be cheaper than credit cards i think i 've shown here that there 's plenty of alternatives to carrying credit card debt for the unexpected in life pay it off

as others have alluded to but have n't said due to the lack of reputation points to spare you can take advantage of oil prices by leveraging up and using as much credit and margin as the banks and brokerages respectively will lend you people assume that the correct answer on this forum has to as conservative financial advice and this is not advice nor conservative futures contracts are readily available but they are expensive to obtain like a minimum entry of $ but if this expense is no such object to you then you can then obtain this contract which is actually worth 20x that and experience the price appreciation and depreciation of the whole contract the concept is similar to a downpayment on a mortgage you assume rock bottom oil prices but fortunately for you futures contracts will allow you to quickly change your bets from future price appreciation and allow you to speculate on future price depreciation so although the union workers will be protesting full time after the drilling company lays them off you will still be getting wealthier long options these are the best the difference with options amongst other speculation products is that options require the least amount of capital risk for the greatest reward with futures or with trading shares of an etf especially on margin you have to put up a lot of capital and if the market does not go your desired direction then will lose a lot and on margin products you can lose more than you put in being long options does not come with these a long march 2015 call option on uso etf can currently be bought for less than $ 200 of actual cash ie the trading quote will be less than $ 2.00 but this will cost you less than $ 200 and will be worth $ 1000 on a very modest rebound in prices the most you can lose is the $ 200 for the contract compared to $ on the futures or $ 100,000 that you do n't have in the futures market if oil really moves against you or compared to whatever large amount of cash needed to actually buy shares of an etf needed to make any decent return these are the most lucrative and fun and and ways to take advantage of rock bottom oil prices as an individual

these statements are n't necessarily contradictory in the first case investors are bearish because they anticipate selling in the future because all the interested buyers have bought so all that remains in the short run are people willing to sell and therefore drive down the price   in the second case the trend is strengthened because the increase in volume indicates that the price movement interested a lot of traders the trend could be bullish or bearish   the statements are n't contradictory because the second case could very well lead to the first case for example if an increase in price is coupled with an increase in volume this could indicate that the positive trend is strengthening second case traders are becoming more interested in the price move so they buy   however once all of the traders who are willing to enter the market long do so we 're in the first case investors realize that all of the traders who were interested in buying have bought so they become bearish because they expect selling to start soon

this is either laundering money or laundering non money   all the other answers point out how a cheque or bank transfer will take days to actually clear   that is a red herring there are lots of ways to illegally transfer real money out of existing accounts   stolen cheque books stolen banking details partly in connection with stolen smartphones and credit cards and cards money transfers from other people duped in a similar manner as you are it is much easier to steal money than invent it and it takes quite longer until stolen rather than invented money will blow up at the banks all of those payments will likely properly clear but not leave you in actual legal possession of money   people will notice the missing money and notify police and banks and you will be on the hook for paying back all of it cheques and transfers from non existing accounts in contrast tend to blow up very fast and thus are less viable for this kind of scam as the time window for operating the scam is rather small whether or not the cheque actually clears is about as relevant of whether or not the rolls royce you are buying for $ 500 because the owner has an toe nail and can not press down the accelerator any more has four wheels better hope for the rolls to be imaginary because then you 'll only be out of $ 500 and that 's the end of it   if it is real your trouble is only starting

17.5 thousand miles year is pretty high mileage   you could find an accord or civic of comparable age with much lower mileage than that and it would n't be a stretch for someone even with your limited credit history to get a loan on an old car like that   you might try to have your parents cosign on a loan depending on their financial circumstances   that 's how i bought my first car 13 years ago the biggest surprise you might want to consider is the cost of full collision auto coverage which will be required by whatever bank you finance through   get quotes for that before signing any papers   i spent $ 2000 more on a motorcycle because the more powerful one cost $ 2000 less year to insure just a few years after i bought that first car   speaking of which another thing to consider given the nice la weather is a motorcycle   the total cost of ownership is much lower than a car   you will probably not want to pursue that option if you do not have medical insurance and you may not want to anyway

simplicity and roi are often at odds the simplest plan that also supports a reasonable investment return would have 3 accounts if you want to get better returns on your investments things can get much more complicated here are some optional accounts to consider besides the mechanics of money flowing between accounts a budget helps you understand and control your spending   while there are many methods for this e.g. envelopes of cash separate accounts for various types of expenses the simplest might be using mint.com   just be sure to put all your spending on a credit or debit card and you can see your spending by category when you log into mint it can take a bit to get it set up and your bank needs to be compatible but it can give you a really good picture of where your money is going   once you know that you can start making decisions like i should spend less on coffee or i should go to the zoo more based on how much things cost vs how much you enjoy them if you feel like your spending is out of control then you can set yourself hard limits on certain kinds of spending but usually just watching and influencing your own choices is enough notes   if you have a spouse or partner you should each maintain your own separate accounts there are many reasons for this including simplicity and roi besides the obvious if you feel you must have a joint account be sure to clearly define how it should be used e.g. only for paying the utilities and funded x$ per month each particularly with your house do not do joint ownership one of you should be a renter and the other a landlord some of these statements assume you are in the usa on a personal note i have about 20 credit cards 2 checking accounts 2 ira 's 2 brokerage accounts and 3 401k 's but i consider myself a personal finance and spend an absurd amount of time chasing financial deals and tax breaks

he sounds like a very bad salesman and i should know because i was a sales manager at a bike shop which sold bikes from $ 200 to $ 10k now i had a clear goal which is to sell as many bikes at the highest price possible but i did n't do that by making customers uncomfortable each customer received different treatment depending on what they were looking for   for example the $ 200 beach cruiser buyer was going to be told you look great on that bike can i ring you up whereas the interested in saving grams will receive a detailed discussion about his bike options   the $ 200 bike customer wo n't have very sophisticated questions although i could give a lecture on so giving out too much info complicates a likely quick impulse buy   on the other hand we are building a relationship with the which will include detailed fitting sessions and time consuming mechanical service   while i also want to close a high priced sale it will take several visits to prove both i have the right bike and this is the best shop but no matter what you were buying i was always pleasant and and my customers left happy    specifically with this situation of high pressure tactics the problem is the competition with internet sales   often customers will have only 2 criteria the model and the price and if a shop does not meet both the customer walks right out    possibly this sales guy is a bit cynical with his tactics but the reality is that if you have no relationship with that shop you fall into the category of internet buyer   one thing the sales guy could have done was not tell you we was n't going to honor this price if you came back   occasionally there would be an internet buyer and i showed no even though internet sellers could crush our brick and mortar shop   i would mention a competitive price and if he bought it great and if not that 's just business    as for the buyer i would treat these tactics with a certain   i would personally chuckle at his treatment and ask if i could kick the tires an user car saying    i suppose the bottom line is if you are ready to buy this specific model and if the price is right and the shop is ethical so you wo n't get ripped off with garbage then you have to be ready to buy on the spot i will point out one horrible experience i had at a car dealership   i came in 15 minutes before closing and a sales person gave me a price almost a third cheaper than list   i was n't ready to buy on my first visit ever to a dealership and of course buying a car has all kinds of hidden fees   i asked will this be the price tomorrow and he said absolutely not   i told him so if i come in tomorrow morning your dealer clock has only gone 15 minutes but that logic did not register with him    maybe he thought i was going to spend 15k on the spot and pressure tactics would work on me   i never came back but i did go another dealership and bought a car after a reasonable negotiation

it is true that with a job that pays you via payroll check that will result in a w-2 because you are an employee the threshold that you are worried about before you have to file is in the thousands unless of course you make a lot of money from bank interest or you have income tax withheld and you want it refunded to you table 2 and table 3 in irs pub 501 does a great job of telling you when you must   for you table 3 is most likely to apply because you were n't an employee and you will not be getting a w-2 if any of the five conditions listed below applied to you for 2016 you must file a return you owe any special taxes including any of the following a. alternative minimum tax see form     b. additional tax on a    qualified plan including an individual retirement arrangement ira    or other account   see pub contributions to    individual retirement arrangements iras pub distributions    from   individual retirement arrangements iras and pub 969 health    savings accounts and other health   plans but if you are    filing a return only because you owe this tax you can file form 5329    by itself    c. social security or medicare tax on tips you did n't    report to your employer see pub reporting tip income or on     wages you received from an employer who did n't withhold these taxes    see form     d. taxes including social    security medicare or railroad retirement tax on tips you reported to    your   employer or on life insurance and additional taxes on    health savings accounts see pub pub 969   and the form 1040    instructions for line 62    e. household employment taxes but if you    are filing a return only because you owe these taxes you can file     schedule h form 1040 by itself f. recapture taxes see the form    1040 instructions for lines 44 and 62 you or your spouse if filing jointly received archer medicare advantage or health savings account   distributions you had net earnings from of at least $ 400 see schedule se form 1040 and its instructions you had wages of $ or more from a church or qualified organization that is exempt from employer   social    security and medicare taxes see schedule se form 1040 and its    instructions advance payments of the premium tax credit were made for you your spouse or a dependent who enrolled in coverage   through the health    insurance marketplace you should have received showing    the amount of the advance   payments if any it appears that item 3 you had net earnings from of at least $ 400 see schedule se form 1040 and its instructions would most likely apply it obviously is not too late to file for 2016 because taxes are n't due for another month as to previous years that would depend if you made money those years and how much

i would suggest you pay quarterly or if you prefer do the extra withholding do n't wait until the end of the year my experience is that of having a day job with freelance work on the side i 've spent a few years just freelancing and i paid quarterly as requested to avoid the penalties now that i have a good day job again my freelancing is just a small part of my income and so i end up with a net return and no longer have to pay quarterly you should n't wait until the end of the year to pay this is assuming your wife is bringing in a decent income the only scenario where you would want to wait is if her income is only a small amount such as my wife 's plans for an etsy store to the irs it does n't really make a difference whether you withhold extra or pay quarterly of those two choices my preference is to pay quarterly it 's easy to set up calendar reminders on the quarterly payment dates which are always the same i did the same as bstpierre when estimating my payments just take last year 's tax for the business and divide by 4 adjusting for any obvious situational differences that 's usually close enough paying quarterly instead of via withholding means you get to hold on to your money on average for 6 weeks longer granted that does n't mean much with today 's interest rates but it 's something you may prefer the simpler accounting for withholding though you can set and forget

i 'm normally not a fan of investment money into buckets but your case may be the clearest case for it i 've seen in awhile   your income and saving is good and you have two clearly defined goals of retirement saving and saving for a house each with very different time frames ~30 years and 3 5 years respectively for medium term money like saving for a house just building up cash is not actually a bad idea this minimizes the chance that a market crash will happen at the same time you need to withdraw the money   however given you have the means to take more risk a generally smarter scheme would be to invest much of the money in a broad liquid bond funds with a somewhat lower percentage in stocks and then reduce the amount of stock each year as you get closer even moving some into cash   this gives reasonable positive expected return while lowering the risk of having to sell during a crisis as the time to purchase gets shorter and shorter the retirement money should be invested for the long term as usual   a majority in low fee index stock funds etfs is the standard advice for good reason

credit history is local so when you move to the us you start with the blank slate credit history length is a huge factor so in the first year expect that nobody would trust you and you may be refused credit or asked for deposits i was asked for deposits at cell phone company and refused for store cards couple of times my advice get a secured credit card that means you put certain sum of money as a deposit in the bank and you get credit equal to that sum of money and if you have something like a car loan that helps too of course you should n't buy a car just for that but if you 're buying anyway just know it 's not only hurting but also helping when you pay once you have a year or two of the history and you 've kept with all the payments you credit score would be ok and everybody would be happy to work with you in 4 5 years you can have excellent credit record if you pay on time and do n't do anything bad if you are working it the us a lot of help at first would be to take a letter from your company on an official letterhead saying that you are employed by this and that company and are getting salary of this and that that can serve as an assurance for some merchants that otherwise would be reluctant to work with you because of the absence of credit history if you have any assets overseas especially if they are held in a branch of international bank in us dollars that could help too in general do n't count too much on credit for first 1 2 years though you 'd probably could get a car loan for example but rates would be exorbitant easily 10 percentage points higher than with good credit but it will get better soon

typical wire transfers are not with 4 5 but it all depends on the bank that does the transfer you can chose to send wire the money in source currency or in us $ the former the target bank in the us does the conversion so pick one that adds no or little spread the latter the sending bank does the conversion so ask about their fees spreads i have multiple times transferred money across the ocean though not from japan and never paid more than 0.3 + ~40 $ flat it should be possible to get te same range note that if you look around for current offers you might be easily able to even make some money on it some us banks are eager for new money and offer bonus if you open an account and bring significant = new money to them

on first glance it sounds to good to be true    from what i understand bridge loans are for people waiting on other loans in this case i would presume a housing developer would take this loan if something were to go wrong and their first choice of funding went wrong not anything wrong with that in and of itself but the coupon is way way too big not to draw attention    examine the financial statements of the credit institutions and the companies they 're giving credit to would be the only solution    the terms of the bond should be dictated by all information available therefore if the return is this lucrative then there must be a large degree of risk associated with it

you should also look outside the box there are non profit credit relief organizations that will give you free credit counseling do n't pay for it though there are some organizations that are shady in offering counseling but they wreck your credit by asking you to stop making your payments some of the legitimate organizations out there have ties to credit unions and banks that can offer you some loans to consolidate your debt at rates lower than those you mentioned in your questions you should probably also approach a credit union directly and discuss debt consolidation loan options even if you can only knock out the debts with the highest interest rate that 's a good first step

there is such a thing as deposit only this will allow the individual 's account to function only for collection of monetary deposits   no one will be able to withdraw only deposit   the account holder may still physically withdraw at their banking institution   think of it as taking your account from a public profile to a private profile   doing this is beneficial for ppl who may have been scammed into a program or product where there account is fraudulently or simply to protect your funds from drafted without your approval or despite your requests for the drafts   when making your account a deposit only account it 's a good idea to open a new account at a different banking institution because some banks will still allow an account that is attached to the deposit only account to be drafted from it    with the new account you can utilize that one for paying day to day bills and just transfer funds from the deposit only account to the new account    a deposit only account is also a good way to build up a nice nest egg for yourself or even a young adult financial

it depends on what your plans for the future are taking out a loan is not a bad thing if it is at a good rate and under good terms and you are sure you can handle the payments if you buy the car with cash you may be giving up the opportunity to later get a great rate on that $ 8k however you are probably not utilizing that $ 20k to make as much interest as you 'd then be paying if you did take the $ 8k on loan since you say house fund i assume you are saving to make a down payment on a new house if you plan to buy that house within the next 6 months the hard pulls on your credit report from applying for the car loan will probably ding your credit score for the next 6 months which might cost you on your mortgage rate however if you do n't plan to buy for a few more years and if you 've never had a car payment before then the auto loan would actually be adding diversity to your credit history and in the long run would help your score another factor to consider is the loan to value ratio you are shooting for ltv affects the interest rate requirements for private mortgage insurance etc mortgage rates are at an all time low and lower than auto rates so depending on the terms of the house purchase that $ 8k might be better spent on the car than the house in short if you want to buy the house soon rates are market is a buyer 's market and you need that $ 8k to get a better mortgage rate or prevent you from being required to buy pmi you should probably put it toward the house otherwise you should probably put it toward the car last piece of advice if you absolutely must buy a house and a car in the same short time frame do them both on the same day so that your credit score is not dinged before applying for one or the other with mortgages this may be difficult considering the longer closing procedures but try to time it so that your credit is getting checked by the mortgage broker and the auto lender on the same day

similar to what adam f says above except instead of just transfering the amount you spend on the credit card into the high interest account why not keep the majority of your funds apart from a small amount say a couple of hundred for emergencies in the high interest account until the credit card needs to be paid off even better if you have a mortgage with an 100 offset account keep all your funds in this and pay off your credit card in full from it on or before the due date being a 100 offset to your mortgage interest rate you will be saving at a higher rate than a high interest rate savings account and you will be able to do all your normal banking from it unlike a high interest account which you usually have to link to an additional account to deposit and withdrawl money to and from if you are to use a credit card keep these simple rules in mind hope this has helped regards victor

part 1 quite a few or rather most countries allow usd account so there is no conversion    just to in india its allowed to have a usd account the funds can be transfered as usd and withdrawn as usd the interest is in usd there no conversion at any point in time typically the rates for cd on usd account was central bank regulated rate of 5 recently this was deregulated and some banks offer around 7 interest    why is the rate high on usd in india there is a trade deficit which means india gets less usd and has to pay more usd to buy stuff oil and other essential items the balance is typically borrowed say from imf or other countries etc allowing banks to offer high interest rate is one way to attract more usd into the country in short term because in time they may take back the usd out of india so why is n't everyone jumping and making usd in india the non residents who eventually plan to come back have invested in usd in india there is a risk of regulation changes ie if the central bank country comes up pressure for forex reserves they may make it to take back the usd ie they may impose charges taxes or force conversion on such accounts the kyc norms make it difficult for indian bank to attract us citizens except non resident indians certain countries would have explicit regulations to prevent other nationals from investing in such products as they may lead to volatility ie all of them suddenly pull out the funds there would be no insurance to foreign nationals    part 2 the fdic insurance is not the reason for lower rates most countires have similar insurance for bank deposits for account    the reason for lower rate is all the china etc park the excess funds in us treasuries because 1 it is safe 2 it is required for any international purchase 3 it is very liquid    now if the us fed started giving higher interest rates to bonds say 5 it essentially paying more to other countries so its keeping the interest rates low even at 1 there are enough people institutions who would keep the money with us treasury    so the us treasury has to make some revenue from the funds kept at it it lends at lower interest rates to bank who in turn lend it to borrowers both corporate and retail    now if they can borrow cheaply from fed why would they pay more to individual retail on cd they will pay less because the lending rates are low as well    part 3 check out the regulations

yes using debt appropriately is a huge part of what 's called optimal capital structure theory in the finance world debt is generally cheaper than equity financing due to the tax deductibility of interest and using it appropriately can really juice the profitability of a business as long as the rate of return on equity in the business exceeds the interest rate on the debt

first off i highly recommend the book get a financial life   the basics of personal finance and money management are pretty straightforward and this book does a great job with it   it is very light reading and it really geared for the young person starting their career   it is n't the most current book pre real estate boom but the recommendations in the book are still sound   update new edition of the book came out now with that out of the way there 's really two kinds of investing to think about for most individuals it is best to take care of 1 first   most people should n't even think about 2 until they have fully funded their retirement accounts established an emergency fund and gotten their debt under control there are lots of financial incentives for retirement investing both from your employer and the government   all the more reason to take care of 1 before 2 your employer probably offers some kind of 401k or equivalent like a 403b with a company provided match   this is a potential 100 return on your investment after the vesting period   no investment you make on your own will ever match that   additionally there are tax advantages to contributing to the 401k   the money you contribute does n't count as taxable income the best way to start investing is to learn about your employer 's retirement plan and contribute enough to fully utilize the employer matching beyond this there are also individual retirement accounts iras you can open to contribute money to on your own   you should open one of these and start contributing but only after you have fully utilized the employer matching with the 401k   the ira wo n't give you that 100 roi that the 401k will keep in mind that retirement investments are pretty much walled off from your day to day financial life   money that goes into a retirement account generally ca n't be touched until retirement age unless you want to pay lots of taxes and penalties   you generally do n't want to put the money for your house down payment into a retirement account one other thing to note   your 401 k and your ira is an account that you put money into   just because the money is sitting in the account does n't necessarily mean it is invested   you put the money into this account and then you use this money for investments   how you invest the retirement money is a topic unto itself   here is a good starting point   if you want to ask questions about retirement portfolios it is probably worth posting a new question

i do n't know about the technicalities of retirement accounts but i would advise you to please please please do not use retirement money to buy a home the reason for not ever wanting to spend your retirement is when can you make it up   when you retire you are by definition no longer earning money so all your expenses can only come from the money you have saved   if you are willing to borrow from your retirement it is not hard to imagine you are willing are willing to get a new car or a new barbecue or a new fishing boat before you repay yourself so the question to ask yourself is can i deal with renting for a few years knowing that i can retire comfortably or am i willing to risk retirement to have a house now part of the will power it takes to pay yourself first is not taking from your own savings   you can not count on anybody but yourself to take care of you when you are old it is just opinion but risking a comfortable retirement for a home now is not a risk anybody should take

yeah there 's a lot to talk about with basic income like how currently there is an incentive to not work harder or move up the socio economic ladder because as you earn more your welfare benefits go away so people think it 's not worth getting a better job because they will pay more in taxes and lose benefits but now they are working harder and not getting more for it a basic income would n't go away with that sweet new job promotion therefore there is an incentive to work more   i like the basic income idea but i wonder about how to handle immigration and global relations you will have it in some countries where others are like literally falling apart basically we have a long way to go until we are comfortably collecting our bi checks at least in the us

first of all metals are commodities so if you 're phrasing that as metals and/or commodities then that 's poorly worded if you 're phrasing that as metal commodity reports then say as such    second and more importantly what commodities power is very different than coffee different places specialize in different things all banks are good in some and weak in others there 's no generic commodity market but rather a huge range of specifically different products traded in the future you learn more than a small fraction of this universe so pick one or two specific products from the macro buckets i.e. energy grains metals and focus on those

i quite like the canadian couch potato which provides useful information targeted at investors in canada they specifically provide some model portfolios canadian couch potato generally suggests investing in indexed etfs or mutual funds made up of four components one etf or mutual fund tracking canadian bonds another tracking canadian stocks a third tracking us stocks and a fourth tracking international stocks i personally add a reit etf bmo equal weight reits index etf but that may complicate things too much for your liking canadian couch potato specifically recommends the tangerine portfolio if you are looking for something particularly easy though the management expense ratio is rather high for my liking anyway the website provides specific suggestions whether you are looking for a single mutual fund multiple mutual funds or prefer etfs from personal experience tangerine 's offerings are very very simple and far cheaper than the 2.5 you are quoting i currently use td 's e series funds and spend only a few minutes a year rebalancing there are a number of good etfs available if you want to lower your overhead further though canadians do n't get quite the deals available in the u.s. still you should n't be paying anything remotely close to 2.5 also beware of tax implications the website has several articles that cover these in detail

i do n't know of a situation where rejecting a raise would make sense often one can be in a phaseout of some benefit so that even though you 're in a certain tax bracket the impact of the next $ 100 is greater than the bracket rate alone taxation of social security benefits is one such anomaly it can be high but never over 100 update the affordable care act contains such an anomaly go to the kaiser foundation site and see the benefit a family of three might receive a credit for up to $ toward their health care insurance cost but increase the income to above $ modified adjusted gross income magi and the benefit drops to zero the fact that the next dollar of income will cost you $ in the lost credit is an example of a step function in the tax code i 'd still not turn down the raise but i 'd ask that it be deposited to my 401(k and when reconciling my taxes each april i 'd use an ira in case i still went over a bit consider it 's april and your magi is $ even if you do n't have to cash to deposit to the ira you borrow it from a 24 credit card if need be because the $ 2000 ira will trigger not just $ 300 less federal tax but a $ health care credit   note the above example will apply to a limited specific group who are funding their own health care expense and paying above a certain percent of income it 's not a criticism of aca just a mathematical observation appropriate to this question for those in this situation a close look at their projected magi is in order   another example the deduction for college tuition and fees   this is another step function go a dollar over the threshold $ 130 k joint and the deduction drops from $ 4000 to $ 2000 you can claim that a $ 2000 deduction is a difference of only $ 500 in tax due but the result is a quick spike in the marginal rate for those right at this number it would be worth it to increase their 401(k deduction to get back under this limit

your assertion that you will not be selling anything is at odds with the idea that you will be doing tax loss harvesting   tax loss harvesting always involves some selling you sell stocks that have fallen in price and lock in the capital losses which gives you a break on your taxes   if you absolutely prohibit your advisor from selling then you will not be able to do tax loss harvesting in that case why are you using an advisor at all tax loss harvesting has nothing to do with your horizon nor the active passive difference really as a practical matter a good tax loss harvesting plan involves mechanically selling losers and immediately putting the money in another stock with more or less similar risk so your portfolio does n't change much   in this way you get a stable portfolio that performs just like a static portfolio but gives you a tax benefit each year   the irs officially prohibits this practice via the wash sale rule that says you ca n't buy a substantially identical asset within a short period of time   however though two stocks have similar risk they are not generally substantially similar in a legal sense so the irs ca n't really beat you in court and they do n't try   basically you ca n't just buy the same stock again the is advertising that they will perform this service keeping your portfolio pretty much static in terms of risk in such a way that your tax benefit is maximized and you do n't run afoul of the irs

this will depend on individual bank policy federal reserve regulation d is the regulation that requires banks to disallow more than 6 convenient transactions in a month on savings accounts   if they do allow it they will fail their audits and be fined as a result banks will do one of several things either prevent you from any more transactions for the month charge you a fee convert your account to a checking account or simply close the account altogether   if they do that they will give you the money in it probably by mailing you a check you have a few options before that happens   first of all if this is an account that you regularly spend money out of the appropriate account type is a checking account   you could go to the bank and open a checking account which will not have a transaction limit if you are unable or unwilling to do that you 'll need to stay under this limit   however you should be aware that not all withdrawal types fall under this 6 transaction limit   the regulations talk about convenient transactions which generally include things like automated payments debit card check internet transfers etc   cash withdrawals in person or at an atm generally do not fall under this limit so that is an option for you if you hit your limit for the month

never ever use a giant monster mega bank for home loans   i am sure you probably did n't and they bought your loan from someone else   you have no legal options   what you should do is look at getting a new loan maybe a 15 year loan   your payment might be the same with no pmi i would check with a to see what they think your home is worth   also if you have any money you can always pay extra to the principle and get yourself to 20 based on the next appraisal    you might have a legal option regarding what they say you need in value 350k is what it should appraise to for you to get rid of pmi when you owe 280k remember citibank is a publicly traded company and their goal is to make more money the ceo has a fiduciary relationship with stock holders not customers   they seriously have board meetings to figure out what charges they can invent to screw their customers and make shitloads of money   there is no incentive for them to let you get out of your pmi

the best thing for you to do will be to start using the cash flow report instead of the income and expense report go to reports > income and expense > cash flow once the report is open open the edit window and open the accounts tab   there choose your various cash accounts checking saving etc   in the general tab choose the reporting period   and then save the report settings so you do n't need to go hunting for your cash accounts each time gnucash will display for you all the inflows and outflows of money which appears to be what you really want though gnucash does n't present the cash flow in a way that matches united states accounting rules with sections for operating investing and financial cash flows separated it is certainly fine for your personal use if you want the total payment to show up as one line on the cash flow report you will need to book the accrual of interest and the payment to the mortgage bank as two separate entries normal entry for mortgage payments which shows up as a line for mortgage and a line for interest on your cash flow pair of entries to make full mortgage payment show up as one line on cash flow entry 1   interest accrual entry 2   full mortgage payment tested in gnucash

why does the article which refers to the 2006 2008 boom as a age use the same time period as a basis for labor participation calculation should they not use a more wise approach and make the basis around 2005 or 2004 and then calculate the amount of labor participating in order to account for the false high of 2007 maybe i missed something in my education but if a specific time counts as an anomaly then it should not be the base calculation when deriving a hypothesis about that time period for example wage growth between 2005 and 2007 increased x% but between 2007 and 2009 decreased so we are really in for it now it should be the base period of 2005 shows a growth of x% to 2007 and from 2005 to 2009 shows a growth of only one tenth x%    of course this would make for much less sensationalist journalism and may not sell as many news stories as a sensationalist story would

because this is money se and you 're connecting it to offspring i 'd think about a discussion with them to get their agreements from my perspective anything my wife and i have will go to offspring in the end as such everything borrowed and not repaid simply reduces the estate by that much among multiple offspring such reductions should be against the borrower rather than spreading it out that should be accounted for in whatever will is created this would be the discussion point it might also be discussed how or even if any interest should accrue for unpaid amounts if for example a 1 apr is agreed upon for unpaid loans then the final amount is taken off of the borrower 's inheritance existing outstanding loans might or might not be useful examples for sample calculations if desired or needed if nothing else they might serve as reminders that loans were not forgotten by having such a discussion you can show that you are trying to plan for a fair distribution of your estate perhaps thereby any concern about charging interest to offspring for repaid loans at the same time you 're handing over some financial responsibility giving them a power of personal choice which seems to be a part of what you 're concerned about once such a discussion is started it 's possible that any question of interest will resolve itself naturally the discussion almost necessarily must include all offspring at once one will find it harder to negotiate from a standpoint of pure self interest without objection from another think beforehand about what will be said and about what responses might come think things through as much as you can

your calculations are good as far as they go but there are lots of other factors and pros and cons to each decision yes you should certainly compare the monthly rent to what your mortgage payments would be as you have done yes you should consider how long you might live there if you do move out how difficult will it be to sell the house given market conditions in your area if you try to rent it how difficult is it to find a tenant and what rent could you expect to receive speaking of moving out and renting the place who will manage the property and do maintenance would you still be close enough to do this yourself would you be willing and able to spend the time or would you have to hire someone also what if the tenant does not pay the rent how difficult is it to evict someone in your area speaking from personal experience i own a rental property in ohio and the law says you can evict someone with 3 days notice but in practice they do n't just leave so then you have to take them to court it takes months to get a court date and months longer before the police actually show up to order them out of the house and you have to pay the lawyer and court fees in that time they 're living in your property rent free in my case one tenant also totally trashed the place and stole everything that was n't nailed down i had to spend $ 13,000 on repairs to a house worth a fraction of what you 're talking about being a landlord is not just a matter of sitting back and collecting rent checks there 's a fair amount of work and a lot of risk what do you have to pay the realtor and what other closing costs would you have to pay where i live realtors typically charge 6 to 7 you may also have to pay for an appraisal title search and bunch of other little fees mortgage interest is deductible on your federal income taxes rent is not if you own and something needs to be repaired you have to pay for it if you rent the landlord has to pay for it   if you own you can do pretty much what you like with the property subject to zoning ordinances and building codes and maybe homeowners association rules but you should have a pretty good amount of leeway if you want to install ceiling fans or remodel the kitchen or add a deck it 's up to you if you 're renting it 's up to the landlord to decide what you can do to the property and if he agrees to let you do some upgrade when you 're done it belongs to him with a condo you are not usually responsible for exterior maintenance like mowing the lawn and trimming the and washing the outer walls with a house you are you might pay someone to do this which adds to the cost or you might do it yourself which takes time insurance on a condo or is much less than insurance on a house in my area anyway you should investigate those costs if you buy eventually you own the place and do n't have to pay a mortgage any more if you rent you continue to pay forever even if you do n't live in the same house forever as long as you do n't take a terrible loss when you sell you should then have some money left over to apply to the next house so you are still building equity some of these pros and cons are easily quantifiable others are probabilities like how likely is it that your water heater will fail and how long is it likely to take to find a buyer if you want to sell and others are pretty subjective

index funds can be a very good way to get into the stock market it 's a lot easier and cheaper to buy a few shares of an index fund than it is to buy a few shares in hundreds of different companies an index fund will also generally charge lower fees than an actively managed mutual fund where the manager tries to pick which stocks to invest for you while the actively managed fund might give you better returns by investing in good companies instead of every company in the index that does n't always work out and the fees can eat away at that advantage stocks on average are expected to yield an annual return of 4 after inflation consider that when you see an expense ratio of 1 index funds should charge you more like or so possibly more if it 's an exotic index the question is what sort of index you 're going to invest in the standard and poor 's 500 s&p 500 is a major index and if you see someone talking about the performance of a mutual fund or investment strategy there 's a good chance they 'll compare it to the return of the s&p 500 moreover there are a variety of index funds and exchange traded funds that offer very good expense ratios e.g. vanguard 's etf charges very cheap you can also find some funds which try to get you exposure to the entire world stock market e.g. vanguard total world stock etf nyse vt an index fund is probably the ideal way to start a portfolio easy and you get a lot of diversification later when you have more money available you can consider adding individual stocks or investing in specific sectors or regions someone else suggested brazil russia indo china or brics having some money invested in that region is n't necessarily a bad idea but putting all or most of your money in that region would be if brics are more of your portfolio then they are of the world economy your portfolio is n't balanced also while these countries are experiencing a lot of economic growth that does n't always mean that the companies that you own stock in are the ones which will benefit small businesses and new ventures may make up a significant part of that growth bond funds are useful when you want to diversify your portfolio so that it 's not all stocks there 's a bunch of portfolio theory built around asset allocation strategies the idea is that you should try to maintain a target mix of assets whatever the market 's doing the basic simplified guideline about investing for retirement says that your portfolio should have your in bonds e.g. a 30-year old should have 30 in bonds a old 50 this helps maintain a balance between the volatility of your portfolio the stock market 's ups and downs and the rate of return you want to earn money when you can but when it 's almost time to spend it you do n't want a sudden stock market crash to wipe it all out bonds help preserve that value but do n't have as nice of a return the other idea behind asset allocation is that if the market changes e.g. your stocks go up a lot while your bonds stagnate you rebalance and buy more bonds if the stock market subsequently crashes you move some of your bond money back into stocks this basically means that you buy low and sell high just by maintaining your asset allocation this is generally more reliable than trying to time the market and move into an asset class before it goes up and move out before it goes down market timing is just speculation you get better returns if you guess right but you get worse returns if you guess wrong commodity funds are useful as another way to diversify your portfolio and can serve as a little bit of protection in case of crisis or inflation you can buy gold silver platinum and palladium etfs on the stock exchanges having a small amount of money in these funds is n't a bad idea but commodities can be subject to violent price swings moreover a bar of gold does n't really earn any money and owning a share of a precious metals etf will incur administrative storage and insurance costs to boot a well run business does earn money assuming you 're saving for the long haul retirement or something several decades off my suggestion for you would be to start by investing most of your money in index funds to match the total world stock market with something like the aforementioned nyse vt for instance a small portion in bonds and a smaller portion in commodity funds for all the negative stuff i 've said about market timing it 's pretty clear that the bond market is very expensive right now and so are the commodities then as you do additional research and determine what sort investments are right for you add new investment money in the places that you think are appropriate stock funds bond funds commodity funds individual stocks sector specific funds actively managed mutual funds et cetera and try to maintain a reasonable asset allocation have fun most of your investment money you should have a separate fund for emergencies and do n't invest money in stocks if you know you 're going need it within the next few years

most modern bank accounts can be set up to automatically pay bills for anyone even someone who has no control over the account this account would be in a trustee 's name for the untrustworthy party an automatic transfer could be set up from the source account to the irresponsible party 's bank account to pay their allowance it would be wise to remove all overdraft capability from the recipients account but the whole system might help them learn some responsibility there are more formal legal structures for forming a long term care taking trust with provisions to protect the trust from legal action the trust would need to be maintained by a trustee resulting in maintenance fees on the principle it might also help to know if there are legally recognized factors that impair the beneficiaries ability to take care of themselves substance abuse depression age mental impairment etc but depending on state law trusts can be designed very flexibly to cover the lifetime of an heir and even their heirs

one piece of documentation that might help here is a confirmation of your benefit selections through your employer for each year since the expenses in question were incurred assuming you have a job with eligibility for benefits   if you can prove which accounts you maintained through your your spouse 's if applicable then it is relatively simple to go back through the records for those specific accounts and see if a specific expense was ever reimbursed   obviously you ca n't prove through documentation that you did n't have accounts that do n't exist this seems like it would be more important for the accounts elected by a significant other since i believe reimbursements from an account in your name would typically be reported to the irs on your behalf anyway also keep in mind that the irs wo n't care about each line item individually   their focus will be on whether for any given snapshot in time your total reimbursed amount exceeded your total eligible expenses
