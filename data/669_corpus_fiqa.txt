william r is a momentum indicator used for measuring overbought and oversold levels it is not used to predict the price of a stock in fact william r like all momentum indicators is a lagging indicator meaning the indicator level changes as the price of the stock changes it ranges from 0 to -100 usually when a reading is less than the stock can be considered to be oversold and when the reading is above -20 the stock can be considered overbought when viewed together with the price chart this can help provide a trader with entry and exit points into and out of a trade

a stock insurance company is structured like a normal company it has shareholders that are the company 's investors who elect a board of directors who select the senior who manage the people who run the actual company the directors and thus the executives and employees have a legal responsibility to manage the company in a way which is beneficial for the shareholders since the shareholders are the ultimate owner of the company a mutual insurance company is similar except that the people holding policies are also the shareholders that is the policyholders are the ultimate owners of the company and there generally are n't separate shareholders who are just investing in the company these shareholders elect the board of directors who select the senior who manage the people who run the actual company in practice it probably does n't really make a whole lot of difference since even if you 're just a customer and not an owner of the company the company is still going to want to attract customers and act in a reasonable way toward them also insurance companies are generally pretty heavily regulated in terms of what they can do because governments really like them to remain solvent it may be comforting to know that in a mutual insurance company the higher ups are explicitly supposed to be working in your best interest though rather than in the interest of some random investors some might object that being a shareholder may not give you a whole lot more rights than you had before see for example this article from the boston globe at mutual insurance firms big money for insiders but no say for policyholders it has grown into something else entirely an opaque poorly understood and often immensely profitable world in which some executives and insiders operate with minimal scrutiny and no coincidence often reap maximum personal rewards policyholders despite their status as owners have no meaningful oversight of how mutual companies spend their money whether to lower rates pay dividends or fund executive salaries and perks and few avenues to challenge such decisions another reason that one might not like the conversion is the specific details of how the current investor shareholders are being paid back for their investment in the process of the conversion to mutual ownership and what that might do to the funds on hand that are supposed to be there to keep the firm solvent for the policyholders from another boston globe article on the conversion of sbli to a mutual company insurer sbli wants to get banks out of its business professor robert wright is cautiously optimistic but wants to ensure the prior shareholders are n't overpaid robert wright a professor in south dakota who has studied insurance companies and owns an sbli policy said he would prefer the insurer to be a mutual company that does n’t have to worry about the short term needs of shareholders but he wants to ensure that sbli does n’t overpay the banks for their shares it ’s fine as long as it ’s a fair price he said that article also gives sbli 's president 's statement as to why they think it 's a good thing for policyholders if the banks remained shareholders they would be likely to demand a greater share of the profits and eat into the dividends the insurance company currently pays to the policyholders about half of whom live in massachusetts said jim morgan president of based sbli we ’re trying to protect the policyholders from having the dividends diluted morgan said i 'm not sure there 's an obvious pros cons list for either way but i 'd think that i 'd prefer the mutual approach just on the principle that the policyholders ought to be the owners because the directors and thus the executives and employees are then legally required to manage the company in the best interest of the policyholders i did cast a yes vote in my proxy on whether sbli ought to become a mutual company i 'm a sbli term life but policy terms are n't changing and it 'd be hard to tell for sure how it 'd impact any dividends i assume the whole life policies must be the ones to pay dividends or company solvency either way since it 's not like we 'll get to run a scientific experiment trying it out both ways i doubt you 'd have a lot of regrets either way whether it becomes a mutual company and you wish it had n't or it does n't become one and you wish it had

here is what i have learned with multiple close encounters with bankruptcies ask yourself what if i save vs what if i spend say you like a new shirt ask yourself what can you do saving $ 40 vs rewarding yourself your well right away you will end up spending just like you the other person needs money he she is doing a work ask yourself what if you are in his her situation you would obviously want others to be happy so spend i think these two should be good i must add that you should not be wasteful eg buying a handmade shoes vs corporation made shoes choose handmade one because it fits above two buying a corporate one would be more polluting and less rewarding because you just gave your money to someone who already has lots and cares least about you in what way are you saying mortgage is good i see that as a waste you can pay back your mortgage only when someone takes even bigger mortgage check with some maths before refuting in other words you have taken part in ponzi scheme i would suggest making a house vs buying one is better spending finally spending is a best saving do n't forget that you are getting money only because someone is spending wisely stop feeding your money to corporates and interests and everyone will have plenty to spend

what do you want to do with your degree   corporate finance investment banking wealth management   it all depends on that having said that here are some ideas that are useful in a wide variety of scenarios   1 accounting accounting accounting whether you are at an i bank or a mid cap consumer goods company knowing as much accounting as possible can be hugely helpful i ve interviewed for jobs at all kinds of companies and one thing that always works on interviewers is showing them you have intimate knowledge of accounting rules   2 excel information system courses knowing excel inside and out and/or some of the more widely used information systems out there can give you a nice little bump in interviews   3 statistics statistics teaches you how to think even if you never run a regression again in your life some of the general principles you learn in stats are absolutely priceless not just for work but for knowing why you need to control for variables why samples work etc can be a hugely helpful thing not just at work but in dealing with life decisions and sorting through information   some people here are telling you to learn how to program that 's useful if you want to be a quant or if you want to keep the door open to potentially moving into a quant data analytics job in the future and that 's about it companies hire software engineers to do the coding if you intend to work as an investment banker or a wealth manager for example java wo nt help you a lick let the engineers worry about writing the code focus on the stuff that actually moves your career forward and do nt try to be everything if you absolutely want to do something software related then learn sql at least in some shops particularly corporate finance jobs you might from time to time be able to use it to query some database or another although again at most companies there are entire armies of well paid people providing the necessary interfaces and tools to prevent you from having to do that

in any country individuals and shops can reject any form of payment that is not legal tender defined by law as a payment form that must be accepted shops are typically more generous because they want to do business with you but individuals are in a different position in france only official coins and bills are declared as legal tender so if they do n't want to individuals do n't even need to accept bank transfers this is for doubts you need to pay in addition as you are not forced to do business with them people and shops can require whatever they feel like to require if you want to buy their car they can ask you to stand on your head and spit coins and if you do n't like it they do n't sell to you they wo n't do much business then probably

i would like to add to the answer provided by dheer i think under some you need not pay premium after 3 years and you can take the money back after 5 years something like that read your policy statement of course since the money is invested in stock markets and since generally people say the longer money stays in stocks the better you can keep the money with them without taking it back and without paying any further premium that way whatever you paid will be invested and you can get it back later when you feel you will make a profit

is your mother still paying the premiums or are you if you 're paying the premiums then just contact the company and say you are no longer willing to pay and want to cancel the policy if she 's paying the premiums why do you care if the issue is the non smoking declaration and you are a smoker or want to take up smoking i do n't know what country you live in but i 'd be surprised if there 's a law anywhere that gives your mother the legal authority to forbid you from smoking when you are over 18 if you are paying the premiums then contact the insurance company and tell them that you are no longer a non smoker the premiums may go up if she is paying the premiums tell her that you are now a smoker and that she should contact the insurance company about changing this clause in the policy if she wants to be sure it remains valid if she declines to do this that 's between her and the insurance company as you 're not a party to the contract it really has nothing to do with you if as you say your mother is not fully capable of managing her affairs you could contact the insurance company for her i do n't see how you could get the policy invalidated unless there is some evidence that the life insurance company made false claims or somehow tricked your mother into buying the policy or that the policy violates local law there is nothing invalid about it just because you 've decided you do n't want the policy does n't make it invalid likewise i do n't see how you could get the premiums refunded the whole point of life insurance is that you pay a monthly premium and if and when you die they pay the beneficiary the face value of the policy life insurance is often described as a kind of gambling game the insurance company is betting that you will live long enough to pay more in premiums than they pay out in benefits you are betting that you will get more in benefits than you pay in premiums if you die young you win if you could wait and see if you die within some time period and if not demand your premiums back well that would be like saying that you want to bet on a spin of the roulette wheel and if you win you take your winnings and if you lose you want to get your original bet back what casino would agree to that you should be able to cancel the policy at any time i suppose there might be some specific commitment in the contract like you pledge not to cancel within x years if you never signed it i do n't see how you could be obligated to pay for it regardless of what commitments your mother made i do n't know where you live or your country 's laws but i doubt your mother can sign a contract legally committing you to pay for something for the rest of your life you say it 's a whole life policy which means it should have some cash value if you cancel it i.e. you get some money back not everything you and/or your mother paid in but something

usually not the total interest but all interest accrued and unpaid to date this is called the loan payoff amount and repays the bank their principal plus the true cost of capital on that principal since your last amortized payment which is probably never since you just signed the loan papers there may also be a prepayment penalty this is something that should have been disclosed to you if it exists but it 's fairly rare in u.s. mortgages anymore   the theory is the bank got the money they paid you at the start of the loan by selling a bond package backed by your mortgage and others of similar credit history and/or about the same time a mortgage backed security by turning around and paying early you meet your obligation but the bank is now stuck with at least 10 years of quarterly coupon payments on that bond which they were expecting to pay using your mortgage interest for their trouble you would pay an additional amount that either covers their call price on the portion of the bonds used for your principal or simply buys them the time to re issue a new mortgage using your repaid principal to back the bond again in the modern housing market such a prepayment penalty is very rare because so many lenders are willing to give you a mortgage without one and so many buyers balk at the thought of having to pay more if they pay early the whole point is to pay less by paying early just something to look up in your mortgage documentation

the home owner does not start foreclosure the bank decides when to foreclose   therefore you can not really decide a time to foreclose if you are trying to time the decision the process you miss payments and the banks will send you a late notice for the missing payments   expect many notices the bank will call you at home on your cell phone and at work   they will mail you letters regarding the missing payments if you continue to miss payments the bank will probably demand the loan be paid in full   you will owe the bank the full balance of the principle all past due interest all past due late charges and junk fees   the bank wo n't even take a normal monthly payment from you should you try to pay your regular payment again some law enforcement will notify you on the bank 's intent to foreclose   the bank has begun legal proceedings legal notices are published in the local newspaper soon the notices and the legal waiting period will expire   court proceedings happen   the court will then allow the bank to foreclose notices to into the paper again about the updated status of the foreclosure the house is sold at auction money from the auction is used to pay taxes owned then mortgages then other liens or creditors who file further debt for the home owner taxes when sold if the mortgage debt exceeds the home 's fair market value us federal tax rules say the selling price as the fair market value the fair market value can still be higher than the tax basis which i think is the value of the house at the time of original purchase plus improvements    if the fair market value is higher you will own taxes on sale   however tax rules in the us say if you have owned the home more than two years and make less than $ 250,000 in the transaction $ 500,000 if married you will not owe any tax   state taxes can be different additionally if the mortgage lender the debt and does n't create a deficiency that income is taxable as well   this is more an more common these days   there are exceptions if the home is your primary residence this whole process an take several months to occur but depends on where you live   if you continue to live in the home after the auction the new owner must evict you from the property which is another set of legal proceedings your credit and ability to buy are home will be damaged for the next several years i am not so sure on how pmi works for the banks but i know they are getting some money back

you could buy bitcoins they are even more deflationary than swiss francs   but the exchange rate is currently high and so is the risk in case of volatility   so maybe buy an altcoin instead see altcoin market capitalization for more information basically all you 'd be doing is changing into bitcoin altcoin   you do n't need a bank to store it you do n't need to stockpile cash at home   stays liquid there 's no stock portfolio albeit a coin portfolio unlike in stocks there are no noteworthy buy and sell commissions and the central bank ca n't just change the bills as in classic cash currency   the only risk is volatility in the coin market which is not a small risk   should coins have been going down then for as long as you do n't need that money and keep some for use on a bank account you can just wait until said coins re climb volatility goes both ways after all

my answer will suck but it comes from someone who has been married you ca n't control another person or convince them to do something   what you can do is identify what they value and show how saving money increases their opportunities in what they value but understand that the person could see what you 're saying as invalid too   if you 're single and reading this this is why you verify that the person has similar values to you think of it like someone who wants good gas mileage you show them a car that gets and immediately they say well but that 's not a cool car   so their value is n't the miles per gallon and you may find the same is true with your spouse   india is paying more interest than the us and europe in their savings accounts i believe the benchmark interest rate is 7.5 so assuming your spouse values more money showing him how to use money in savings to passively earn money might be a technique that works   but it may mean nothing to him because it 's 1 not his actual value or 2 is n't enough to matter in his mind in other words this is all sales and whatever you do and this is regardless of gender do n't manipulate as in the long run that tends to build resentment   if there is a specific problem that you know he sees as a major issue and saving money can help i 'd recommend showing how savings would help with that problem   people generally like solutions to problems just remember what you think he sees as a problem may not be what he sees as a problem   this is why i chuckle when i see single people give married people advice you ca n't just convince the person enough because you are not that person we have to speak their language and we should be careful to avoid creating resentment the part that sucks or does n't depending on who you ask is that if we ca n't convince others to do it we should do it ourselves   either 1 earn money independently yourself when applicable realizing that you are about to have a child and may be limited or 2 save the money that you and your spouse have agreed that you 're allotted if this applies to your situation a few spouses divide income even when one is an earner

the book value is total assets minus total liabilities and so if you increase the total assets without changing the total liabilities the difference gets bigger and thus higher consider if a company had total assets of $ 4 and total liabilities of $ 3 so the book value is $ 1 now if the company adds $ 2 to the assets then the difference would be 4 + 2 and last time i checked 3 is greater than 1 on definitions here are a couple of links to clarify that side of things from investopedia equity = assets liabilities from ready ratios shareholders equity = total assets total liabilities or shareholders equity = share capital + retained earnings treasury    shares depending on what the reinvestment bought there could be several possible outcomes if the company bought assets that appreciated in value then that would increase the equity if the company used that money to increase sales by expanding the marketing department then the future calculations could be a bit trickier and depend on what assumptions one wants to make really if you need an example of the latter imagine playing a game where i get to make up the rules and change them at will do you think you 'd win at some point it would depend on how i want the game to go and thus is n't something that you could definitively say one way or the other

the short answer is that you would want to use the net inflow or net outflow aka profit or loss    in my experience you 've got a couple different uses for irr and that may be driving the confusion   pretty much the same formula but just coming at it from different angles    thinking about a stock or mutual fund investment you could project a scenario with an up front investment net outflow in the first period and then positive returns dividends then final sale proceeds each a net inflow in subsequent periods   this is a model that more closely follows some of the logic you laid out thinking about a business project or investment you tend to see more complicated and less smooth cashflows   for example you may have a large up front capital expenditure in the first period then have net profit revenue less ongoing maintenance expense then another large capital outlay and so on    in both cases you would want to base your analysis on the net inflow or net outflow in each period   it just depends on the complexity of the cashflows trend as to whether you see a straightforward example initial payment then ongoing net inflows or a less straightforward example with both inflows and outflows    one other thing to note you would only want to include those costs that are applicable to the project   so you would not want to include the cost of overhead that would exist even if you did not undertake the project

i have managed two ira accounts one i inherited from my wife 's 401 k and my own 's   i managed actively my wife 's 401 at which does n't restrict on options except level 5 as naked puts and calls i moved half of my funds to tdameritrade the only broker authorized by my employer to open a self directed account   however my 457 plan disallows me from using a cash secured puts only covered calls   for those who does not know investing i resent the contention that participants to these iras should not be messing around with their ira funds   for years i left my funds with my current fund custodian great west financial   i checked it 's current values once or twice a year these last years the market in the last 2 quarters of 2015 and another dive early january and february of 2016   i lost a total of $ 40 k leaving my portfolio with my current custodian choosing all 30 products they offer 90 of them are etfs and the rest are bonds if you do n't know investing better leave it with the pros right   but no one can predict the future of the market   even the pros are at the mercy of the market so i you know how to invest and choose your stocks i do n't think your plan administrator has to limit you on how you manage your funds for example if you are not allowed to place a cash secured puts and you just buy the stocks or eft at market or even limit order you buy the securities at their market value if you sell a cash secured puts against the stocks etf you are interested in buying you will receive a credit in fraction of a dollar in a specific time frame   in average your cost to owning a stock etf is lesser if you buy it at market or even a limit order   most of the participants of the ira funds rely too much on their portfolio manager because they do n't know how to manage if you try to educate yourself at a minimum you will have a good understanding of how your ira funds are tied up to the market   if you know how to trade in bear market compared to bull market then you are good at managing your investments   when i started contributing to my employer 's deferred comp account as a public employee i have no idea of how my portfolio works   year after year as i looked at my investment i was happy because it continued to grow   without how much it grew yearly and my regular payroll contribution i am happy even it only grew 2 per year   and at this age that i am ready to retire at 60 i started taking investment classes and attended pre retirement seminars   then i knew that it was not totally a good decision to leave your retirement funds in the hands of the portfolio manager since they do n't really care if it tanked out on some years as long at overall it grew to a meager because they managers are pretty conservative on picking the equities they invest   you can generalize that maybe 90 of ira investors do n't know about investing and have poor decision making actions which securities etf to buy and hold for those who would like to remain as one that is fine   but for those who spent time and money to study and know how to invest i do n't think the plan manager can limit the participants ability to manage their own portfolio especially if the funds have no matching from the employer like mine all i can say to all who have ira or any retirement accounts educate yourself early because if you leave it all to your portfolio managers you lost a lot   do n't believe much in what those commercial fund managers also show in their presentation just to move your funds for them to manage   be proactive   if you start learning how to invest now when you are young just do it

consider firstly that they 're penny stocks for a reason the company just is n't worth much yes it could take off but this happenstance is rarer than you think next there is the problem of how you 'd find out what the good stocks to invest in are here in the uk reliable news about stocks outside the ftse indexes aim is hard to come by also consider than there is n't the supply and demand for these stocks in the same way as there is in the main indexes even if you were to make a tidy profit over time you might lose what you made in the delay selling the stock start ups also have the problem of poor cash reserves so new employees are often given stock options in lieu of cash which further depresses the share price i read a report once that said that only 1 in 10 penny shares yields a worthwhile return i just do n't like these odds so i tend to avoid

there are many good brokers available in the market and many spammers too personally i have been associated with since 2001 and have never faced any problem but everyone has their own personal choice and i recommend you to make your own but the question is how to find out which broker is a good broker and would provide you with a timely and reliable service online google check not really there is so much competition between brokerage firms that they keep writing rubbish about each other on blogs and websites best thing is to is check with regulator 's website for us is a regulator for all forex firms information about any regulated forex firm could be found here for uk its fsa information on all regulated uk based firm could be found here remember in many countries its not compulsory for a forex firm to be regulated but being regulated ensure that the govt has a watch on the operations of the firm also most of the firms out there provide accounts for large as well as small traders so there is nothing much to look for even if you are a small trader do keep in mind that if you are a us citizen you are restricted by the us govt to trade only with a broker within us you are not allowed to trade with any brokerage firm that is based outside the country forex trading involves a significant amount of risk make sure you study the markets well and get yourself educated properly before risking your money while i have made a lot of money trading forex i have seen a lot of people loosing everything please understand the risk and please make sure you only trade with the money which you can afford to loose

as other answers state selling the options contracts to the market is a definite way out and probably the best in most cases   if you 're determined to exercise your options or there 's not enough liquidity to reasonably sell your contracts to the market then you could plan ahead and exercise smaller number of contracts at a time and sell the resulting position in the underlying which will give you funds to exercise some more contracts and sell the underlying     if you think you 're going down this path however make sure that you take into account your broker 's rules for settlement   you may need to start the exercise sell cycle before the option 's expiration date

you can not claim back vat what happens is that if you sell goods with vat and charge customers vat you would have to send that vat straight to hmrc but if your business itself paid vat then you already paid vat so you have to send less   as an example if you send an invoice for £ 10,000 plus £ 2,000 vat and you paid yourself £ 500 vat on business related expenses then you need to send £ 2,000 £ 500 = £ 1,500 to hmrc   but if you do n't send invoices including vat then you owe hmrc £ 0 any vat you paid on business related expenses is lost hmrc wo n't pay you money   btw only vat on business related expenses can be deducted so if you want to be smart register for vat and get the vat on your weekly shopping bill refunded forget it

couple points 1 since the roth is after tax you can effectively contribute more than you could with the traditional ira before hitting the limits so in your example if you had extra money you wanted to invest in an ira you could invest up to $ more into the roth but only $ 500 more into the traditional current limits are $ 5,500 per year for single filers under 50 your example assumes that you have exactly $ 3,750 in spare money looking for an ira home   2 the contributions but not earnings can be withdrawn from the roth at any time penalty and tax free   3 the tax rate lock in can be significant especially early on when you are at a relatively low tax bracket say 15 but expect to be higher at retirement   4 traditional iras and 401(k are taxed as ordinary income so you go through the tax brackets even if the marginal rate is 25 the effective rate may be lower if you have a roth conceivably you could reduce the amount you need to withdrawal from the trad to reduce the effective tax rate on those of course subject to minimum distributions and all that this is more an argument to have a mix of pre- and post tax retirement accounts than strictly a pro roth reason

usually that is the case that when fixed rates are lower than the variable rates it is an indication that the banks feel the next movement in rates could be down you also need to look at the fixed rates for different periods for example 1 year fixed compared to 3 year fixed and 5 year fixed rates if you find the 3 and 5 year fixed rates are higher than the 1 year fixed rates this could be an indication that the banks feel rates will fall in the short term but the falls wo n't last long and will continue to rise after a year or so if the 3 year fixed rates are also low in comparison then the banks may feel that the economy is heading for a longer term down trend the banks wo n't want to lose out so will change their fixed rates on their perception of where they feel the economy is headed since your post in may 2011 the standard variable rate has since dropped twice in november and december to be at you will also find that fixed rates have also been dropped further by the banks indicating additional future cuts in the variable rates regards victor

the short version of jb king 's excellent answer is that the company will typically buy back shares from the open market at market price sometimes it will specifically target larger stakeholders even controlling interests who are making noise that they want to divest if such an investor were to just dump their stock on the open market neither the investor nor the company would be very happy with the resulting price collapse in those cases the company may offer an incentive price above market rates in recent times the investor looking to divest has often been the u.s. government who received stock in return for bailouts and with notable exceptions turned a modest profit on many of them not enough to break even on the entire bailout but the government did n't just throw $ 700 billion in taxpayer money down a hole as conservative pundits would have you believe in the 80s a specific type of buy back was made famous called the leveraged buyout basically the company took out a huge loan against itself and used that money to buy up all the company 's publicly traded shares essentially becoming a private company this became a popular tool among private equity groups for better and worse

i have n't dealt with this kind of thing in any way but i found some quotes from irs publications which i think are relevant and hopefully help your scenario sounds to me like a qualified tuition reduction as described in publication 970 tax benefits for education it appears the rules are different for graduate study as opposed to pre graduate work though i do n't see anything about any dollar amount limit there are various requirements and exceptions so hopefully reading through that section of the publication can help you understand whether the benefit is supposed to be taxable if taxable it should show up on your w-2 like any other income any tuition reduction that is taxable should be included as wages on your form w-2 box 1 report the amount from form w-2 box 1 on line 7 form 1040 or form 1040a or line 1 form 1040ez   it does n't appear that there is any special designation or box for the tuition reduction as opposed to normal work it just is income that 's been earned like any other if you need guidance on how much of the income is for normal work and how much is for the tuition reduction you probably need to see if you can figure it out from her pay stubs or contact the university 's hr department well looking through the credits i see in publication 970 there appear to be two possible credits the american opportunity credit section under no double benefit allowed says things like my emphasis added you ca n't do any of the following   my understanding from reading through the section is that expenses are only excluded if they were tax free so that there ca n't be a double dipping of benefits if they 're included as taxable income i think they would count under your second interpretation that the employer paid them like any other income and your wife spent them as educational expenses just like other students and they would qualify for educational credits in fact it explicitly states do n't reduce qualified education expenses by amounts paid with funds the student receives as which sure sounds to me that anything that counts as w-2 box 1 wages would be payments received that then the expenses were logically paid separately from the other credit the lifetime learning credit appears to use identical language no double benefits and do n't reduce by wages obviously this is just from my looking through publication 970 there may be more nuances here and for real advice you may want to speak more to the university hr department who perhaps have dealt with this before and/or a real tax advisor you might also see if you can get any sort of a receipt or even a form 1098-t from the university of what amount was paid on your wife 's behalf to help document it is truly that she was just paid more wages and spent them on classes as far as tax law is concerned

refinancing a car for anything other than lowering the rate is not a good idea keep the same term or take a shorter one remember that unlike real property a car only loses value   so when you make your payments on your 84 month loan those payments are amortized so that the interest is front loaded the problem is when your car gets around month 24 insurance will generally only pay what the car is worth and you 'll owe more

an llc does not pay taxes on profits as regards tax a llc is treated as a partnership but instead of partners they are called members the llc is a passthrough entity as in partnerships members can have a different percentage ownership to the share of profits the llc reports the share of the profits of the members then the members pay the tax as an individual the profit of the llc is deemed to have been transferred to the members regardless of any funds transferred this is often the case as the llc may need to retain the profits for use in the business late paying customers may mean there is less cash in the llc than is available to distribute   the first answer is wrong only a c corporation files a tax return all other corporate structures are passthrough entities the c corporation pays corporation tax and is not required to pass any funds to the shareholders if the c corporation passes funds to the shareholders this is a dividend and taxable to the shareholder hence double taxation

i use tiaa cref for my 403(b and fidelity for my solo 401(k and iras   i have previously used vanguard and have also used other discount brokers for my ira all of these companies will charge you nothing for an ira so there 's really no point in comparing cost in that respect   they are all the cheapest in this respect each one will allow you to purchase their mutual funds and those of their partners for free   they will charge you some kind of fee to invest in mutual funds of their competitors like $ 35 or something   so the real question is this which of these institutions offers the best mutual and index funds   while they are not the worst out there you will find that tiaa cref are dominated by both vanguard and fidelity   the latter two offer far more and larger funds and their funds will always have lower expense ratios than their tiaa cref equivalent   if i could take my money out of tiaa cref and put it in fidelity i 'd do so right now btw you may or may not want to buy individual stocks or etfs in your account   vanguard will let you trade their etfs for free and they have lots   for other etfs and stocks you will pay $ 7 or so depends on your account size   fidelity will give you free trades in the many ishares etfs and charge you $ 5 for other trades   tiaa cref will not give you any free etfs and will charge you $ 8 per trade each of these will give you investment advice for free but that 's about what it 's worth as well   the quality of the advice will depend on who picks up the phone not which institution you use   i would not make a decision based on this

a budget is different for every person   there are families making $ 40k yr who will budget to spend it all but a family making $ 100 k of course will have a different set of spending limits for most items my own approach is to start by tracking every cent keep a notebook for a time 3 months minimum note for homeowners a full year is what it takes to capture the seasonal expenses   this approach with help you see where the money is going and adjust accordingly the typical goal is to spend less than you make saving x% for retirement etc the most important aspect is to analyze how much money is getting spent on wasteful items the $ 5 coffee the $ 10 lunch the $ magazines etc one can decide the $ 5 coffee is a social event done with a friend and that 's fine so long as it 's a mindful decision i 've watched the person in front of me at the supermarket put 4 magazines down on the counter if she has $ 20 to burn that 's her choice   see where can i find an example of a really basic family budget for other responses

to me this sounds like a transaction where e already owns a company worth 400k and can therefore pocket the money from d and give d 25 of the profits every year there is nothing objective like a piece of paper that states the company is worth 400k. it is all about perceived value some investors may think it is worth something because of some knowledge they may have heck the company could be worth nothing but the investor could have some sentimental value associated to it so is it actually the case that e 's company is worth 400k only after the transaction it is worth what someone pays for it when they pay for it i the 400 k valuation is subjective in return the investor is getting 25 ownership of the product or company the idea is that when someone has ownership they have a vested interest in it being successful in that case the investor will do whatever he she can to improve the chances of success in addition to supplying the 100 k capital for instance the investor will leverage their network or perhaps put more money into it in the future is the 100k added to the balance sheet as cash perhaps it is an asset that may later be used to fund inventory for instance and would the other 300k be listed as an ip asset no see what i said about the valuation just being perception note that the above analysis does n't apply to all dragons den deals it only applies to situations where capital is exchanged for ownership in the form of equity

you have several questions in your post so i 'll deal with them individually is taking small sums from your ira really that detrimental i mean as far as tax is concerned percentage wise you pay the tax on the amount plus a 10 penalty plus the opportunity cost of the gains that the money would have gotten   at 6 growth annually in 5 years that 's more than a 34 loss   there are much cheaper ways to get funds than tapping your ira is n't the 10 penalty really to cover ss and the medicare tax that you did not pay before putting money into your retirement no you still pay ss and medicare on your gross income 401(k contributions just reduce how much you pay in income tax   the 10 penalty is to dissuade you from using retirement money before you retire if i contributed that to my ira before taxes including ss and medicare tax that money would gain 6 interest again you would still pay ss and medicare and like you say there 's no guarantee that you 'll earn 6 on your money   i do n't think you can pay taxes up front when making an early withdrawal from an ira can you   this one you got right   when you file your taxes your ira contributions for the year are totaled up and are deducted from your gross income for tax purposes there 's no tax effect when you make the contribution would it not be better to contribute that $ 5500 to my ira and if i did n't need it great let it grow but if i did need it toward the end of the year do an early withdrawal so what do you plan your tax withholdings against   do you plan on keeping it there reducing your withholdings and pay a big tax bill plus possibly penalties if you need it   or do you plan to take it out and have a big refund when you file your taxes you might be better off saving that up in a savings account during the year and if at the end of the year you did n't use it then make an ira contribution which will lower the taxes you pay   do n't use your ira as a hopeful savings account so if i needed to withdrawal $ 5500 and i am in the 25 tax bracket i would owe the government $ 1925 in 10 penalty so if i withdrew $ to cover the tax and penalty i would then be taxed $ 2600 an additional $ 675 sounds like a cat chasing it 's tail trying to cover the tax yes if you take a withdrawal to pay the taxes if you pay the tax with non retirement money then the cycle stops how can i make a withdrawal from an ira without having to pay tax on tax pay cash for the tax and penalty rather then taking another withdrawal to pay the tax   if you ca n't afford the tax and penalty in cash then do n't withdraw at all based on this year 's w-2 form i had an accountant do my taxes and the $ 27 k loan was added as earned income then in another block there was the $ 2700 amount for the penalty so you paid 25 in income tax for the earned income and an additional 10 penalty   so in your case it was a 35 overall tax instead of the 40 rule of thumb since many people are in 28 and 35 tax brackets the bottom line is it sounds like you are completely unorganized and have absolutely no margin to cover any unexpected expenses   i would stop contributing to retirement today until you can get control of your spending get on a budget and stop trying to use your ira as a piggy bank   if you do n't plan on using the money for retirement then do n't put it in an ira   stop borrowing from it and getting into further binds that force you to make bad financial decisions you do n't go into detail about any other aspects mortgage car loans consumer debt to even begin to know where the real problem is   so you need to write everything down that you own and you owe write out your monthly expenses and income and figure out what you can cut if needed in order to build up some cash savings until then you 're driving across country in a car with no tires worrying about which highway will give you the best gas mileage

you can take a shortcut and make a few cumulative transactions maybe just estimate how much of your spending landed in each of your budget categories but you will lose a lot of the value that you were building for yourself by tracking your spending during the earlier months i reconcile my budget and categorize my spending on a monthly basis it 's always a chore to pull out the big stack of receipts and plow through them but i 've learned the value of having an accurate picture of where all my money went there is no clean way to fake it you can either take the time and reconcile your spending or you can take a short cut it probably renders your efforts to track everything from the beginning of the year invalid though if you want to start over this month as you did at the beginning of the year that would probably be a cleaner way to reconcile things

as i understand it capital gains from real estate sales in india can be shielded from income tax entirely if the proceeds of the sale are invested in certain specific types of bonds rural highway authority of india for a period of three years beginning no later than x months 6 months after completion of the sale perhaps this applies to sales of inherited real estate only and not to commercial property or residential property acquired by purchase since there is no step up of basis on death as occurs in the us and in all likelihood records of the purchase price of the inherited property are lost in the of time and so the basis of the investment is effectively zero or treated as such by the revenue authorities the interest paid by these bonds is included in taxable income perhaps will be willing to correct any mistakes in the above so it may be necessary to check whether a the interest income from the bonds was declared on form 1040 schedule b for each year b whether the appropriate boxes the ones that ask whether the taxpayer has signature authority over foreign accounts etc were checked on schedule b or not c whether form td 90 22.1 was filed each year or not this is the fbar requirement note that if the total value of the accounts is less than us $ 10 k during the entire year then the taxpayer is supposed to check no on schedule b and need not file form td 90 22.1   also there is a separate requirement to file a form 8938 for certain specific types of investments   there was a two part article describing these rules in forbes magazine some time ago and this is available on line part 1 and   part ii as says the irs might be lenient if the only issue is not filing the forms in timely fashion and the taxpayer is voluntarily coming into compliance even though the filing is late they are likely to be less   forgiving if the foreign income was not reported and still remains unreported even after filing the various forms

india 's a very interesting case study they 're economy 's exploded and grown by leaps and bounds in the last decade it 's a free market but the reserve bank of india 's get 's weird sometimes    for instance a lot of these crappy and defaulting loans are because the government reserve bank of india said to fuel growth you have to make sure a certain percentage of your loan book is made out industries we want to develop so huge loans were made to construction firms not because they fit the risk profile of the bank or were good investments but cause the government mandated it ton 's of horribly run companies got money they should n't have   also public banks pay a lot less than their private counterparts so you do n't have the best and brightest handing out these loans    india 's a fucking mess of laws like there 's no codified way to declare bankruptcy like there is in the west so if a company goes belly up they have to go through this of different government offices with contradictory rules so creditors in many cases the banks that lent them money can get some of their money back imf said it takes 4.5 years on average for a company to go through bankruptcy proceedings that 's insane   and because it 's india there 's a ton of shady shit going on behind the scenes up until 2 3 years ago loans that the banking industry considers non performing interest payments have n't been made in 90 days were lumped in another category and hidden in the balance sheet so the rest of the world looked at this said well their ratio is only 3 4 which is fine for developing country and continued to rate them highly it was n't until recently that we figured out the entire banking sector was n't reporting their bad loans properly

as weird as it seems 5 years is not a long term investment   furthermore investing is about accepting risk   based on your criteria for the alternative to a down payment i think your only choice is to make the larger down payment if however you were willing to invest that money for the long term in a retirement account or an educational account for example then i would definitely encourage you to invest   i think the chance that a long term investment in a diversified investment account will exceed 3.25 is pretty high   however that is only my opinion and i am not so your let your personal tolerance to risk be your guide but again based on the way you asked it down payment all the way   your time frame means you are not an investor   therefore your only option for risk free storage of money is an fdic insured account which might pay a little less than 1 for the next 5 years   a bigger down payment will have a 3.25 return in this case in that order   4 and 5 could be swapped if the interest rate on the loans is really low

it also reduces risk from the bank 's eyes believe it or not they do lose out when people do n't pay on their mortgages take the big 3 wells chase and boa if they have 50 million mortgages between the 3 of them and 20 of people at one point wo n't be able to pay their mortgage due to loss of income or other factors this presents a risk factor although interest payments are still good reducing their principal and interest keeps them tied down for additional or sometimes shorter time but now they are more likely to keep getting those payments that 's why credit cards back in 07 and 08 reduced limits for customers the risk factor is huge now for these financial institutions do your research sometimes a refi is n't the best option sometimes it is

the earnings portion will be taxed at your marginal tax rate + 10 penalty if the total is $ 100 then the earnings portion is probably not very significant for this to be a concern but it 's something you could put into a roth ira and let it compound with the rest of your retirement savings depending on your age the compounding effect of $ 100 invested early enough tax free can be thousands of dollars at retirement i.e. you have 60 days to deposit it into a roth ira do n't let that pass you by

what you want to do is figure out how much you 're paying in interest solely ie the interest part of each payment add that up over 48 months then figure out the net value of the cash inflow outflow for the points over 48 months ie 3.5 annual return on the positive or negative value   sum those two   then you can see your p&l and your total cash outflow up to you if you add a to your negative initial outflow and how exactly you consider your $ 2k closing costs i agree with joetaxpayer about adding at least closing costs to the loan amount   if you have money to pay the points that would otherwise be earning money you could alternately consider it a negative cash ie instead of accruing 3.5 it 's a negative balance accruing that in excel i 'd do something like then track changes in h and i when you change columns b and c and g.

there are too many nuances to the question asked to explore fully but here are a few points to keep in mind if you are a cash basis taxpayer most individuals are then you are not required to pay taxes on the money that has been billed but not received as yet   if you operate on an accrual basis then the income accrues to you the day you perform the service and not on the day you bill the client you can make four equal payments of estimated tax on the due dates and if these together with any income tax withholding from wage paying jobs are at least 90 of your tax liability for that year then you owe no penalties for underpayment of tax regardless of how your income varied over the year if your income does vary considerably over the year even for people who only have wages but who invest in mutual funds the income can   vary quite a bit since mutual funds typically declare dividends and capital gains in december then you can pay different amounts in each quarterly installment of estimated tax this is called the method a part of form 2210 that is best avoided unless you really need to use it   your annualized income for the payment due on june 15 is 2.4 = times your taxable income through may 31 thus on form 2210 you are allowed to assume that your average monthly taxable income   through may 31 will continue for the rest of the year you then compute the tax due on that annualized income and you are supposed to have paid at least 45 of that amount by june 15 similarly for september 15 for which you look at income through august 31 you use a multiplier of 1.5 = and need to pay of the tax on the annualized income and so on   if you these numbers and pay too little tax in any installment then you owe penalties for that quarter   most people find that the tax due for the entire year and paying it in equal installments is simpler than keeping track of nuances of the annualized method even simpler is to pay 100 of last year 's tax in four equal installments 110 for high earners and then no penalty is due at all if your business is really taking off and your income is going to be substantially higher in one year then this of last year 's tax deal could allow you to postpone a significant chunk of your tax bill till april 15

whether your financial status is considered ok depends on your aspirations   you are n't spending more than you earn and have no debt   that puts you in the category of ok in my book but the information in your post indicates that you would benefit from some financial grand sounds like a lot of money to have in a bank unless you are on the verge of spending it financial advisors come in various shapes and sizes   many will charge you a lot for what turns out to be helpful advice in the first meeting but very little value added thereafter   some do n't have the best incentives they may be incentivized to encourage you to put your money into certain funds for example there are many financial advisors of sorts that you have access to that wo n't cost you anything   for example if you have a 401(k at work i bet there is a representative from the plan administrator that will meet with you for free   if you open a brokerage account or ira at any place fidelity vanguard etc you can easily talk with one of their reps and get all sorts of advice   my personal take is to meet with anyone who will meet with me for free but not to pay anyone for this service   it 's too easy to get good advice and paying for it does n't guarantee that you get better advice your financial situation will depend primarily on a few things you have not mentioned here   for example how much are you setting aside for retirement and what are your retirement goals   this is something lots of people can give you advice on but we do n't know what market returns will be going forward so we do n't really know   one bit of advice that may benefit you is how to set aside money for retirement in the most tax advantaged way how much do you feel that you need saved up for large expenses   thinking of starting a family   how many months worth of income are you comfortable having set aside what is your tolerance of risk   if you put your money in risky assets you may make more but you may also actually lose money   those are the questions a financial advisor will ask about   once you have his her advice and after talking to a few advisors you can make your own decision basically your options are rules of thumb save only what makes sense to save in banks given your expected needs for cash put a lot in tax advantaged accounts do n't give uncle sam any gifts then look at financial and real investments there are a number of free resources on the internet   for example   or you can hit up the forums at bogleheads   those guys give and receive financial advice as a hobby   they are n't professionals but you can get a lot of varying ideas and make up your own mind which to me is better than just asking a professional btw regarding the espp these plans often give you a discount on stock and can therefore be a good idea   just be sure you do n't hold the stock longer than you need to   it 's generally a bad idea to concentrate your wealth in any single investment especially one highly correlated with your background risk i.e. if the company does poorly you will already be worse off because you may lose your job or see fewer advancement opportunities no need to add losses in your savings to that   1 please note i am neither advocating nor discouraging buying guns gold or other controversial real assets   i 'm just giving examples of items some people buy as part of their wealth preservation strategy

the total value of the stock market more or less tracks the total value of the companies listed in the stock market which is more or less the total value of the us economy since very few industries are nationalized or dominated by privately held companies the us economy has consistently grown over time thanks to the wonders of industrialization the discovery of new markets new natural resources etc   thus the stock market has continued to grow as well will it forever   no   the united states will not exist for ever   but there 's no obvious reason it wo n't continue to grow at least for a while though of course if i could accurately predict that i would be far richer than i am why do other countries not have the same result   china is its own ball of wax since it 's a sort of market sort of command economy   japan has major issues economically right now and does n't really have the natural or people resources it also had a huge market bubble a while back that it 's never recovered from and many european countries are doing fine   german 's index was at around 2500 in 2004 and is now at nearly   that 's pretty fast growth if you go back further there was a crash ending in around 2004 you can see around the fall of the berlin wall it was still around 2000 even going that far back that 's about an 8 annual bump   the ftse was also around 2000 back then around 8000 now which is around 5 annual growth    many of these indexes were more seriously hurt than the us markets in the two major crashes of this while the us markets fell a lot in 2008 they did n't fall nearly as much as many smaller markets in 2002 so had less to recover from   both dax and ftse suffered similar falls in 2002 to 2008 and so even though during good periods they 've grown quite quickly they have n't overall done as well as they could have given the crashes

as a start up the initial shares can be given at various price points so essentially they can give someone a larger percentage based on the same amount earlier and lesser percentage to someone else for the same amount as its a start up the valuations can be very and what matters is that whether you believe the percentage you got for the amount is right or not    it is very important to note that when you have been given an ownership in the company how that is designated is it in absolute number of shares or is it in terms of percentage based on the existing shares for example you maybe given 100 shares without any qualification or you maybe given a 5 stake in the paid up capital that translates to 100 shares it is always better to hold the shares in of the total shares also read the contract any dilution should require your approval normally start ups once the valuation starts to go up start creating more shares and sell these to private equity or create more shares and give it as a bonus to promoters hence in both cases your holding will keep getting diluted there is a related if a startup can always issue new shares what value is there to stocks options

i know its not legal to have open long and short position on specific security on two stock exchanges nse bse there is nothing illegal about it there are prescribed ways on how this is addressed   in cash segment intra day trades    one can short sell a security if by end of day he does not buy the security it goes into auction the said security is purchased on your behalf any profit or loss arising out of this is charged to you similarly one can buy a security if one does not pay the amount by end of day it would go into auction and sold any profit or loss arising out of this is charged to you if you short sell a security on one exchange you have to buy it on same exchange if you buy on other exchange it will not be adjusted against this short position also is it legal to have long position on stock and short its derivative future option there are no restrictions edit party a shorts 10 shares of hdfc today in intra day cash segment purchased by party b. rather than buying back 10 shares or allowing it to go into auction party a borrows 10 hdfc shares from x via for a period of say 6 months 1 month to 1 year this is recorded as party a obligation to x these 10 borrowed shares are transferred to party b. so party x does n't have any hdfc shares at this point in time however in exchange party x receives fees for borrowing from party a. if there is dividend are declared company pays party b. however recovers identical amount from party a and pays party x. if there is 1:1 split now party a owes party x 20 hdfc shares on maturity after 6 months party a has to buy these from market and given back the borrowed shares to party x. if there are some other corporate actions i.e. mergers the obligation of party a to party x is closed immediately and position settled of course there are provisions whereby party a can pay back the shares earlier or party x can ask for shares earlier and there are rules trades mechanisms to facilitate this

you some of the crime is committed without violence but if the sheep ever complain then the violence is right there to put the boot on their    i would venture to say that far from some in fact the lion 's share of crime is committed without any apparent violence it also goes   overt obvious apparent violence is the hallmark of the petty thief and the petty criminal it is a path of desperation that normally only yields trivial sums   bernie madoff was a far more successful criminal than amp and the impact of his crimes was significantly higher and broader but he used zero violence and naught but fraud   and yet bernie madoff was a compared to the real criminal   that is backed up by violence is violence   yes i would n't dispute that but very often the violence or even the threat thereof is almost entirely non obvious again cf madoff enron worldcom and a host of others   and the of course there are the government based scams schemes which are significantly more profitable and generally stable and non risky for the participants heck fractional reserve banking is and always was nothing more than a fraud ala stone soup and yet the risk especially of prosecution is virtually zero

short term the game is supply demand and how the various participants react to it at various prices on longer term prices start to better reflect the fundamentals within something like week to some month or two if there has not been any unique value affecting news then interest options market swing traders and such play bigger part with intraday the effects of available liquidity become very pronounced the market makers have algos that try to guess what type of client they have and they prefer to give high price to large buyer and low price to small buyer as intraday trader has spreads and commissions big part of their expenses and leverage magnifies those instead of being able to take advantage of the lower prices they prefer to stop out after small move against them in practise this means that when they buy low that low will soon be the midpoint of the day and high etc if they are still holding on buy and sell are similar to long call or long put options position and options are like insurance they cost you also the longer the position is held the more likely it is to end up with someone with ability to test your margin if you 're highly leveraged and constantly making your wins from the same source   risk management is also issue the leveraged pros trade through a company not sure if they 're able to open another such company and still open accounts after the inevitable

as asked previous in the week there is a big difference between budgeting and expense tracking   using software like gnucash allows one to track their spending    a budget is a plan the tracking is what actually happened i do not track expenses although i do budget   for me hitting financial goals is good enough of a track without investing the time and energy into tracking every penny   one could easily criticize my method as how can you have a good plan without continuous feedback for me it is an example of the 80/20 principle   if i put in 20 effort into making and sticking to a budget i will obtain 80 of the financial success that a person who 100 effort into budgeting and tracking   a person with the same income and life events who budgets and tracks will likely be more successful that i however not overwhelmingly so   for me time is better spent on other endeavors   you seem to have this attitude as well but those that do track have it as part of their path to financial success and probably view us as somewhat foolish     this is another example how personal finance is more about behavior than math

i think part of the confusion is due to the age of the term and how money has changed over time relative to being backed by precious metals vs using central banks etc historically because historically the coin itself was precious metal if a change occurred between the face value of the coin and value of the precious metal itself the holder of the coin was less affected since they have the precious metal already in hand they could always trade it based on the metal value instead of the face value otoh if you buy a note worth an the current price of ounce of gold and the price of gold goes up and then the holder wants to redeem the note they end up with less than an ounce of gold in the more modern age   the main concern is the cost to borrow funds to put money into circulation or the gain when it goes out of circulation   the big difference between the two is that bills tend stay in circulation until they wear out have to be bought back and replaced   coins on the other hand last longer but have a tendency to drop out of circulation due to collectors especially with collectible series coins that the mint seems to love to issue lately   this means that bills issued tend to stay in circulation while only a percentage of coins stays in circulation   so the net effect on the money supply is different for the two and since modern is all about the cost to put money in circulation it is different in the case of coins where some percentage will not remain circulating

it ought to be possible to buy a foreign exchange future aka forex future fx future businesses use these futures to make sure their exchange rate is predictable if they put a bunch of money into manufacturing things that 'll be ready a year later it helps to know that the currency exchange rate shifts wo n't wipe out all their profits if you 're willing to take on some of that risk and if things go your way you can make money they are essentially contracts between two private parties to pay each other a certain amount of money based on the movement of the currencies so the chinese government does n't actually need to be involved and no need to change hands you can just trade the contracts note that the exchange rate is currently fixed by the chinese government so you 're going to be subject to enhanced levels of political risk and they may not be as widely available or readily tradable as other foreign exchange futures so check with a broker before opening your account i could n't find them on my personal etrade account but a quick google search reveals cme group offering some there are probably others   foreign exchange futures are an advanced investing tool and carry risk be sure you understand the risk in particular how much money you can end up on the hook for if things do n't go your way also remember futures expire you 're not just betting on the rate changing but you 're betting on it changing within a certain amount of time

to get the probability of hitting a target price you need a little more math and an assumption about the expected return of your stock   first let 's examine the parts of this expression iv is the implied volatility of the option   that means it 's the volatility of the underlying that is associated with the observed option price   as a practical matter volatility is the standard deviation of returns expressed in annualized terms   so if the monthly standard deviation is y then is the volatility from the above you can see that de the volatility to get back to a standard deviation   so you get an estimate of the expected standard deviation of the return between now and expiration if you multiply this by the stock price then you get what you have called x which is the standard deviation of the dollars gained or lost between now and expiration   denote the price change by a so that the standard deviation of a is x note that we seek the expression for the probability of hitting a target level q so mathematically we want 1 pr a < q   we do 1 minus the probability of being below this threshold because cumulative distribution functions always find the probability of being below a threshold not above if you are using excel and assuming a mean of zero for returns the probability of hitting or exceeding q at expiration then is that 's your answer for the probability of exceeding q. accuracy is in the eye of the   you 'd have to specify a criterion by which to judge it to know the answer   i 'm sure more sophisticated methods exist that are more unbiased and have less error but i think it 's a fine first approximation

there are few different types of mi you can choose from they are borrower paid monthly this is what most people think of when they think mi borrower paid single premium you may have issues on this lender paid single premium split up front and monthly the only way to determine which option will ultimately cost you less is to come up with a time estimate or range for how long you anticipate you will hold this mortgage then look at each option over that time and see where they fall to answer your question about the single premium being added to your loan this typically does not happen outside of fha va   the reason for that is you would now have financing and fall into a new pricing bracket if not being disqualified altogether   what is far more typical is the use of premium pricing to pay this up front premium   premium pricing is where you take a lender credit in exchange for an elevated rate it is the exact opposite of paying points to buy down your rate for example   say a zero point rate is 4.25 and you have monthly mi of say .8   your effective rate would be   it may be possible to use premium pricing at an elevated rate of say 4.75 to pay your mi up front now your effective rate is the note rate of 4.75   this is how a single premium can save you money   keep in mind though the 4.75 will be your rate for the life of the loan and in the other scenario once the mi drops off the effective rate will go back down from to 4.25   this is why it is critical to know your estimated length of financing

an option gives you the option rather than the obligation to buy or sell the underlying so you do n't have to exercise you can just let the option expire so long it does n't have an automatic expiry after expiration the option is worthless if it is out of the money but other than that has no hangover option prices normally drop as the time value of the option decays an option has two values associated with it time value and exercise value far out of the money when the price of the underlying is far from the strike price on the losing side options only have time value whereas deep in the money options as yours seems to be has some time value as well as the intrinsic value of the right to buy sell at a low high price and then sell buy the underlying   the time value of the option comes from the possibility that the price of the underlying will move further in your favour and make you more money at expiry as expiry closes it is less likely that there will be a favourable mood so this value declines which can cause prices to move sharply after a period of little to no up to now what i have said applies to both otc and traded options but exchange traded options have another level of complexity in their trading because there are fewer traders in the options market the size of trade at which you can move the market is much lower on the equities markets you may need to trade millions of shares to have be substantial enough to significantly move a price on the options markets it could be thousands or even hundreds if these are european style options which sounds likely and a single trading entity was holding a large number of the exchange traded options and now thinks that the price will move significantly against them before expiry their sell trade will move the market lower in spite of the options being in the money their trade is based on their supposition that by the time they can exercise the option the price will be below the strike and they will lose money they have cashed out at a price that suited them and limited what they will lose if they are right about the underlying if i am not correct in my excise style assumption european i may need more details on the trade as it seems like you should just exercise now and take the profit if it is that far into the money

to add to jason 's answer a further mechanism is that of monopoly rents which you mention in your question   movie theatres are often in shopping complexes which themselves may offer a particular cinema exclusivity or physically remote from each other making price comparison more difficult   different companies may not offer the same movies similar to the way phone companies offer difficult to compare contract pricing once you 've paid for your movie ticket if you 're suddenly or the theatre is the only place selling snacks   many theatres including film theatres discourage or refuse patrons from consuming products purchased elsewhere on site a sense of capture is reinforced with ticket collection at the entrance or some form of barrier inside vs outside the a theatre can thus capture their patrons and then leverage that access in order to discriminate amongst the higher paying consumers mentioned by jason

i do n't think its a taxable event since no income has been constructively received talking about the rsu shareholders here i believe you 're right with the irc and the basis of the rsu is the basis of the original stock option probably zero edit see below however once the stock becomes vested then it is a taxable event not when the cash is received but when the chance of forfeiture diminishes even if the employee does n't sell the stock and is an ordinary income not capital that is my understanding of the situation do not consider it as a tax advice in any way i gave it a bit more though and i do n't think irc is relevant you 're not doing any exchange or conversion here because you did n't have anything to convert to begin with and do n't have anything after the conversion your iso 's are forfeited and no longer available basically you treat them as you 've never had them what happened is that you 've received rsu 's and you treat them as a regular rsu grant based on its vesting schedule the tax consequences are exactly as i described in my original response you recognize ordinary income on the vested stocks as they vest your basis is zero i.e. the whole fmv of the stock at the time of vesting is your ordinary income it should also be reflected in your w2 accordingly

borrow money from the central bank wrong premise they can not borrow as much as they want and they can not borrow without collateral i.e. government debt instruments they hold or any other instrument with value   and banks do n’t have unlimited collateral to borrow against   secondly central banks are n’t in the business of lending unlimited money the more money they lend out the more is the money supply which inflation which will eventually lead them to stop lending at any point of time they want a certain amount of money movement so they can control inflation and interest rates within an agreed limit and as limited by their economy no sane central bank would want to by printing money at will e g helicopter money so the only other way for banks is to accept deposits from private individuals you can also argue that banks make money by connecting lenders and borrowers and make their profit by being the middleman without using their assets so you can say they are making a profit with the minimum usage of their capital albeit they have the central bank looking over their shoulder to police their behaviour while some banks do charge fees for keeping deposits yes but many provide certain extra services for which they charge that is how they differentiate between no fee accounts and fee paying accounts

technically yes in most cases you 'll probably get all the amt you pay for exercising in the money incentive stock options isos credited back to you practically however inflation could significantly reduce the value of the money when you get it back remember you can only recover the differential between regular income tax and the tentative minimum tax each year depending on your situation that could be a few thousand dollars or less in which case $ 50k of amt credit would take a while to use up however as you point out if you end up selling your shares you 'll likely use up all your amt credit that year so yes you 'd probably get your $ 50k of amt back but a lot of people do n't have that much to tie up in taxes for an extended period of time

cash price is $ 22,500 financed it 's the same thing 0 interest but you pay a $ 1500 fee = 6.6 basically the apr for your loan is 1.1 per year but you are paying it all upfront opportunity cost if you take the $ 22,500 you plan to pay for the car and invested it could you earn more than the $ 1500 interest on the car loan according to google as of today you can get 1 year cd 1.25 so yes it 's likely that interest rates will be going up in medium term so you can potentially earn even more   insurance cost if you finance you 'll have to get comprehensive insurance which could be costly however if you are planning to get it anyway it 's a brand new car after all that 's a wash which brings me to my main point why do you have $ 90k in a savings account even if you are planning to buy a house you should have that money invested in liquid assets earning you interest   conclusion take the cheap money while it 's available you never know when interest rates will go up again

it sounds like the kinds of planners you 're talking to might be a poor fit because they are essentially selling investments for a commission some thoughts on finding a financial planner the good kind of financial planner is going to be able to do a comprehensive plan look at your whole life goals and non investment issues such as insurance you should expect to get a document with a monte carlo simulation showing your odds of success if you stick to the plan for investments you should expect to see a recommended asset allocation and an emphasis on low cost no commission commission is load funds see some of the other questions from past posts for example what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money a good place to start for a planner might be there 's also a franchise of planners providing hourly advice called the planning network i helped my mom hire someone from them and she was very happy though i do think your results would depend mostly on the individual rather than the franchise anyway see they do require planners to be fee only and working on their cfp credential you should really look for the certified financial planner cfp credential there are a lot of credentials out there but many of them mean very little and others might be hard to get but not mean the right thing some other meaningful ones include chartered financial analyst cfa which would be a solid investment expert though not necessarily someone knowledgeable in financial planning generally and irs enrolled agent which means someone who knows a lot about taxes a cpa accountant would also be pretty meaningful a law degree and estate law know how is very relevant to many planning situations too some not very meaningful certifications include certified mutual fund specialist which is n't bogus but it 's much easier to get than cfp or cfa registered investment adviser ria which mostly means the person is supposed to understand securities fraud laws but does n't mean they know a lot about financial planning there are some pretty bogus certifications out there many have retirement or senior in the name a good question for any planner is are you a fiduciary which means are they legally required to act in your interests and not their own most sales oriented advisors are not fiduciaries they would n't charge you a big sales commission if they were and they are not on your side legally speaking it 's a good idea to check with your state regulators or the sec to confirm that your advisor is registered and ask if they have had any complaints small advisors usually register with the state and larger ones with the federal sec if they are registered they may still be a salesperson who is n't acting in your interests but at least they are following the law you can also see if they 've been in trouble in the past when looking for a planner one firm i found had a professional looking web site and did n't seem sketchy at all but the state said they were not properly registered and not in compliance other ideas a good book is it 's very and you 'd feel more confident talking to someone maybe with more background information for companies to work with stick to the ones that are very consumer friendly and sell no load funds vanguard is probably the one you 'll hear about most but t. rowe price fidelity usaa are some other good names fidelity is a bit of a mixture with some cheap consumer friendly investments and other products that are less so avoid companies that are all about charging commission pretty much anyone selling an annuity is probably bad news annuities have some valid uses but mostly they are a bad deal not knowing your specific situation in any detail it 's very likely that 60k is not nearly enough and that making the right investment choices will make only a small difference you could invest poorly and maybe end up with 50 k when you retire or invest well and maybe end up with 80 90k but your goal is probably more like a million dollars or more and most of that will come from future savings this is what a planner can help you figure out in detail it 's virtually certain that any planner who is for real and not a ripoff salesperson will talk a lot about how much you need to save and so forth not just about choosing investments do n't be afraid to pay for a planner it 's well worth it to pay someone a thousand dollars for a really thorough fiduciary plan with your interests foremost the free planners who get a commission are going to get a whole lot more than a thousand dollars out of you even though you wo n't write a check directly be sure to convert those mutual fund expense ratios and sales commissions into actual dollar amounts to summarize find someone you 're paying not someone getting a commission look for that cfp credential showing they passed a demanding exam maybe read a quick and easy book like the one i mentioned just so you know what the advisor is talking about and do n't rush into anything and btw i think you ought to be fine with a solid plan you and your husband have time remaining to work with good luck

basically in any financial system that features fractional reserve banking the monetary supply expands during times of prosperity stable low inflation of 2 4 keeps capital available while keeping the value of money stable it also discourages hoarding of wealth banks are n't vaults they take deposits and make an explicit promise to repay the depositor on demand since most depositors do n't need to withdraw money regularly the lend out the money you deposited and maintain a reserve sufficient to meet daily cash needs when times are good banks lend to people and businesses who need capital who in turn do things that add value to the overall economy when times are bad people and businesses either can not get capital or pay more for it which reduces the number of times that money changes hands and has a negative impact on the wider economy people who are trying to sell you commodities or who have a naive view of how the economy actually works decry the current monetary system and throw around scary words like fiat currency and inflation is theft what these people do n't realize is that before the present system where the value of money is based on promises to repay the gold and silver backed systems also experienced inflation with gold silver based money inflation was driven by discoveries of gold and silver deposits

in steady state the refrigerator only has to pump out the heat that has leaked in from outside   the amount of heat leaked is related to the difference between interior and exterior temperatures and the overall insulation quality   thus a refrigerator full of cold food uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator full of cold air    in practice people open the door take cold food out put warm food in and the unit may also make ice dispense cold water and itself   aside from tweaking those uses e.g. minimizing time with the door open a useful trick is to use empty milk cartons or similar containers to fill up unused space   this helps by reducing the amount of cold air that escapes when the door is opened and the air in the cartons has low thermal mass so it cools down rapidly   when you need the space you can remove the cartons and set them aside similarly water filled cartons may be used as a sort of thermal leveling out the temperature fluctuations within the refrigerator particularly if the electric utilities are erratic   however they increase the cost of when cooling the water in the first place and when you eventually dump out the water the expense of cooling it goes down the drain

it 's very possible that someone would lie to their landlord but not be prepared to lie to the police   so here 's what i would do advise your tenant that since her money has been stolen from your she should report the theft to the police if she refuses to report the theft to the police then her story is probably a lie   in which case treat the rent as and demand payment in full   invoke whatever kind of recourse is available in your jurisdiction if she goes ahead and reports the theft then it 's very likely that her story is true   it 's probably in your interest to stay on good terms with such a tenant so you could offer to split the loss with her   but let her know that this is a one time offer and you wo n't be so generous again

the value of a company is simplified the sum of the value of the equity and the value of the debt there are some other things to add subtract to that but just think about those for now   you could also say the value of a company is the value of its assets or more precisely the value of the net cash flows those assets will generate in the future   so let 's say you want to start a company so you want to buy some assets maybe you want to buy a $ 200 asset well you only have $ 100 so you take out a loan debt for $ 100 for the remainder you buy the asset and start generating income   let 's say after a month you get bored and decide to sell the company let 's assume the value of the assets has n't changed your equity is worth $ 100 and you find a buyer who is willing to pay $ 100 for your company great right   well there 's still the $ 100 loan you owe so you have to pay that back and suddenly you now have $ 0    so in fact you should have negotiated $ 200 with the buyer because that 's what the assets are actually worth then you can pay back the loan and still have the $ 100 in equity you deserve alternatively you could have negotiated the buyer to assume responsibility for the loan same outcome for you   did that help

even if you avoid the issue of the auto dealer wanting to limit the abuse of their policy you have to realize that the discount they give is 25 off of some stated price it might be 25 off the sticker they do n't want to lose money the 25 represents the haggling they avoid by selling to the employee this means the discount might not be as large as you imagine because you would n't have paid sticker if you had purchased the vehicle on your own the other issue you will have to deal with is taxes and registration when your friend drives the car off the lot the car will have to be registered with the state then they will have to sell the car to you and that transaction will have to be done though the state for a price then you will sell it to somebody else these transaction fees will cut into your profits   it is likely that when the potential purchaser runs a vin check through a service it will show multiple owners which can cut the estimated resale value the manufacturer will also have to be notified so that all the relevant warranty coverage is still intact   the question is for that final sale can you offer enough discount compared to the new car dealer and still make enough profit to be worth the hassle

the reserve bank of australia 's role in monetary policy has three objectives currency stability primarily keeping inflation within a narrow band full employment and improved prosperity and welfare its primary weapon in this is its setting of a target for the cash rate the overnight money market interest rate charged between financial intermediaries short term market rates closely track this cash rate target because the reserve bank controls the supply of funds that banks use to settle the transactions that use the overnight money market interest rates australian capital markets are liquid with many deposits loans being on variable rate or short term rates hence changes to the cash rate quickly propagate throughout the market nb that the changes propagate but not all interest rates are at the same level the absolute values do n't propagate different interest rates will reflect different loan periods and different perceptions of risks banks are profit so they wo n't loan at a lower rate to one borrower if they can loan the same money to someone else at a higher interest rate and the same or lower risk and they wo n't lend money out unless they can cover the cost of their own borrowing plus overheads plus a reward for the risk of the loan hence the home loan rates of all banks will tend to move in the same direction by broadly the same amount at the same time

fundamentally these are my opinions i am expressing even though i try to remain as factual as possible and have significantly modified my opinion over the years as a result of apparently factual information it 's still technically just opinion   gt my view is not so much that labour and finance capital returns need to be balanced although that is probably a great thing to aim for but that creation of wealth capital needs to be intrinsically linked with the creation of real value   by the way when i say capital it 's not generally just finance capital but all operational capital goods which includes factories and all means of production a certain amount of financing is needed to keep it operational and more is needed to increase the means of production to grow overall wealth   have you ever heard of the 's wiki basically you ca n't really push this ratio very far if consumer demand dries up then production will get cut back to meat demand overproduction of stuff they ca n't sell is not what they are in business for likewise is demand exceeds the capacity of production to keep up it pushes inflation which drives up cost to reduce demand so this ratio remains very nearly a constant even though this ratio was at historic highs in the 1970s and historic lows today   what happens when you artificially dry up labor returns through excessive supply side policies is that demand for production falls hence production is cut back to meet that demand this of course reduces employment and increases job competition which puts more downward on wages exacerbating the situation only once labor cost fall low enough it effectively subsidizes inefficient production methods which limits the falling wages at a reduced overall productivity note that this is under present circumstances not those of the 1970s this adaptive matching between production and demand insures that the ratio is never too far off of its historical averages even if productivity is driven well below its potential   more or less the same effect occurs for the opposite reason if capital return ratios are too low though with opposite effects on the inflation rate and such when consumer demand is high enough capital will pay whatever labor cost is required to meet that demand so long as it remains profitable enough i.e. they get a reasonable ratio of the market return consumer demand with sufficient capital profit margins is what drives full employment not the sheer volume of capital returns as present policies essentially assume yet you ca n't have a broad based consumer demand to drive employment without sufficient labor returns as those labor returns is what finances that demand needed to drive employment   so not only does labour and capital returns need to be balanced economics does not allow it to be unbalanced at least for long even if balancing requires the economy to shrink productivity to fall etc that is exactly what it will do to remain balanced no choice given no matter how draconian the regulations to force it this is true under purely economies of the past pure communism and even this is why i am a capitalist because nature gives me no choice but acceptance of that fact does not require me to have an ounce of tolerance for cronyism   the only thing we can do is not push this balance in either direction to destructive levels because destruction is what will happen for the balance to remain because so much of our productive capacity has been in productivity gains since the 1990s and wages and demand have as yet not matched these productivity gains we have a huge latent wealth capacity that continues to grow as we fail to take advantage of it so far our supply side policies have n't so much destroyed wealth and productivity rather it has prevented us from seeing the potential gains from the latent productivity growth from technologies over the few decades     the last part you mention about wealth capital needing to be intrinsically linked with the creation of real value you are absolute 100 entirely correct perhaps even more than you know ever heard of planned obsolescence or the light bulb light bulb that link is a documentary on the issue that will make you mad we could almost certainly pay a flat 90 tax rate on everything and still not come close to what this issue cost us that 's not the only means this issue imposes cost but it is extreme    of course just because an appliance still works does n't mean people will not replace it with newer better models but the trash pile insures there is a much more limited secondary market for poorer people consumption debt cost is also a far bigger issue than people recognize debt to finance capital goods for production is fine as this feeds productivity and wealth in a manner that itself even as the debt is paid consumption debt is an entirely different beast creating a significant section of the population that feeds on peoples income without producing a thing only to let allow people to consume income they have n't earned yet   this generally falls under the category of rent seeking behavior yeah the lack real value creation turns my stomach that people will knowingly spend money on temporary non essential and such is all fine and dandy but renting our base appliances for a certain number of uses is outrageous in my book

one key to trading is recognizing expectations   what you see in the market is not always a reflection of fundamentals sometimes it 's a reflection of what people expect to occur whether that actually happens or not is debatable when a currency experiences inflation such as the cpi being higher today for the usd it may see an increase because people expect that the central bank will raise rates   again this may not be the case and the traders with this expectation could be wrong   if you 're seeing a currency rise after reported inflation more than likely traders expect the inflation to benefit the currency in the longer run finally on the economics side and economists here can debate this at least in the past the view was that there was a relationship between inflation and unemployment see the phillip 's curve   this idea depending on who you ask was refuted in the 70s when we had both high inflation and high unemployment stagflation   supposedly if we have high unemployment we should have low inflation so we can always raise inflation to have low unemployment   note that you will still find some economists who think the phillip 's curve is true so refuted depends on who you ask from what i 've read austrian economists are the only economists who see inflation as always bad long story short i think it 's paul who argues that deflation is actually good like you 're seeing other economists might see it as a good sign and it 's only a concern when it 's very high hyperinflation

it 's important because it shows that the amount you owe does not decrease linearly with each payment and you gain equity as a correspondingly slower rate at the beginning of the loan and faster at the end this has to be figured in when considering refinancing or when you sell the place and pay off the mortgage it also shows why making extra payments toward principal if your loan permits doing so is so advantageous unlike a normal payment that lowers the whole curve by a notch reducing the length of time over which interest is due and thus saving you money in the long run possible lost costs of course

the answer for me has to do with compounding that drop in price post ex div is not compounded but if you reinvest your dividends back into the stock then you buy on those post ex div dips in price and your money is compounded because those shares you just bought will themselves yeald dividends next quarter   also with my broker i reinvest the dividend incurring no commission my broker has a feature to reinvest dividends automatically and he charges no commission on those buys edit i forgot to mention that you do not the loss from a drop in price until you sell the security if you do not sell post ex div then you have no loss as long as the dividend remains the same or increases then the theoretical roi on that security goes up the drop in price is actually to your benefit because you are able to acquire more shares with the money you just received in the dividend   so the price coming down post ex div is a good thing if you buy and hold

typically this is not an option as the monthly payments are fixed it depends on the willingness of your financing bank for such a change you probably will have to refinance with them or another lender which is not a bad thing as you even can get a lower interest rate potentially as of jan 2017 this will change consider too it could be a better solution to instead invest the 25000 and use the investment returns to fill up the difference every month certainly more effort but you probably come out ahead financially

first two to address good points people made in comments as noted before you move your $ 30k to something that might lose money make sure you have enough cash to serve as an emergency fund in case you lose your income especially remember that big stock market crashes often go hand in hand with widespread layoffs also you mentioned that you 're maxed out in a 401k as joetaxpayer hinted this could very well already be invested in stocks and if it is n't probably a big part of it should be regarding your $ 30k you do n't need to pay anybody in general fees and expenses can form a big drag on your investments and it 's good to avoid them as much as possible in particular especially with only $ 30k it 's unlikely that advisers can save you more than they cost also all financial advisers have a cost the free ones usually push you into investing in expensive funds that make them money at your expense in that regard keep in mind that unlike a lawyer or a doctor a financial adviser is not required by law to give advice that 's in your best interest when investing there is a pretty short list of important considerations that you should keep in mind if anyone has any other points they think are similarly important feel free to suggest an edit practically speaking i 'd suggest investing in index funds these are mutual funds that invest very broadly in a passive way that does n't spend a lot of effort and money trying to pick individual high performing stocks or anything like that index funds provide a lot of diversification and tend to have low expense ratios other actively managed funds tend to be more expensive and often do n't outperform index funds anyway if you 're saving for retirement there are even target date funds that are themselves composed of a small number of index funds often domestic and international stocks and bonds and will increase the proportion invested in bonds safer as they get closer to a target retirement date see for example the vanguard target retirement 2045 fund a fund like that one might be all you need if you are saving for retirement finally you can invest online without paying any advisers not all companies are created equal however do your research i personally highly recommend vanguard since they have a wide variety of no load index funds and tend to have very low expense ratios no load means you do n't have to pay a fee to buy and sell part of why they are inexpensive is that unlike most financial companies they are actually a cooperative owned by those who invest in their funds so they do n't need to try and milk a profit out of you do n't let that suggest that they 're some small potatoes hippie firm though they 're actually one of the largest i hope i helped keep posting if you have more questions

if you are using an excel the function pv should be able to easily calculate this excel formulae pv = rate nper pmt fv type    where rate rate of return in this case you can use inflation or assumed rate that would cost you say 3 5 note the rate has to be for nper i.e. in nper if you are counting yearly payments then rate is yearly if you are counting as monthly then the rate should be monthly    nper number of periods if yearly in your case it would be 20 if monthly 20 12 if quarterly 20 4 etc    pmt expected payments for nper if you are saying 20 million over 20 years it would be 1 million per year fv and type can be blank so assuming a rate of 3 and yearly payments of 1 million over 20 years pv = $ it would show negative just ignore the sign

couple quick s to help understand your situation a bit better are you currently in school and if so grad or undergrad undergrad opens up a whole different world of formal recruiting than you would get otherwise it sounds like you already graduated if so how many years out are you further out the much harder it 's going to be without going back to get an mba or msf your other option is being in the top 1 5 of your career but like has been said you still ca n't get into financial consulting it do companies like pwc cognizant and accenture would be better    if you 're more than 5 years out of undergrad without an mba it is going to be extremely difficult i break in no less with the firms you mentioned mckinsey is a lot like goldman in some cases the acceptance   rate from recruiting can be more difficult than harvard you 're going up against extremely intelligent hard working individuals who are trained in strategy consulting through degrees be prepared for this and no matter what you 're doing networking is going to be key to getting in so start now people you meet at these companies can help you more with that    also what in particular you about consulting also what kind of consulting ie biz dev strategy financial it due diligence govt etc you need to understand that before doing a search there are major differences between each of them    not trying to he a just a realist if say for example i did a basic programming course and really enjoyed it i would n't immediately apply to google and google would expect me to be formally trained by more than just reading programming books it 's not much different with very high end consulting and easily just as competitive as getting into a google i hope this helps    hopefully with a reply i can help a little more not saying it ca n't be done just difficult depending on where you are in your career path

with debts exceeding assets by a billion dollars this activity likely comes from penny stock speculators and pump and dump there is no rational expectation that the stock is even worth multiple pennies when the company is that far upside down on its debts even if the debts could be restructured in a chapter 11 the equity shares would likely lose all of their value in the bankruptcy proceedings shareholders are at the bottom of the totem pole when debts are being adjusted by the courts

that ai n't nothing   it 's really easy to get up into a sense of entitlement and forget to be grateful for what you do have   if this house does n't exist what would his costs of housing be elsewhere   realistically   would landlords rent to him would other bankers lend him money to buy a house would those costs really be any better   what about the intangible benefits like not having any landlord hassles or having a good relationship with the neighbors   it 's entirely possible he has a sweet deal here and just does n't make enough money   if your credit rating is poor your housing options really suck   banks wo n't lend you money for a house unless you have a huge ton of upfront cash   most landlords wo n't rent to you at all because they are going to automated scoring systems to avoid accusations of racism   in this day and age there are lots of ways to make money with a property you own   in fact i believe very firmly in robert allen 's doctrine never sell   that way you avoid the tens of thousands of dollars of overhead costs you bear with every sale that 's pure profit gone up in smoke   keep the property forever keep it working for you   if he does n't know how learn   to get bootstrapped he can put it up on airbnb or other services or do housemate shares   when your house is not show condition just be very honest and about the condition   do n't it tell them exactly what they 're going to get   people like honesty in the social sharing economy   and here 's the important part do n't booze away the new income invest it back into the property to make it a better money maker better at airbnb better at housemate shares better as a month to month renter so it 's too big is there a way to the unit to make it a better renter or airbnb   can he carve out an in law unit that would be a good size for him alone if he can keep turning the money back into the property like that he could do alright   this is what the new sharing economy is all about   of course sister might show up with her hand out wanting half the revenue since it 's half her house   tell her hell no this pays the mortgage and you do n't   she deserves nothing yet is getting half the equity from those mortgage payments and that 's enough it   and if she wants to go to court get a judge to tell her that   not that he 's going to sell it but it 's a huge deal he needs to know how much of his payments on the house are turning into real equity that belongs to him    owning it on paper does n't mean you own it   there 's a mortgage on it which means you do n't own all of it   the amount you own is the value of the house minus the mortgage owed    this is called your equity    of course a sale also minus the costs of bringing the house up to mandatory code requirements   minus the cost of making the house    but when you actually sell there 's also the 6 realtors commission and other closing costs   this is where the mortgage is more than the house is worth   this is a dangerous situation   if you keep the house and keep paying the mortgage all right that is stable and can be cheaper than the intense disruption and credit rating shock of a foreclosure or short sale   if sister is half owner she 'll get a credit burn also that may be why she does n't want to sell   and that is leverage he has over her   i imagine a winter 's bone great movie situation where the family is hanging on by a thread and has n't told the bank the parents died   that could get very complex especially if the brother sister are not creditworthy because that means the bank would simply call the loan and force a sale    the upside is this wo n't result in a credit rating burn or bankruptcy for the children because they are not owners of the house and children do not inherit parents debt

let 's look at basics your 340 k mortgage amortized over 25 years at 3.5 is going to cost you $ 1700 in payments almost exactly your rent you wo n't be paying out less you will in fact be paying out more because you are now liable for more insurance and any repairs will have to be paid for by you not the landlord so do n't do this to save money figures from here do n't forget that it is extremely likely that interest rates will go up in the next few years 7 is not unlikely can you afford it if your payments double you can get a fixed rate mortgage but they are going to cost you much more than 3.5 for more than a couple of years do n't be fooled by the pay yourself argument for getting a mortgage in the first few years almost all of your payments is interest not paying down the principal you are just switching from paying a landlord to paying a bank there are huge advantages to waiting until you have a good down payment before buying a house people with a big down payment get better interest rates and do n't need to pay as much cmhc insurance you will be less at risk if the price of your house drops also ask yourself if you are sure you will be in your house for five years if not even real estate agents would usually admit you should n't buy the truck payment should n't be an issue as long as you are sure you can service both truck and mortgage payments nor is $ 600 in credit card debt significant in the big scheme i would probably put any spare cash towards a down payment it reduces your interest rate possibly some expenses with regard to your mortgage and your risk if you have to sell and your house value has dropped   you might like to look at the government of canada website rent or buy it 's down right now so i ca n't give you a link i 'll edit it in when it 's back up edit turns out it 's offline for updating here 's the link

actually the labor theory of value is based on the socially necessary labor time a sort of societal average of the amount of labor necessary to produce something including the labor already included in raw materials etc   so if someone produces some commodity more or less quickly than their competitors the goods still have the same value unless until that average changes and that producer 's costs will simply be above or below the average leading to increased decreased profits compared to their competitors   so your criticism is not only rather uninformed its actually pretty central to how marxists explain the drive for increased production efficiency through capital investment new management techniques etc

you understood it pretty right every fiscal year which runs from april 6 year y to april 5 year you can deposit a total this number is subject to an annual increase by hmrc into your isas you can open 2 new isa every year but the amount deposited to those isas shall not excess in total from the tax year some isas now permit you to replace any funds you have withdrawn without using up your allowance it used to be that if you deposited k and then withdrew k you could not pay in to that isa again within that tax year as you had already used your full allowance under new flexible isa rules this would be allowed providing you replace the funds in the same isa account and within the same tax year strongly recommend that you check the small prints related to your account to make sure this is he case any gains and losses on the investments held in the isa accounts are for you to take i.e. if you make investment gains of k this does not reduces your allowance you will still be able to deposit or whatever hmrc increases that number to in the following year you are also allowed to consolidate your isas you can ask bank a to transfer the amount held into an isa with bank held with bank b. this is usually done by filling a special form with the bank that will held the money post transactions again here be very careful do not withdraw the money to transfer it yourself as this would count against the k limit instead follow the procedures from the bank finally if you do n't use your allowance for a given year you can not use it during the following year i.e. if you do n't deposit the k this year then you can not deposit k next year nb i used the word deposit it does not matter to hmrc if the money get invested or not if you are in a rush on april 4th just make sure the money is wired into the isa account by the 5th no need to rush and make bad investment decision you can invest it later   hope it helps

note i am the currency units   while i strongly suspect it 's us$ i do n't know from the chart   the system works the same no matter what the currency a call or a put is the right to sell put or buy call shares at a certain price on a certain day this is why you see a whole range of prices   not all possible stock values are represented the number of possibilities has to be kept reasonable   in this case the choices are even units for an expensive stock they may be spaced even farther apart than this the top of the chart says it 's for june   it 's actually the third friday in the month june 15th in this case   thus these are bets on how the stock will move in the next 10 days while the numbers are per share you can only trade options in lots of 100 the left side of the chart shows calls   suppose you sell a call at 19 the top of the chart   the last such trade would have gotten you a premium of per share the flip side of this is when the third friday rolls around it will most likely be exercised and they 'll be paying you only 19 a share for a stock now trading at something over 26   note the volume bid and ask columns though you're not going to get for such a call as there is no buyer   the most anybody is offering at present is a share now lets look farther down in the chart say a strike price of 30   the last trade was only .10 think it 's very unlikely that fb will rise above 30 to make this option worthwhile and thus you get very little for being willing to sell at that price   if fb stays at 26 the option will expire worthless and go away   if it 's up to 31 when the 15th rolls around they 'll exercise the option take your shares and pay you 30 for them   note that you already gave permission for the trade by selling the call you ca n't back out later if it becomes a bad deal going over to the other side of the chart with the puts here the transaction goes the other way come the 15th they have the option of selling you the shares for the strike price   lets look at the same values we did before   19   there 's no trading you ca n't do it 30   here you will collect 3.20 for selling the put   come the 15th they have the right to sell you the stock for 30 a share   if it 's still 26 they 're certainly going to do so but if it 's up to 31 it 's worthless and you pocket the 3.20 note that you will normally not be allowed to sell a call if you do n't own the shares in question   this is a safety measure as the risk in selling a call without the stock is infinite   if the stock somehow up to 10,000 when the 15th rolls around you would have to come up with the shares and the only way you could get them is buy them on the open market you would have to come up with a million dollars   if there simply are n't enough shares available to cover the calls the result is catastrophic whoever owns the shares simply gets to dictate terms to you   and in the days of old this sometimes happened

this is n't new in the mid 80s rules were established by the irs to differentiate life insurance from modified endowment contracts placing upper limits on how much money could be placed in life insurance accounts relative to the coverage provided and how quickly fastest a policy can become paid in full is 7 years none of this closes the fundamental loophole but it exists for a reason taxation of life insurance is probably unwise and would result in less people using life insurance as a risk mitigation technique despite the fact that it 's very appropriate for that in some situations   the problem here is that once you get out of everyday people numbers and into very large sums the vehicle can be clearly abused to avoid taxes on investment gains while living and possibly avoid them altogether depending on how the estate is structured and this is bad for the average person who 'd like the to pay their percent towards the public needs the same way the average guy does

this is actually a very complicated question the key reading in this area is a seminal paper by optimal execution of portfolio transactions 2000 they show that there 's a tradeoff between liquidating your portfolio faster and knowing the value with more certainty versus liquidating more slowly and likely for a higher price but with less certainty so for example if you sold your entire position right now you would know almost certainly how much you would get for the position or you could sell off your position more slowly and likely get more money but you would have less certainty about how much you would get the paper is available online at

keep in mind this is an opinion piece the foreign sovereign act would have argentina from virtually all of these suits lets sovereigns opt out of its protections which argentina did argentina waived immunity from suit in new york state or federal court and its immunity from the attachment of its assets within the us to satisfy a judgement    in this particular case it also agreed this issuance of debt would rank with its other debt obligations and without any preference among themselves emphasis added 1994 bondholder agreement this is the clause the court used when deciding whether argentina could pay some bondholders and not others it is fairly that bondholders are all on equal footing it also added that these debt obligations would rank at least equally with argentina 's other unsecured debt    this was not a coincidence by issuing in new york and subjecting itself to new york us law argentina was able to obtain a much more favorable borrowing rate argentina was the of the debt agreement where it promised to treat all borrowers the same and it was the party who waived its inherent under us law it benefited greatly from the substantially lower borrowing costs it enjoyed by doing so    because argentina waived its sovereign the court looked to the language in the contract it states the debt will all be treated the same and will be subject to ny us law it is hard to say it is unfair for a new york court to enforce a contract argentina wrote and then subjected itself to new york jurisdiction law    note three us government agencies sided with argentina justice state treasury claiming should at least partially apply regardless of waiver they made mostly policy arguments about how sovereigns should enjoy at least partial immunity argentina 's debt contract was very liberal with its waiver of sovereign immunity so it is not surprising the court looked to the actual contract when deciding what rights bondholders have

no you do n't rounding errors happen and if there 's no change in the actual tax there 's no reason to amend if all the income was properly reported and the tax was properly calculated no one cares if it was rounded up or down on one of the lines note for the next time though not sure about new york but federal taxes are generally rounded to the nearest dollar on each line of the form so do n't calculate cents just round to the nearest dollar and be consistent on all of your tax forms technically it is perfectly legal to report cents as well and people used to when the forms were still filled by hand with pen but all the automatic tax filing software rounds so just do that

there are some etf 's on the indian market that invest in broad indexes in other countries here 's an article discussing this   be aware that such investments carry an additional risk you do not have when investing in your local market which is currency risk   if for example you invest in a etf that represents the us s&p500 index and the us dollar weakens relative to the indian rupee you could see the value if your investment in the us market go down even if the index itself is up but not as much as the change in currency values a lot of investment advisors recommend that you have at least 75 of your investments in things which are denominated in your local currency well technically the same currency as your liabilities and no more than 25 invested internationally   in large part the reason for this advice is to reduce your exposure to currency risk

i was i a similar position as you and sometimes credit bureaus might be difficult to deal with especially when high amounts of money are involved to make the long story short someone opened a store credit card under my name and made a charge of around 3k after reporting this to the bureaus they did not want to remove the account from my credit report citing that the claim was frivolous after filing a police report the police officer gave me the phone number for the fraud department of this store credit card and after they investigated they removed the account from my credit i would suggest to do the following communicating with creditors and debt collectors you have the right to   stop creditors and debt collectors from    reporting fraudulent accounts after you give them a copy of a valid    identity theft report they may not report fraudulent accounts to the    credit reporting companies get copies of documents related to the    theft of your identity like transaction records or applications for    new accounts write to the company that has the documents and include    a copy of your identity theft report you also can tell the company to    give the documents to a specific law enforcement agency stop a debt    collector from contacting you in most cases debt collectors must    stop contacting you after you send them a letter telling them to stop    get written information from a debt collector about a debt including    the name of the creditor and the amount you supposedly owe if a debt    collector contacts you about a debt request this information in    writing i know that you said that the main problem was that your credit account was combined with another but there might be a chance that identity theft was involved if this is the case and you can prove it then you might have access to more tools to help you for example you can file a report with the ftc and along with a police report this can be a powerful tool in stopping these charges feel free to go to the website for more information

there are several reasons why credit cards are popular in the us on the other hand debit cards do not have any of these going for them   a debit card does n't make much money for the bank unless you overdraw or something so banks do n't have incentive to push you to use them as much   as a result they do n't offer rewards other benefits some people say the ability to spend more than you have is a downside of a credit card   but it 's really an upside   the behavior of doing that when it is n't needed is bad but that 's not the card 's fault it 's the users   you can get a credit card with a very small limit if this is an issue for you the question i find interesting is why debit cards are more popular in your home country   i ca n't think of any advantage they offer besides free cash back   but most people in the us do n't use cash much either   i have to think in your home country the banks have a different revenue model or perhaps your country is n't as eager to offer tons of easy credit to everyone as the us is

this is easier than you think 1 at the end of the year airbnb will send you a 1099 form you will need to report the amount on this form as your rental income they will report it to the irs so it has to match as a bonus turning your condo into a rental property can become advantageous in that you can deduct repairs and improvements against any rental income 2 as a host you will have the option of charging a cleaning fee take a look at competitor listings to determine the average cleaning fee in your area you do not have to clean before and after each guest only before 3 as a host you also have the option of charging a security deposit to cover any damages do n't get confused by airbnb 's host protection plan this plan protects you against liability for damages incurred by your guests   now take a look at competitor listings to determine your rental price you may want to lower your price initially to get positive reviews going deduct your cleaning fee plus any reasonable wear and tear not covered by the security deposit above this is your rental income   if your rental income is a positive number and as long as you charge a realistic cleaning fee security deposit it will be you should rent it out the worst that can happen is low occupancy i.e. you ca n't rent your place out as often as you expect in which case you will be no worse off than you are today good luck

if i had to guess since you provided little information about your loan repayment i 'd guess that you 're on the extended repayment plan for your $ loan and the standard plan for your $ 30k loan in general there are 4 main kinds of student loan repayment plans this holds true for federal loans direct stafford plus private loans may not have all of these options or they may have more running your numbers i get 300 payments of $ 500/mo at 6.8 interest for a $ 72,000 loan and 120 payments of $ at 6.8 interest for a $ 30,000 loan now to address your issue of interest vs principal you should notice that each month you pay the interest payment is slightly lower and the principal slightly higher and if you make bi weekly payments you 'll see that change a little bit more quickly slightly smaller balance accruing interest for 14 days of the month and you 'll also pay slightly less over time

i 'd agree with maybe a concept of situational value being negative while accepting intrinsic value means what use a person can expect to get out of it but again both ultimately are subjective that said there can be benefits from drawing a distinction between the two   going back to bitcoin it does have an intrinsic value because the value of bitcoin itself is that it can be divided up easily transferred easily and etc all the things that make a currency valuable traditionally we value things as money if they meet many of the following criteria   1 medium of exchange 2 unit of account 3 store of value 4 standard of deferred payment 5 measure of value   gold meets some of these better than others dollars meet some of these better than others and so on but bitcoin meets all of these very well which means at least to me that bitcoin has intrinsic value in that it meets the definition of what we value the most in a   so maybe as long as we agree that there is a difference between subjective value and intrinsic value and agree that subjective value can in fact be negative there may be something to go on here

yeah me too as i said actually what i 'd really prefer is single payer but failing that getting health insurance separated from employment would be a big step forward if people really knew how much they are paying for health insurance things would change   i 've never worked for an employer that did n't renegotiate health insurance every year often changing insurance providers every year to the extent that hr departments are competent in finding the best value the current environment is pretty dynamic and competitive are individuals going to be as competent and well informed as hr departments i do n't know but i do know that simply making a market free does n't guarantee lower prices if consumers are ill informed and bad at making decisions   as for wages currently companies are not required to carry health insurance and many have dropped it already without increasing wages so i do n't see an upward pressure on wages from greater employee mobility   but it 's true that if there were a single large pool for insurance to be based off of large businesses would no longer get the pool advantage of health insurance over small businesses hence my preference for single payer or single group multi payer

yes your privacy is invaded that 's the law in many jurisdictions the goal is to make money laundering and financing evil things harder that 's why banks are required to request proof for every money transfer larger than a specific sum this is only a minor issue most of the time you will have some kind of agreement with that money management company and this agreement or a copy of it will serve as a proof of your lawful reason to transfer money it works just like that you get to the bank and say you want to initiate a money transfer the clerk asks you to show the proof you give them your agreement or a bill that requests you to pay or whatever else document you may have that proves that you 're bound by some kind of contract with the recipient of money the clerk then makes a copy of the proof and it stays in the bank to back the transfer until it is completed the copy is then stored for some time and later destroyed that 's up to how the bank handles documents

no i understood your question perfectly   i 'm just saying that sort of situation is generally rare    a quick google search yields this article which responds to the question which funding method should i choose with the answer often you will not have a choice     that is exactly what i 'm saying   the status and stage of your business dictates what sort of financing is even available to you   most often you do n't even have a choice between one or the other   if you want a formula the other people responding mentioned wacc which is the standard that finance professionals typically use   you generally will want a wacc that is similar to other successful companies of your similar size and industry   the actual mechanics of adjusting your wacc will involve either issuing or repurchasing equity or debt   regardless what you are asking is not generally practical nor does it come into practice in 99 out of 100 financing situations   wacc is important to understand and consider but people do n't issue equity or debt just to balance their wacc      think about this another way how easy is it to raise debt   probably fairly easy as usually you can go to commercial banks or go to an investment bank if you 're raising enough debt   companies borrow all of the time they 're constantly paying off loans or taking new ones with different interest rates   there are revolving lines of credit secured loans factoring borrowing against receivables fixed interest debt variable interest debt mezzanine debt etc etc   how easy is it to issue equity   pretty amazingly difficult sure you have your ipos but that happens once in a company 's lifetime   you might have secondary offerings or follow ons but those are incredibly rare i mean you 've probably never even heard of them right   you do n't hear about apple or boeing doing those every quarter do you   you 'll hear about private equity companies buying up firms and you 'll hear about mergers all of the time but again those are once in a lifetime events     so now that you 've read that how often is a company really going to be deciding between debt and equity   not very often

a link to this article grabbed my interest as i was browsing the site for something totally unrelated to finance   your question is not silly i 'm not a financial expert but i 've been in your situation several times with carmax auto finance caf in particular a lot of people probably thought you do n't understand how financing works but your car loan set up is exactly how caf financing works which i 've used several times just some background info to anyone else reading this unlike most other simple interest car financing with caf they calculate per diem based on your principal balance and recalculate it every time you make a payment regardless of when your actual due date was   but here 's what makes caf financing particularly fair when you do make a payment your per diem since your last payment accrued x dollars and that 's your interest portion that is subtracted first from your payment and obviously per diem goes down faster the more you pay in a payment and then everything else including any extra payments you make goes to principal you do not have to specify that the extra payment(s are principal only if your payment amount per month is $ 500 and you give them 11 payments of $ 500 the first $ 500 will have a small portion go to interest accrued since the last payment depending on the per diem that was recalculated and then everything else goes to principal and still pushes your next due date i prefer to break up extra payments as precisely the amount due per month so that my intention is clear pay the extra as a payment for the next month and the one after that etc and keep pushing my next due date that last point of pushing your next due date is the key   not all car financing companies do that a lot of them will let you pay to principal yes but you 're still due next month with caf you can have your cake and eat it too i worked for them in college i know their financing system in and out and i 've always financed with them for that very reason   so back to the question should you keep the loan alive albeit for a small amount my unprofessional answer is yes car loans are very powerful in your credit report because they are installment accounts same as mortgages and other accounts that you pay down to 0 and the loan is closed credit cards are revolving accounts and do n't offer as much bang for your money unless you are savvy in manipulating your card balances take it up one month take it down to 0 the next month etc i play those games a lot but i always find mortgage and auto loans make the best impact   i do exactly what you do myself i pay off the car down to about $ 500 i actually make several small payments each equal to the agreed upon monthly payment because their system automatically treats that as a payment for the next month due and the one after that etc on top of paying it all to principal as i mentioned   do not leave a dollar as another reader mentioned they have a good will threshold i ca n't remember how much probably $ 50 for which they will consider the account paid off and close it out so if your concern is throwing away free money but you still want the account alive your sweet spot where you can be sure the loan is not closed is probably around $ 100   but something else important to consider if you decide to go with that strategy of keeping the account alive which i recommend in my case caf will adjust down your next payment due if it 's less than the principal left so let 's say your regular payment is $ 400 and you only leave a $ 100 your next payment due is $ 100 and it will go up a few cents each month because of the small per diem and that is exactly what caf will report to the credit bureaus as your monthly obligation which sucks because now your awesome car payment history looks like you 've only been paying $ 100 every month so leave something close to one month 's payment yes the interest accrued will be higher but i 'm not a penny when the reward is worth it if you left $ 400 for 1.5 years at 10 apr that equates to about $ 50 interest for that entire time well worth it in my books sorry for rambling a lot i suck myself into these debates all the time

if you want to invest in the stock market whether over a shorter period of 1 to 2 years or over a longer period of 10 or 20 years or longer you need to take some precautions and have a written investment plan with a risk management strategy incorporated in your plan others have said that 1 to 2 years is too short to invest in the stock market as the stock market can have a correction and fall by 50 but it does n't matter if you invest for 1 year or if you invest for 50 years the stock market can still fall by 50 just before you plan to withdraw your funds what you need to figure out is a way to get out before the market falls by 40 to 50 a simple way to do this is to use technical indicators to warn you when a market trend is starting to change and that it is time to get out of the market two simple indicators you can use on a market index are the rate of change roc indicator and the 100 week moving average ma below is a 10 year weekly chart of the s&p500 with these two indicators charted they show good times to get into the market and good times to get out   if you are using the 100 week ma you would buy in when the price crosses above the ma line and sell when the price crosses below the ma line if you are using the roc indicator you would buy in when the roc indicator crosses above the zero line and sell when the roc indicator crosses below the zero line so your investment plan could be to buy an index etf representing the s&p500 when the roc moves above zero and sell when it crosses below zero you can also place a trailing stop loss of 10 to protect you in case of a sudden fall over a couple of days you can manage your investments in as little as 10 minutes per week by checking the chart once per week and adjusting your stop loss order   if you want to progressively add to your investment each month you could check the charts and only add any new funds if both the roc is above zero and sloping upwards another option for adding new funds could be if the price is above the ma and moving further away from the ma all these rules should be incorporated into your investment plan so that you are not basing your decisions based on emotions there are many other technical analysis indicators you could also learn about to make better educated decisions about your stock market investments however what i have provided here is enough for anyone to test over different indexes and time frames and do their own paper trading on to gain some confidence before placing any real money on the table

while i do not have an issue with treating customers clients well the whole mentality of the customer is always right needs to be re evaluated    in a case where a customer has unreasonable demands or is treating an employee poorly by no fault of the employee their privilege to be right ends in situations like that it is more important to stand up for your employees then it is to side with the customer if you do side with the customer in that situation it not only reinforces that behavior from the customer but makes the employee feel undervalued and will lead to morale issues if your workplace has consistent morale issues you will have a high turnover rate this will end up costing you considerably more not just in human capital but in workplace knowledge time and most prominently money chances are if a customer is being a huge drain of your resources they are likely not worth too much to your company to begin with see below    another reason why this mentality of every customer is valuable is a bad idea is found within the 80/20 principle simply put 80 of your revenue will come from 20 of your customer base and usually the 20 tend to be the lowest maintenance and have the lowest resource demand another application of this principle shows that 20 of your customer base accounts for 80 of the resource usage within your company the principle itself is not limited to 80/20 but the of a majority of x is provided by the minority of y is something that remains consistent across economies and cultures    in short not all customers are created equal and as a result do not deserve the same resources as one another in addition to this workforce integrity is more important in the long run than possibly losing a customer average firms provide good service excellent firms provide smart service

i skimmed the answer from and it looked correct if you 're going to set this up from scratch   since you said you already have a system for tracking stocks however maybe you 'd prefer to use that   it should handle almost everything you need note that only the last of these actually ties the option and the underlying together in your accounting system   other than that case the option behaves in your accounting system as if it were a stock it does not behave that way in the market but you need to manage that risk profile outside of the double entry accounting system

it 's not usually apparent to the average consumer but there 's actually two stages to collecting a payment and two ways to undo it   the particular combination that occurs may lead to long refund times on top of any human delays like ben miller 's answer addresses when you pay with a credit card it is typically only authorized the issuing bank says i 'm setting this money aside for this transaction but no money actually changes hands   you 'll typically see this on your statement as a pending charge   only later in a process called settlement does your bank actually send money to the merchant 's bank   typically this process starts the same day that the authorization happens at close of business but it may take a few days to complete   in the case of an ecommerce transaction the merchant may not be allowed to start it until they ship whatever you ordered on the flip side a given transaction can be voided off or money can be sent back to your card   in the first case the transaction will just disappear altogether in the second it may disappear or you may see both the payment and the refund on your statement   can be as fast as an authorization but once a transaction has started settlement it ca n't be voided any more   sending money back a refund goes through the same settlement process as above and can take just as long so to specifically apply that to your question you get the sms when the transaction is authorized even though no money has yet moved   the refund money wo n't show up until several days after someone indicates that it should happen and there 's no reverse authorize operation to let you or your bank know that it 's coming

i 'll get to my answer in a moment but first need to put focus on the two key components of bond prices interest rates and credit risk suppose that the 10-year treasury has a coupon of 2 per year it would be paid as 1 twice per year in reality if you own one contract of the bond which we suppose has a so called face value of $ 100 then this contract will over the ten years pay you a total of $ 20 in coupons then $ 100 at redemption so $ 120 in total would you therefore buy this 10-year treasury bond for $ 120 or more or less well if there were bank accounts around which were offering you an interest rate of 2 per year fixed for the next 10 years then you could alternatively generate $ 120 from just $ 100 deposited now if we assume that the interest paid is not put back in the account to earn 2 per year consequently a price of $ 100 for the treasury would seem about right however suppose that you are not very confident that the banks that offer these accounts will even be around in 10 years time maybe they will fail before that and you 'll never get your money back then you might say to yourself that the above calculation is mathematically right but not really a full representation of the different risks and you conclude that maybe treasuries should be a bit more expensive because they offer better credit risk than bank deposits   all of this just to show that the price of bonds is a comparative valuation of rates and credit you need to know the general level of interest rates available in other investment products even in stocks i 'd say you need to have a feel for how much credit risk there is in the different investment products most people think that normally interest rates are positive because we are so familiar with the basic principle that if i lend you some money then you need to pay me some interest but in a world where everyone is worried about bank failures people might prefer to effectively deposit our savings with the us treasury by buying their bonds than to deposit their savings in the local bank the us treasury will see this extra demand and put up the prices of their   bonds they are not stupid at the us treasury you know so maybe the price of the 10-year treasury will go above $ 120 it could right in this scenario the implied yield on the 10-year treasury is negative there you go yields have gone negative because of credit risk concerns

in general buying a house will improve your net worth over the long haul because unlike cars houses do n't suffer as much from depreciation   the problem with real property is that markets are very cyclic and are n't very liquid assets farmers with thousands of acres of valuable land are often cash poor for that very reason a lot of people here are negative about housing ownership   this is illustrative of the fact that 2010 is a year where real estate is on the down side of the cycle

there was a book written by harry dent in the early 90 's that talked about the approaching demographic problem the simple version of his theory is that people spend the most money between 45 49 after which people begin to become a drain on the economy as they utilize government benefits and begin draining retirement plans    boomers are moving out of this range and there is no group substantially large enough to follow them according to him until the mid when the echo boomers come through    while he had some things way off and u fortunately seems to be as of late and only his newsletters he had some great points in his first book    to me you ca n't fudge those numbers and what he said makes a lot of sense that seems to be very similar to this article

great answers here 's my two cents first do n't forget to look at the overall picture not just the dividend study the company 's income statement balance sheet and cash flow statement for the last few years make sure they have good earnings potential and are not carrying too much debt i know it 's dull but it 's better to miss an opportunity than to buy a turkey and watch the dividends and the share price tank i went through this with bac bank of america a couple of years ago they had a history of rising dividends when i bought them and the yield was about 8 then the banking crisis happened and the dividend went from $ to $ 0.04 and the price fell from $ 40 to $ 5 i stuck with it continuing to buy at lower and lower prices and eventually sold them all at $ 12 and managed to break even but it was not a pleasant experience do your homework still one of the most reliable ways to judge a company 's dividend paying ability is to look at its dividend history once a company has started paying a dividend there is a strong expectation from shareholders that these payments will continue and the company 's management will try very hard to maintain them though sometimes this does n't work out e.g. bac you should see an uninterrupted stream of non decreasing payments over a period of at least 5 years this timeframe is just a rule of thumb well established profitable companies also tend to increase their dividends over time which has the added benefit of pushing up their share price so you 're getting increasing dividends and capital gains next look at the company 's payout ratio over time and the actual cost of the dividend can the projected earnings cover the dividend cost without going above the payout ratio if not then the dividend is likely to get reduced in the case of the dividend history is short and erratic the earnings are also all over the place so it 's hard to predict what will happen next year the company is up to its eyeballs debt current ratio is .2 and its earnings have dropped by 20 in the last quarter they have lost money in two of the last three years even though earning have jumped dramatically this is a very young company and in my opinion it is too early for them to be paying dividends a very speculative stock and you are more likely to make money from capital gains than dividends is a different story they are profitable and have a long dividend history although the dividend was cut in half recently this may be a good to buy them hoping the dividend comes back once the economy recovers however they are trading at over 40 times earnings which seems expensive considering their low profit margins before investing your money invest in your education get some books on interpretation of financial and learn how to read the numbers it 's sort of like looking at the codes in the matrix and seeing the in the red dress or whatever it was good luck

before we all argue about his pricing blah blah let me explain to you how he absolutely fleeced consumers under the guise of helping them   had a handful of sales strategies   40 off   50 off   buy one get one for $ 0.01   buy one get one for $ 0.99   60 off   green tag clearance where things were up to 90 off discounted prices items as low as $   what he did was basically eliminate all of the different kind of sales and just discount a straight 40   meaning that before when you were screwed the worst you would do is their everyday low pricing today if you went in and bought at their worst 40 sale you got exactly what he offers you right now if you were lucky and went in at a better time you actually saved more generally around 50 with type of stuff   not only that he killed coupons this is where you could really rake you would   save money with your card   $ 10 off orders of $ 25   $ 10 off orders of $ 30   $ 10 off orders of $ 50 $ 15 off $ 75 $ 25 off $ 100   again these all varied but you could stack coupons on top of savings   shoppers like me stopped going there because the savings ceased to exist we 're not stupid but he played us like we were and he counted on people 's outrage of sales to dupe them as you can see by the scheme i 've shown you not only saved more before but way more and the argument that it 's better now is patently false because their prices are identical to their worst sale without any coupons   why do you think the red stickers go over the price because they want to hide it the same items at kohls have the sticker from union bay or whoever on it it 's all the same msrp it 's just that he tried to fool the shoppers he did n't have with false outrage but alienated the rest of the shoppers who look at their receipt

answers 1 no sections of the irc were passed in the reagan 2 not only can a foreign company like a chocolate company fall afoul of the definition of pfic because of the asset test which you cite but it can also be called a pfic because of the income test   for example i have shares in a development stage canadian biotech which is considered a pfic because it has no income at all except for a minor amount of bank interest on its working capital   this company is by no means passive it has run 31 clinical trials in over 1100 human research subjects burning $ 250 m of investor 's money in the process nor is it an investment company but the stupid irs considers it to be a passive foreign investment company   the irs looks at it and sees only the bank account and assumes it is a foreign shell corporation set up to shield the bank interest from them 3 yes a foreign mutual fund is exactly what congress intended to be a pfic when passed irc   candy factories ect got nailed as innocent   note that if you hold a us mutual fund then every year you 'll get a form 1099 in the mail   the 1099 will report your share of the mutual fund 's own income and capital gains which you must report on your taxes   you can also have capital gains from selling your shares of the mutual fund but that 's a different thing now suppose that there was no pfic law   then the us investors in the mutual fund would do better if the mutual fund were in a foreign country for two reasons a the fund would no longer distribute 1099 's   that means the shareholders would n't have to pay tax every year on their proportions of the fund 's own income gains   the money that would have sooner gone to the irs can sit around for years earning interest b the fund could return profits to shareholders exclusively through capital gains rather than dividends thus ensuring that all of the investors income on the fund would be taxed at < rather than up to 39   the fund could do this by returning cash to shareholders exclusively through buybacks however the us mutual fund industry does n't want to move the industry to canada and it only takes a few newspaper articles about a foreign loophole to make congress spring to action 4 it depends   if you have a election in place as i do for my biotech shares then form 8621 takes a few minutes by hand   however this requires both the company and the investor to fully cooperate with congress 's vision for pfics   the company by providing a so called pfic annual information sheet which replaces the 1099 form for a us mutual fund   the investor by having a election in place for each and every tax year in which he held the stock and by reporting the numbers from the pfic annual information sheet on his return   note that the election persists once made until revoked   there are here that i am glossing over since deemed sale elections and other means may be used to modify a share 's holding period to come into compliance note that there is software coming out to handle pfics and that the software makers will already run their software to make your form 8621 for $ 75 or so   i should also warn you that the blogs of tax accountants and tax lawyers all contradict each other on the basic issue of whether you can take capital losses on pfics for which you have no form 8621 elections   see section 2.3 of my notes for commentary on this mess   i do not know if the software people will tell you which elections are best made on form 8621 though or advise you if it 's time to simply dump your investment the professional software is at and the individual 8621 preparation is at btw in case you 're interested i wrote up a very careful analysis of how to deal with the pfic situation for the small biotech i invested in in certain cases it is posted   for tax reasons it was quite fortunate that the share price dipped to near an all time low on jan 1 2015 making the next 2015 tax year ripe for a so called deemed sale election   this was only possible because the company provides the necessary pfic annual information statements which your chocolate factory may or may not do

insurance is for events that are both and unexpected and for many people catastrophic events are for example sickness disability death car accidents house fires and for which you may buy health disability life auto home and renter 's insurance   it may be catastrophic for a family relying on a very old earner for that earner to die and you can buy life insurance up to a very old age but the premiums will reflect the likelihood of someone of that age dying within the covered period   the more expected an event is the more anything referred to as insurance is actually forced savings health insurance with no copays on regular checkups expects the insured to use them so the cost of those checkups plus a profit for the insurance company is factored into the premiums ahead of time   a wooden pencil breaking may be unexpected regardless of no one buys insurance on wooden as the loss of a pencil is not catastrophic what is catastrophic can be context dependent health care needs are typically as you do n't know when you 'll get sick for a billionaire needing health care while the situation would not be catastrophic and the billionaire can easily self insure his or her health to the same extent as most caps offered by health insurance companies if you 're on a fixed budget buying a laptop if it unexpectedly failed that would be catastrophic to you so budgeting in the cost of insurance or an extended warranty while buying your laptop would probably make sense especially if you need that $ 2000 laptop spending an extra 17.5 would safeguard against you having to come out of pocket and depleting your savings to replace it even though that brings you to a grand total of $ before taxes however if you 're in that tight of a situation i would strongly recommend you to find a less expensive option that would allow you to self insure if you found a used laptop for much less i can even see apple selling macs for less than $ 1000 you might decide that your budget allows you to self insure and you could profit from being careful with your hardware and resolving to cover any issues with it yourself

while i totally agree with you talking to free market people you have to address it this way    their point is that they should pay what the market bears not what you want to make   that is fair     but that market has shown they need to pay more but they ca n't do it      roofing is a perfect example    charge $ 6000 for a roof materials cost $ 2000    labor costs $ 800    the rest is additional expenses and profit   even if you have to give your roofers a 25 raise that is $ 200   you are n't going out of business even if you have to absorb the increase and you ca n't tell me you ca n't raise your prices by $ 200 when your competitors are all over the board   i guarantee that if the cost of shingles go up the cost of a roof is raised no second thought    the problem is that they think their competitors are still paying the old rate   they are no longer competitive if they give a raise they are no longer competitive

changed to answer match the edited version of the question no you do not need to write the date of your endorsement but you can choose to do so if you want to the bank stamp on the back will likely have the date and perhaps even the exact time when the check was   deposited the two lines are there in case you want to write something like for deposit only to acct above your signature always a good idea if you are making the deposit by sending the paper check with or without a deposit slip by us mail or any other method that does n't involve you handing the check to a bank teller if you are wanting to get encash the check that is get cash in return for handing the check over to the bank instead of depositing the check in your account then the rules are quite a bit different

that 's completely false   if you buy a house and live in it for 30 years it should rise about 2 3 with inflation neglecting any bubbles then when you sell it it may be worth 75 to 100 more than you paid for it   but if you sell it for 50 60 more you did n't actually make any money due to inflation you lost money but are still expected to pay capital gains on that

the typical scam is that they overpay you or for some obscure reason they claim and they ask you to wire the extra money either back or to someone else because you wire it that money is gone for sure then they undo the original transaction or it turns out it was fake anyway and you end up with a loss maybe he claims that he wants to buy some more stuff and the fees are high so he sends you all the payments in one amount and you pay the other sellers from it something like that there are honest though actually most of them either way the real problem is that the original payment is fake whichever way it comes to you you need to make sure that it can not be reversed or declared invalid after you think you have it wire transfer is the only way i know that is not reversible bank transfers are reversible do n't think you have it just because it arrives in your bank account talk to your bank about what all can happen if you make the deal when you send the bike think about insuring it and make him pay for that too that way you are out of any loss risk

you say   my work is steady even if i lost my job it 'd be easy to get another location has been static for a few years now but i 'm not sure that 'll extrapolate to the future i 'm lazy so i do n't want to move but for a significantly better job opportunity i would n't mind    the general rule of thumb is that you 'll come out ahead if you buy a house with a mortgage and live there for five years   what you lose in interest you make up in rent   and living there for five years you make back your closing costs in equity   if you 're there less than five years though you do n't make back the closing costs   you 'd have been better off renting    historically up to about twenty years ago your mortgage payment and rent payment for the same basic property would be about the same   i.e. if your current landlord sold you what you are renting your mortgage payment would be roughly the same as your rent   maybe a little lower or a little higher but about the same   more recently it has n't been strange to see a divergence in those   now it is not uncommon for a mortgage payment to be 50 higher than rent on the same property    this has some consequences   first your $ 1000 rent probably wo n't stretch as far as a $ 1000 mortgage payment   so you 'll be buying something that you 'd only pay $ 650 or $ 700 rent   second if you move and ca n't sell immediately you 'll get less in rent than you 'd pay in mortgage   rather than contributing to your income the property will require subsidy just to maintain the mortgage   and in the early years of the mortgage this means that you 're paying all of the principal equity and some of the interest    buying a duplex makes this worse   you have your side and their side   you can substitute your $ 1000 rent for half of the mortgage payment   meanwhile they are paying $ 700 in rent   you have to subsidize the mortgage by $ 300   plus you are talking about hiring a property management company to do things like lawn maintenance   there goes another $ 100 a month   so you are subsidizing the mortgage by $ 400    i do n't know real estate prices in utah but a quick search finds a median house price over $ 200,000   so it seems unlikely that you are buying new construction with new appliances   more likely you are buying an existing duplex with existing appliances   what happens when they fail   the renter does n't pay for that   the property management company does n't pay for that although they 'll likely arrange for it to happen   you pay for it    also it often takes a bit of time to clean up the apartment after one tenant leaves before the new tenant starts paying rent   that 's a dead weight loss   if this happens during a local recession you could be carrying the mortgage on a property with no offsetting rental income for months    there are some forces   for example if house prices in your area are increasing the rent will increase with them not necessarily at the same pace   but your mortgage payment stays the same   so eventually the rent may catch up with the mortgage payment   if you wait long enough in a strong enough market the rent on the other half of the duplex may cover the entire mortgage payment    if you currently have an urban apartment within walking distance of work and switch to a suburban apartment with a commute you have a better chance of finding a duplex where the entire mortgage payment is only the $ 1000 that you pay in rent   your half of the duplex wo n't be as nice as your apartment is and you 'll have a half hour or hour long commute every morning and the same to get home in the evening   but on strictly fiscal terms you 'll be doing about as well   plus you have the income from the other half   so even if your mortgage payment is more than your rent payment you can still break even if the rent covers it    consider a $ 1400 mortgage and $ 400 in rent from the other half after property management fees   so long as nothing goes wrong you break even   perhaps the agreement is that your parents take care of things going wrong broken appliances troublesome tenants time between tenants   or perhaps you drain your emergency fund and adjust your 401(k payment down to the minimum when that happens   once your emergency fund is replenished restore the 401(k    if you 're willing to live in what 's essentially a $ 500 apartment you can do better this way   of course you can also do better by living in a $ 500 apartment and banking the other $ 500 that you spend on rent   plus you now have the expenses of a commute and five hours less free time a week    you describe yourself as essentially living paycheck to paycheck   you have adequate savings but no building excess   whatever you get paid you immediately turn around and spend   your parents may view you as profligate   your apartment is nicer than their early apartments were   you go out more often   you 're not putting anything aside for later except retirement    it did n't use to be at all strange for people to move out of the city because they needed more space   for the same rent they were paying in the city they could buy a house in the suburbs   then they 'd build up equity   so long as they stayed in roughly the same work location they did n't need to move until they were ready to upgrade their house    the duplex plan leads to one of two things   either you sell the duplex and use the equity to buy a nicer regular house or you move out of the duplex and rent your half   now you have a rental property providing income   and if you saved enough for a down payment you can still buy a regular house    from your parents perspective encouraging you to buy a duplex may be the equivalent of asking you to cut back on spending   rather than reducing your 401(k deposits they may be you trading in your car for a cheaper one and trading in your nice but expensive apartment for something more reasonable in a cheaper neighborhood   rather than working with a property management company you 'll be out doing rather than with your friends   and maybe the new place would have more space to share when you meet someone you are n't going to provide many grandkids alone    if you get a mortgage on a duplex you are responsible for paying the mortgage   you are responsible even if something happens to the house   for example if a fire burns it down or a takes it away   or you just find that the house is n't solid enough to support that party where all of your friends are jumping up and down to the latest pop sensation   so beyond losing whatever you invest in the property you may also lose what you borrowed    now consider what happens if you invest the same amount of money in general motors as in the house   let 's call that $ 10,000 and give the house a value of $ 200,000   with general motors even if they go bankrupt tomorrow you 're only out $ 10,000   with the house you 're out $ 200,000   admittedly it 's much hard to lose the entire $ 200,000 value of the house   but even if the house loses $ 80,000 in value you are still $ 70,000 in the hole    you do n't need a disaster for the house to lose $ 80,000 in value   that 's pretty much what happened in the 2006 2010 period   people were losing all of what they invested in houses plus having to declare bankruptcy to get out of the excess debt   of course if they had been able to hold on until 2015 markets mostly recovered   but if you lost your job in 2008 they would n't let you not make mortgage payments until you got a new one in 2012    when you declare bankruptcy you do n't just lose the house   you also lose all your emergency savings and may lose some of your belongings    there are some pretty disasters too   for example you and your tenant both go away for a weekend   it rains heavily and your roof starts to leak due to weak maintenance so not covered by insurance   the house floods destroying all the electronics and damaging various other things   bad enough if it 's just you but you 're also responsible for the tenant 's belongings   they sue you for $ 20,000 and they move out   so no rent and big expenses   to get the house livable again is going to take $ 160,000   plus you have a $ 190,000 mortgage on a property that is only worth about $ 40,000   that 's at the extreme end

look at a mixture of low fee index funds low fee bond funds and cds the exact allocation has to be tailored to your appetite for risk if you only want to park the money with essentially no risk of loss then you need fdic insured products like cds or a money market account as opposed to a money market fund which is not fdic insured however as others have said interest rates are awful now   since you are in your early 30 's and expect to keep this investment for 10 + years you can probably tolerate a bit of risk also considering speaking to a tax professional to determine the specific tax benefits drawbacks of one investment strategy funds and cds versus another e.g. real estate

my experience is in economics so it may differ from an accounting or personal finance perspective somewhat that being said i find it perfectly acceptable to use a term like cagr when the rate is positive or negative economists talk about negative growth rates all the time and it 's universally assumed that growth rates can be positive or ideally the actual magnitude and sign of the value should be specified by the value itself the term whether it 's growth rate some modified version of it like cagr or any label in a table or on a graph should describe the calculation or source used obtain the value i should n't need the name to indicate the sign of the number if the number is present the name is only there to help me understand the value unfortunately i do n't know of any specific term that represents the geometric averaging nature of cagr and also eliminates the minor potential for semantic confusion however i think the minor problem of semantics needs to be balanced against the tradeoff of using a different term that is n't as common if one were to exist cagr is a standard well known term that a allows someone who is familiar with the term to instantly understand the procedure you 're using and b allow someone who is n't familiar with it to quickly search and find an explanation since searching for cagr will numerous simple explanations of how it 's calculated 1 this is different from the concept of economic growth which is usually assumed to be positive in informal discussions in economic modeling many of the first steps in creating a model are symbolic anyway so growth rate change in output and economic growth are used interchangeably to describe changes in gdp because the values either are n't known irrelevant until later in the project or pulled from data that describes it using one or several of the previously stated terms

self employment is typically harder to qualify with than w2 income in general the bank is going to want 2 years of tax returns you will be asked to sign a that allows the bank to get the records directly from the irs self employment income will be averaged across the 2 years i do n't think a 20 drop in profits is large enough to cause concern but it might i would plan on being able borrow against the lowest year just in case   if you get a w2 job you will be able to count the income immediately assuming it is not a temporary position the bank will ask for   the offer letter if you have decent credit and 20 down you should be able to get a mortgage either way a w2 is typically less paperwork and you would get to claim your current income assuming that is higher than your past income

the slips from your bank for your hsa account are for an account already established and thus the bank is willing to accept your deposits even if they arrive at the bank after the april 15 deadline as long as the postmark   is april 15 or earlier the account exists in the bank they know who you are and that the payment is received after april 15 is just due to the normal or even abnormal delays in postal delivery for the new account that you tried to establish with appropriate and timely postmark etc the credit union could not   have received the paperwork as of the close of business on april 15 except in the very unlikely circumstance that a local letter deposited in the mailbox in the morning gets delivered the same day by usps do n't extrapolate from stories of how mail was delivered in london in victorian times ergo you did not   have an hsa account in the credit union as of april 15 and they are perfectly correct in refusing to open an account with a april 15 date and put money into it for the previous tax year to answer the question asked   are they allowed to ignore the postmark date yes not only are they allowed to ignore the postmark date the irs insists that they ignore the postmark date the credit union prefers to report only the truth as of april 15 you had not established an hsa account as of april 15 to say otherwise would be making a false statement to the irs

let me answer by parts when a company gives dividends the share price drops by the dividend amount   not always by that exact amount for many different reasons e.g. there are transaction costs if you reinvest dividend taxes etc i have tested that empirically now if all the shareholders choose to reinvest their dividends will the share price go back up to what it was prior to the dividend that is an interesting question the final theoretical price of the company does not need to be that when a company distributes dividends its liquidity diminish there is an impact on the balance sheet of the company if all investors go to the secondary market and reinvest the dividends in the shares that does not restore the cash in the balance sheet of the company hence the theoretical real value of the company is different before the dividends of course in practice there is not such a thing as one theoretical value in reality if everybody reinvest the dividend that will put upward pressure over the price of the company and depending on the depth of the offers meaning how many orders will counterbalance the upward pressure at the moment the final price will be determined which can be higher or lower than before not necessarily equal i ask because some like spy automatically reinvest dividends so what is the effect of this reinvestment on the stock price let us see the mechanics of these purchases when a non distributing etf receives cash from the dividends of the companies it takes that cash and reinvest it in the whole basket of stocks that compose the index not just in the companies that provided the dividends the net effect of that is a small leverage effect let us say you bought one unit of spy and during the whole year the shares pay 2 of dividends that are reinvested at the end of that year it will be equivalent to having 1.02 units of spy

for the future never buy a car based on the payment   when dealers start negotiating they always try to have you focus on the monthly payment   this allows them to change the numbers for your trade the price they are selling the car for etc so that they maximize the amount of money they can get   to combat this you need to educate yourself on how much total money you are willing to spend for the vehicle then if you need financing figure out what that actually works out to on a monthly basis never take out a 6 year loan   especially on a used car   if you ca n't afford a used car with at most a 3 year note paying cash is much better then you ca n't really afford that car   the longer the note term the more money you are throwing away in interest   you could have simply bought a much cheaper car drove it for a couple years then paid cash for a one with the money you saved    now as to the amount you are upside down and that you are looking at new cars   $ 1400 is n't really that bad   note yes you were taken to the cleaners   someone mentioned that banks will sometimes loan up to 20 above msrp   this is true depending on your credit but it 's a very bad idea because you are purposely putting yourself in the exact same position worse actually    however you should n't need to worry about that   it is trivial to negotiate such that you pay less than sticker for a new car while trading yours in even with that deficit   markup on vehicles is pretty insane   when i sold it was usually around 20 for foreign and up to 30 for domestic that leaves a lot of wiggle room when buying a used car most dealers ask for at least $ 3k more than what they bought them for sometimes much more than that depending on blue book loan value or what they managed to talk the previous owner out of    either way a purchase can swallow that $ 1400 without making it worse   buy accordingly

without knowing specifics about your personal situation there are two items to consider   1 pre pay as many items as possible this year   rent lease insurance premiums etc to reduce your profit on paper in this tax year     2 if you do n't have a retirement plan for yourself look into it as a way to put some money aside for retirement pre tax   if your accountant ca n't help with this perhaps find a financial planner    congrats though great problem to have

i know your pain oh so much   i literally have a 14 gallon container full of i have received   even worse for profit fundraising companies send most of those mailings they take the money and deduct their expenses rigged to consume all your gift   some companies have been caught passing as little as 9 to the charity   first let 's talk about a few issues   authentication   is that outfit really a tax deductible charity    address    is this their genuine address or is it the dropbox of a scammer or one of those evil for profit fundraising companies   acknowledgement    for gifts over a certain size you need a thank you letter from them to show the irs that you really donated   will you get it   the limit is $ 250 no letter deduction rejected but as a practical thing it helps in an audit to show as many donation letters as possible   charities can not issue them retroactively but can issue you second copies of ones they sent previously if the charity drops the ball you lose   obviously enough you go to the post office and spend $ 1 on a money order      this does not authenticate them as a charity it does not assure it goes to their real address   you can do both these things yourself by checking their data on the irs website or on you do n't get an acknowledgement   i mention these because donation websites work much the same way require a higher one time commitment but are much simpler and more efficient after that if you are planning to give $ 5000 in a single year save it up and open a donor advised fund account   a daf is itself a charity    you donate to the daf and take the tax deduction for charitable   then you tell the daf to donate it to other charities on your behalf or anonymously    their concept is you use the daf as a buffer so you can easily make the tax deductible donation when you need to for tax purposes then at your leisure research charities and support them   however i asked my daf most people donate and then immediately re donate the money leaving the fund at zero balance   my daf does n't mind that at all and they charge zero fees for this    its expenses are paid by those of us who leave money sitting around in the daf   mine charges 0.6 a year   this money can be invested sort of like in a 401 k and each investment also has an expense ratio such as 0.18 a year in my chosen index fund   websites like will take any amount of your money and re donate it to the charity you select    they deduct 3 5 for their expenses notably paper stamps and the 2 3 it costs them to process your credit card

you 're asking all the right questions and if i worked for my landlord 's company i might have an answer i imagine they 're capitalizing on people 's laziness i live in the bay area where some people probably do n't mind paying $ 35 to not have to walk 100 feet to the office and drop off a check

while you would probably not use your atm card to buy a $ 1 m worth mansion i 've heard urban about people who bought a house on a credit card while ca n't say its reliable i would n't be surprised that some have actual factual basis i myself had put a car down payment on my credit card and had i paid the sticker price the dealer would definitely have no problem with putting the whole car on the credit card and my limits would allow it even for a luxury brand the instruments are the same there 's nothing special you need to have to pay a million dollars you just write a lot of zeroes on your check but you do n't need a special check for that large amounts of money are transferred electronically wire transfers which is also something that regular people do once or twice in their lives what might be different is the way these purchases are financed rich people are not necessarily rich with cash most likely they 're rich with equity own something that 's worth a lot in this case instead of a mortgage secured by the house they can take a loan secured by the stocks they own this way they do n't actually cash out of the investment yet get cash from its value it is similarly to what we regular mortals do with our equity in primary residence and helocs so it is not at all uncommon that a billionaire will in fact have tons of money owed in loans why because the billions owned are owned through stock valuation and the cash used is basically a loan secured by these stocks it might happen that the stocks securing the loans become worthless and that will definitely be a problem both to the now and the bank but until then they can get cash from their investment without cashing out and without paying taxes and if they 're lucky enough to die before they need to repay the loans they saved tons on money on taxes

because how you look at a billion or millions is important compared to how he looks at it   the bottom line is incentive to continue if he looks at how things used to be and how they are now and decides it 's not worth it it is his to close or sell the company    hopefully he sells to a chinese company who will low ball profits down to 100 million net profit and cuts employee benefits would n't that be a great success story of government incentivized capitalism   america
