there are a few reason why the stock price decreases after a dividend is paid   what 's the point of paying a dividend if the stock price automatically decreases do n't the shareholders just break even companies have to do something with their profits they beholden to their shareholders to make them money either by increasing the share value or paying dividends so they have the choice between reinvesting their profits into the company to grow the business or just handing the profits directly to the owners of the business the shareholders some companies are as big as they want to be and investing their profits into more capital offers them diminishing returns these companies are more likely to pay dividends to their shareholders i assume the price of the stock naturally increases over the year to reflect the amount of the dividend payment this is kind of a vague question but then does n't it make it difficult to evaluate the fluctuations in stock price in the way that you would a company that does n't pay a dividend it depends on the company the price may recover the dividend drop could take a few days to a week and that on the company 's performance and the overall market performance   with respect to options i assume nothing special happens so say i bought $ 9 call options yesterday that were in the money all of a sudden they 're just not is this typically priced into the option price is there anything else i need to know about buying options in companies that pay dividends what if i had an in the money option and all of a sudden out of nowhere a company decides to pay a dividend for the first time am i just screwed one key is that dividends are announced in advance typically at least if not always not sure if it 's required by law but i would n't be surprised this is one reason people will sometimes exercise a call option early because they want to get the actual stock in order to earn the dividend for out of the ordinary large cash dividends over 10 is the guideline stock splits or other situations an option can be adjusted if you have an options account they probably sent you a characteristics and risks of standardized options booklet it has a section discussing this topic and the details of what kinds of situations trigger an adjustment a regular pre announced < 10 dividend does not while a special large dividend would is what i roughly get from it that characteristics and risks of standardized options is worth reading by the way it 's long and complicated but well options are complicated finally do all companies reduce their stock price when they pay a dividend are they required to i 'm just shocked i 've never heard of this before the company does n't directly control the stock price but i do believe this is automatic i think the market does this automatically because if they did n't there would be enough people trying to do dividend capture arbitrage that it would ultimately drive down the price

the exchanges artificially push the price of the stock down on the ex div date often the impact of paying the dividend is absorbed by the and flow of trading in the stock later in the day by the market i think this was with nokia because the company is in poor shape and the stock has recently   dividends are a great way for companies to return value to shareholders the trend for many companies particularly growth stocks is to reinvest profits to grow the company former growth stocks like microsoft like to just sit on billions of dollars and do nothing with it

regarding    1 what 's the point of paying a dividend if the stock price automatically decreases do n't the shareholders just break even    as dividends distribution dates and amounts are announced in advance probably the stock price will rise of the same amount of the divident before the day of distribution if i know that stock share a 's value is y and the dividend announced is x i would be willing to buy shares of a for anything > y and < than x+y before the distribution so arbitrageurs probably would take the price to x+y before the dividend distribution and then after the dividend distribution the price will fall back to y.

1 what 's the point of paying a dividend if the stock price    automatically decreases do n't the shareholders just break even when the company earns cash beyond what is needed for expenses the value of the firm increases as a shareholder you own a piece of that increased value as soon as the company earns it when the dividend is paid the value of the firm decreases but you break even on the dividend transaction the benefit to you in holding the company 's shares is the continually increasing value whether paid out to you or retained be careful not to confuse the value of the firm with the stock price the stock price is ever changing in the short term driven mostly by investor emotion over the long term by far the largest effect on stock price is earnings take an extreme and simplistic example the company never grows or shrinks earnings are always the same there is no inflation and they pay everything out in dividends by the reasoning above the firm value never changes so over the long term the stock price will never change but you still get your quarterly dividends

4 finally do all companies reduce their stock price when they pay a dividend are they required to there seems to be confusion behind this question   a company does not set the price for their stock so they ca n't reduce it either   in fact nobody sets the price for a stock the price you see reported is simply the last price that the stock was traded at   that trade was just one particular trade in a whole sequence of trades   the price used for the trade is simply the price which the particular buyer and particular seller agreed to for that particular trade   no agreement well then no trade   there 's no authority for the price other than the collection of all buyers and sellers so what happens when nokia declares a 55 cent dividend   when they declare there is to be a dividend they state the record date which is the date which determines who will get the dividend the owners of the shares on that date are the people who get the dividend payment   the stock exchanges need to account for the payment so that investors know who gets it and who does n't so they set the ex dividend date which is the date on which trades of the stock will first trade without the right to receive the dividend payment   ex dividend is usually about 2 days before record date   these dates are established well before they occur so all market participants can know exactly when this change in value will occur when trading on ex dividend day begins there is no authority to set a different price than the previous day 's closing price   what happens is that all knowledgeable market participants know that today nokia is trading without the payment 55 cents that buyers the previous day get   so what do they do   they take that into consideration when they make an offer to buy stock and probably end up offering a price that is about 55 cents less than they would have otherwise   similarly sellers know they will be getting that 55 cents so when they choose a price to offer their stock at it will likely be about that much less than they would have asked for otherwise

the reason comcast i 'll just say comcast when i mean tv providers like comcast dish cox etc bundle channels is because they get to sell advertising on those channels   each channel or group of channels like disney charges comcast for the of broadcasting it   that is abc and hbo and so forth ask comcast for a certain $ $ per year month fortnight etc     comcast then takes really popular channels like hbo and bundles them up with shitty channels like and the oxygen network   comcast then sells advertising based on those   so if you want to advertise to middle aged white women in the mid morning oxygen you have to also pay for advertising on hbo at the same time which drives up the price comcast can ask   the popular channels are essentially loss leaders     in turn however oxygen can say hey you 're making a of money advertising on our channel comcast   pay us more or we pull the channel    this cycle continues and is part of the reason cable tv prices keep going up   some other reasons are over the top greed   for your model to work a single subscription fee would have to replace the income earned from ads and maintain the same price paid to each network   since comcast can no longer force people to pay for oxygen when all they want is hbo the prices for the non popular channels skyrocket as people stop paying for them    the shitty networks are n't willing to take the risk of cutting their revenue streams off and will most certainly write into their agreements with comcast and no streaming    the super popular networks do n't need the extra income and feel like streaming would diminish their brand so they add in similar no streaming clauses

my point of view is that monopolies happen because politics whether that 's politicians trade boards or oversight allows them to occur it 's a failure of politicians in allowing it to happen not a failure in business as they 're just pursuing their profits when business started to interfere in politics to gain market advantages that 's when monopolies started to form competitive marketplaces are self sustaining unless you create the conditions for monopolies to form   once you what price you sell a good at you 're going down a slippery slope of communism it 's a free market and companies should be able to freely sell a good at whatever price they want if other companies ca n't compete in the market at that price then they are n't as efficient as the other company and it would hurt the economy in the long run to have them operating at higher costs than similar companies who can do it better   i did n't say that the only exit for a startup is acquisition but i digress the reality is that the tech market is dominated by large businesses who in politics to maintain their position such as google and apple colluding in hiring apple and googles wage fixing cartel involved dozens more companies over one million this is bad for everyone and especially for startups and needs to be so that startups and big companies alike can competitively challenge each other in the tech sectors   i think we 're arguing for roughly the same thing but it seems that it 's a different between equality vs equity i might be wrong however

some sample prices for straightforward pay for hours or planners i think i 've seen some similar rates elsewhere too i 'd feel like you might get something and boilerplate for too much less than $ 1000 how could the person afford to spend much time and i 'd feel like lots more than $ 1000 for just a standard straightforward plan might be a ripoff basically you 're paying $ 1000 for a day or two of work you do n't want just a couple hours of work but you do n't need a week of work either anyway extracting the general guideline since prices may vary or over time you could figure it takes a day or two to do a decent job on a basic complete financial plan without a lot of complexities in it from there you can decide what 's fair adding or subtracting time if you need less than a complete plan or have complex issues this is assuming you 're paying for time and which is not a given the biggest factor in how much you pay is probably how they charge a couple of the most common models there are other models but these are the ones i 've seen most the difference between these two models is a lot of money over time hourly is going to be much cheaper because it 's a one time cost instead of ongoing and unrelated to what you have in assets however you wo n't get investment management which can be valuable if you are n't the kind to stick to an investment plan or you want someone else to completely take care of it for you the investment management planners have the potential to make a lot more money and are more likely to be in it for the money hourly planners do n't really have as good a business from a business owner 's perspective but they are cheaper from a customer perspective as long as you 're happy to diy a bit one thing i like about hourly planners is that i do n't really feel investments are the main place planners can add value so it makes me nervous to have the compensation based on that insurance estate planning taxes etc are where it 's harder for a to know all the ins and outs and diy from what i 've seen the cheapest planners are the ones that you can get free or discounted from companies like usaa or vanguard if you have an account with them however they will only recommend products from the company in question so that 's a downside and you probably wo n't get to meet them in person this question may be useful too what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money

the most obvious use of a collateral is as a risk buffer just as when you borrow money to buy a house and the bank uses the house as a collateral so when people borrow money to loan financial instruments or as is more accurate gain leverage the lender keeps a percentage of that or an equivalent instrument as a collateral in the event that the borrower falls short of margin requirements brokers in most cases have the right to sell that collateral and mitigate the risk   derivatives contracts like any other financial instrument come with their risks and depending on their nature they may sometimes be much more riskier than their underlying instruments for example while a common stock 's main risk comes from the movements in its price which may itself result from many other macro micro economic factors an option in that common stock faces risks from those factors plus the volatility of the stock 's price   to cover this risk lenders apply much higher haircuts when lending against these derivatives in many cases depending upon the notional exposure of the derivative that actual dollar amount of the collateral may be more than the face value or the market value of the derivatives contract usually this collateral is deposited not as the derivatives contract itself but rather as the underlying financial instrument an equity in case of an option a bond in case of a cds and so on this allows the lender to offset the risk by executing a trade on that collateral itself

i 'm not convinced that cost of living is related to ensuring greater appreciation of assets over time especially over a 30 year window the importance of regional differences in cost of living to anyone 's decision making should be weighted by the percentage of their income spent on indexed items   that is for people who spend 35 or even 50 of their salary on indexed items regional variances in cost of living are far more important than for people who spend 10 of their salaries on these items   essentially as income goes up the significance of cost of living goes down see for a pretty picture of the relevance of cost of living across income groups for food gas which are often not included in indexes due to volatility   so if you are wondering whether cost of living is overstated perhaps it 's because you are in an income group that does n't need to worry about it as much   whether it 's overstated or not will depend on how much one makes and spends

when evaluating a refinance it all comes down to the payback refinancing costs money in closing costs there are different reasons for refinancing and they all have different methods for calculating payback   one reason to finance is to get a lower interest rate when determining the payback time you calculate how long it would take to recover your closing costs with the amount you save in interest for example if the closing costs are $ 2,000 your payback time is 2 years if it takes 2 years to save that amount in interest with the new interest rate vs. the old one the longer you hold the mortgage after you refinance the more money you save in interest with the new rate generally it does n't pay to refinance to a lower rate right before you sell because you are n't holding the mortgage long enough to see the interest savings you seem to be 3 years away from selling so you might be able to see some savings here in the next three years   a second reason people refinance is to lower their monthly payment if they are having trouble paying it i see you are considering switching from a 15 year to a 30 year is one of your goals to reduce your monthly payment by refinancing to a 30 year you 'll be paying a lot of interest in your first few years of payments extending the payback time of your lower interest rate   a third reason people refinance is to pull cash out of their equity this applies to you as well since you are planning on using it to remodel the home you are trying to sell you have to ask yourself if the renovations you are planning will payoff in the increased sale price of your home often renovations do n't increase the value of their home as much as they cost you do renovations because you will enjoy living in the renovated home and you get some of your money back when you sell but sometimes you can increase the value of your home by enough to cover the cost of the renovation talk to a real estate agent in your area to get their advice on how much the renovations you are talking about will increase the value of your home

gt;my father and my grandfather and my great grandfather could all sustain their families on a single middle class income   well depends on what you define as middle class income   some of it is a rising expected standard of living   what size house did they have   how many automobiles did they have   if you go back to your great grandfather 's time he probably had far fewer sets of clothing   they probably did n't have the television telephone and air conditioning services that i expect most middle class people expect   my dad ate fruits and vegetables only in season you did n't get to have in the middle of winter or shipped in from chile   i expect to be able to travel via air to visit relatives go back to the 1960s or even into the 1970s and it was considered something that only

a chunk of change than they did before   we eat more meat if i remember a lecture on this correctly   my parents had a lot more and inexpensive foods than i do   but some of it is also adjusting norms   reading about the sort of house that a farmer lived in a few hundred years back would make me think of horrible poverty by modern standards   most women seem not to have wanted to remain when women started going out and doing men 's historical work   so if they go out into the workforce then keeping up with the doing what 's considered middle class requires doubling income and downwards pressure on some fixed costs like say utility costs or gas costs is lessened that makes things tough on the few families who want to have a single income standard   sure maybe a small percentage of people out

line has fallen dramatically in value as the need for more people to do this sort of work has fallen off   wages for a particular job are a function of how many people are available to do them relative to how many are needed   every atm is one less bank teller every e commerce website fewer retail workers   that increases the productive capacity of society but whereas before there might be tremendous demand for someone to perform a repeated task on an assembly line which it was easy to train people to do many of the types of labor that are currently under supplied are things that take longer to train people to do and require more specialization   debt   any debt that someone has that does n't have a positive return on investment an engineering degree would probably have a positive roi a large television probably a negative winds up making them poorer in the long run   any debt at all barring investors making bad pricing decisions and hitting default or unexpectedly low returns means transfer of wealth from people without money to people with money   the more non defaulted upon debt the more people with more wealth make more wealth from lending   people have vastly more personal debt than they once did    compare the amount of debt that someone has today with the amount of debt that they typically had in your great grandfather 's time in the 1930s   there 's a constant drain of wealth towards the lenders   this is one of elizabeth warren 's favorite points people take out a lot more debt particularly on housing than they ever did in the past and so a lot of their income is eaten year by year on debt service   there are lots of factors that make it easier to take out more debt   the biggest source of personal debt is by far pdfs and this is where the largest increases have taken place policies to try to encourage people to go into debt to take out larger and larger mortgages have been steadily ramped up over this time with the government subsidizing and taking on risk for insurance liability on mortgages to keep encouraging ever larger amounts of debt   lenders have computers and much more information and sophisticated systems for evaluating risk of default which permits lending out more wealth   so there are technological changes driving this   the government has more public debt which means more such payments even if they do n't show up on your personal checkbook and are only seen by an increasing disparity between what you pay in taxes and the services you get back    here 's a chart of inflation adjusted debt per business of the day americans income and the us in the united states   that means that there 's a constant increasing in the siphoning off of taxes as well to pay for the government having purchased a good or service without having actually paid for it at the time it was ordered   that decreasing green line means not that personal debt is falling well most of the time but that the government is taking out debt on your behalf even faster than private debt has been going up   the rest of the world catching up and breaking a temporary limited monopoly on certain   china and india were not industrialized and the former stuck under and not trading much with the rest of the world so there were fewer people available to do this sort of work   europe rebuilt from world war ii so it did n't have to purchase from the overseas us manufacturing industry   what could change   well standard of living is a cultural thing that seems hard to manipulate   i 'm sure that it 's possible to change that but i have a hard time suggesting how   automation would be an across the board good thing if workers could be efficiently shifted into fields which currently have more demand it 's only an issue for workers if they stay in a field that has falling demand   i 'm sure that our mechanisms for re educating workers are not terribly good   today our education system still involves having a person stand up in front of a lot of other people and talk at them then have those other people go and repeat some rote tasks to try and hammer something into their brain it 's the same mechanism that the wealthy used hundreds of years ago to tutor their children but ramped up on a larger scale   if it were cheaper and easier to learn a new trade it 'd be easier to enter lucrative fields   college costs in particular are ridiculous   when you take college classes you 're basically getting a reading list a very few limited slots to ask questions and a set of predefined tasks plus some grading   that can be done far less than it is provided today   i personally have high hopes for online courses as a start here though i 'm sure that there will be blocks   ditto for things like wikipedia using means that i can skip over things i already know and focus on what i do n't understand and electronic automatic distribution means that it can be done far less than having some guy with a phd stand up in front of a room and read some lecture notes   instead of answering questions generation after generation those people should be polishing databases of answers to questions so that every subsequent human being can quickly and easily refer to their answer and so that we can direct people to the best explanation easily   it 's possible to adopt some measures that would reduce debt service by reducing public debt but the public debt has been growing for a long time and it seems very clear that people are much more willing to take out debt than to cut into their favorite concern low taxes or lots of services in the immediate future   as for reducing debt service via reducing private debt most of the policy and technological factors that drive private debt seem unlikely to change to me   maybe if we see some sort of cultural change an aversion to taking out debt with a negative roi but all of the information i 'm giving here has been public for a long time and people have n't changed so i doubt that we 'll see any kind of a reversal or social movement against taking out lots of debt   you 'd have to have the equivalent of a great wiki with respect to debt and given that attempts to excite interest in the matter have generally not gone anywhere thus far i suspect that this is human nature and doubt that things will change   you can always change your personal debt decisions but society as a whole   as for the temporary monopoly well i think that it 's pretty much inevitable that the rest of the world catches up to a great degree   asia will catch up even africa will eventually get there   i think that that would be a pretty difficult thing to stop and i think that most of the world would object to someone attempting to stop it

a major thing to consider when deciding whether to invest or pay off debt is cash flow specifically how each choice affects your cash flow and how your cash flow is affected by various events simply enough your cash flow is the amount of money that passes through your finances during a given period often a month or a year some of this is necessary payments like staying current on loans rent etc while other parts are not necessary such as eating out for example you currently have $ 5,500 debt at 3 and another $ 2,500 at 5 this means that every month your cashflow effect of these loans is $ 5,500 3 12 + $ 2,500 5 12 = $ 24 interest before any applicable tax effects plus any required payments toward the principal which you do n't state to have the $ 8,000 paid off in 30 years you 'd be paying another $ 33 toward the principal for a total of about $ 60 per month before tax effects in your case if you take the full $ 7,000 you have available and use it to pay off the debt starting with the higher interest loan then your situation changes such that you now assuming that the repayment timeline remains the same the cashflow effect of the above becomes $ 1,000 3 12 = $ interest plus $ toward the principal again before tax effects in one fell swoop you just reduced your monthly payment from $ 60 to $ 5.25 per year this means $ 720 to $ 63 so on the $ 7,000 invested in repayment you get $ in return every year for a annual return on investment it will take you about 11 years to use only this money to save another $ 7,000 as opposed to the 30 years original repayment schedule if the extra payment goes toward knocking time off the existing repayment schedule but keeping the amount paid toward the principal per month the same you are now paying $ 33 toward the principal plus $ 2.50 interest against the $ 1,000 loan which means by paying $ you will be debt free in 30 months two and a half years instead of 30 years an effective 92 reduction in repayment time you immediately have another about $ in your budget and in two and a half years you will have $ 60 per month that you would n't have if you stuck with the original repayment schedule if instead the total amount paid remains the same you are then paying about $ toward the principal and will be debt free in less than a year and a half not too shabby if you ask me also do n't forget that this is a known guaranteed return in that you know what you would be paying in interest if you did n't do this and you know what you will be paying in interest if you do this even if the interest rate is variable you can calculate this to a reasonable degree of certainty the difference between those two is your return on investment compare this to the fact that while an investment in the s&p might have similar returns over long periods of time the stock market is much more volatile in the shorter term as the past two decades have so demonstrated it does n't do you much good if an investment returns 10 per year over 30 years if when you need the money it 's down 30 because you bought at a local peak and have held the investment for only a year also consider if you go back to school are you going to feel better about a $ payment or a $ payment even if the payments on old debt are deferred while you are studying you will still have to pay the money and it will likely be accruing interest in the meantime now i really do n't advocate your savings account entirely the way i did in the example above stuff happens all the time and some stuff that happens costs money instead you should be keeping some of that money easily available in a liquid non volatile form which basically means a savings account without withdrawal penalties or a money market fund not the stock market how much depends on your necessary expenses a buffer of three months worth of expenses is an often recommended starting point for an emergency fund the above should however help you evaluate how much to keep how much to invest and how much to use to pay off loans early respectively

not exactly   my sewing needle example had nothing to do with population growth   population growth offsets nothing   unemployment percentages would go up as populations grow if there was a net loss in jobs   instead unemployment goes up and down just like it always has     how did population growth offset farmers using tractors to get you more food   africa also has seen explosive population growth without using nearly as many tractors as we use how are they doing   the fact of the matter is more things are being produced   this means more people are buying more things   not that there are more people being born buying more things but people have greater buying power because as more things hit the market their price goes down   what income class would you have to be in to buy a computer in 1985 compared to now   what was the capability of producing a computer between 1985 and now   automation simply this is one area we no longer have to focus on now we can focus on other areas    also where are you getting that we are approaching unsustainable levels of population growth   please look up atlanta vs year 2000   look at the difference in population per   how can you say we are quickly approaching that point

first of all kudos to you for seeing the value in saving at a young age there are several different things you can mean by this and i 'm not sure which is accurate so i am going to address the first two that i thought of if you are selling your investments because you need the money emergency expenses saved enough for a short term goal whatever the reason then this may not be the best solution for your savings   investing in mutual funds etfs stocks 401k ira etc are typically for longer term goals such as a goal that is 10 + years away maybe buying a home paying for college for your children retirement etc if you are selling your investments because you believe that another investment is performing better and you want to get in on that one instead what i would suggest is leaving the money you have invested where it is and starting future investments in the new fund etf you are interested in   for example if you have $ 2000 invested in fund x and now you do some research and fund q looks more appealing that is great start investing in fund q with your next deposit   any research you do will be based on past results there is nothing that guarantees that fund q will continue doing better than the fund x you already have   trying to time the market rarely ends well for the investor i would encourage you to continue saving money a bit at a time just like you have been doing   avoid selling your investments until it is time to sell them for whatever goal you intended them for   set aside some cash to cover any unexpected expenses so you wo n't have to sell your investments to cover the costs even at 18 unplanned things happen

i 've heard that the bank may agree to a one time adjustment to lower the payments on mortgage 2 because of paying a very large payment is this something that really happens it 's to the banks advantage to reduce the payments in that situation   if they were willing to loan you money previously they should still be willing   if they keep the payments the same then you 'll pay off the loan faster   just playing with a spreadsheet paying off a third of the mortgage amount would eliminate the back half of the payments or reduces payments by around two leaving off any escrow or insurance    if you can afford the payments i 'd lean towards leaving them at the current level and paying off the loan early   but you know your circumstances better than we do    if you are underfunded elsewhere shore things up   fully fund your 401k and ira   fill out your emergency fund   buy that new appliance that you do n't quite need yet but will soon   if you are paying pmi you should reduce the principal down to the point where you no longer have to do so   that 's usually more than 20 equity or less than an 80 loan    there is an argument for investing the remainder in securities stocks and bonds   if you itemize you can deduct the interest on your mortgage   and then you can deduct other things like local and state taxes   if you 're getting a higher return from securities than you 'd pay on the mortgage it can be a good investment   five or ten years from now when your interest drops closer to the threshold you can cash out and pay off more of the mortgage than you could now    the problem is that this might not be the best time for that   the buffett indicator is currently higher than it was before the 2007 9 market crash   that suggests that stocks are n't the best place for a medium term investment right now    i 'd pay down the mortgage   you know the return on that   no matter what happens with the market it will save you on interest   i 'd keep the payments where they are now unless they are your budget unduly   pay off your thirty year mortgage in fifteen years

genius answer do n't spend more than you make pay off your outstanding debts put plenty away towards savings so that you do n't need to rely on credit more than necessary guaranteed to work every time   answer more tailored to your question what you 're asking for is not realistic practical logical or reasonable you 're asking banks to take a risk on you knowing based on your credit history that you 're bad at managing debt and funds solely based on how much cash you happen to have on hand at the moment you ask for credit or a loan or based on your salary which is n't guaranteed except in cases like professional athletes where long term contracts are in play   you can qualify for lower rates for mortgages with a larger down payment but you 're still going to get higher rate offers than someone with good credit   if you plan on having enough cash around that you think banks would consider making you credit worthy why bother using credit at all and not just pay for things with cash   the reason banks offer credit or low interest on loans is because people have proven themselves to be trustworthy of repaying that debt based on the information you have provided the bank would n't consider you trustworthy yet even if you have $ 100,000 in cash they do n't know that you 're not just going to spend it tomorrow and not have the ability to repay a long term loan you could use that $ 100,000 to buy something and then use that as collateral but the banks will still consider you a default risk until you 've established a credit history to prove them otherwise

to confirm you say you have credit card debt of $ 18,000 with min repayment of $ plus on top of this you are also paying off a car loan and another personal loan from my calculations if your monthly interest on your credit card is $ 237 the interest on your credit card should be about p.a is this correct balance transfer if you did a balance transfer of your $ 18,000 to a new credit card with 0 for 14 months and keep your repayments the same $ you would have saved yourself a bit over $ in interest over those 14 months your credit card balance after 14 months would be about $ instead of $ with your current situation if your interest after the 14 months went back to   you would be able to pay the remaining $ in 2.5 more years keeping repayments at $ saving 10 months off your repayments and a total of $ in interest over 3 years and 8 months the main emphasis here is that you are able to keep your repayments at least the same so you are able to pay off the debt quicker and that your interest rate on the new credit card after the 14 months interest free is not more than your current interest rate of things you should be careful about if you take this path debt consolidation in regards to a debt consolidation for your personal loan and credit card and possibly your car loan into a single lower interest rate loan can be a good idea but there are some pitfalls you should consider if you are taking out a loan with a lower interest rate but a longer term to pay it off you may end up paying less in monthly repayments but will end up paying more interest in the long run if you do take this course of action try to keep your term to no longer than your current debt 's terms and try to keep your repayments as high as possible to pay the debt off as soon as possible and reduce any interest you have to pay as you already have you credit card and personal loan with cba talk to them to see what kind of deal they can give you again be wary of the fine print and read the of any products you are thinking of getting refer to money smart website for more valuable information you should consider before taking out any debt consolidation other action you can take if you are finding that the repayments are really getting out of hand and no one will help you with any debt consolidation or reducing your interest rates on your debts as a last resort you can apply for a part 9 debt agreement but be very careful as this is an alternative to bankruptcy and like bankruptcy a debt agreement will appear on your credit file for seven years and your name will be listed on the national personal insolvency index forever further assistance and help if you have trouble reading any or want further information or help regarding any issues i have raised or any other part of your financial situation you can contact centrelink 's financial information service they provide a free and confidential service that provides education and information on financial and lifestyle issues to all australians

you probably have enough math to satisfy a program as an incoming student however gmat will matter a lot the and their equivalents are going to have more applicants with perfect and higher math backgrounds than they can take if you ca n't distinguish yourself with connections from well published professors who can write good letters for you then they 're probably out of reach which means almost surely that you wo n't get a job at an ivy or equivalent as they are pretty incestuous    basically if you go on the market without a top tier publication before you go out or without a huge endorsement from a big name your best outcome is to land at a school that is the same level as the one from which you receive your degree and you had better have at least 1 decent pub or or a presentation at a top conference with a good pipeline to hope for that   more likely outcome is you have a good job market paper decent pipeline maybe a few conference presentations but no pub or in which case the most likely outcome for you is a step down from the tier of school you were at so if you were at a flagship state program then you will end up in the second tier state programs the worse your portfolio on the market the farther you fall   so if your goal is a flagship state program then you need to be aiming as high as absolutely possible and the chances of getting into those programs are progressively smaller the higher you shoot the flagship state schools like ut and the ivy equivalents like harvard etc will get hundreds if not thousands of applicants ones with backgrounds in working finance or econ or worse i had two physics phd holders start in my cohort with me so you have no chance to compete with that kind of math and programming experience perfect and great recommendations it is very hard but you ca n't win if you do n't play i suppose i would wager that the average number of applications to programs sent by applicants is around 50 so why not aim a few of those applications high and see if anything sticks    computer language proficiency is a good thing to highlight but wo n't win you any big awards by the time you get out of your first year every student should have proficiency in either stata r sas and have some python perl c etc depending on what area of research you go for so you have a head start but not for long    your best shot to improve your chances are good recommendations from professors you know that are research active and big names in their sub fields and in the finance field as a whole next up would be to have an active interest in a research area and be able to discuss write about why you want to research that area do n't just think about it go look up papers that do that sort of research and see what they do and how they do it so that you will know the limitations of that sort of research when i interview a prospective student and they say i am interested in international finance research or any other sort of general field i know they have n't got a clue what they 're interested in which puts them behind again

here is a less scientific view of why there is a focus on credit utilization it is the easiest to control by doing something the focus on utilization is coming from the people asking the questions regarding how to improve their score some even have an obsession with trying to wring a few more points even though they have no immediate need for a loan   look at the other factors that means that for 70 the best advice is either wait for your history to get longer do n't open a new line or do n't close an old line therefore the only thing they control is to get their utilization score down if they pay off balance that saves them interest if they ask for or are award an increase in credit line that also brings down their utilization number if it is the easiest to improve it will garner a greater focus from consumers therefore it seems that the credit industry focuses on it in reality each consumer has to look at their situation to see which part of their overall score they need to focus on

the money is not subject to tax because it was deposited you can deposit money as much as you like that 's not what is triggering the tax what is triggering the tax is the sale itself and it has already happened if your friend is taxed for capital gains under the spanish tax law then this money is already taxable and not paying the tax due is tax evasion depositing the money may indeed trigger an investigation that will lead to evasion charges but it would not be the depositing the money that was against the law not depositing the money does n't mean you will avoid investigation it just means that the authorities may learn about it in a different way and charge you with additional crimes while at it money laundering fraud whatever keeping large amounts of cash brings additional complications and dangers the more people knowing about it and they will as you spend it the higher chances are for you to split it with some robber or thief i suggest talking to a licensed tax accountant in spain about whether the sale of the flat is taxable in spain or not if it is pay the taxes due and be done with that

before we all argue about his pricing blah blah let me explain to you how he absolutely fleeced consumers under the guise of helping them   had a handful of sales strategies   40 off   50 off   buy one get one for $ 0.01   buy one get one for $ 0.99   60 off   green tag clearance where things were up to 90 off discounted prices items as low as $   what he did was basically eliminate all of the different kind of sales and just discount a straight 40   meaning that before when you were screwed the worst you would do is their everyday low pricing today if you went in and bought at their worst 40 sale you got exactly what he offers you right now if you were lucky and went in at a better time you actually saved more generally around 50 with type of stuff   not only that he killed coupons this is where you could really rake you would   save money with your card   $ 10 off orders of $ 25   $ 10 off orders of $ 30   $ 10 off orders of $ 50 $ 15 off $ 75 $ 25 off $ 100   again these all varied but you could stack coupons on top of savings   shoppers like me stopped going there because the savings ceased to exist we 're not stupid but he played us like we were and he counted on people 's outrage of sales to dupe them as you can see by the scheme i 've shown you not only saved more before but way more and the argument that it 's better now is patently false because their prices are identical to their worst sale without any coupons   why do you think the red stickers go over the price because they want to hide it the same items at kohls have the sticker from union bay or whoever on it it 's all the same msrp it 's just that he tried to fool the shoppers he did n't have with false outrage but alienated the rest of the shoppers who look at their receipt

besides what others have mentioned another thing to watch out for is the tax withholding on withdrawal if it 's a traditional ira they will probably withhold a certain percentage on non qualified withdrawals i am not sure if you can ask them not to withhold i do n't remember the percentage and it varies by state but let 's assume it is 20 that means that you only receive 80 of the withdrawal amount when you take it out however when you deposit the money to complete the rollover you need to give them 100 of the withdrawal that means assuming the 20 withholding you need to fork out cash equal to 125 of what you received in cash within 60 days that 's like several hundred percent apr and hard to meet unless you are certain of receiving a large payment within the time period and if you forget about this and you just deposit the same amount that you received 80 of the withdrawal the remainder 20 of the withdrawal will count as an early withdrawal with all the taxes and penalty so what happens to the 20 withheld that you never received but had to pay anyway well the government has it it will count as tax paid on your tax return so it will increase your refund decrease the amount you owe but that means you are out that money until tax time unless you decrease the withholding on your salary in the rest of the year to compensate if it 's a roth ira withdrawal on the contribution there is generally no withholding so you do n't have to worry about the above but there is no penalty on withdrawal of roth ira contribution anyway

this is a classic case of sunk cost fallacy the basic idea is this do n't look at how much you 've invested look at what the thing is worth it sounds like you are no longer able to keep up so the financial answer is to stop making repairs etc   the only question is whose name is on the deed if your coworker still owns the asset you can simply back out say the mobile home is yours any repairs and payments i made are yours too   basically you will be out all of your work and what you put into it but you 're not continuing to dig a hole your coworker should consider your investment as a gift but a gift that is no longer being made if in taking over the asset he put it in your name the asset is yours to do with as you please   it sounds like you should dispose of the asset even if its at a loss either way from a financial perspective the answer is to cut your losses and be done with it all of that is of course a strictly financial answer   reading between the lines it seems like you feel guilty about not being able to honor the commitment you have made   if there is a sentimental attachment to the mobile i would suggest discussing your situation with the coworker   that 's really not a financial consideration but that does n't mean its unimportant

an emergency fund of $ 5000 seems on the low side and i would be worried about spending it down to $ 2000 that said you want to get out of the car loan it sounds like you have a little extra income since you think you can rebuild your emergency fund quicker than just the amount you will save from not having a car payment one option to decrease the hit to your emergency fund is to save aggressively for a month or two to increase your emergency fund by a few hundred dollars and take on some other debt possibly credit card you could then pay off the new debt and replenish your emergency fund over a slightly longer period while some financial planners dislike the idea of an emergency fund while still having high interest debt to me i would prefer to have $ 1000 in credit card debt and $ 3000 in an emergency fund over $ 0 in credit card debt and $ 2000 in an emergency fund given your time course of 6 months or so to pay off the debt you might even qualify for a 0 credit card introductory rate or balance transfer

it would be good to know which country you are in you are basically on the right track with your last point usually when you buy your first property you need to come up with a deposit and then borrow the remainder to have enough to purchase the property in most cases and most places the standard percentage of loan to deposit is 80 to 20 this is expressed as the loan to value ratio lvr which in this case would be 80 this being the amount of the loan to the value of the property some banks and lenders will lend you more than the 80 but this can usually come with extra costs in australia the banks charge an extra percentage when you borrow called loan mortgage insurance if you borrow over 80 and the gets more expensive the higher lvr you borrow also this practice of lending more than 80 lvr has been tightened up since the gfc so if you are borrowing 80 of the value of the property you will need to come up with the remainder 20 deposit plus the additional closing costs taxes in australia we have to pay stamp duty solicitor or fees loan application fees building and pest inspection costs etc if you then want to buy a second property you will need to come up with the same deposit and other closing costs again most people can not afford to do this any time soon especially since the a good majority of the money they used to save before is now going to pay the mortgage and upkeep of your first property especially if you used to say live with your parents and now live in the property and not rent it out so what a lot of people do who want to buy more properties is wait until the lvr of the property has dropped to say below 60 this is achieved by the value of the property going up in value and the mortgage principle being reduced by your mortgage payments once you have enough as you say collateral or equity in the first property then you can refinance your mortgage and use this equity in your existing property and the value of the new property you want to buy to basically borrow 100 of the value of the new property plus closing costs as long as the lvr of the total borrowings versus the value of both properties remains at or below 80 this should be achievable you can do this in two ways firstly you could refinance your first mortgage and borrow up to 80 lvr again and use this additional funds as your deposit and closing costs for the second property for which you would then get a second mortgage the second way is to refinance one mortgage over the two properties the first method is preferred as your mortgages and properties are separated so if something does go wrong you do n't have to sell everything up all at once this process can be quite slow at the start as you might have to wait a few years to build up equity in one property especially if you live in it but as you accumulate more and more properties it becomes easier and quicker to do as your equity will increase quicker with tenants paying a good portion of your costs if not all if you are positively geared of course you do want to be careful if property prices fall as this may drastically reduce your equity and increase your total lvr or the lvr on individual properties and have a safety net for example i try to keep my lvr to 60 or below currently they are below 50

if you are looking to go long buy you would use bid prices as this is what you will be matched against for your order to be executed and a trade to go through if you are looking to go short sell you would use the ask prices as this is what you will be matched against for your order to be executed and a trade go through in your analysis you could use either this convention or the midpoint of the two prices as fx is very liquid the bid and ask prices would be quite close to each other so the easiest way to do your analysis is to use the convention i listed above

i have a personal theory that due to warren buffett having the entire faith and backing of wall street that it definitely plays into his returns look at the mortgage originator he money into that was truly a terrible business a whole lot of wall street poured money into it right after as well i do n't think he would be as consistent if he were only buying a handful of shares and could n't influence the entire price as a whole but i 'm not denying historically he 's made a lot of good picks

while i 'm not an accountant this is how i do this for my personal    accounting note if you do n't want the expense to take effect right away meaning    it 'll affect your profits then the transaction date here needs to be    something in the future then when you hit that date and the bill is    still not paid you just the bill and repost again with a new    date so you end up with something like the following    4 now you post the invoice to liabilities accounts payable the cable company the invoice due date should reflect what you had in the invoice this is important as gnucash will warn you that your bill is due if you want to pay it every time it starts   when you 're ready to pay the bill just find the bill and click pay invoice if it 's already paid and you imported transactions from your bank find the transaction then right click and click assign as payment then choose your invoice note i 've being using this to also record cheques that are given to    people but not cashed yet i hope that helps

i 'm sorry to hear you 've made a mistake having read the contract of sale we signed i do not see any remedy to your current situation   however i 'm interested in making sure i do not take advantage of you   as such i 'll return the vehicle you can return my money plus the bank fees i paid for the cashiers check tax title and registration and i will look at buying a vehicle from another dealership    this seems to be the most fair resolution   if i were to pay for your mistake at a price i did not agree to it would not be fair to me   if you were to allow this vehicle to go to me at the price we agreed to it would n't be fair to you   if i were to return the car and begin negotiations again or find a different car in your lot it would be difficult for us to know that you were not going to make a similar mistake again at this point i consider the sale final but if you 'd prefer to have the vehicle back as is returning to us the money we gave you as well as the additional costs incurred by the sale then we will do so in order to set things right chances are good you will see them back down   perhaps they will just cut the additional payment in half and say well it 's our mistake so we will eat half the cost or similar but this is merely another way to get you to pay more money    stand firm   i appreciate the thought but i can not accept that offer when will you have payment ready so we can return the car if you are firm that the only two solutions is to keep the car or return it for a full refund plus associated costs i 'd guess they 'd rather you keep the car trust me they still made a profit but if they decide to have it returned do so and make sure they pay you in full plus other costs   bring all your receipts etc and do n't hand over the keys until you have the check in hand then go gladly to another dealership that does n't abuse its customers so badly if you do end up keeping the car do n't plan on going back to that dealership   use another dealership for warranty work and find a good mechanic for non warranty work note that this solution is n't legally required in most jurisdictions read your contract and all documentation they provided at the time of sale to be sure but it 's unlikely that you are legally required to make another payment for a vehicle after the sale is finalized   even if they have n't cashed the check the sale has already been finalized what this solution does though is put you back in the driver 's seat in negotiating   right now they are treating it as though you owe them something and thus you might feel an obligation toward them   re asserting your relationship with them as a customer rather than a debtor is very important regardless of how you proceed you are n't legally culpable and so making sure they understand you are n't will ultimately help you further dealerships operate on negotiation the primary power the customer has in the dealership is the power to walk away from a deal they 've set the situation up as though you no longer have the power to walk away   they did n't threaten with re possession because they ca n't the sale is final they presented as a one path situation you pay   period you do have many options though and they are very familiar with the walk away option   present that as your chosen option either they stick with the original deal or you walk away and they will have to look at getting another car off the lot which is often more important than making a profit for a dealership or selling a slightly used car if they 've correctly pushed the title transfer through or you if that 's your task in your state then your brief ownership will show up on and similar reports and instantly reduces the car 's worth   having the title transfer immediately back to the dealership does n't look good to future buyers so the dealership does n't want the car back   they are just trying to extract more money and probably illegally depending on the laws in your jurisdiction your position as customer and decide now that you 'll be fine if you have to return it and walk away then when you communicate that to them chances are good they 'll simply cave and let the sale stand as is

this is called currency speculation and it 's one of the more risky forms of investing   unless you have a crystal ball that tells you the euro will move up or down relative to the dollar it 's purely speculation even if it seems like it 's on an upswing   you have to remember that the people who are speculating professionally on currency are the reason that the amount changed and it 's because something caused them to believe the correct value is the current one not another value in one direction or the other this is not to say people do n't make money on currency speculation but unless you 're a professional investor who has a very good understanding of why currencies move one way or the other or know someone who is and gives free advice it 's not a particularly good idea to engage in it while stock trading is typically win win currency speculation is always zero sum that said you could hedge your funds at this point or any other by keeping some money in both accounts that is often safer than having all in one or the other as you will tend to break even when one falls against the other and not suffer significant losses if one or the other has a major downturn

i would say you can file your taxes on your own but you will probably want the advice of an accountant if you need any supplies or tools for the side business that might be tax deductible iirc you do n't have to tell your current employer for tax reasons just check that your contract does n't state you ca n't have a side job or business but i believe you 'll have to tell hmrc at the end of the year you 'll have to file a tax return and at that point in time you 'll have to pay the tax on the additional earnings these will be taxed at your highest tax rate and you might end up in a higher tax bracket too i 'd put about 40 away for tax that will put you on the safe side in case you end up in the high tax bracket if not you 'll have a bit of money going spare after paying your taxes

more perspective on whether buying the stock going long or options are better my other answer gave results for the option route even though i made up the numbers but indeed if you know exactly when a move is going to happen assuming a non thin and orderly option market on a stock then a call or put will almost of necessity produce exaggerated returns there are still many many catches e.g. what if the move happens 2 days from now and the option expires in 1 so a universal can not be made of which is better consider this though a huge number of airline stock options were traded in the week before the investors presumably with the of the events that would happen in the next couple of days could score tremendous profits because they knew exactly when a big stock price movement would happen and knew with some certainty just what direction it would go it 's probably going to be very rare that you know exactly when a security will move a substantial amount 3 is substantial and exactly when it will happen unless you trade on inside knowledge which might lead to a prison sentence i hope this provides some perspective on the magnitude of results above and recognizing that such a fantastic outcome is rather unlikely then consider jack 's answer above his and all of them are good in the long run unless one has a price prediction gift smarter than the market at large or has special knowledge his insurance remark is apt

if you have a credit card with no interest free period there is no drawback as you will be saving interest the sooner you pay it off however if you have a credit card with an interest free period the drawback on paying it earlier than the due date such as when you first get the statement is that you lose out on interest for the period between when you first recieve the statement to when it is due you could have your money earning you interest in a high interest paying savings account depending on how much you spend on your credit card each month and the interest rate you get this may add up to quite a bit of additional cash each year

the short answer is that there are no great personal finance programs out there any more in the past i found microsoft money to be slick and feature rich but unfortunately it has been discontinued a few years ago   your choices now are quicken and mint along with the several open source programs that have been listed by others in the past i found the open source programs to be both clunky and not feature complete for my every day use it 's possible they have improved significantly since i had last looked at them the biggest limitation i saw with them is weakness of integration with financial service providers banks credit card companies brokerage accounts etc let 's start with mint mint is a web based tool owned by the same company as quicken whose main feature is its ability to connect to nearly every financial institution you 're likely to use mint aggregates that data for you and presents it on the homepage this makes it very easy to see your net worth and changes to it over time spending trends track your progress on budgets and long term goals etc mint allows you to do all of this with little or no data entry it has support for your investments but does not allow for deep analysis of them quicken is a desktop program it is extremely feature rich in terms of supporting different types of accounts transactions reports reconciliation etc one could use quicken to do everything that i just described about mint but the power of quicken is in its more manual features for example while mint is on showing you your status quicken allows you to enter transactions in real time as you 're writing a check initiating a transfer etc and later them with data from your financial institutions link mint quicken has good integration with financial companies so you can generally get away with as little or as much data entry as you want for example you can manually enter large checks and transfers and later match to automatically downloaded data but allow small entries like credit card purchases to download automatically   bottom line if you 're just looking to keep track of where you are at try mint it 's very simple and free if you need more power and want to manage your finances on a more transactional level try quicken though i believe they do not have a trial version i do n't understand why the learning curve is steep although probably than that of gnucash last note on why mint.com is free it 's the usual ad supported model plus mint sells aggregated consumer behaviour reports to other institutions since mint has everyone 's transactions it can identify consumer trends if you 're not comfortable with that or with the idea of giving a website passwords to all your financial accounts you will find quicken easier to accept hope this helps

the harvested losses are capital losses   see this irs page generally realized capital losses are first offset against realized capital gains   any excess losses can be deducted against ordinary income up to $ 3,000 $ 1,500 if married filing separately on line 13 of form 1040   losses in excess of this limit can be carried forward to later years to reduce capital gains or ordinary income until the balance of these losses is used up this means that your harvested losses can be used to offset ordinary income up to $ 3000 in a single year and with extra losses carried forward to future years   it is pretty close to a free lunch provided that you have some losses somewhere in your portfolio this free lunch is available to anyone but for a human it can be quite a chore to decide when to sell what keep track of the losses and avoid the wash sale rules   the advantage of robo advisors is that they eat that kind of bookkeeping for breakfast so they can take advantage of tax loss harvesting opportunities that would be too cumbersome for a human to bother with

i have n't seen this answer and i do not know the legality of it as it could raise red flags as to money laundering but about the only way to get around the exchange rate spreads and fees is to enter into transactions with a private acquaintance who has euros and needs dollars the problem here is that you are taking on the settlement risk in the sense that you have to trust that they will deposit the euros into your french account when you deposit dollars into their us account if you work this out with a relative or very close friend then the risk should be minimal however a more casual acquaintance may be more apt to walk away from the transaction and disappear with your euros and your dollars really the only other option would be to be compensated for services rendered in euros but that would have tax implications and the fees of an international tax attorney would probably outstrip any savings from forex spreads and fees not paid

there are mutual funds oriented toward kids or that are suitable in some way e.g. they have low minimums here are two articles with mention of some of them of those only usaa first start growth is explicitly for kids or another fund aimed at kids is young investor or the diversified funds with fixed income like usaa first start growth vanguard star world balanced etc have the nice property that they wo n't be as volatile and may spend less time underwater so that might better convey the value of investing vs. an all stock fund where it could be kind of depressing for years on end if you get bad luck though i feel the same principle applies for adults kids may appreciate intangible aspects of the funds e.g. world balanced invests in sustainable companies appreciation also has some social parameters and i think the guy running it does charity work with kids that type of thing there should be quarterly and annual reports on mutual funds or stocks that would give kids something to read and think about related to the investment disclaimer none of these funds are recommendations i have not researched them in any detail just giving you some leads

you should speak to a good tax adviser the less documentation you have the more problems irs are going to cause you generally you can deduct business losses in the year they occurred which is 2011 but you have to show that that was a valid business not just a way to reduce your tax bill with personal expenses thus lack of documentation reduces your ability to prove that you 're entitled to the deduction the burden of proof is generally on you you can not deduct it from 2012 taxes but you can still amend 2011 keep in mind though that amended returns have higher chance of audit and a significant business loss on a business that only existed that year is a major red flag which will raise the probability of an audit to very high percentage theoretically if the business was real and just failed you can definitely deduct this but practically lack of documentation may cause too big a problem and a tax adviser might suggest you giving it up if he does n't think you have a real chance to convince the irs definitely do n't do that without a professional advice it is worth fighting for its quite a loss but do n't do it on your own as you will definitely lose

i think your analysis is very clear it 's a sensible approach and the numbers sound about right to me a few other things you might want to think about tax in some jurisdictions you can deduct mortgage interest against your income tax i see from your profile that you 're in texas but i do n't know the exact situation there and i think it 's better to keep this answer general anyway if that 's the case for you then you should re run your numbers taking that into account you may also be able to make your investments tax advantaged for example if you save them in a retirement account you 'll need to apply the appropriate limits for your specific situation and take an educated guess as to how that might change over the next 30 years liquidity the money you 're not spending on your mortgage is money that 's available to you for other spending or emergencies i.e. even though your default assumption is to invest it and that 's a sensible way to compare with the mortgage you might still place some extra value on having more free access to it overpayments would you have the option to pay extra on the mortgage that 's another way of investing your money that gets you a guaranteed return of the mortgage rate you might want to consider if you 'd want to send some of your excess money that way

sell the house in the scenario you describe he is using the property as an investment with a $ 250 per month buy in this investment does n't make a return right now and when you add in the cost of dealing with the tenant even if he does n't have those cost now he will when they move is out of more than $ 250 a month and he has no direct knowledge that the value will definitely increase he would be better spent selling the house and putting the funds into an investment even a risky investment it will have less maintenance cost associated with the risky investment than the rental property   besides sitting on the property for 10 15 years would cost him 30 45k plus the cost of re renting the house when empty not to mention the inevitable increases in taxes over that time which will either increase his deficit or eat up the rent increase he is able to charge do n't take the loss on the sale just short sale it and take the money and invest one last thought an alternative is to creatively finance a sale take payments from a buyer until they can buy outright that will cover the full mortgage and get him the price he needs you can look up owner financing to find out more on how to do this hope this helps

if you even qualify for a no down payment usda loan which i 'm not sure you would it would be extremely risky to take on a $ 250 k house loan and have near zero equity in the house for a good while if property values drop at all you are going to be stuck in that house which likely has a pretty high monthly payment insurance taxes hoa fees maintenance costs etc   my rule of thumb is that if you ca n't come up with a down payment then you ca n't afford the house especially with that much debt hanging over your head already if one major thing goes wrong with the house roof a c electrical etc you are going to put yourself in a world of hurt with no clear path out of that financial trap my suggestion keep renting until you have enough money for a downpayment even if this means downsizing your price range for houses you are considering

when getting a mortgage it always depends on the bank and each bank may be more or less strict with that being said there are rules and general guidelines which can help you understand how you fit in the world of mortgage approvals if you can provide the same paper work as an employee of your company that you would normally provide from any other company then a bank may just accept that alone however to me it seems like you will be looking at a new variation of what was known as a self certification mortgage a self certification mortgage is basically a mortgage for those who    can not prove their income as a result of the housing collapse the rules on a traditional self cert mortgages have changed as someone who is self employed it is more difficult today to get a mortgage but is still possible this article provides some good information can the self employed still get a mortgage i advise doing some research on this topic and speaking with a professional mortgage broker   some resources compare self cert mortgages how to beat the mortgage famine in 2012 can the self employed still get a mortgage

gt;the odd thing about primary school education that i hear from talking to teachers is that the materials used in the classroom are all bought under some sort of district wide or even state wide in the case of texas decision for which program to use   it did n't used to be that way but yes that is pretty much how it is done these days basically central planning and one size fits all as i said   gt;for reading they generally include a set of books or single book with a sequence of things to be taught teacher 's who 've been teaching for a long time will know which series has useful properties for teaching the material they might refer to them by names but it really just comes down to a set of materials and sequence of introducing material    and of course none of that really has anything to do with actual reading   gt;when one teacher says to another i used $ x to supplement the required $ y it 'd be like a software engineer saying i used a hash map instead of a map for that case because it had better performance for the use case there 's a fair amount of baggage in the statement but another software engineer would understand the differences and know what tradeoffs were being made   no that 's a rather poor analogy   a better analogy would be we used to use sap but then we got bought out by xyz corporation and now we have to build everything around oracle and the reality is that both choices are crap   gt;as to the master 's in reading there 's a lot of goofy degrees offered through the education departments at state schools a large part of it is because the union pay scales include things like education level they tend to be equivalent to any terminal masters program you 'd find in other subjects including mba take these classes part time and summers over the next 3 years and if you pass them all we give you a piece of paper that says masters of education reading or similar it comes down to something like 45 credit hours with a focus on something   it 's also a result of the requirement for continuing education to maintain teaching licenses certifications   and yeah it has created a lot of underwater basket weaving experts the problem is that they actually sincerely believe that they have some significant expertise even though it can not be shown in their results if it could they would be all about merit pay   gt;i actually doubt that it 's going to come down to the sets of materials they have available for teaching some work some do n't the structure of the system discourages unfortunately and the teachers often feel that they have their hands tied   young beginning teachers feel they have their hands tied those types either leave teaching or they succumb to the system   the teacher in question with the masters in reading to the system long long ago   and that teacher 's whole concern was really just a brand x versus brand y thing the teacher knows brand x and so can and probably does teach it while half asleep   most long tenure teachers tend to get in a comfortable comfortable in no small because it is not only familiar but also because it then requires little work to update their or prepare anything new disrupting that i.e. switching from brand x to brand y is therefore nearly always met with either opposition or amp compliance   it is indeed the system but one must keep in mind that it is the teachers collectively in aggregate over time that have essentially created that system

a fund is a portfolio in that it is a collection so the term is interchangeable for the most part   funds are made up of a combination of equities positions i.e. stocks bonds etc plus some amount of un invested cash most of the time when people are talking about a fund they are describing what is really an investment strategy   in other words an example would be a far east agressive fund just a made up name for illustration here which focuses on investment opportunities in the far east that have a higher level of risk than most other investments thus they provide better returns for the investors   the portfolio part of that is what the stocks are that the fund has purchased and is holding on behalf of its investors   other funds focus on municipal bonds or government bonds and the list goes on i hope this helps good luck

while on the surface it may seem that the warrant you described is trading below intrinsic value there are many reasons why that might not be the case it 's more likely that you are lacking information than having identified a derivative instrument that the market has failed to reasonably price for instance might there be a conversion ratio on the warrants other than the 1:1 ratio that you seem to be assuming sometimes warrant terms are such that multiple warrants are required to buy one share of stock consider the conversion ratio is the number of warrants needed in order to buy    or sell one investment unit therefore if the conversion ratio to    buy stock xyz is this means that the holder needs three warrants    in order to purchase one share usually if the conversion ratio is    high the price of the share will be low and vice versa source conversion ratios are sometimes used so that warrants can be issued on a 1:1 basis to existing stockholders but where the potential number of new shares to be issued is much less conversion ratio is just one such example that could lead to perceived mispricing and there may be other restrictions on exercise warrants are not issued by an options exchange using standardized option contract terms and so warrant terms vary considerably from issuer to issuer even series of warrants from the same issuer may have differing terms always look beyond any warrant quote to find a definitive source of the warrant 's precise terms and read those terms carefully before taking any position

littleadv 's answer gives a concise summary of the system as it stands now but much more changed than just the portion of the mandatory contribution that was diverted to the private plan in broad terms the balances of your accounts and your future benefit wo n't change it 's only the source of these benefits that 's changing the bloomberg article describes the changes this way the state will take over the amount of bonds that pension funds held as of end of sept. 3 and turn them into pension liabilities in the state run social security system the state will assume control of percent of pension fund assets including bonds guaranteed by the government and other non stock assets after the change polish workers that held bonds in the private portion of their retirement portfolios will instead have more payments from the state run pension system the balances of your retirement portfolio and your future benefits should n't change but the reality may depend on how the state pension system is managed and any future changes the government implements the effect this change will have on future benefits is n't clear because the change may simply delay the problem of high levels of outstanding sovereign debt not solve it the government stated that because increasing numbers of workers invested their money in private pension funds less money went into the government 's fund which forced them to issue sovereign debt in order to cover the shortfall in their current pension liabilities   the government 's recent cancellation of government bonds in the hands of private pensions will decrease their overall outstanding debt but in exchange the government is increasing its future pension liabilities years down the road the government may find that they need to issue more sovereign debt to cover the increased pension liabilities they 're taking on today in other words they may find themselves back in the same situation years down the road and it 's difficult to predict what changes they might make at that time

in practice momentum and trend following are two different ideas albeit similar and often simultaneously   i do n’t know if the book makes a clear between the two but keep this in mind   1 momentum trading is a trade where prices are increasing decreasing and an increasing rate usually confirmed by heavy volume   like you said this can often be at the top of a bubble or nearing a bottom of a crash but not necessarily   it may also occur when trend trading is violated switching directions or a new trend emerging   2 trend following is a trade where one could draw a linear line in a chart up or down at some angle   being able to draw a line into the future would be your projected target   you could buy now and say the trend is up in 365 days the s&amp;p 500 will trade at on the trend we ’ve seen in the past year

it 's very simple the whole purpose of a credit card for the credit card company is that you borrow money and then pay them interest for the rest of your life the way you describe yourself you are the perfect victim so the obvious thing for you to do is to not touch credit cards with a pole   if you decide to use a credit card then what you should really really do is to pay back the maximum amount possible all the time best is to pay off the credit card in full if at all possible   consider this if you owe them money the interest rate is so high that with the minimum payment your debt will be growing all the time spend $ 1,000 pay $ 10 a month and next year you owe $ 1,100 without having used the credit card at all if you pay $ 32 a month as you mentioned your $ 1,000 purchase is actually a multi year loan if you need a multi year loan for a $ 1,000 purchase an ordinary loan from your bank will be much much cheaper

this is called the ask bid spread the difference varies based on the of the asset the more liquid or the higher the volume of trades for the asset then the smaller the spread is the spread goes to the broker to pay for some of the cost of the trade my guess is that when there is a higher volume of shares being traded brokers need to take less of a fee per share out of the transaction to cover their costs this makes the spread is smaller   this is essentially the difference in    price between the highest price that a    buyer is willing to pay for an asset    and the lowest price for which a    seller is willing to sell it the seller will get the bid price and the buyer will pay the ask and the broker keeps the spread from

did a great job explaining your options so i wo n't rehash any of that i know you said that you do n't want to save for retirement yet but i 'm going to risk answering that you should anyway specifically i think you should consider a roth ira when it comes to tax advantaged retirement accounts once the contribution period for a tax year ends there 's no way to make up for it for example in 2015 you may contribute up to $ 5,500 to your ira you can make those contributions up until tax day of the following year april 15th 2016 after that you can not contribute money towards 2015 again   so each year that goes by you 're losing out on some potential to contribute as for why i think a roth ira specifically could work well for you i 'm advocating this because i think it 's a good balance you put away some money in a retirement account now when it will have the most impact on your future retirement assets taking advantage of a time you will never have again at a low cost custodian like vanguard you can open an ira with as little as $ 1,000 to start and choose from excellent fund options that meet your risk requirements if you end up deciding that you really want that money for a car or a house or beer money you can withdraw any of the contributions without fear of penalty or additional tax but if you decide you do n't really need to take that money back out you 've contributed to your retirement for a tax year you likely would n't have   otherwise and would n't be able to make up for later when you have more than enough to max out an ira each year i also want to stress that you should have a liquid emergency fund in a savings or checking account to deal with unexpected emergencies before funding something like this but after that if you have no specific goal for your savings and you do n't know for sure you 'll actually need to spend it in the near future funding a roth ira is worth considering in my opinion

it sounds like you are describing seller financed mortgages also sometimes called self financed where self is the seller   in essence the buyer and seller enter into a legal contract a promissory note that specifies the payment schedule interest rate etc   the nature of the agreement is similar to the kind of mortgage agreement you 'd get from the bank but no bank is involved it 's just an directly between the buyer and seller if you search for seller financed mortgage or self financed mortgage you can find a good deal more info about this kind of arrangement   here is a useful article from investopedia here is one from forbes and here is one from nolo broadly speaking the advantages and disadvantages of seller financing are two sides of the same coin by doing the agreement yourself without bank involvement you can cut out procedural red tape delays and requirements that a bank might insist on but in so doing you may expose yourself to risks that those procedures are designed to shield you from   most obviously as the seller you receive only the down payment up front not the entire purchase price as you would if the buyer got a bank loan and if the buyer does n't follow through on the agreement you 're on your own as far as starting foreclosure etc you can read up on some of the linked pages for more details about the pros and cons   in general as those pages note seller financed mortgages are relatively rare   a home is a big purchase and if you do n't know what you 're doing it 's easy to screw up in a way that could cost you a large amount of money if things go wrong

actually most insurance policies don't have a cash value if you do n't make a claim   the reason that some life insurance policies do this is that they are really tax sheltered investments posing as insurance   with that in mind the root of your question is really whether insurance premiums are wasted if you never make a claim it really makes no difference if you are talking about ei auto or homeowner 's insurance my answer to that is no what you are paying for when you buy insurance is financial risk avoidance look at it this way you do n't buy ei as an investment where you hope to get a return on your investment you are buying the right to be protected against catastrophic financial difficulty associated with losing your job whether you claim it or not you did receive that protection this is what drives me so crazy when i hear people talk about how an insurance company is ripping you off because you paid more in premiums than they paid out in benefits of course you did if most people did n't pay in more than the company paid out there would be no financial interest for someone to form an insurance company

i 'm going to take a very crude view of this suppose that you have an event that would cost $ 100,000 if it occurred if there 's a 10 chance that it 'll happen to you and the insurance costs less than $ 10,000 you 'll make a profit on average this is of course assuming that you could afford a $ 100,000 loss if you ca n't the actual loss could be much higher or different for example if you could n't afford surgery because you did n't have health insurance it could be a lot more costly in a way that could be difficult to compare to the $ 100,000 obviously this is a very simplistic view of things for example making more than you paid on the premium typically is n't the only reason you 'd buy insurance even if you 're high net worth just wanted to throw this out there for what it 's worth though

depends the short answer is yes hsbc for instance based in new york is listed on both the lse and nyse toyota 's listed on the tse and nyse there are many ways to do this both of the above examples are the result of a corporation owning a subsidiary in a foreign country by the same name a holding company which sells its own stock on the local market the home corporation owns the majority holdings of the subsidiary and issues its own stock on its home country 's exchange it is also possible for the same company to list shares of the same pool of stock on two different exchanges the foreign exchange usually lists the stock in the corporation 's home currency and the share prices are near identical or for a company to sell different portions of itself on different exchanges however these are much rarer for tax liability and other cost purposes it 's usually easier to keep american monies in america and japanese monies in japan by setting up two copies of yourself with one owning the other and move money around between companies as necessary shares of one issue of one company 's stock on one exchange are the same price regardless of where in the world you place a buy order from however that does n't necessarily mean you 'll pay the same actual value of currency for the stock first off you buy the stock in the listed currency which means buying dollars or yen or euros or gbp with both a fluctuating exchange rate between currencies and a broker 's fee one of those cost savings that make it a good idea to charter subsidiaries could you imagine millions a day in car sales moving from american dealers to toyota of japan converted from usd to yen with a forex commission to be paid second you 'll pay the stock broker a commission and he may charge different rates for different exchanges that are cheaper or more costly for him to do business in he might need a trader on the floor at each exchange or contract with a foreign broker for a cut of the commission

typically developing economics are marked by moderate to high inflation as they are growing at a faster pace higher in savings rate and higher lending rates if you reduce the lending rate more business start up will borrow at cheaper rate this in turn means lowers savings rate and leads to higher inflation to combat this central banks make borrowing expensive which lowers inflation and increases the saving rate essentially all these 3 are tied up as to why these countries offer higher interest on usd is because most of the developing countries have trade current account deficit they need to bring in more usd in the country one of the ways is to encourage non resident citizens to park their foreign earning back home ensuring more funds usd inflow   the rate differential also acts as a guide as to how the currency would be valued against usd for example if you get 8 on usd less than 12 had you converted same to rouble at the end of say 3 years the exchange rate between usd and rouble would factor that 4 ie rouble will go down developed countries on the other hand are marked by low inflation they have already achieved everything as there is no in growth it more they are also characterized by low savings and lending rates

if there are no limit orders on the opposite side of the book when your market order gets its turn for execution it should be rejected by the market   a market order should generally not sit on the book like your question suggests waiting for another order to arrive   thus the situation that you describe should not happen in an ordinary market that is operating in an orderly fashion this is not to say that your order can not sit for a while in a queue if there is heavy volume orders will be executed in order so your your market order may have to wait for orders entered ahead of it to be processed   but once its turn comes up that 's it there are some related points to consider i should caution that my answer is biased a bit to us stock markets whereas you asked about currency markets   i believe the same basic principles apply but i 'd be swayed by someone with evidence to the contrary   i 'd also note that currency tends to be more liquid than stock so i think it 's less likely that this situation would come up   maybe possible for a weak currency or a currency that experiences a sudden crisis of some sort

as in most anti living wage   editorials there is a lot of here   first the workers are not minimum wage in the sense that increasing the minimum wage will not increase their wages   second the article cites that one worker claimed to be making $ 2 and hour less in tips before the law was enacted with wages unchanged that seems like pretty strong evidence that tipping behavior is ultimately independent of the minimum wage   finally the article cites studies that show that workers that rely on tips have higher poverty levels than those that do n't   so while the article appears to be an editorial opposed to increasing minimum wage a more objective look at the evidence presented suggests that the minimum wage should be increased and that is either a bit of an idiot or he recognizes that as a non minimum wage earner he benefits from the inequality of a lower minimum wage

fully paid up partly paid up a company may issue stock to you which is only partly paid up for example a company may issue a stock of face value 10 to you and ask you to pay 5 now and other 5 will be adjusted later by some other mechanism this stock shall be partly paid up usually these stocks are issued in different circumstances for example as part payment for debentures preference shares or other capital structuring on the other hand for a fully paid up share no more money needs to be paid by you or no other adjustments need to be made so above the company is issuing you with stocks for which you will need to pay no further money they are fully paid for authorized capital authorized capital of a company is the amount of money a company can raise by selling stock not debt equity this number is registered when the company is incorporated subsequently this number can be revised upward by applying to the registrar of companies now this means that at max the company is authorized to raise this much capital and no more however a company may raise less than this which is called issued capital in your case the company is raising its authorized capital by applying to the registrar of companies though in this case they are looking at their full authorized capital to be issued capital it was not necessary to do so increase of authorized capital the main benefit is that the company can get more money in form of equity and utilize the same perhaps for expansion of business etc that is the primary benefit bonus share usually companies keep some surplus as reserve this money comes out of the profit the company makes and is essentially money of the shareholders this reserve surplus is maintained for situations when the money may be required for however this surplus grows over a few years and the company usually the company plans for an expansion of business however this money can not be just taken as it belongs to the shareholder so shareholders are issued extra equity in proportion to their current holding and this surplus is capitalized i.e. used as part of the company 's equity capital bonus declaration does not add t o the value of the company and the share prices fall in proportion but not quite to the bonus

first thing ask your real estate agent who should have been involved in writing the contract and can explain your options regarding the contingency that being said the inspection report is the decision point for every issue problem mentioned you have decide ignore have the seller fix have the seller give you money to fix have the seller drop the price or walk away minor things you can have the seller fix they need to be done but they can be done by the seller   expensive things that are difficult to estimate the price in advance should also be done by the seller the estimating the cost to repair will make it risky for you to negotiate a price break   getting a credit of $ 1,000 when it ends up costing you $ 20,000 is something you want to avoid for items that you want to do the fix yourself you want money at closing to do them or ask for a price break items in this category include replacing an appliance you can take the money and get exactly the one you want or let the seller of the house buy one that has the least options and wo n't match the color buyers also take this option when they were going to renovate soon anyway walking away this happens when there is a large expensive issue that is hard to fix or a very large list of mid size problems issues in this category can include foundation cracks major electrical problems extensive leaks mold it can also include beautifully constructed additions that are n't up to code and were done without permits and inspections    which category is your radon in you need to ask your agent and read the inspection report the agent can explain your options and how likely the seller will be to agree they can also tell you how likely you are to not lose the deposit if you do walk away

generally it is considered a bad idea to put significant parts of your money in your own employer 's stock no matter how great the company looks right now the reason is the old do n't put all your eggs in one basket if there is ever a serious issue with your company and you lose your job because they go down the drain you do n't only lose your job but also your savings and potentially 401k if you have their stock there too so you end unemployed and without all your savings of course this is a generic tip and depending on the situation it might be ok to ignore it that 's your decision just remember to have an eye on it so you can get out while they are still floating typically employees are not the first to know when it goes downhill and when you see it in the papers it 's too late typically you get a more secure and independent return on invest by buying into a well managed mixed portfolio

illiquid charges are charges that apply to the trading of low priced over the counter otc securities with low volumes open net buy quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a settlement cycle open net buy quantity must be less than 5,000,000 shares per stock for your entire firm basically you ca n't hold a long position of more than 5 million shares in an illiquid otc stock without facing a fee you 'll still be assessed this fee if you accumulate a long position of this size by breaking your purchase up into multiple transactions open net sell quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a settlement cycle open net sell quantity must be less than 10 percent of the average volume if you attempt to sell a number of shares greater than 10 of the stock 's average volume over the last 20 days you 'll also be assessed a fee the first link i included above is just an example but it makes the important point you may still be assessed a fee for trading otc stocks even if your account does n't meet the criteria because these restrictions are applied at the level of the clearing firm not the individual client   this means that if other investors with your broker or even at another broker that happens to use the same clearing firm purchase more than 5 million shares in an individual otc stock at the same time all of your accounts may face fees even though individually you do n't exceed the limits technically these fees are assessed to the clearing firm not the individual investor but usually the clearing firm will pass the fees along to the broker and possibly add other charges as well and the broker will charge a fee to the individual account(s that triggered the restriction also remember that when buying otc pink sheet stocks your ability to buy or sell is also contingent on finding someone else to buy from sell to if you purchase 10,000 shares one day and attempt to sell them sometime in the future but there are n't enough buyers to buy all 10,000 from you you might not be able to complete your order at the desired price or even at all

peace of mind is the key to your question just before the us housing bust of 2007 i had someone try to convince me to take all the equity from my house which was overvalued in an overheated market the idea was to put that money in the stock market for a bigger return than the interest on the house many people did that and found themselves out of jobs as the economy crashed unfortunately they could n't sell their homes because they owed more than they were worth i never lost a night of sleep over the money i did n't make in the stock market i did manage to trade up to a house twice the size by buying another when the housing market bottomed out but waiting for a market recovery to sell the smaller house the outcome of my good fortune is a very nice house with no mortgage worth about 1/3 of my total net worth that 's probably a larger percentage than most money managers would recommend but it is steadily decreasing because now all the money that would go to a mortgage payment instead gets deposited in retirement accounts and it still has 30 years to grow before i start drawing it down i almost do n't remember the burden of a mortgage hanging over my head each month almost

free huh from their commission and fee schedule   so if you literally bought two shares then the sec added one penny in fees and finra added one penny as a trading activity fee note that there are several other fees on their schedule that may not apply to you if you had bought 100 shares instead your total fees would have still been only 2 cents but you would have lost $ 4 on the trade   so the fees are minuscule when you start doing larger orders    however that should not discourage you from experimenting and learning   i 'd rather pay 2 cents in fees on a 4 cent loss than 2 cents in fees on a $ 400 loss   just chalk it up to the cost of experience

people 's value of money is not always linear   consider an individual with $ 1000 in the bank   i 'm going to look at amounts of debt by orders of magnitude now its pretty easy to see a order of magnitude increase in impact from $ 100 to $ 1000 and it becomes slightly worse for the $ 10,000 case due to debt   however one more order of magnitude going to $ 100,000 and suddenly it becomes hard to argue that there 's a mere order of magnitude more hurt than the $ 10,000 case   from the cases i 've read those sorts of situations can be far far worse than the monetary cost could convey insurance companies are in a good position to absorb $ 100,000 of debt if something happens far better position than the individual   they rely on the central limit theorem in general they do n't have to pay out all at once the insurance companies have their limits too   when hurricane came through the insurance companies had a tremendously difficult time dealing with so many claims all at once   just like the individuals they found a sudden change in how much value they had to put on their monetary debts

firstly you mean resistance not support as a support is below the current price and resistance is above the price secondly using a ma as support or resistance would mean that that support or resistance level would move up or down as the price moved up or down and would not be static at $ 25 generally stocks will range trade more often than they will be trending either up or down so a stock can be range trading between a support and resistance levels for months and even years and usually the longer it range trades for the bigger the outbreak either up or down will be when it does happen using a ma especially shorter dated ones as support or resistance or as a up or down trend line works better when a stock is already trending up or down when a stock is moving sideways it will tend to keep crossing above and below the ma and you will be if you try to use them as your trigger for entry in these situations compare the two charts below   in the first chart the stock is up trending for over 6 months and the ema is being used as a support or up trending line as long as the price does not break through and close under the ema then the uptrend continues you could use this ema line as a means of entering the stock when prices move towards the ema and bounce off it back up again or you could use it as your stop loss level so if price closes below the ema line you would sell your position   in the second chart the stock has been range trading between the support line at about $ and the resistance line at about $ for 10 months in this case the price has been moving above and below the ema during these 10 months and you may have been many times if you were trading each break above or below the ema a better strategy here would be to buy the stock as it approached the support line and bounces up off it and then close and reverse your position go short when the price approached the resistance line and bounces down off it   edit when range trading you would have your stops just below the support line when going long and just above the resistance line when going short that way if it does break through support or resistance and starts trending you will be covered so this shows that different strategies should be used when a stock is trending to when it is range trading mas are better used as entry signal during an established uptrend or downtrend than when a stock is range trading

firstly if a stock costs $ 50 this second the bid ask would have to be   if the bid ask were the stock would cost $ 51 this second   what you 're likely referring to is the last trade not the cost   the last trading price is history and does n't apply to future transactions to make it simple let 's define a simple order book   say there is a bid to buy 100 at $ 49 200 at $ 48 500 at $ 47   if you place a market order to sell 100 shares it should all get filled at $ 49   if you had placed a market order to sell 200 shares instead half should get filled at $ 49 and half at $ 48   this is of course assuming no one else places an order before you get yours submitted   if someone beats you to the 100 share lot then your order could get filled at lower than what you thought you 'd get   if your internet connection is slow or there is a lot of latency in the data from the exchange then things like this could happen   also there are many ecns in addition to the exchanges which may have different order books   there are also trades which for some reason get delayed and show up later in the time and sales window but to answer the question of why someone would want to sell low the only reason i could think is they desire to drive the price down

employers generally prefer to hire someone already working in the same position because they do n't want to invest in training and because they do n't know what else they should be looking for when they hire instead    while this might make sense on the surface it fails to take into account that they are in fact paying for this prior training i.e. experience through higher starting salaries as well as productivity losses through imperfect portability of prior work article when stars migrate do they still perform like    this game of hiring musical chairs punishes both new graduates and job seekers who by default lack the right work experience because they 're working in jobs for which they are considered millennials overqualified for their 7    sure you can blame them for not getting the right internships but this ignores how competitive getting an internship is and how companies are to hire in the first place

tl;dr when everything is going great it 's not really a problem it 's when things change that it 's a problem finally home loans are extended over extremely long periods i.e. 15 or 30 years making any fluctuations in their value short lived even less reason to be obsessed over their current value relative to the loan your post is based on the assumption that you never move in that case you are correct being underwater on a mortgage is not a problem the market value of your house matters little except if you sell it or it gets the primary problem arises if you want to sell there are a variety of reasons you might be required to move in all of these scenarios it is a major problem if you can not sell your options generally are in the first option you will destroy your credit this may or may not be a problem the second is a major inconvenience the third is ideal but often people in this situation have money related problems student loans can deferred if needed mortgages can not a car is more likely to be a lower payment as well as a lower amount underwater generally the problem comes when people buy a mortgage assuming certain things whether that 's appreciation income stability growth etc when these change they run into these problems and that is exactly a moment where being underwater is a problem

high roi and high barriers to entry are rare to find existing together at the same time in the same market more commonly you have high margins roi in early markets but high barriers to entry are more common in mature markets the most common places to find high roi and barriers to entry is when there is something proprietary involved this is why the stem science technology engineering and math fields are so valuable industries related to these fields have an edge because they are the most likely fields to create something proprietary when something proprietary is also in high demand you have a barrier to entry and also a potential to create high margins which in turn will be high roi some people have mentioned medical devices which are an excellent example there are only a handful of companies that have went to the lengths of development to create the swan for example an essential tool used in cardiac surgeries with little competition and high demand companies that manufacture swan can put healthy margins on the product without worry   tl;dr the best way to find something high roi that also has barriers to entry is to specialize towards something proprietary that can not be or replaced but is also in high demand

does such insurance make any sense or is it just wasting money for passengers as with most insurance it depends if you just look at the probability of a payout the cost of the insurance and the payout amount then statistically it will always be better to avoid buying insurance this is because there is a certain amount of overhead in an insurance company like the commissions and salaries you mentioned the goal when buying insurance should be to avoid a cost that you can not afford or is inconvenient to be able to afford for example if your family would be devastated financially by your death then it would make sense for you to buy some sort of life insurance whether or not this particular insurance makes sense for you depends on your financial situation and risk tolerance

what i think was being asked and so this is how i interpreted it is not the transition from public to private but a corporation itself buying all its shares back and as a result having no shareholders   in this case we could envision that all outstanding shares would be become treasury stock   my argument was that this would never happen in a practical setting   obviously if you interpret the question differently for instance to be about all the shares of firm being purchased by someone else as in a private equity buyout you get very different answers about practicality   so i 'm not disagreeing with you at all i just read the question differently

another way of explaining the balance right after a particular bill is paid you have $ 0 saved to pay that bill the next time   just before the bill is next due you wisely have the whole amount saved   that 's the purpose of the whole process   so for that bill on average over time you 'll have one half that upcoming bill in the account but the same argument holds for every one of the upcoming bills   so for a large number of bills with varying sizes and times between occurrence the average amount in the account will be approximately one half of the total amount of all the bills that you 're saving for

to keep it simple let 's say that a shares trade at 500 on average between april 2nd 2014 and april 1st 2015 one year anniversary then if c shares trade on average the payment will be made either in cash or in shares within 90 days the difficulties come from the fact that the formula is based on an average price over a year which is not directly tradable and that the spread is only covered between 1 and 5 in practice it is unlikely that the market will attribute a large premium to voting shares considering that keep the majority and any discount of cs vs as above 2 3 to include cost of trading + borrowing will probably trigger some arbitrage which will prevent it to extend too much but there is no guarantee fyi here is what the spread has looked like since april 3rd   details in the section called class c settlement agreement in the filing

the answer to the question can i exercise the option right away depends on the exercise style of the particular option contract you are talking about if it 's an american style exercise you can exercise at any moment until the expiration date if it 's an european style exercise you can only exercise at the expiration date according to the cme group website on the on gold futures it 's an american style exercise always make sure to double check this especially in the options on futures world there are quite a few that are european style so if you wanted to the answer is yes you can exercise those contracts before expiration but a very important question you should ask is should you option prices are composed of 2 parts intrinsic value and extrinsic value intrinsic value is defined as by how much the option is in the money that is for calls it 's how much the strike is below the current underlying price and for puts it 's how much the strike is above the current underlying price extrinsic value is whatever amount you have to add to the intrinsic value to get the actual price the option is trading at the market note that there 's no negative intrinsic value it 's either a positive number or 0 when the intrinsic value is 0 all the value of the option is extrinsic value the reason why options have extrinsic value is because they give the buyer a right and the seller an obligation ie the seller is assuming risk traders are only willing to assume obligations risks and give others a right if they get paid for that the amount they get paid for that is the extrinsic value in the scenario you described underlying price is call strike is whatever amount you have paid for that option is extrinsic value because the strike of the call is above the underlying price so intrinsic = 0 intrinsic + extrinsic = value of the option by definition now in your scenario gold prices went up to now your call option is in the money that is the strike of your call option is below the gold price that necessarily means that your call option has intrinsic value you can easily calculate how much it has exactly $ 5 intrinsic value price strike but that contract still has some risk associated to it for the seller so it necessarily still have some extrinsic value as well so the option that you bought for let 's say $ 2.30 could now be worth something like $ $ 5 + a hypothetical $ 1.90 in extrinsic value in your question you mentioned exercising the option and then making a profit there well if you do that you exercise your options get some gold futures immediately paying $ for them your strike and then you can sell them in the market for $ so you make $ 5 there multiplied by the contract multiplier but your profit is not $ 5 here 's why remember that you had to buy that option you paid some money for that in this hypothetical example you payed $ 2.30 to buy the option so you actually made only $ 5 $ 2.30 = $ profit on the other hand you could just have sold the option you 'd then make money by selling something that you bought for $ 2.30 that 's now worth $ this will give you a higher profit in this case if those numbers were real you 'd make $ $ 2.30 = $ profit more than $ profit here 's the interesting part did you notice exactly how much more profit you 'd have by selling the option back to the market instead of exercising it and selling the gold contracts exactly $ 1.90 do you remember this number that 's the extrinsic value and it 's not a coincidence by exercising an option you immediately give up all the extrinsic value it has you are going to convert all the extrinsic value into $ 0 so that 's why it 's not optimal to exercise the contract also many brokers usually charge you much more commissions and fees to exercise an option than to buy sell options so there 's that as well always remember when you exercise an option contract you immediately give up all the extrinsic value it has so it 's never optimal to do an early exercise of option contracts and individual retail investors institutional investors doing hft might be able to spot price discrepancies and make money doing arbitrage but retail investors do n't have the low commissions and the technology required to make money out of that might also be interesting to think about the other side of this have you noticed how in the example above the option started with $ 2.30 of extrinsic value and then it had less $ 1.90 only that 's really how options work as the market changes extrinsic value changes and as time goes by extrinsic value usually decreases other factors might increase it like more fear in the market usually bring the option prices up but the passage of time alone will decrease it so options that you buy will naturally decrease some value over time the closer you are to expiration the faster it 's going to lose value which kind of makes intuitive sense for instance compare an option with 90 days to expiration to another with 10 one day later the first option still has 89 almost the same as 90 but the other has 9 it relatively much closer to the expiration than the day before so it will decay faster option buyers can protect their investment from time decay by buying longer dated options which decay slower edit just thought about adding one final thought here probabilities the strategy that you describe in your question is basically going long an otm call this is an extremely bullish position with low probability of making money basically for you to make money you need two things you need to be right on direction and you need to be right on time in this example you need the underlying to go up by a considerable amount and you need this to happen quickly before the passage of time will remove too much of the extrinsic value of your call and obviously before the call expires benefit of the strategy is in the highly unlikely event of an extreme unanticipated move of the underlying to the upside you can make a lot of money so it 's a low probability limited risk unlimited profit extremely bullish strategy

i 'll echo many factors brand there are generally two levels of pricing major brand and discount brand you can generally expect the discount brand to cost about 5 10 cents less per gallon in the same neighborhood as major brand gas this is for a number of sub factors chief among them is that not all are created equal a lot of the major brands shell chevron bp exxon have proprietary and cleaning agents that the discount brands do not they 're also generally closer to the real rating of the gas have less ethanol you 'll see the sign that says contains up to 10 ethanol the bargain brands are right up at that limit while the top tier brands keep it lower and have stricter requirements about storage tank maintenance anyone who tells you that all gas is the same send em my way i tried to save a few buying the cheaper stuff and now my car needs an engine overhaul because of causing premature wear a couple of my co workers got a fuel system overhaul free from the local supermarket because the storage tank was n't properly and they got water into their gas tanks market price yes this is of course a factor generally gas prices at the pump rise very quickly when the market price of crude or gasoline goes up then fall more slowly than the market price because the margins on gas sales for a c store are very slim when prices change the c stores lose either way when prices rise they have to pay more than they got from the last to buy the next one and when prices fall they do n't recoup the cost of their current tank by quickly increasing the price to match commodities market prices then gradually lowering them over time even if the market collapses they mitigate the losses both ways overhead a gas station right next to a highway probably had to pay more for that land both to buy lease it and in property taxes nicer newer cleaner stations generally have to pay more to stay that way the higher your operating costs the more you 'll have to charge for your gas you can usually do so because the nicer station will attract customers willing to pay a few cents more for the nicer facilities taxation most states charge a tax on gasoline in addition to a federal tax on gas that revenue either goes into the state 's general fund or is earmarked for transportation costs like road maintenance california 's gas prices are sky high across the state because they have the highest gas tax i 'm not sure colorado wyoming and have gas taxes at all proximity to other stations no matter what you have to pay for the land and facilities if there 's another station across the street you have to be within a penny of their price or people will vote with their feet while predatory pricing taking a loss on sales in one area by profits elsewhere in order to drive out competition is technically illegal you see it all the time in the c store industry and it is very difficult to prove this is a primary cause of neighborhood to neighborhood changes a c store will look around the other stations on their street corner and the ones down the road a block or two each direction when determining what they can sell gas for that day the guy five blocks down has a completely different pool of competing stations population distribution with a lot of people in a particular area there 's a big pie of customer dollars for c stores to compete for this generally leads to increased prices because the stations do n't have to be as cutthroat regardless of how good your price is you have only so many pumps and at some point people will pay more to use the open pump than wait for the cheaper one the reverse is true in rural areas with only two stations in an entire small town those two stations will become extremely cutthroat however rural prices also vary more with only one station in easy walking distance from where you ran out of gas they can charge you $ 6 to fill that gallon gas can if they want and you 'll pay it because the next gas station 's another 20 miles down the road and probably has even higher prices this along with overhead is generally why the states have the lowest average prices land 's cheap and people are scarce in wyoming but the price gouging can be seen in the rural southwest where there 's a lot of ground to cover between gas stations and so the last chance gas along major highways just outside of town each a nickel to a dime more than the previous station is a common stereotype transportation costs prices are higher on the east and west than in the gulf states for a very simple reason the bulk of the u.s. refinery capacity is along the gulf coast between and the florida border the further you are from there the more it costs to get the fuel from the refinery to the gas station and that cost is reflected at the pump in fact the east coast imports gasoline by tanker even though the united states is now a net exporter of gasoline because it 's cheaper to buy it from foreign sources than it would be to watch it drip through the limited pipeline capacity that exists between the gulf states and the eastern

everyone complaining about fraud and jail time have no idea what they are talking about fraud in a financial sense is very difficult to prove it is also very expensive to litigate furthermore there is little evidence there was any actual fraud rather a number of things just went wrong at the time you had the chairman of the federal reserve ben bernanke and the treasury secretary henry paulson both going on tv saying subprime was n't an issue and even if it was it would n't affect the wider mortgage market the regulators knew what was going on and did nothing at the time because none of the economic models anyone used showed we would go into recession

i think you 're not considering the opportunity cost of giving up your money early   i 'm not sure what the total money you have to spend but spending extra on things you 're going to buy later might not be the best choice    consider you could just get a credit card that does 3 6 with fee on groceries 3 on gas etc   so you can make some money there without spending it all up front also you could be turning that money into more money by investing it   assuming you 're not going to just carry a balance and pay interest on the card you have this cash on hand to invest one more thing i 'm not sure of your financial situation but i do n't think something like spending an extra 5k is a pittance to you since you wanted $ 500 so badly   having the cash at hand has its own advantages even if you 're just sitting on it in short consider if you want to follow through with this plan   you can still keep the card

ira is an account you can open as many as you want what 's limited is the contributions you can not deposit to the ira all of them combined more than what you 've earned during the year or $ 5500 for 2013 the lowest there are also limits on how much you can deduct depending on your income and availability of other retirement programs at your work you can open as many iras as you want in your child 's name but if your child had only earned $ 500 this year that 's how much you can put in these accounts your wife and you share the earned income limit so if your wife is not working you can still contribute to the ira in her name based on your own earnings i.e. if you earned more than $ you can contribute the maximum $ 5500 for each of you the limits are for all the ira combined does n't matter how many accounts you have and how many of them are roth

it 's a trade off the answer depends on your risk tolerance seeking higher rewards demands higher risk if you want advice i would recommend hiring an expert to design a plan which meets your needs as a sample point not necessarily right for anyone else i'm considered an aggressive investor and my own spread is still more conservative than many folks i 'm entirely in low cost index funds distributed as with the money tied up in a defined contribution pension fund being treated as a low yield bond some of these have beaten the indexes they 're tracking some have n't my average yield since i started investing has been a bit over not including the company match on part of the 401k which i consider good enough certainly good enough for something that requires near zero attention from me past results are not a guarantee of future performance this may be completely wrong for someone at a different point in their career and/or life and/or finances i 'm posting it only as an example not a recommendation   regarding when to rebalance set some at which things have too far from your preferred distribution value of a fund being 5 off its target percentage in the mix is one rule i 've sometimes used and/or pick some reasonable usually fairly low frequency at which you 'll actively rebalance once a year 4x year whenever you change your car 's oil something like that and/or rebalance by selecting which funds you deposit additional money into whenever you 're adding to the investments note that that last option avoids having to take capital gains which is generally a good thing you want as much of your profit to be long term as possible and to avoid triggering the wash sales rule generally you do not have to rebalance very frequently unless you are doing something that i 'd consider unreasonably risky or unless you 're managing such huge sums that a tiny fraction of a percent still adds up to real money

gt no it 's really not i have no illusions that private school is any better than the public schools around here the problems with them differ but one is no better than the other our education system in florida is broken the voucher system they instituted created broken schools and soon to be bankrupt private schools every state that 's done so has or soon will have the same problems even states that are n't screwing their public schools with vouchers are screwing them with poor funding at every level   how do vouchers fuck over our education system does n't it allow parents to pick the best school for their kids despite their economic condition i may be mistaken on what vouchers are is n't it just the government paying for what ever school you decide to go to   gt;every state that 's done so has or soon will have the same problems   source please   broke and getting more broke every year eventually it might get fixed but i 'm not going to play maybe games with my kids i 'd rather move them to a country that is n't supporting the most expensive military on the planet   as long as you send your kids to a school where they do n't fear for their lives have teachers that at least do the bare minimum and you are involved in your kid 's school life then they will be fine it is n't a school that makes the kids successful it is the parents who are active in their kids lives if the school is also good then that is all the better    canada is n't a magical i get the feeling that you surround yourself in an echo chamber of other parents who are mad at the education system you guys build off each other to make america 's education system seem like hell on earth

i used to own a few investment properties so i 'm pretty familiar with this   as mrchrister mentions lenders see investment mortgages as higher risk people who fall into financial trouble are much more likely to let their investment properties go than their personal residence   consequently the interest rates and downpayment requirements are generally higher typically a mortgage for an investment property will require 20 down vs. as low as 3 5 down for a personal residence   with excellent credit and some shopping around you could probably do 10 down   interest rates are typically about a half percent higher as well you 'll also find that the more investment properties you have the harder it becomes to finance new ones   banks look at debt to income ratios to determine if you are over extended   typically banks like to see that your housing payments are less than 20 or so of your income   however with rental properties housing payments generally account for far more than 20 of your rental income   other income you have can offset that but after buying 2 3 houses or so your dti generally into the range where lenders are uncomfortable lending to you anymore   this is why you 'll find that many rental properties are bought on land contracts with owner financing rather than with mortgages

the federal funds rate is one of the risk free short term rates in the economy we often think of fixed income securities as paying this rate plus some premia associated with risk for a treasury security we can think this way interest rate = fed funds rate + term premium the term premium is a bit extra the bond pays because if you hold a long term bond you are exposed to interest rate risk which is the risk that rates will generally rise after you buy making your bond worth less   the relation is more complex if people have expectations of future rate moves but this is the general idea   anyway generally speaking longer term bonds are exposed to more interest rate risk so they pay more on average for a corporate bond we think this way interest rate = fed funds rate + term premium + default premium where the default premium is some extra that the bond must pay to compensate the holder for default risk which is the risk that the bond defaults or loses value as the company 's prospects fall   you can see that corporate and government bonds are affected the same way approximately this is all hand waving by changes in the fed funds rate now that all refers to the rates on new bonds   after a bond is issued its value falls if rates rise because new bonds are relatively more attractive   its value rises if rates on new bonds falls   so if there is an unexpected rise in the fed funds rate and you are holding a bond you will be sad especially if it is a long term bond does n't matter if it 's corporate or government   ask yourself though whether an increase in fed funds will be unexpected at this point   if the increase was expected it will already be priced in   are you more of an expert than the folks on wall street at predicting interest rate changes   if not it might not make sense to make decisions based on your belief about where rates are going   just saying brick points out that treasuries are tax advantaged   that is you do n't have to pay state income tax on them but you do pay federal if you live in a state where this is true this may matter to you a little bit they also pay little because they are convenient for use as a cash substitute in transactions and convenience yield   in general treasuries just do n't pay much   young folk like you tend to buy corporate bonds instead so they can make money on the default and term premia

yes when exercising a stock option you will be buying the stock at the strike price so you will be putting up your money if you lose that money you can declare it as a loss like any other transaction so if the stock is worth $ 1 and you have 10 options with a strike at $ 0.50 you will spend $ 500 when you exercise your options if you hold those shares and the company is then worth $ 0 you lost $ 500 i have not verified my answer so this is solely from my understanding of accounting and finance please verify with your accountant to be sure

basically the money you pay in student loan interest is tax deductible which means as far as the irs is concerned you did n't make that money however what that saves you on your taxes is a percentage of a percentage you save the amount of your current marginal rate on the money you paid as interest simple example with made up numbers let 's say you had a student loan outstanding and you were making payments of $ 150 monthly on it total payments to said loan in one tax year would be $ 1800 of that amount let 's for the sake of argument say that half $ 900 was interest you get your with that number on it and reduce your taxable income by that amount you 're currently doing well not outstanding but ok so you 're in the 25 tax bracket that most single middle are in so your reduction in taxable income of $ 900 saves you the 25 that those 900 would have been taxed at which is $ 225 so all told this loan is a net drain on your disposable income of $ of which $ 675 is pure cost of capital you never received a dollar in disbursements to match this amount you 're paying so it 's money lost now in return for previous gains 10 years later you pay off the debt now that $ 1800 is yours to keep and to pay full   taxes on you pay $ 225 more in taxes actually because of amortization the amount of additional taxes has been steadily increasing as the interest portion of the loan payments has reduced but have the remaining $ in your pocket to do something else while there is good debt and bad debt debt is debt whether deductible or not the irs will never credit your tax bill in the amount of interest owed afaik if someone knows of a loan whose interest is a credit instead of a deduction i 'm all ears so the deduction on this loan reduces your cost of capital to an effective apr of 4.5 and because it 's a student loan and not a mortgage you do n't have to itemize so this is in effect a free deduction even with an fha mortgage allowing me to deduct interest property taxes and pmi and the residual medical costs after insurance of having our new baby the $ standard deduction for my wife and i was still the better deal this year but you 're still losing 4.5 per year to interest that 's your break even if the money you could use to pay your debt could earn a better return than 4.5 then invest it but if not pay off the loan right now investments that could make you 4.5 are at the bottom edge of a steep increase in risk and variance so if your expected roi is close i 'd lean toward paying off the debt

if you buy a call that 's because you expect that the stock will go up if it does not go up then forget about buying more calls as your initial idea seems to be wrong and i do n't think that buying a put to make up for the loss will work either the only thing that is sure is that you will pay another premium on a stock that could stay where it is even if you are 100 sure that the stock will go up again do n't do anything as john maynard keynes stated markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent my idea is wait until the expiration date the good things about options is that you wo n't lose more than the premium that you paid for it and that until it reaches its maturity you can still make money if the market turns around more generally when you are purely speculating adding to a position when it goes against you is called averaging down i sincerely discourage you to do that if the stocks goes in the wrong direction that means that your    initial idea was wrong in the first place or you were not right at    the right moment in my opinion adding up to a wrong idea is not the    right thing to do when you are losing just take your loss and do n't    add up to your position based on your emotions on the other hand adding to your position more when the stock goes in    your direction is called and is in my opinion a better    way of doing things you bought you were right let 's buy more but    at some point you will have to take your profits there are plenty of other stocks on which you can try to invest and the market will still be here tomorrow there will be other opportunities to make profits rushing things by constantly trying to have a position is not a good idea not doing anything is also a strategy

pmi is mortgage insurance it stands for private mortgage insurance this guy is just trying to get you to buy it from him instead of whoever you have it with now   your lender would always be on the policy since it is an insurance policy they hold and you pay for that protects them from you defaulting on the loan do n't think of it as insurance for you in case you ca n't pay if that should happen your credit would still be trashed the bank just would n't be out the money you do n't really get any benefit at all from it it is just the way a bank can mitigate the risk of giving out large loans this is why people are keen to drop it as soon as possible   the whole thing about keeping the house in your estate after you die makes me think he is trying to sell you a different type of insurance called mortgage life insurance pmi is n't typically about that type of situation your estate will go into probate to work out your debts if you die and my understanding is that pmi does n't usually pay out in that situation   if this is what he is selling buying such a policy would be on top of your pmi insurance payment not instead of it be personal finance experts usually consider mortgage life insurance to be a ripoff if you want to protect against the risk of your heirs losing the house because they ca n't make the payments you are better off with term life insurance   however do n't worry that they will inherit your debt on the house unless they are on the loan if they do n't want the house they wo n't be obliged to make payments on it unless they want to keep it it wo n't affect their credit if they just walk away and let the bank have the house after you die unless they are on the note here is an article in two parts with a pretty good treatment of the issue of choosing your own pmi policy give buyers freedom to choose mortgage insurance part 1 part 2

options are contractual instruments most options you 'll run into are contracts which allow you to buy or sell stock at a given price at some time in the future if you feel like it it gives you the option these are call and put options respectively for buying the stock and selling the stock if you have a lot of money in an index fund etf you may be able to protect your portfolio against a market decline by e.g. buying put options against the etf for a substantially lower price than the index fund currently trades at if the market crashes and your fund falls in value significantly you can exercise the options selling the fund at the price that your option has specified to the counter party of your contract this is the risk that the option mitigates against even if you do n't have one particular fund with your investments you could still buy a put option on a similar fund and resell it to another person in lieu of exercise they would be capable of buying the stock and performing the exercise themselves for profit if necessary in general if you are buying an option for safety it should be an option either on something you own or something whose price behavior will mimic something you own you will note that options are linked to the price of stocks futures are contracts whose values are linked to the price of other things typically commodities such as oil gold or orange juice their behaviors may diverge with an option you can have a contractual guarantee on the exact investment you 're trying to protect additionally many commodities value may fall at the same time that stock investments fall during economic contractions which reduce industrial activity resulting in lower profits for firms and less demand for commodities you may also note that there are other structures that options may have put options on index funds or similar instruments are probably most specifically relevant to your interests the downside of protecting yourself with options is that it costs money to buy this option and the option eventually expires so you may lose money essentially you are buying safety and risk tolerance from the option contract 's counterparty and safety is not free i can not inform you what level of safety is appropriate for your portfolio 's needs but more safety is more expensive

first i 'd recommend that you separate short term assets from long term assets in your head   short term assets are earmarked for spending on something specific in the near future or are part of your emergency fund   these should be kept in cash or short bond funds    long term assets are assets that you can take some risks with and are n't going to spend in the next few years   under normal circumstances i 'd recommend 80 bonds or even 70/30 for someone your age assuming you 're saving mainly for retirement and thus have a correspondingly long time horizon   these portfolios historically are much less risky than 100 stock and only return slightly less    right now though i think that anyone who does n't absolutely need safety keep 100 of their long term assets in stocks   i 'm 26 and this is my asset allocation   bond yields are absolutely pathetic by historical standards   even ten year treasury yields are comparable to s&p 500 dividend yields and likely wo n't outperform inflation if held to maturity   the stock market is modestly undervalued when measured by difference between current p e ratio and the historical average and more severely undervalued when you account for the effects of reduced inflation transaction costs and capital gains taxes on fair valuation   therefore the potential reward for taking risk is much higher now than it usually is

you have several options depending on your tolerance for risk certainly open an investment account with your bank or through any of the popular discount brokerage services then take however much money you 're willing to invest and start earning some returns you can split up the money into various investments too a typical default strategy is to take any money you wo n't need for the long term and put it in an index fund like the s&p 500 or a european equivalent yes it could go down especially in the short term but you can sell shares at any time so you 're only 2 3 days away at any time from liquidity historically this money will generate a positive return in the long run for smaller time frames a short term bond fund often gives a slightly better return than a money market account and some people like me use short term bond funds as if it were a money market account there is a very low but real risk of having the fund lose value so you could take a certain percentage of your money and keep it close in a bond fund likewise you can sell shares at any time win or lose and have the cash available within a couple days

you should get a 1099-misc for the $ 5000 you got   and your broker should send you a 1099-b for the $ 5500 sale of google stock these are two totally separate things as far as the us irs is concerned 1 you made $ 5000 in wages you will pay income tax on this as well as fica and other state and local taxes 2 you will report that you paid $ 5000 for stock and sold it for $ 5500 without holding it for one year since this was short term you will pay tax on the $ 500 in income you made these numbers will go on different parts of your tax form   essentially in your case you 'll have to pay regular income tax rates on the whole $ 5500 but that 's only because short term capital gains are treated as income   there 's always the possibility that could change unlikely   it also helps to think of them separately because if you held the stock for a year you would pay different tax on that $ 500   regardless you report them in different ways on your taxes

you 'd have to consult a lawyer in the state that the transaction took place to get a definitive answer   and also provide the details of the contract or settlement agreement that said if you clearly presented the check as payment verbally or otherwise and they accepted and cashed the check and it cleared you should have good legal standing to force them to finalize the payment    while they had every right to refuse the payment and also every right to place a hold on the credit until the transaction cleared their bank they do n't have the right to simply claim the payment as a gift just because it came in a different form than they specified in the contract   obviously this is a lesson learned on reading the fine print though   and to be frank it sounds like someone wants to make life difficult for you for whatever reason and if that is the case i would refer back to my initial comment about contacting a lawyer in that state

think about it this way if the strike price is $ 200 and cost of the option is $ 0.05 $ 200 + $ 0.05 is $ that does not mean that the price of buying the option is more neither is the option writer going to pay you $ 70 to buy the contract   when you are buying options you can only have a limited downside and that is the premium that you pay for it   in case of the $ 115 contract your total loss could be a maximum of $   in case of the $ 130 contract your total loss could be a maximum of $ this is due to the fact that the chances of aapl going to hit $ 130 is less than the chance of aapl hitting $ 115 therefore option writers offer the lower probability contracts at a lower price   long story short you do not pay for the strike price you only pay the premium and that premium keeps getting lower with and increase in strike decrease if it is a put option strike price is just a number that you expect the stock or index to break i would suggest you to read up a little more on pricing from here

investopedia has a section in their article about currency trading that states the fx market does not have commissions unlike exchange based markets fx is a principals only market fx firms are dealers not brokers this is a critical distinction that all investors must understand unlike brokers dealers assume market risk by serving as a counterparty to the investor 's trade they do not charge commission instead they make their money through the bid ask spread principals only means that the only parties to a transaction are agents who actively bear risk by taking one side of the transaction   there are forex brokers who charge what 's called a commission based on the spread investopedia has another article about the commission structure in the forex market that states there are three forms of commission used by brokers in forex some firms offer a fixed spread others offer a variable spread and still others charge a commission based on a percentage of the spread   so yes there are forex brokers who charge a commission but this paragraph is saying mostly the same thing as the first paragraph the brokers make their money through the bid ask spread how they do so varies and sometimes they call this charge a commission sometimes they do n't all of the information above differs from the stock markets however in which   the broker takes the order to an exchange and attempts to execute it as per the customer 's instructions for providing this service the broker is paid a commission when the customer buys and sells the tradable instrument the broker is n't taking a side in the trade so he 's not making money on the spread he 's performing the service of taking the order to an exchange an attempting to execute it and for that he charges a commission

take a look at irs publication 15 this is your employer 's bible for withholding the correct amount of taxes from your paycheck most payroll systems use what this publication defines as the percentage method because it requires less data to be entered into the system in order to correctly compute the amount of withholding the computation method is as follows taxes are computed dollar amounts up to a are taxed at x% and then dollar amounts between a and b are taxed at y% so total tax for b dollars is + b here is the table of rates for income earned in 2012 on a daily basis by a person filing as single to use this table multiply all the dollar amounts by the number of business days in the pay period so do n't count more than 5 days per week even if you work 6 or 7 find the range in which your pay subject to withholding falls subtract the more than amount from the range multiply the remainder by the w h for that line and add that amount to the w h base amount which is the cumulative amount of all lower tax brackets this is the amount that will be withheld from your paycheck if you file single or married filing separately in the 2012 ty if you file married filing jointly the amounts defining the tax brackets are slightly different there 's a pretty substantial marriage advantage right now withholding for a married person in average wage earning range is half or less than a person filing single in your particular example of $ 2500 biweekly 10 business days pp with no allowances and no pre tax deductions so with zero allowances your employer should be taking $ out of your paycheck for federal withholding now that does n't include pa state taxes of on $ 2500 that 's $ plus other state and federal taxes like ss 4.2 on your gross income up to medicare medicaid 1.45 on your entire gross income and .8 on the first $ 8000 but you also do n't get a refund on those when you fill out the 1040 except if you claim deductions against state income tax and in an exceptional case which requires you to have two jobs in one year thus doubling up on ss and taxes beyond their wage bases if you claim 3 allowances on your federal taxes all other things being equal your taxable wages are reduced by $ leaving you with taxable income of $ still in the 25 bracket but the wages subject to that level are only $ for taxes in the 25 bracket of $ plus the withholding base of $ equals total federal w h of $ per paycheck a savings of about $ those allowances do not count towards other federal taxes and i do not know if pa state taxes figure these in it seems odd that you would owe that much in taxes with your withholding effectively maxed out unless you have some other form of income that you 're reporting such as investment gains child support alimony etc with nobody claiming you as a dependent and no dependents of your own filing single and zero allowances on your w-4 resulting in the tax withholding above a quick run of the 1040ez form shows that the feds should owe you $ the absolute worst case scenario of you being claimed as a dependent by someone else should still get you a refund of $ 800 if you had your employer withhold the max the numbers should only have gotten better if you 're married or have kids or other dependents or have significant itemized deductions such as a home mortgage on which the interest and any property taxes are deductible if you itemize remember that state income tax if any is also deductible i would consult a tax professional and have him double check all your numbers unless there 's something significant you have n't told us you should not have owed the gov't at the end of the year

first off leaving money in a 529 account is not that bad since you may always change the beneficiary to most any blood relative   so if you have leftovers you do n't have to pay the 10 penalty if you have a for instance that can use it   but if you would rather have the money out then you need a strategy to get it out that is tax efficient my prescription for managing a situation like this is not to pay directly out of the 529 account but instead calculate your cost of education up front and withdraw that money at the beginning of the school year   you can keep it in a separate account but that 's not necessary   the amount you withdraw should be equal to what the education costs which may be estimated by taking the budget that the school publishes minus grants and scholarships   you should have all of those numbers before the first day of school   this is amount $ x. during the year write all the checks out of your regular account   at the end of the school year you should expect to have no money left in the account   i presume that the budget is exactly what you will spend   if not you might need to make a few adjustments but this answer will presume you spend exactly $ x during the fall and the spring of the next year in order to get more out of the 529 without paying penalties you are allowed to remove money without penalty but having the gains taxed $ y + $ z   you have the choice of having the 529 funds directed to the educational institution the student or yourself   if you direct the funds to the student the gains portion would be taxed at the student 's rate   everyone 's tax situation is different and of course there is a between the parent 's taxes and student 's taxes but it may be efficient to have the 529 funds directed to the student   for instance if the student does n't have much income they might not even be required to file income tax   if that 's the case they may be able to remove an amount $ y from the 529 account and still not need to file   for instance let 's say the student has no unearned income and the gains in the 529 account were 50   the student could get a check for $ 2,000 $ 1,000 would be gains but that low amount may mean the student was not required to file or if it 's more important to get more money out of the account the student could remove the total amount of the grants plus scholarships $ y + $ z   no penalty would be due just the taxes on the gains   and at the student 's tax rate generally but check your own situation finally if you really want the money out of the account you could remove a check $ y + $ z + $ p   you 'd pay tax on the gains of the sum but penalty of 10 only on the $ p portion this answer does not include the math that goes along with securing some tax credits so if those credits still are around as you 're working through this consider this article which requires site sign up   in part this article says how much to withdraw     for most parents it will be 100 of the beneficiary ’s qualified higher education expenses paid this year tuition fees books supplies equipment and room and board less $ 4,000 the $ 4,000 is redirected to the american opportunity tax credit when to withdraw it     take withdrawals in the same calendar year that the qualified expenses were paid designating the     since it is usually best that the form be issued to the beneficiary and show the beneficiary ’s social security number i prefer to use either option 2 or 3 2 a check made out to the account beneficiary or 3 a check made out to the educational institution what about scholarships     the 10 percent penalty on a non qualified distribution from a 529 plan is waived when the excess distribution can be attributed to tax free scholarships while there is no direct guidance from the irs many tax experts believe the distribution and the scholarship do not have to match up in the same calendar year when applying the penalty waiver if you 're curious about timing taking non penalty grants and scholarship money out there is this link which says you probably are allowed to accumulate grants and scholarship totals for tax purposes over multiple years

in many espp programs i.e. every one i 've had the opportunity to be a part of in my career your purchase is at a discount from the lower of the stock prices at the start and end of the period so a before tax 5 return is the minimum you should expect if the price of the stock appreciates between july 1 and december 31 you benefit from that gain as well more concretely stock closes at $ 10/share on july 1 and $ on december 31 the plan buys for you at $ if you sell immediately you clear $ in profit or a nearly 16 pre tax gain if the price declines instead of increases though you still see that 5 guaranteed profit combine that with the fact that you 're contributing every paycheck not all at once at the start and your implied annual rate of return starts to look pretty good so if it was me i 'd pay the minimum on the student loan and put the excess into the espp

current evidence is that after you subtract their commission and the additional trading costs actively managed funds average no better than index funds maybe not as well you can afford to take more risks at your age assuming that it will be a long time before you need these funds but i would suggest that means putting a high percentage of your investments in small cap and large cap stock indexes i 'd suggest 10 in bonds maybe more just because maintaining that balance automatically encourages buy low sell high as the market cycles as you get older and closer to needing a large chunk of the money for a house or after retirement you would move progressively more of that to other categories such as bonds to help safeguard your earnings   some folks will say this an overly conservative approach on the other hand it requires almost zero effort and has netted me an average 10 return or so claims quicken over the past two decades and that average includes the dot bomb and the great recession past results are not a guarantee of future performance of course but the point is that it can work quite well enough

i think you are making this more complicated that it has to be   in the end you will end up with a car that you paid x and is worth y. your numbers are a bit hard to follow   hopefully i got this right i am no accountant this is how i would figure the deal the payments made are irrelevant   the downpayment is irrelevant as it is still a reduction in net worth    your current car has a asset value of <   that should make anyone pause a bit    in order to get into this new car you will have to finance the shortfall on the current car the price of the vehicle the immediate depreciation say 7,000   in the end you will have a car worth 38 k and owe   so you will have a asset value of <   obviously a much worse situation   to do this car deal it would cost the person of net worth the day the deal was done   as time on it would be more as the reduction in debt is unlikely to keep up with the depreciation additionally the new car purchase screen shows a payment of $ if you bought the car with zero down   except you do n't have zero down you have down   making the car payment higher i with months   so rather than having a hit to your cash flow of $ for 69 more months you would have a payment of about $ 1000 for 84 months if you could obtain the interest rate of 3.5 those are the two things i would focus on is the reduction in net worth and the cash flow liability    i understand you are trying to get a feel for things but there are two things that make this very unrealistic   the first is financing   it is unlikely that financing could be obtained with this deal and if it could this would be considered a sub prime loan   however perhaps a relative could finance the deal secondly there is no way even a moderately financially responsible spouse would approve this deal   that is provided there were not assets like a few million if that is the case why not just write a check

what the other 's said is right you build credit by paying over time keeping your balance under the halfway mark of your limit and paying it down over the course of a fair amount of periods yields the best results so if you have a limit of $ 1500 then charge a $ 600 credit and pay $ 100 + interest over 6 months best yet are loans with fix installments this behavior tells the credit agencies you are responsible and you pay your debts in their eyes you are a low risk high roi statistically speaking

assuming the stock was worth more at the time she gave it to you than when she bought it the cost basis would be the amount that she bought it for you would then pay tax on the increase in value from that time   generally it 's better to inherit assets than receive them as gifts since the cost basis of inherited assets is raised to the value at the time of the death of the one leaving the inheritance you will probably need to find some record of the original amount paid so you can determine the right cost basis

cd laddering is a process of buying multiple cds at longer terms to take advantage of better interest rates while still having liquidity the benefit of a cd ladder is based on this assumption   without higher rates for longer terms i would n't ladder cds   so let 's assume you have $ 10,000 to invest    and let 's say you have a 12 month cd at 1 and a 24 month cd at 2 available to purchase you could lock all of your money up for 2 years and buy the 24 month cd at 2    this is a good rate of return but locks up your money for longer than you might otherwise have planned the laddering approach is to buy longer term cds over a regular interval    in this case we could buy a 2 year cd at 2 every 6 months    your ladder would look like this this gives you the 2 year rate 2 but you are always less than 6 months until your next cd matures giving you some liquidity when each cd matures you then purchase another 2 year cd at the more beneficial rate   you 'll always have something maturing every 6 months now if you want to start with your money immediately you can seed your ladder by buying partial terms like this the two year time maturity time frame and the interest rates are all examples   you could have 12 cds with one maturing every month one maturing every quarter etc the benefits of cd laddering are that a portion of your money is never far from maturity and that your interest rate is better than it otherwise would be the risks of cd laddering are the same as the risks of buying cds   if you think cds are a good investment cd laddering is a good way to invest at higher rates

yes depending on the timing   you generally can make a tax free withdrawal of contributions if you do it before the due date for filing your tax return for the year in which you made them this means that even if you are under age 59½ the 10 additional tax may not apply these distributions are explained in pub   i believe any growth is subject to the 10 penalty the 10 additional tax on distributions made before you     reach age 59½ does not apply to these tax free withdrawals of your contributions however the distribution of interest or other income must be reported on form 5329 and unless the distribution qualifies as an exception to the age 59½ rule it will be subject to this tax

while there certainly are many specific predictions that have proven completely wrong the fundamental complaint is that the structure of our economy is unsustainable with the prediction that this will eventually be revealed in a terrible way   simply pointing out that the day of reckoning has been off for the immediate future does nothing to address or the actual complaint   for example we 've been some 40 years now without a catastrophe attributable to global warming should that be taken as indicative that the fundamental logic that predicts an eventual catastrophe is a load of bunk   should the reasonable advance prediction requirement be harder for economics than for a hard science

i get the sense that this is a the world is unfair there 's no way i can succeed question so let 's back up a few steps income is the starting point to all of this   that could be a job or jobs or running your own business from there you can do four things with your income obviously spend and give do not provide a monetary return they give a return in other ways such as quality of life helping others etc save gives you reserves for future expenses but it does not provide growth so that just leaves invest   you seem to be focused on stock market investments which you are right take a very long time to grow although you can get returns of up to 12 depending on how much volatility you 're willing to absorb but there are other ways to invest   you can invest in yourself by getting a degree or other training to improve your income   you can invest by starting a business which can dramatically increase your income in fact this is the most common path to millionaire in the us and probably in other free markets you can invest by growing your own existing business   you can invest in someone else 's business you can invest in real estate that can provide both value appreciation and rental income   so yes investment is a key aspect of wealth building but it is not limited to just stock market investment you can also look at reducing expenses in order to have more money to invest also keep in mind that investment with higher returns come with higher risk both in terms of volatility and risk of complete loss and that borrowing money to invest is almost always unwise since the interest paid directly reduces the return without reducing the risk

the price earnings ratio is calculated as the market value per share divided by the earnings per share over the past 12 months in your example you state that the company earned $ 0.35 over the past quarter that is insufficient to calculate the price earnings ratio and probably why the pe is just given as 20 so if you have the formula correctly the calculation given the numbers in your example would be 0.35 4 20 = $ as to i 'm not sure your pe is correct according to yahoo the pe for is at the time of writing not using the formula above this would lead to 2.3 4 = $ that stock has a 52-week high of $ so $ is not unrealistic i 'm more than a little dubious of the validity of that formula however and urge you not to base your investing decisions on it

you are kind of thinking of this correctly but you will and should pay for insurance at some point   what i mean by that is that although the insurance company is making a profit that removing the risk for certain incidents from your life you are still receiving a lot of value    things that inflict large losses in your life tend to be good insurance buys   health liability long term care long term disability and property insurance typically fall into this category    in your case assuming you are young and healthy it would be a poor choice to drop the major medical health insurance   there is a small chance you will get very sick in the next 10 years or so and require the use of this insurance   a much smaller chance than what is represented by the premium   but if you do get very sick and do n't have insurance it will probably wipe you out financially   the devastation could last the rest of your life    you are paying to mitigate that possibility   and as you said it 's pretty low cost    while you seem to be really good at numbers it is hard to quantify the risk avoidance   but it must be considered in your analysis also along those lines is car insurance   while you may not be willing to pay for full coverage it 's a great idea to max out your personal liability if you have sufficient assets

curious why do n't banks have their atms running on a bare bones of linux like arch   imo it would be far more secure and with the right kind of training for the maintenance staff would actually be easier to maintain   i mean it 's not like they ca n't get access to top notch counsel from tech industry heavy weights

debts do not inherit to the children you are absolutely not liable for your parent 's debt in any way whatsoever   collection agents will lie about this tricking you is their job and your job is to tell them heck no do i look like an idiot when a person dies all their personal assets and debts go to a fictitious entity called the estate   this is a holder for the person 's assets until they can be finally   the estate is managed by a living person sometimes a company law firm called an executor   similar to a corporation which is shutting down business the executor 's job is to act on behalf of the estate and in the estate 's best interest not his own   for instance he ca n't decide in his capacity as executor to give all the estate 's money to himself   he has to and follow state law and any living trust or wills that may be in place this role is not for everyone   you ca n't just decide la la la i 'm going to live in their house now that is   the house is an asset and someone inherited that as dictated by will trust or state law   that has to be worked out legally   once they inherit the house you have to negotiate with them about living there if you want to live there now negotiate to rent the house from the estate this is an efficient way to funnel money into the estate for what i discuss later the estate has assets and it has debts some debts extinguish on the death of the natural person e.g. student loans depending on the contract and state law did you know corporations are considered a person   that 's what citizens united was all about   so are estates both are fictitious persons the executor can act like a person in that sense    if you have unsecured debt how can a creditor motivate you to pay   they can annoy and harass you   they can burn your credit rating   or they can sue you and try to take your assets but suing is also expensive for them   this is not widely understood but anyone at any time can go to their creditors and say   hey creditor i 'm not gon na pay you $ 10,000   tough   you can sue me good luck with that   or i 'll make you a deal   i 'll offer you $ 2000 to settle this debt   what say you   and you 'll get one of two answers   either ok or nice try let 's try $ 7000   if the latter you start into the cycle of haggling 3000 6000 4000 5000 split the difference $ 4500 ok   this is always a one time lump sum one shot payoff never partial payments   creditors will try to convince you to make partial payments   do n't do it   anyone can do that at any time   why do n't living people do this every day    how about an estate   estates are fictitious persons they do n't have a morality they have a fiduciary duty do they plan on borrowing any more money nope their credit rating is already 0 they owe no loyalty to actually the executor 's fiduciary duty is to get the most possible money for the assets and settle the debts for the least   so i argue it 's unethical to fail to haggle down this debt   if an executor is not a or has a moral issue with creditors he is the heirs and he can be sued for that personally because he has a fiduciary duty to the heirs not chase bank   like i say the job is not for everyone the estate should also make sure to check the paperwork for any other way to escape the debt does it extinguish on death   is the debt time barred can they really prove it 's valid   etc   it 's not personal it 's business   the estate should not make monthly payments no credit rating to protect and should not pay one dime to a creditor except for a one shot final settlement is it secured debt let them take the asset unless an heir really wants it   when a person dies with a lot of unsecured debt it 's often the case that they do n't have a lot of cash lying around   the estate must sell off assets to raise the cash to settle with the creditors   now here 's where things get ugly with the house   the estate should try to raise money any other way but it may have to sell the house to pay the creditors for the people who would otherwise inherit the house it may be in their best   interest to pay off that debt check with lawyers in your area but it may also be possible for the estate to take a mortgage on the house use the mortgage cash to pay off the estate 's debts still haggle and then the house and mortgage to the heirs   the mortgage lender would have to be on board with all of this   then the heirs would owe the mortgage    good chance it would be a small mortgage on a big equity e.g. a $ 20,000 mortgage on a $ 100,000 house   banks love those

there 's nothing new about whole life insurance the agent stands to earn a pretty hefty commission if he can sell it to you i do n't think your assets warrant using it for avoiding the taxes that would be due on a larger estate i do n't see a compelling reason to buy it
