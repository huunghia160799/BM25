when you do your taxes you have two choices for your deductions you can take the standard deduction or you can choose to itemize your deductions if you itemize your deductions you use form 1040 schedule a.   by looking at schedule a you can see the list of deductions that are itemized on schedule a itself you only list a total for each of these broad categories in some cases this is sufficient detail however for certain deductions finer detail may be required and you may have to submit additional forms showing this detail for example on the medical expense line you generally only list a total of medical expenses details are only supplied to the irs upon request for gifts to charity you need to supply more details on form if your gifts are worth more than $ 500   these requirements can be found in the instructions for schedule a. as noted by in the comments the above deductions that are a part of your itemized deductions are called below the line deductions because they are subtracted after the adjusted gross income line and are only able to be deducted if you choose to decline the standard deduction there are other deductions that are available whether or not you itemize these above the line deductions are found on form 1040 lines 23 35 if you look at these lines on the form you 'll see the different types of deductions that are called out here some of these deductions require additional details on other forms for example the hsa deduction requires details on form 8889   if you have a business your business expenses are not part of your itemized deductions at all and do not appear on schedule a anywhere instead your business expenses get subtracted from your business 's revenue and the resulting profit or loss is what is reported on your form 1040   different types of businesses report these expenses differently if you have a sole proprietorship the details of your business 's expenses are reported on schedule c. on this schedule part ii is devoted to deductible business expenses take a look at schedule c and you 'll see that lines 8 27 are different categories of expenses that get called out on this schedule

the article in the op talks about the model s competitors luxury cars and even says they three different manufacturers cars combined in that category yet bmw sold cars alone last year tesla sold under 80,000 cars in total last year    they must be picking a very specific luxury car from a series range to make those claims add up     tesla is a niche automaker a better comparison would be to etc   they are simply and utterly dwarfed by any real oem and that is n't going to change for at least a decade or more

generally prize money is miscellaneous income reported on line 21 of your 1040 and not subject to self employment tax see irs publication 525 for more details under prizes and awards they give an example of winning a photography contest now there are a couple of exceptions if your main occupation is participating in contests such as this or you do it sufficiently that it could be considered such then it may be considered something you should pay self employment taxes on if it 's your first one you 're fine also it would have to be something that does n't look like work for me to be confident it 's self employment income i 'm not sure that winning the netflix prize for improving on their algorithm by 10 would n't run the risk of being considered sort of employment i 'm not a tax advisor but in that case i would hire one to be sure   i could imagine companies abusing prizes otherwise to get out of paying employment taxes

what you want is a position transfer likely by    this is a transfer from one ira to another without having to liquidate positions to do so   in effect the brokerage firm is just transferring records from your existing ira to your new ira   you will need to watch out to make sure your new ira account can hold your positions for this to work   for example some brokerages allow you to hold fractional shares but others do n't   the fractional share amounts would be sold automatically prior to transfer   another example might be different fund families could be allowed between different brokerages the general process is open your new ira account initiate the from your new account your old ira account brokerage sends the positions over and after a week or so your new ira brokerage notifies you that everything is transferred i 've switched iras a couple times via this mechanism and never been charged a fee but i 've always stuck with the larger brokerages like fidelity td ameritrade and interactive brokers

if that 's not a politically loaded title to your post i do n't know what is   wal mart pays it 's employees the wage that it is competitive in line with similar types of work and what it is able to afford and still offer the pricing they can on the products they offer and still make money   what they 're doing is legal and ethical   additionally if the people that work at wal mart need more money than their jobs offer what concern of their employer is that   if the people do n't like that they do n't make enough money at their job and have to take welfare then it 's their responsibility to improve their situation not their employer 's to give them more money for the same work just because they do n't earn enough   is wal mart 's or any place of employment for that matter mission to enrich their employees or to do business to make a profit   i hope your answer is the latter   if it 's not i think you 're less an advocate of business and more an advocate of socialism and wealth redistribution

i would go even farther than victor 's answer   there is little evidence that candlestick patterns and technical analysis in general have any predictive power    even if they did in the past of which there is some evidence in modern times they are so easy to do on computers that if they worked algorithmic traders would have scanned almost all traded stocks and bought sold the stock before you even had a chance to look at the graph while the best technical traders who are very good at quickly using pattern recognition across many indicators as victor mentioned might be able to add some advantage   the odds that a pattern so simple to code such as bullish would have predictive power is tiny

i am going to give advice that is slightly differently based on my own experiences first regarding the financing i have found that the dealers do in fact have access to the best interest rates but only after negotiating with a better financing offer from a bank when i bought my current car the dealer was offering somewhere around 3.3 which i knew was way above the current industry standard and i knew i had good credit   so like i did with my previous car and my wife 's car i went to local and national banks came back with deals around 2.5 or 2.6   when i told the dealer they were able to offer so it 's ok to go with the dealer 's financing just never take them at face value   whatever they offer you and no matter how much they insist it 's the best deal never believe it   they can do better with my first car i had little credit history similar to your situation and interest rates were much higher then like 6 8   the dealer offered me 10   i almost walked out the door laughing   i went to my own bank and they offered me 8 which was still high but better than 10   suddenly the dealer could do 7.5 with a 0.25 discount if i auto pay through my checking account down payment wise there is nothing wrong with a 35 down payment   when i purchased my current car i put 50 down   all else being equal the more cash down the better off you 'll be   the only issue is to weigh that down payment and interest rate against the cost of other debts you may have   if you have a 7 student loan and the car loan is only 3 you 're better off paying the minimum on the car and using your cash to pay down your student loan   unless your student loan balance is significantly more than the 8k you need to finance like a 20k or 30k loan also remember that a car is a depreciating asset   i pay off cars as fast as i can   they are terrible debt to have   a home can rise in value offsetting a mortgage   your education keeps you employed and employable and will certainly not make you dumber so that is a win   but a car   you pay $ 15k for a car that will be worth $ 14k the next day and $ 10k a year from now   it 's easy to get underwater with a car loan if the down payment is small interest rate high and the car loses value quickly to make sure i answer your questions do you guys think it 's a good idea to put that much down on the car if you can afford it and it will not interfere with repayment of much higher interest debts then yes   a car loan is a major liability so if you can minimize the debt you 'll be better off what interest rate is reasonable based on my credit score i am not a banker loan officer or dealer so i can not answer this with much credibility   but given today 's market 2.5 4 seems reasonable do you think i 'll get approved probably but only one way to find out

from some background reading i 'm doing it sounds like the union has people by the proverbial balls anyway even in an agency shop where union membership is optional non members must pay for the collective bargaining done by the union and union shop just means that the employer can hire anybody but they must join the union in order to be employed all of those seem to indicate that every worker in the represented class must accept the terms of the collective bargaining wiki   part of the reason that i 'm curious is that once i 've decided that i 'm done being an engineer i think it might be fun to teach but every time i hear about union negotiations it makes me think that operating in that system would be lame going from a world where merit is the primary differentiator to a world where years in the system count for more would kinda suck

i will answer the question from the back who can not afford luxury cars those whose parents paid for their college education can not afford luxury cars but buy them anyway why i have what may seem a rather shocking proposition related to the point of not saving for kids college parents do not owe children a college education why should they did your parents fund your college or did you get it through a mix of pell grants loans and work if they did then you owe them $ back for it adjusted for inflation if they did not well then why do you feel your children deserve more than you deserved when you were a child you do not owe your children a college education they owe it to themselves gifts do not set one up for success they set one up for dependence    i will add one more hypothesis financial discipline is best learned through one 's own experiences when an 18 + year old adult gets a very large amount of money as a gift every year for several years in the form of paid tuition does that teach them frugality and responsibility my proposition is that those who get a free ride on their parents backs are not well served in terms of becoming disciplined they become the subjects of the question in this post those why buy cars and houses they can not afford and pay for vacations with credit cards we reap what we as a society   of course college is only one case in point but a very illustrative one the bigger point is that financial discipline can only be developed when there are opportunities to develop it such opportunities arise under one important condition financial independence   what does buying children cars for their high school graduation buying them 4 years of college tuition and buying them who knows what else study abroad trips airfare apartment leases textbooks etc etc teach does it teach independence or dependence   it can certainly at least that 's what you hope for teach them to appreciate when others do super nice things for them but does free money instill financial responsibility   try to ask kids whose parents paid for their college why they did it because my parents want me to succeed is probably the best you can hope for now ask them but do your parents owe you a college education why yes i guess they do why well i guess because they told me they do they said they owe it to me to set me up for success in life now think about this do people who become financially successful achieve that success because someone owed something to them or because they recognized that nobody owes them anything and took it upon themselves to create that success for themselves these are not very comfortable topics to consider especially for those of you who have either already sunk many tens of thousands of dollars into your childrens college education or for those who have been living very frugally and for the past 10 15 years driven by the goal of doing so but i want to open this can of worms because i believe fundamentally it may be creating more problems than it is solving i am sure there are some historical and cultural explanations for the assumption that has at some point formed in the american society that parents owe their children a college education   but as with most social conventions it is merely an idea a shared belief it has become so ingrained in conversations at work parties and family that it seems that many of those who are advocates of the idea of paying for their childrens education no longer even understand why they feel that way they simply go with the flow of social expectations unwilling or unable to question either the premises behind these expectations or the long term consequences and results of such expectations   with this comment i want to point to the connection between the free financial gifts that parents give to their adult children and the level of financial discipline of these young adults their spending habits sense of entitlement and sense of responsibility over their financial decisions the statistics of the u.s. savings rate average credit card debt foreclosures and bankruptcy indeed tell a troubling story   my point is that these trends do n't just happen because of lots of tv advertising and the proverbial jones 's these trends happen because of a lack of financial education discipline and experience with balancing one 's own checkbook perhaps we need to think more deeply about the consequences of our socially motivated decisions as parents and what is really in our children 's best interests not while they are in college but while they live the rest of their lives after college finally to all the 18 + adult children who are from the traumatic experience of not having their parents pay for their college while some of their friends parents totally did i have this perspective to offer   like you are now your parents are adults their money is theirs to spend because it was theirs to earn you are under no obligation to pay for your parents retirement not that you were going to similarly your parents have no obligation to pay for your college they can spend their money on absolutely whatever they want be it a cottage vacations a or slots in the casino how they spend their money is their concern only and has nothing to do with your adult needs such as college education   if your parents their finances and go bankrupt it is their obligation to get themselves back in the black not yours if you have the means and may be so inclined you may help them if you do not or are not fair enough regardless of what you do they will still love you as their child no less   similarly if your parents have the means and are so inclined they may help you if they do not or are not fair enough regardless of what they do you are to love them as your parents no less   your task as an adult is to focus on how you will meet your own financial needs not to dwell on which of your needs were not met by people whose finances should well be completely separate from yours at this point in life for an adult to harbor an expectation of receiving something of value for free is misguided it unjustified illusory entitlement it is the expectation of someone who is clueless as to the value of money measured by the effort and time needed to earn it when adults want to acquire stuff or services they have to pay for these things with their own money that 's how adults live when adults want to get a massage or take a ride in a cab are they by their parents obligation to pay for these services no they realize that it 's their own responsibility to take care of these needs they either need to earn the money to pay for these things or buy them on credit and pay off the debt later   education is a type of service just like a massage or a cab ride it is a service that you decide you need to get in order to do xyz become smarter get a better paying job join a profession etc therefore as with any other service the primary responsibility for paying for this service is yours   you have 3 options or their combination work now so that you can earn the money to pay for this service later work part time while you are receiving this service acquire the service on credit and work later to pay it off that 's it this is called the real world the better you can deal with it the more successful you will become in it good luck

as someone who 's done quit a bit of home improvement and seen positive roi i can speak from some personal experience   all of this assumes you do the unskilled labor yourself and shop around for relatively cheap plumbers electricians etc first never underestimate the resale value added by a can of paint   this assumes you have or know someone with a good sense of style that can help improve the aesthetics of the home significantly   white walls can be so boring to homebuyers and so many of them ca n't see through the of an inch of white paint second look for shortcomings in the house as is anyway these are some common upgrades   the big thing is to find something you are reasonably comfortable doing yourself and that you will enjoy   realize that if you 're new to this most projects will cost twice what you budget and take four times as long   the pride of having done it yourself and put in the sweat equity makes it worth it though usually edit to better answer your modified question i 'm adding to my answer   so if i understand it your question is now at what rate is it sane to invest in our house vs. outside investments   this is really just a matter of balancing risk vs. lifestyle   with most upgrades there is no financial benefit to investing in upgrading your home now vs. 5 years from now right before you sell   you could be making 10 in mutual funds until then and then invest in the upgrades right before you sell   there is obviously a physical limit to how fast you can do these improvements yourself but front loading this now at the beginning of your timeframe as opposed to the end is not an investment decision it is a lifestyle decision   not saying do n't do it but do n't rationalize it to yourself as we 're saving money by doing this now   maybe use the rationalization we want to enjoy these upgrades and not just add them before we move out one exception to that i 'd plant any trees now and make sure they have a good water supply   good trees take a while to grow and doing that sooner rather than later will help

i find this very hard to believe believe it   the bottom quarter of american households have negative net worth and the bottom three quarters have no more than a tiny amount saved up in an emergency 63 of americans would not be able to come up with $ 500 without going into debt   nobody can retire with 5k in the u.s. the money will be gone within a year is it possible now you begin to see why the long term stability of social security and medicare are at present hot topics in american political life without them a great many more americans would die in poverty what is the actual figure the $ 5000 figure is accurate but irrelevant that median includes people who are thirty years from retirement and people who are two days from retirement the more relevant statistics are those restricted to people at or close to retirement age and they can be found lower down in the article you cite or in numerous other studies here 's one from the gao for example the figures here are unfortunately no less terrifying now $ 104 k is a lot better than $ 5 k but it 's still not much to retire on why we believe that it is reasonable to throw out all the zeros before taking the median i do not know that seems like bad math to me update there is some discussion of this point in the comments all i 'm saying here is that this is a and possibly misleading way to characterize the situation the linked report has the actual data but let 's try to summarize it here in a more meaningful way let 's suppose that we make buckets for how dependent on ss is a retirement age household to avoid starving to death being homeless and so on maybe these buckets are not ideal and we could move them around a bit   the takeaways here are that the ratios of nothing inadequate barely adequate comfortable is about that only the top of retirement age households can fund a comfortable retirement without help illustrates just how dependent on ss american households are how do 50 of old americans survive in their old age   social security and medicare   as the cited gao report indicates social security provides most of the income for about half of households age 65 and older do most old americans rely on their children for financial support one day i met a woman at a party and we were making small talk about her kids she had a couple already and one more was on the way   i want to have lots of children to support me in my old age she said   do you support your parents i asked which frankly seemed like an entirely reasonable question   of course not i ca n't afford it i 've got a baby on the way and two more kids at home i left her to draw her own conclusions as to the viability of her retirement plan

now asking if college is worth it   that 's not the question that should be asked   higher education and extended training are always a benefit at any point in life when it 's of high quality   the question that should be asked is why is the cost of college as high as it is   when i went to college to get my bachelors a semester at my state university cost $ bucks us this was in the early to mid 90s   twenty years later that same education cost $ 6,500 per semester   the main difference between these periods is that borrowing for school is now standard practice much less so in the 90s   any time you need to borrow to pay for something you 're going to overpay just because you have access to credit and can keep borrowing when someone hands you a bill   today kids borrow for college because they do n't have much choice if their parents did n't save enough or stopped supporting them right out of high school   and if you have this level of debt right out of college your hands will be tied for decades it affects things like first home buying and disposable income spending   the only way to drive the cost of college down is to plan ahead and pay with cash and to do that you need to have enough luck to be born to parents who care enough to help with your future   if schools know you ca n't or wo n't borrow to pay for an education they adjust

nobody can predict the affects of brexit but it is wise to consider them we saw the pound weaken after the vote to leave and it is possible the pound will weaken further after brexit and this devaluation could be quite dramatic if that happens it is likely to increase inflation uk inflation has gone from under 1 around the time of the referendum to 3 today and it could well go higher if inflation continues to increase the bank of england is likely to put up interest rates as it has historically done this to hedge against inflation   we have been living in a world of artificially low interest rates since the global crash of 2008 as the boe has tried to stimulate recovery with lower rates   the rates can not continue at this level if inflation starts to rise that in turn will put up mortgage rates   so for example if you have a £ 100k mortgage at currently this is a reasonable rate to have your repayments will be £ 523 a month   if your mortgage rate goes up to say 7 then your repayments are £ a month if it goes up to 10 then it 's £ a month and so on there is a mortgage calculator you can use to try playing with different amounts here my advice would therefore be try to get as small a mortgage as you can and make sure you can afford it quite comfortably in case rates go up and you need to find a few hundred pounds a month extra there are other risks from brexit as well house prices could fall as people decide not to buy properties due to excessive interest rates overall nobody knows what will happen but it is good to be planning ahead for all i am not a financial advisor this advice is given in good faith but with no financial qualification

if by being a millionaire you mean dollar millionaire then i doubt that it is really that easy in pakistani context at present the exchange rate is 107 pakistani rupees per us dollar so even with this exchange rate to have a million us dollars means having 107 million rupees of wealth now with this maths in mind you can very well calculate how much possible it is for an average 25 years old pakistani to have that much wealth and by the time you have 107 million pakistani rupees of wealth the exchange rate against the us dollar would have only gone up against pakistani currency that article which you have mentioned makes calculations in us context and dollar terms however if you talk only in terms of your country 's context then being a millionaire means having 1 million rupees of wealth and that is something which is quite achievable with your salary and within very short span of time

if you were certain you would probably do best by short selling an etf that tracked the index for the market you think was about to tank you 'd certainly make a lot more money on that strategy than precious metals if you were feeling super confident and want to make your money earn even more you could also buy a bunch of put options on those same etf funds obligatory warning short selling and options can be extremely risky while most investments cap your potential losses to your total investment a short sale has no theoretical limit to the amount of money you can lose

i would n't advocate it but one reason to pay a lower interest rate is if you have $ 990 on a $ 1000 limit credit card with 6 interest and $ 5000 on a $ 15k limit card at 10 interest having $ 500 to pay in a month and putting it on the lower interest would free up a greater percentage of credit on that card and could potentially help your credit rating i believe i think having $ 1000 on 10 different credit cards w/ $ 15k limit reflects better than $ 10k on one $ 15k card regardless of interest rates personally i think that 's dumb b c having the extra credit available is an opportunity to get into trouble a lot easier

the public does n't really need to notice for inflation to take effect   inflation happens there 's more money relative to things to buy   most people think that if say we increase the money supply by 2x everything should get more expensive   but it matters where the increase in money supply is and to whom is receiving it    for example the liquid money supply for us$ increased almost 4 times from 2009 to 2017 via quantitative easing where the central bank purchased not just short term treasuries but also longer term bonds     you would think that having 4x the amount of us$ circulating would lead to a lot of inflation on consumer prices   for every $ 1 that was floating around in 2009 we now have $ 4 so people should be willing to pay more for a given good increasing its price    however the new money has been primarily used to purchase assets and drive up their prices   it has not really found its way to into worker pay or to the general public as median income for workers has stayed relatively flat in that time frame    so it can be argued that the asset markets are feeling the effects of inflation from the increased money supply   where real estate prices public stock prices venture capital investments etc have all seen a large increase in their costs to acquire relative to the same asset and opportunity    these assets are acting like a sponge for the new money that prevents the effects of its inflationary properties from exiting out into the consumer economy    that is also why central banks across the globe are in a predicament in how to stop quantitative easing   if they were to shrink the money supply the inflationary pressures on assets would go down because there 's not enough new money to keep raising their prices   doing it the wrong way would cause housing stocks and investment markets to stop growing because there would n't be as much new money creating demand for those assets    the best way i can illustrate this is with an example   say you have an economy that consists of an orange tree that produces 10 oranges per year   there are 10 people in this economy that each want 1 orange per year   and there is a circulating money supply of $ 10    the owner of the orange tree hires all 10 people to pick 1 orange for him and pays them $ 1 to pick    in this scenario each person picks 1 orange and gives it to the owner   they then receive $ 1   they then turn around and purchase one of the oranges from the owner of the tree   because demand is 10 oranges and supply is 10 oranges and the money supply is $ 10 each orange is priced at $ 1 and everyone is happy    now let 's say the central bank prints $ 100 more dollars   if the central bank gave it to the people evenly each person would end up with $ 11   now we have 10 people that want 10 oranges and each have $ 11   so the price for the oranges would inflate to $ 11 per orange    now let 's say instead of giving the extra $ 100 to the people the central bank instead gives it to the orange tree owner   the owner can still pick his 10 oranges with the 10 people the labor force and can still charge $ 1 per orange   as long as oranges are still $ 1 he does n't really need to increase the wages of the orange pickers   so instead he invests the $ 50 into building a bigger house for himself and then puts the remaining $ 50 into developing an orange picking machine   the supply of oranges is the same the demand for oranges is the same and the supply of money that demands oranges is the same so each orange will continue to be priced at $ 1   in this scenario the supply of money increased by 10x but the prices of oranges did not inflate   this is because the new money went into assets not consumer demand    now play this scenario forward a few years   the orange tree owner now has a machine that picks oranges so he stops hiring people to pick oranges   now he has a new house and all the oranges he can eat     now let 's say this economy was replicated 100 times but here are only 20 houses   so there are 100 orange tree owners and 1,000 people that get paid to pick oranges and are willing to pay to consume oranges    the central bank hands $ 100 to each of the 100 orange tree owners   in this case some of the orange tree owners will bid up the price of the houses from $ 50 to $ 100   the other orange tree owners may invest in bigger and better orange tree picking machines   that automation will lower the cost to pick oranges and increase profits if prices stay the same   eventually those owners will be able to bid more than $ 100 for one of the 20 houses    as this plays out the price of a house will continue to increase until all orange picking is automated but no one can afford oranges because they are not needed to pick them anymore    this is a simplified version of what 's basically happening on a global scale

first a clarification no assets are immune to inflation apart from inflation indexed securities like tips or inflation indexed gilts well if held to maturity these are at least close inflation causes a decline in the future purchasing power of a given amount and it certainly does n't just affect government bonds either regardless of whether you hold equity bonds derivatives etc the real value of those assets is declining because of inflation all else being equal for example if i invest $ 100 in an asset that pays a 10 rate of return over the next year and i sell my entire position at the end of the year i have $ 110 in nominal terms inflation affects the real value of this asset regardless of its asset class because those $ 110 are n't worth as much in a year as they are today assuming inflation is positive an easy way to incorporate inflation into your calculations of rate of return is to simply subtract the rate of inflation from your rate of return using the previous example with inflation of 3 you could estimate that although the nominal value of your investment at the end of one year is $ 110 the real value is $ + 10 3 = $ 107 in other words you only gained $ 7 of purchasing power even though you gained $ 10 in nominal terms this back of the envelope calculation works for securities that do n't pay fixed returns as well consider an example retirement portfolio say i make a one time investment of $ 50,000 today in a portfolio that pays on average 8 annually i plan to retire in 30 years without making any further contributions yes this is an over simplified example i calculate that my portfolio will have a value of 50000 1 + or $ that looks like a nice amount but how much is it really worth i do n't care how many dollars i have i care about what i can buy with those dollars   if i use the same rough estimate of the effect of inflation and use a 8 3 = 5 rate of return instead i get an estimate of what i 'll have at retirement in today 's dollars that allows me to make an easy comparison to my current standard of living and see if my portfolio is up to scratch repeating the calculation with 5 instead of 8 yields 50000 1 + or $ as you can see the amount is significantly different if i 'm accustomed to living off $ 50,000 a year now my calculation that does n't take inflation into account tells me that i 'll have over 10 years of living expenses at retirement the new calculation tells me i 'll only have a little over 4 years now that i 've clarified the basics of inflation i 'll respond to the rest of the answer   i want to know if i need to be making sure my investments span multiple currencies to protect against a single country 's currency failing as others have pointed out currency does n't inflate prices denominated in that currency inflate also a currency failing is significantly different from a prices denominated in a currency inflating if you 're worried about prices inflating and decreasing the purchasing power of your dollars which usually occurs in modern economies then it 's a good idea to look for investments and asset allocations that over time have outpaced the rate of inflation and that even with the effects of inflation still give you a high enough rate of return to meet your investment goals in real inflation adjusted terms if you have legitimate reason to worry about your currency failing perhaps because your country does n't maintain stable monetary or fiscal policies there are a few things you can do first define what you mean by failing do you mean to exist or simply falling in unit purchasing power because of inflation if it 's the latter see the previous paragraph if the former investing in other currencies abroad may be a good idea questions about currencies actually failing are quite general however and in my opinion require significant economic analysis before deciding on a course of action hedging i would ask the same question about my home 's value against an inflated currency as well would it keep the same real value your home may or may not keep the same real value over time in some time periods average home prices have risen at rates significantly higher than the rate of inflation in which case on paper their real value has increased however if you need to make substantial investments in your home to keep its price rising at the same rate as inflation you may actually be losing money because your total investment is higher than what you paid for the house initially of course if you own your home and do n't have plans to move you may not be concerned if its value is n't keeping up with inflation at all times you 're deriving additional satisfaction utility from it mainly because it 's a place for you to live and you spend money maintaining it in order to maintain your physical standard of living not just its price at some future sale date 1 i use dollars as an example this applies to all currencies

this situation sounds better than most the company it seems likely to be profitable in the future   as such it is a good candidate to have a successful ipo    with that your stock options are likely to be worth something   how much of that is your share is likely to be very small   the workers that have been their since the beginning the venture capitalist and the founders will make the majority of profits from an ipo or sale   since you and others hired at a similar time as you are assuming almost no risk it is fair that your share of the take is small    despite being employees expect your share of the profits to be much smaller than   how about we go with .01    lets also assume that they go public in 2.5 years and that revenues during that time continue to increase by about year   profit margins remains the same   so revenues to 112 m profits to typically the goal for business is to pay no more than 5 times profits that could be supplanted by other factors but let 's assume that figure   so about 112 m from the ipo   so .01 of that is about 11k.   that feels about right keep in mind there would be underwriting fees and also i would discount that figure for things that could go wrong   i 'd be at about 5k. that would be my expected value figure 5k.   i 'd also understand that there is a very small likelihood that i receive that amount   the value received is more likely to be zero or enough to buy a there might also be some value in getting to know these people   if this fails will their next venture be a success in my own life i went to work for a company that looked great on paper that just turned out to be a bust   great concept horrible management and within a couple of years of being hired the company went bust   i worked like a dog for nothing

generally speaking an interest free loan will be tied to a specific purchase and the lender will be paid something by the vendor the only other likely scenario is an introductory offer to try to win longer term more profitable business such as an initial interest free period on a credit card banks could n't make money if all their loans were interest free unless they were getting paid by the vendors of whatever was being purchased with the money that was lent

for stocks bonds etf funds and so on taxed only on realised gain and losses are deductible from the gain and not from company 's income corporate tax is calculated only after all expenses have been deducted not the other way around real estate expenses can be deducted because of repairs and maintenance   in general all expenses related to the operation of the business can be deducted but you can not use expenses as willy nilly as you assume you can not deduct your subscription to playboy as an expense doing it is illegal and if caught the tours to church will increase exponentially vat is only paid if you claim vat on your invoices your situation seems quite complicated i would suggest get an accountant there are nuances in your situation which an accountant only can understand and help

this is actually quite a complicated issue i suggest you talk to a properly licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state legal advice from an attorney licensed in your state is also highly recommended there are many issues at hand here income both types of entities are pass through so earnings are taxed the same however for s corp there 's a reasonable compensation requirement so while b and c do n't do any work they may be required to draw salary as executives directors if they act as such equity for s corp you can not have different classes of shares all are the same so you can not have 2 partners contribute money and third to contribute nothing work is compensated you 'll be getting salary and all three have the same stake in the company you can have that with an llc expansion s corp is limited to x shareholders all of which have to be americans once you get a foreign partner or more than 100 partners you automatically become c corp whether you want it or not investors it would be very hard for you to find external investors if you 're a llc there are many more things to consider do not make this decision lightly fixing things is usually much more expensive than doing them right at the first place

no in fact you did n't really say anything your initial comment just on the fact he used the total bond market number instead of the muni bond market number from 2007 2008   and were dead on anything else about the article which would lead one to believe that that was all you saw fit to comment on       which is the equivalent to reading a story of a bank robbery and getting hung up on the article reporting the total dollar amount in the bank instead of the total dollar amount in the cash that were robbed from and not talking about anything else        also your initial complaint about what numbers he uses for the bond market is n't a lie   you personally feel that he should only mention the 2007 2008 bond market but if you actually read how he used it he was n't saying anything other than that is the size of the bond market in the context it 's used in the story there 's nothing wrong with the number   he did n't say they were scamming everything in the market it was a one off sentence about the size of the total bond market that in fact is vulnerable to the exact same type of illegal activity he talked about

ira is an account you can open as many as you want what 's limited is the contributions you can not deposit to the ira all of them combined more than what you 've earned during the year or $ 5500 for 2013 the lowest there are also limits on how much you can deduct depending on your income and availability of other retirement programs at your work you can open as many iras as you want in your child 's name but if your child had only earned $ 500 this year that 's how much you can put in these accounts your wife and you share the earned income limit so if your wife is not working you can still contribute to the ira in her name based on your own earnings i.e. if you earned more than $ you can contribute the maximum $ 5500 for each of you the limits are for all the ira combined does n't matter how many accounts you have and how many of them are roth

gt another way of looking at it most people think that the way to promote hiring women is to make them better potential employees but another way to do it is to make men worse potential employees by giving them the same time off   nothing more than lowering the bar   just like all the misinformation thrown around about the assault on women and the fictitious pay gap a majority of women choose to be the family member that takes time off from work   making men worse potential employees does n't change much since women will still choose to take the time off   as a result you have two people not showing up for work as opposed to just one

us or eu states are sovereigns which can not go bankrupt us states have defaulted in the 's but in most of those cases creditors were eventually repaid in full i 'm not 100 sure but i believe that indiana was an exception with regard to costs incurred building a canal system the best modern example of a true near default was new york city in the late 1970 's although new york city is n't a state the size and scope of its finances is greater than many us states what happened then in a nutshell basically a default of a major state or a city like nyc where creditors took major losses would rock the financial markets and make it difficult for all states to obtain both short and long term financing at reasonable rates that 's why these entities get bailed out if greece or california really collapse it will likely create a domino effect that will have wide reaching effects

there are two scenarios to determine the relevant date and then a couple of options to determine the relevant price if the stocks were purchased in your name from the start then the relevant date is the date of the purchase if the stocks were willed to you i.e. you inherited them then the relevant date is the date at which the person who willed them to you had died you can check with the company if they have records of the original purchase if it was in street name they may not have such records and then you need to figure out what broker it was to hold them once you   figured out the relevant date contact the company 's investor relationships contact and ask them for the adjusted stock price on that date adjusted for splits mergers acquisitions whatever that would be the cost basis per share you would be using alternatively you can research historical prices on your favorite financial information site google yahoo bloomberg or the stock exchange where the company is listed if you can not figure the cost basis or it costs too much you can just write cost basis as $ 0 and claim the whole proceeds as gains you 'll pay capital gains tax on the whole amount but that may end up being cheaper than conducting the investigation to reveal the actual numbers

individual product prices do not necessarily rise at inflation rates   what inflation means is that the purchasing power of one unit of currency decreases by x% in a year which is typically measured by looking at a broad spectrum of products in an economy and to all products   so for all products across an economy the aggregate price of all goods will on average be x% higher that they were this time last year   some products will be cheaper some will be more expensive but on average their prices will rise with inflation rates for the other part of your question inflation is an annualized percentage so an inflation rate of 12 means prices are 12 higher than they were a year ago so if you extrapolate that linear trend prices will rise again on average 1 in a month

i do n't even know where to begin you 're truly all over the place the number of upvotes on your post has absolutely zero relevance to the fact that you believe trump has caused this minuscule reduction in the deficit you literally said it yourself you posted an article and stated let 's discuss and then when it was discussed your argument was completely refuted in a heartbeat why did n't you respond to 's post he laid out a rational argument to refute your opinion however you unfortunately did n't have the facts or understanding on the subject to back your opinion so instead you stayed away from that comment argument because it did n't reflect your biased way of thinking this is the basis of which the shrinking pro trump base now stand they project their opinions then cherry pick the feedback that helps them feel good about their opinions while refusing to respond to any arguments that have factual information amp merit   i 'm going to give you some advise is n't a good place for you to learn about the basics of economics and i know you do not know the bare basics because anyone with any clue about how modern economics works knows that a president can not enact true economic growth or can significantly reduce a national budget deficit in 8 months while not introducing amp passing one piece of meaningful legislature or enacting any piece of their economic agenda which both sides of the aisle are fully aware amp accept that trump has n't been able to accomplish yet   now this is going to put you in a tough spot the s&amp;p under obama was up 30 after his first 8 months in office by your rational obama grew the overall wealth of the top 500 companies in the u.s. by 30 before he was able to enact any legislature but no obama could n't have done that because he only introduced destructive economic legislature from the get go therefore the president must have no control over economic success or failure within their first year of the presidency before they can make use of their economic agenda however that would go against your entire argument you set forward in this post puts you in a bit of a    sorry for the long response it 's just tough seeing someone make repeated simple basic economic mistakes in the subreddit feel free to pm me if you 're looking for some good books to get you started

i 'd agree that this can seem a little unfair but it 's an unavoidable consequence of the necessary practicality of paying out dividends periodically rather than continuously and differential taxation of income and capital gains to see more clearly what 's going on here consider buying stock in a company with extremely simple economics it generates a certain constant earnings stream equivalent to $ 10 per share per annum and all of that profit as periodic dividends let 's say once annually assume there 's no intrinsic growth and that the firm 's value which we 'll say is $ 90 per share is completely neutral to any other market factors under these economics this stock price will show a evolution accruing from $ 90 to $ 100 over the course of a year and resetting back down to $ 90 after each dividend payment now if i am invested in this stock for some period of time the fair outcome would be that i receive an appropriately time weighted share of the $ 10 annual earnings per share less my tax if i am invested for an exact calendar year this works as i 'd expect the stock price on any given day in the year will be the same as it was exactly one year earlier so i 'll realise zero capital gain but i 'll have collected a $ 10 taxed dividend along the way on the other hand what if i am invested for exactly half a year spanning a dividend payment i receive a dividend payment of $ 10 less tax but i make a capital loss of overall pre tax i 'm up $ 5 per share as expected however the respective tax treatment of the dividend payment which is classed as income and the capital gains is likely to be different in particular to benefit from the negative taxation of the capital loss i need to have some positive capital gain elsewhere to offset it if i ca n't do that i 'm much worse off compared to half the full year return further even if i can offset against a gain elsewhere the effective taxation rates are likely to be different but note that this could work for or against me if my capital gains rate is greater than my income tax rate i 'd actually benefit and if i 'm invested for half a year but not spanning a dividend i make $ 5 of pure capital gains and realise a different effective taxation rate again in an ideal world i 'd agree that the effective taxation rate would n't depend on the exact timing of my transactions like this but in reality it 's unavoidable in the interests of practicality and so long as the rules are clear i would n't say it 's unfair per se it just adds a bit of complexity

the best way to determine how much it will cost you is to call the insurance companies to get a quote from them for all the vehicles that you are planning on purchasing   they will have a set amount depending on the year make model of the car combined with all your personal details like where you live age sex occupation   there are many online sites where you an get quotes as well though talking with a rep may be the better option since you have a lot of questions   if you are still living with your parents you may be able to get a cheaper rate with that company as you might qualify for a multi vehicle discount or combined property vehicle insurance with them   you might also be able to get a better rate since you were probably insured as a secondary driver with that company for several years the cost of your auto insurance will depend also on what type of premium you choose   for instance it will be cheaper if you opt to only purchase 3rd party liability insurance which only covers the cost of repairing the 3rd party 's vehicle ie the person you hit   you may also get discounts for having certain optional safety equipment options like snow tires    you will need to have your insurance purchased and sorted out before you are able to drive your car out of the dealership    for a male with ~10 years driving experience and a clean record   you could probably find something good for about $ 120 a month   of course this depends on the many factors listed above

taxing divident earnings hurts bank shareholders customers and impacts the equities market for the worse because it   a lowers the incentive to hold an equity instrument over long and intermediate periods incentivizes short term holdings creating a more traded stock market with more pronounced crises occurring more frequently   b the resulting dead weight loss of long term equities investment the capital available to banks and investment firms limiting the services they can offer their customers decreasing product yield and increasing borrowing costs   c the banks having lost business in long term equities trading then of course make less money and return less money to their shareholders   no such things as a free lunch my dude

in principle when you are the sole owner of a limited company and also the sole employee then it is much easier to assume that someone else is the employee let 's say your twin brother john   john receives a salary from david 's company of course john has to pay income tax on his salary absolutely in the uk and in estonia as well if they have any sensible tax laws at all which i assume but do n't know for sure   then there is the company it 's profit equals revenue minus cost you said £ 4000 revenue and john 's salary plus anything the company has to pay on top of the salary is cost which is subtracted from the revenue to calculate profit in the uk the company pays 20 corporation tax on those profits and the rest stays in its bank account or may be in goods that the company purchased   where does david come in he owns the company but does n't work for it and gets no salary he owns the company but he does not own the company 's money he ca n't just help himself to the money he can get a loan from the company and is personally responsible for repaying that loan if it 's not repaid hmrc will be very angry which will hurt or he can pay himself a dividend and pays dividend tax on it or of course he can leave the money in the company   that 's exactly how it works in the uk and i would assume estonia to be similar and of course if it 's not the twin brother who is the employee but the op himself then the situation is exactly the same

interactive brokers offers global securities trading notice that the security types are cash stock futures options opt futures options    warrants war bonds contracts for differences cfd or    dutch warrants there is a distinction between options opt warrants war options on futures and finally dutch warrants is intuitively similar to an index option for index option valuation equations for a call and -1 for a put i do n't know if interactive brokers uses that convention   what is the difference between a dutch warrant and an option or warrant dutch warrants are n't analogous to dutch auctions e.g. in the bond market for north america interactive brokers only lists commissions for traditional warrants and options that is warrants and options that have a single stock as the underlying security for asia and europe interactive brokers lists both the   regular options and warrants as well as equity index options see commission schedule dutch warrants are actually more like options than warrants and that may be why interactive brokers refers to them as index options here 's some background from a research article about dutch warrants which was not easy to find in the netherlands ing bank introduced call and put warrants on the    ft se 100 the 40 and the german dax indexes these are some differences between dutch index warrants and exchange traded index options that last point is the most important as it makes the pricing and valuation less subject to arbitrage last part of the question where do you find structured products on interactive brokers website look on the products page rather than the commissions page which mention structured products at all there is a structured products tab with details

of course goldman sells the bonds to the fed without charging a commission they are   well known for their compassionate altruism just kidding of course they charge the federal reserve act specifies that the federal reserve buy and sell treasury securities only in the open market the federal reserve conducts its purchases through primary dealers usually goldman these btw are older securities the new ones such as the fed has been up lately are sold at auction   this supposedly supports the central banks independence in conducting monetary policy but still does n't seem right but then the fact that we have a central bank at all instead of the u.s. treasury printing the money does n't seem quite right either now does it

since 2007 the world has seen a period of striking economic and financial volatility featuring the deepest recession since the 1930s despite this gold has performed strongly with its price roughly doubling since the global financial crisis began in 1 gold and real interest rates one of the factor that influences gold prices is real interest rate which is to some extent related to inflation since gold lacks a yield of its own the opportunity cost of holding gold increases with a real interest rate increase and decreases with a fall in real interest rates 2 gold and the us dollar the external value of the us dollar has been a significant influence on short term gold price movements the imf in 2008 that 40 50 of the moves in the gold price    since 2002 were dollar related with a 1 change in the effective    external value of the dollar leading to a more than 1 change in the    gold price source   3 gold and financial stress it is a significant and commonly observed influence on the short term price of gold in periods of financial stress gold demand may rise for a number of    reasons   4 gold and political instability it is another factor that can boost gold prices investor concerns about wars civil conflicts and international    tensions can boost demand for gold for similar reasons to those noted    above for periods of financial stress potential function as a    currency of last in case of serious system collapse provides    a particular incentive to hold it in case the political situation is    especially severe source 5 gold and official sector activity the behaviour of central banks and other parts of the official sector can have an important impact on gold prices   one reason for this is that central banks are big holders of gold    possessing some metric tons in 2010 which is approximately 15    of all above ground gold stocks as a result central bank policies on    gold sales and purchases can have significant effects and these    policies have been subject to considerable shifts over the decades source    source of above graphs

i think the issue here is you 're starting with a criteria that does n't actually exist in reality   a very small amount of research will uncover a plethora of options for savings accounts that pay far more interest than your basic checking account and do n't require you to spend on the balance to earn the interest    the point of saving is to have a pot of money that you can dip in to when you need it or when you 're ready to spend it for it 's intended purpose   that pot of money is not supposed to experience a lot of transactions   it should n't be commingled with funds that come and go on a daily basis   it does n't make sense to have checks or a debit card attached to your savings account because you should n't need access to that money that way not to mention that those two things open the door to fraud on the money that 's supposed to be there for you when you need it could you put your savings funds in to a checking account sure   if we lived in a world where savings accounts that do n't force you to jump through hoops to avoid fees did n't pay 10x more interest than interest bearing checking accounts that have similar ease of administration more people may choose to house savings funds in checking accounts but that 's not the world we live in    thanks to the back and forth in the comments below i 'm now more certain of my position that if you want a high yielding checking account you 'll have pay fees or initiate a certain number of debit card transactions or both   no one wants fees and you should n't be spending on your savings in order to earn interest on the balance it is very easy to juice your savings account to the best rates available

a suitable mix of index funds is a great option if you do n't want to spend a lot of time and effort micromanaging your money if you find amusement in pushing numbers around you may be able to do better notice may if you have multiple millions you can hire someone of that sort to push the numbers around for you they may do better for you notice may and remember that part of your additional gains have to go to pay them which means they have to do better just to be worth having on staff in the first place if you have more than that there are some options available which smaller investors really ca n't get involved in as one example if you have enough money that you can lose $ 100 k without especially noticing you can get involved in venture capital and the like which require a large commitment and are higher risk but can yield higher returns anyone who 's dismissing index funds as only for beginners is being foolish but recommending them to beginners in particular is a good thing since they let you get into the market with fairly predictable risk benefits without needing a massive investment in education and time

a few weeks ago i was thinking about this exact thing except swap euros for canadian dollars the good news is that there are options option 1 yes buy indian fixed deposits interest rates are high right you can get up to 9 p.a it boils down to your sentiment about the indian rupee going forward for instance let 's say you purchase a deposit for amount x at 9 p.a you can have it double to almost 2x in 10 years three things can happen in 10 years are you optimistic about indian governance and economy going forward if you are go for it i certainly am option 2 heard of fcnr look in to fcnr deposits i do n't know about europe but in canada the best rate for a 1 year deposit is approximately 1.5 however through foreign currency non resident fcnr deposits you can get up to 4 or 5 the other benefit is that you do n't have to convert currency to inr which results in conversion savings however only major currencies can be used to open such accounts

the people who cause this sort of sell off immediately are mostly speculators short term day traders and the like they realize that because of the lowered potential for earnings in the future the companies in question wo n't be worth as much in the future they will sell shares at the elevated price including sometimes shares that they borrow for the explicit purpose of selling short selling until the share price is more reasonable now the other question is why the companies in question wo n't sell for as much in the future even if every other company in the world looks less attractive all at once global economic catastrophe etc people have other options they could just put the money in the bank or in corporate bonds or in mortgage bonds or treasury bonds or some other low risk instrument or something crazy like gold if the expected return on a stock does n't justify the price you 're unlikely to find someone paying that price so you do n't actually need to have a huge sell off to lower the price you just need a sell off that 's big enough that you run out of people willing to pay elevated prices

i like this option rather than exposing all 600k to market risk i 'd think of paying off the mortgage as a way to diversify my portfolio expose 400k to market risk and get a guaranteed 3.75 return on that 200k in essence then you can invest the money you were putting towards your mortgage each month   the potential disadvantage is that the extra 200k investment could earn significantly more than 3.75 and you 'd lose out on some money historically the market beats 3.75 and you 'd come out ahead investing everything there 's no guarantee you also do n't have to keep your money invested you can change your position down the road and pay off the house i feel best about a paid off house but i know that my sense of security carries opportunity cost up to you to decide how much risk you 're willing to accept also if you do n't have an emergency fund i 'd set up that first and then go from there with investing paying off house

i know its not legal to have open long and short position on specific security on two stock exchanges nse bse there is nothing illegal about it there are prescribed ways on how this is addressed   in cash segment intra day trades    one can short sell a security if by end of day he does not buy the security it goes into auction the said security is purchased on your behalf any profit or loss arising out of this is charged to you similarly one can buy a security if one does not pay the amount by end of day it would go into auction and sold any profit or loss arising out of this is charged to you if you short sell a security on one exchange you have to buy it on same exchange if you buy on other exchange it will not be adjusted against this short position also is it legal to have long position on stock and short its derivative future option there are no restrictions edit party a shorts 10 shares of hdfc today in intra day cash segment purchased by party b. rather than buying back 10 shares or allowing it to go into auction party a borrows 10 hdfc shares from x via for a period of say 6 months 1 month to 1 year this is recorded as party a obligation to x these 10 borrowed shares are transferred to party b. so party x does n't have any hdfc shares at this point in time however in exchange party x receives fees for borrowing from party a. if there is dividend are declared company pays party b. however recovers identical amount from party a and pays party x. if there is 1:1 split now party a owes party x 20 hdfc shares on maturity after 6 months party a has to buy these from market and given back the borrowed shares to party x. if there are some other corporate actions i.e. mergers the obligation of party a to party x is closed immediately and position settled of course there are provisions whereby party a can pay back the shares earlier or party x can ask for shares earlier and there are rules trades mechanisms to facilitate this

if you are already invested in a particular stock i like joetaxpayer 's answer think about it as if you are re buying the stocks you own every day you decide to keep them and do n't set emotional anchor points about what you paid for them or what they might be worth tomorrow these lead to two major logical fallacies that investor 's commonly fall prey to loss aversion and sunk cost both of which can be bad for your portfolio in the long run to avert these natural tendencies i suggest having a game plan before you purchase a stock based on on your investment goals for that stock for example a combination of one or more of the following i 'm investing for the long term and i expect this stock to appreciate and will hold it until specific event time at which point i will sell it all sell it gradually over a fixed time period right around the time i need the money i 'm going to bail on this stock if it falls more than x from my purchase price i 'm going to cash out all half some of this investment if it gains more than x from my purchase price to lock in my returns the important thing is to arrive at a strategy before you are invested and are likely to be more emotional than rational   otherwise it can be very hard to sell a hot stock that has suddenly jumped in price 25 because it has momentum gambler 's fallacy conversely it can be hard to sell a stock when it drops by 25 because i know it will bounce back eventually sunk cost loss aversion fallacy   also remember that there is opportunity cost from sticking with a losing investment because your brain is saying i really have n't lost money until i give up and sell it when logically you should be thinking if i move my money to a more promising investment i could get a better return than i am likely to on what i 'm holding

if you buy a long term bond with long term fixed interest rate and then the interest rates increase your bond is worth less that 's not a problem because over the years the value of the bond will go back to its nominal value if you have a bond that does n't pay out annually but increases its value every year you will get exactly the amount of cash when it pays out that you expected   the problem is that if for 20 years interest rates were 8 while your bond only paid 4 then you will have such an amount of inflation that the cash you get is worth much less than you hoped you may have hoped that your bond would be worth one year average salary but it may be only worth six months of average salary even if the dollar amount is exactly what you expected

the price gaps up because the offer is for a price above the current price therefore people want to buy now before the price jumps to the offer level of course it does depend on the tone of the announcement   which party is making the announcement and are they announcing an offer or a deal if the price is $ 10 and the offer is for $ 12 then the price may quickly jump the early buyers will make the most quick money they hope that the deal is done quickly or if not the final price ends up higher   there are risks the company could reject the offer the due diligence could expose a problem the regulators could reject the deal based on anti trust issues the deal could take many months to complete or the final deal could be for shares in the new company   the risks are one reason people sell after the deal offer is announced in other cases the seller finally is seeing a profit or a smaller loss and wants out while they can

some brokerages will allow you to enroll your account in a dividend reinvestment plan td ameritrade and i think schwab for example the way the plan works is that they would take your $ 4 and give you whatever fractional share of the etf it is worth on the payment date there are no fees associated with this purchase or at least there are in the programs i 've seen if you have to pay a fee look for another brokerage you may also be able to enroll specific securities instead of the entire account into dividend reinvestment call your brokerage to see what they offer

there 's a key assumption made in the calculation of theta that the future price movement of the underlying is a random walk the amount of life left in the option times the volatility of the underlying creates a probability distribution of the price of the underlying at expiration at any given price point you can calculate the theta of the option the at the money values are the most likely the way in or way out of the money values are much less likely theta is constructed mathematically to decay linearly over time so the strikes with the most theta lose the most theta each day if you are looking for a more intuitive answer the otm calls have less theta than the atm calls because while they are both 100 time value the otm calls cost much less so it 's 100 of a smaller number remember decay is linear

allowances are calculated as your total deductions divided by the tax year 's personal exemptions as mentioned above it is a multiplier for 2015 the standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly is $ 12,600 and each of you gets 1 personal exemption $ 4,000 in 2015 that 's a total of $ 12,600 + or $ divide this by the personal exemption and you get roughly 5 allowances now say your employer offers health insurance and a 401(k plan your total health insurance or cafeteria contributions are $ 2,000 for the year and your total 401(k plan contributions are $ 6,000 for the year this would give an additional $ 2,000 + $ 6,000 = $ 8,000 divided by $ 4,000 = 2 allowances thus you would file with 7 allowances note that tax credits are not included in the allowance calculation that is because they do not affect your taxable income but rather directly reduce your taxes due

the really simple answer is that compound interest is compound not linear   money invested for longer earns more interest and the sooner you start investing the longer it has to earn interest   these ideas come out of pension investment where 65 is the usual retirement age and what you invest in the 1st ten years of your pension or any other compound interest fund accounts for over 50 of what you will get out 25 to 65 is forty years and $ 100 invested at 7 for 40 years is $ 1400   $ 100 invested every year for 40 years the pot would be worth just under $ 20,000 at 30 years it would be worth under $ 10,000 and at 20 years it would be worth only $   if you double your investment amount every 10 years you would have invested $ and the pot would be worth $ do exactly the same but starting at 35 instead of 25 and your pot would only be worth $

dealerships make a lot of money in the finance department   one of the thing they play upon is your emotional reaction of purchasing a new vehicle new to you in this case   they perform all sorts of shenanigans like adding selling gap insurance or extended warranties   they entice you with a promise of a lower interest rate but really what they are trying to do is back you into a payment    so if you can fiance 20,000 but the car you are buying is 16,000 then they will try to move that figure up to the 20 k mark   in your case it sounded like some borderline at the least illegal activity they used to fool you into paying more   it sounds like you regret this decision which puts you a step ahead of most   how many people brag about the extended warranty or gap insurance they got included in the sale    as mentioned in another answer the best bet is to go into the dealership with financing in place   say you were able to get a 3 loan on   the total interest would be   if you avoid the finance room you might avoid their dubious add ons that would probably cost you more then the 1600 even if you can get 0    if you are going to buy a car on time my advice would be to not fill out a credit app at the dealership   the dealership people through a fit but hold your ground   if need be get up and walk out   they wo n't let you leave one thing i must mention is that one feels very wealthy without that monthly pain in the payment for a car   you may want to try and envision yourself without a car payment and make steps to making that a reality for the rest of your life

if you get an inr 1000 discount for paying up front versus paying over six months you can consider that inr 1000 interest your annualized rate comes out to about if you can earn better than on that money by using it elsewhere in the mean time then you should pay over six months if not you should pay the whole price up front you may also elect to pay the interest if you do not have the full amount now but the use of the phone for the next six months will earn you more than the inr 1000 premium that you pay to defer the full purchase price

investors who are themselves canadian and already hold canadian dollars cad would be more likely to purchase the tsx listed shares that are quoted in cad thus avoiding the currency exchange fees that would be required to buy usd quoted shares listed on the nyse assuming shopify is only offering a single class of shares to the public in the ipo and shopify 's form f-1 only mentions class a subordinate voting shares as being offered then the shares that will trade on the tsx and nyse will be the same class i.e. identical consequently the primary difference will be the currency in which they are quoted and trade this adds another dimension to possible arbitrage where not only the bare price could deviate between exchanges but also due to currency fluctuation an additional implication for a company to maintain such a dual listing is that they 'll need to adhere to the requirements of both the tsx and nyse while this may have a hard cost in terms of additional filing requirements etc in theory they will benefit from the additional liquidity provided by having the multiple listings canadians in particular are more likely to invest in a canadian company when it has a tsx listing quoted in cad also for a company listed on both the tsx and nyse i would expect the tsx listing would be more likely to yield inclusion in a significant market index say one based on market capitalization and thus benefit the company by having its shares purchased by index etfs and index mutual funds that track the index i 'll also remark that this dual exchange listing is not uncommon when it comes to canadian companies that have significant business outside of canada

the fact you are asking this question the number of up votes the real cause of the banking crisis     answers which mention that shareholders will fire a public company board are on the bottom it is obvious that a company owners are interested in company value and should have direct and easy impact on a directors board if management does n't increase shareholders wealth   with large number of passive shareholders and current stock market system that impact is very limited hence your question   so bank directors upper management are n't that interested in company value they are mostly interested in theirs bonuses their wealth increase not shareholders and that 's the real problem of capitalism public companies slowly drift to function like companies in former socialistic countries these is no owner everything is owned by a nation

the most important thing in my view is flexibility to avoid running into problems one useful thing in the uk would be an arranged overdraft you go to your bank and they 'll agree that you can overdraw your account by a certain number of pounds depending on your income etc it will cost you a very high interest rate but only for each day where you are overdrawn so paying a bill two days before your salary comes in is n't too bad obviously avoid using the overdraft if you can having an overdraft while not using it is free it 's meant for an emergency being regularly overdrawn is expensive but once it is arranged with your bank an arranged overdraft is much much cheaper than bouncing cheques etc and possibly high fees for overdrawing your account and it takes the pressure of you   now things to need before you get a loan again uk the real interest rate that you are paying is called apr that 's the number that counts and that can not be manipulated no payday loans to avoid getting yourself into deep deep trouble no loan sharks obviously if you buy things with interest free credit that 's a included in the price so you pay more and b if you miss paying by one day they 'll hit you with huge interest payments and some will try this intentionally interest rate depends on loan amount i once had to borrow 20 more than i needed because it reduced the interest rate by half the 20 went straight into a savings account credit cards and overdrafts are much more expensive than loans mortgage is again cheaper than a loan usually make sure that you only use money from sources that charge the least amount make sure you pay back regularly so cheap sources stay available to you   just do yourself a favour and if at all possible spend less instead of getting a loan

craig touched on it but let me expand on the point deposits by definition are withheld at your marginal rate and since you can choose roth vs traditional right till filing time you know with certainty the rate you are at each year   absent any other retirement income i.e. no pension and absent an incredibly major change to our tax code i know your starting rate zero the first $ 10 k or so per person is part of their standard deduction and exemption for a couple the next $ 18k is taxed at 10 and so on let me stop here to expand this important point this is $ for the couple and the tax on it is less than $ 1900 5 there is no 5 bracket of course it 's the first $ 20 k with zero tax and that first $ 18,000 taxed at 10 that $ takes nearly $ 1 m in pretax accounts to offer as an annual withdrawal the 15 bracket starts after this and applies to the next $ 57 k of withdrawals each year over $ 95 k in gross withdrawals of pretax money and you still are n't in the 25 bracket   this is why 100 in traditional or 100 in roth are n't either ideal i continue to offer the example i consider more optimizing using roth for income that would otherwise be taxed at 15 but going pretax when you hit 25 then at retirement you withdraw enough traditional to just stay at 10 or 15 and roth for the rest   it would be a shame to retire 100 roth and realize you paid 25 but now have no income to use up those lower brackets   oddly time value of money is n't part of my analysis it makes no difference and note the exact numbers do change a bit each year for inflation there 's a also a good chance the exemptions goes away in favor of a huge increased standard deduction

yes but at the root of it is the consumer complaining that these trusted sources are not adhering to principles of journalistic integrity while they are desperately trying to survive thrive and adapt to a completely shifting paradigm where competition is lowering the bar and the same consumers are unwilling to step up and reward journalistic integrity this is what happens essentially we get what we pay for    we can lay blame on the media organizations as much as we care to but the reality is we ’ve reached a point where most people like to be given talking points and sound bites that their point of view rather than actually try to obtain facts and form their own opinions the truth is rarely in the bite size pieces our society today   trust in the media is at an all time low for no other reason than we allowed it to happen and rewarded the media for going down that path we ’ve created a system that does not reward what we say we want from media rather rewards the actions that show we want the complete opposite    if i may inquire how many people reading this pay any premium for good journalism i will be the first to sadly admit i do not   obviously this means i am also part of the problem despite making an effort to look at news from all sides i am just a guilty as most to reinforcing the same system that has destroyed journalistic integrity

first off your commitment to paying down debt and apparent strong relationship with your brother is admirable however i think you are your situation and potentially your relationship by attempting to combine debts in this way you could consider a simple example where you have interest bearing at 5 and your brother has interest bearing debt at 10 if you both pay down his higher interest debt first and then both pay down your debt after then clearly you will have paid less interest combined but by waiting to pay off your debt until later you have accrued more interest yourself so who has saved money by doing this your brother you will have paid let 's say without getting into balances $ 50 extra interest to save your brother $ 70 in interest so why would you want to give your brother $ 50 total interest savings between both of you in this simplified example are $ 20 so in theory your brother could pay you $ 60 after the fact effectively meaning you end up $ 10 ahead and your brother ends up $ 10 ahead here you end up in a position where you could still say in theory we both came out ahead but what if your brother loses his job while you 're both paying off your debt and he ca n't help any more does he accrue some type of calculated interest until he pays you back what if he 's off work for 2 years and still owes you 30k what if he just never makes his payments to you on time at what point do you resent your brother for failing to uphold his end of the deal money and friends do n't mix money and family mixes even worse in rare circumstances where you absolutely must mix family and money get everything in writing get it signed make it legal outline all details of the transaction including interest rates and examples of how the balances calculate in 5 years when things go following the letter of the law is what will keep you from becoming enemies but with family often people have an expectation that while we agreed i would pay x he 's my brother so he should take pity on me and allow me to pay only y if i need to finally to your question about how to calculate amounts to pay it will be very complicated you will need to track minimum balance payments interest rates and even potentially the lost income which one of you gives up to pay down the other 's debt you could do these things in a simplified way close to what i 've set out above but then ultimately one of you will lose out if you pay down your debts first how can you calculate the lost living potential for your brother who might want to buy a house but ca n't save for a down payment for an extra year what if he has to move and without sufficient down payment he needs to pay extra mortgage insurance on his loan from the bank will you compensate him for that my recommendation if you have n't caught it yet is do not do this your potential savings are not going to be worth the potential of breaking your relationship with your brother   instead look at joining your minds not your money set goals for yourselves individually and hold each other accountable make this an open conversation between yourselves as it can be difficult to talk about finances with other people your support will help the other person and hopefully help keep you on track as well to provide numerical context for potential savings which you appear to still want consider the numbers you 've provided you have 40k debt at 10 your brother has 20k of debt at 5 let 's assume you each can pay up to 20k against the principal of your loans each year finally assume for simplicity that you also have enough to pay off interest as it gets charged so no compounding and you pay in even instalments each year mathematically that means your interest each year is equal to your interest rate your average annual balance if you each go alone then you will accrue 10 on an average balance of = 30k per year which equals 3,000 in interest in year 1 then = 10k .10 = 1,000 interest in year 2 total interest for you = 4,000 your brother will accrue = 10k .05 = 500 in interest in total total interest for both of you combined would be 4,500 if you pool your debt snowball then you will clear your debt first so the interest on your debt would be = 20k .1 = 2,000 your brother 's debt would fully accrue 5 of interest on the full balance in year 1 so interest in year 1 would be 20k .05 = 1,000 in year 2 your brother 's debt would be cleared half way through the year interest charged would be = 10k .05 50 = 250 you would then owe your brother 10k which you would pay him over the remainder of year 2 his total interest paid to the bank would be 1,000 + 250 = 1,250 total interest for both of you combined would be   in a simplified payment example using your numbers maximum interest savings would be about $ 1,250 combined how you allocate those savings would be pretty subjective assuming a 50:50 split this yields $ in savings to each of you if you are n't able to each save 20k per year then savings would be greater for snowballing because otherwise it will take you even longer to pay off your high interest debt this is similar to your brother loaning you 20k today that you can use to pay off your debts after which you pay him back so he can pay off his because you will owe him 20k for 2 years but an average of at any one time because he slowly advances it to you today and you slowly pay him back until the end of year 2 at $ 650 in benefit passed to your brother this is roughly equivalent to him loaning you money at 6.5 interest

your employer sends the money that you choose to contribute plus employer match if any to the administrator of the 401k plan who invests the money as you have directed choosing between the alternatives offered by the administrator typically the alternatives are several different mutual funds with different investment styles e.g. a s&p 500 index fund a bond fund a money market fund etc   now a statement such as i see my 401k is up 10 is meaningless unless you   tell us how you are making the comparison for example if you have just started employment and $ 200 goes into your 401k each month and is invested in a money market fund these are paying close to 0 interest   these days then your 11th contribution increases your   401k from $ 2000 to $ 2200 and your 401k is up 10 more generally suppose for simplicity that all the   401k investment is in just one stock mutual fund and that you own 100 shares of the fund as of right now   suppose also that your next contribution will not occur for three weeks when you get your next paycheck at which time additional shares of the mutual fund will be purchased now the value of the mutual fund shares often referred to as net asset value or nav fluctuates as stock prices rise and fall and so the   401k balance = number of shares times nav changes in accordance with these fluctuations so   if the nav increases by 10 in the next two weeks your 401k balance will have increased by 10   but you still own only 100 shares of the mutual fund you can not use the 10 increase   in value to buy more shares in the mutual fund   because there is no money to pay for the additional shares   you wish to purchase   notice that there is no point selling some of the shares at the 10 higher nav to get cash   because you will be purchasing shares at the higher nav too you could of course sell shares of the stock mutual fund at the higher nav and buy shares of some other fund available to you in the 401k plan   one advantage of doing this inside the 401k plan is that you do n't have to pay taxes now on the 10 gain that you have made on the sale outside tax deferred plans such as 401k and ira plans such gains would be taxable in the year of the sale   but note that selling the shares of the stock fund and buying something else indicates that you believe that the nav of your stock mutual fund is unlikely to increase any further in the near future a third possibility for your 401k being up by 10 is that the mutual fund paid a dividend or made a capital gains distribution in the two week period that we are discussing   the nav falls when such events occur but if you have chosen to reinvest the dividends and capital gains then the number of shares that you own goes up   with the same example as before the nav goes up 10 in two weeks at which time a capital gains distribution occurs and so the nav falls back to where it was before   so before the capital gains distribution you owned 100 shares at $ 10 nav which went up to $ 11 nav 10 increase in nav for a net increase in 401k balance from $ 1000 to $ 1100 the mutual fund distributes capital gains in the amount of $ 1 per share sending the nav back to $ 10 but you take the $ 100 distribution and plow it back into the mutual fund purchasing 10 shares at the new $ 10 nav   so now you own 110 shares at $ 10 nav no net change in price in two weeks but your 401k balance is $ 1100 same as it was before the capital gains distribution and you are up 10   or you could have chosen to invest the distributions into say a bond fund available in your 401k plan and still be up 10 with no change in your stock fund holding but a new investment of $ 100 in a   bond fund so being up 10 can mean different things and does not necessarily mean that the return can be used to buy more shares

you do n't want to do that don't lie to the irs we live overseas as well and have researched this extensively you can not make $ 50k overseas and then say you only made $ 45k to put $ 5k into retirement   i have heard from some accountants and tax attorneys who interpret the law as saying that the irs considers foreign earned income as not being compensation when computing ira contribution limits regardless of whether or not you exclude it publication what is compensation scroll down a little to the what is not compensation section those professionals say that any amounts you can exclude not just ones you actually do exclude then there are others that say the can is not implied so be careful trying to use any foreign earned income to qualify for retirement contributions i have n't ran across anyone yet who has gotten caught doing it and paid the price but that does n't mean they are n't out there an alternative in certain cases there are two things you can do that we have found to have some sort of taxable income that is preferably not foreign so that you can contribute to a retirement account we do this by using capital gains from investments as income since our agi is always zero we pay no short or long term capital gains taxes as long as we keep short term capital gains lower than $ 45k   another way to contribute to a roth ira when you have no income is to do an ira rollover of course you need money in a tax deferred account to do this but this is how it works i always recommend those who have tax deferred ira 's and no agi due to the feie to roll over as much as they can every year to a roth ira that really is tax free money the only tax you 'll pay on that money is sales tax when you spend it =)

you say you have 90 in stocks i 'll assume that you have the other 10 in bonds for the sake of simplicity i 'll assume that your investments in stocks are in nice passive indexed mutual funds and etfs rather than in individual stocks a 90 allocation in stocks is considered aggressive the problem is that if the stock market crashes you may lose 40 or more of your investment in a single year as you point out you are investing for the long term that 's great it means you can rest easy if the stock market crashes safe in the hope that you have many years for it to recover so long as you have the emotional willpower to stick with it would you be better off with a 100 allocation in stocks you 'd think so would n't you after all the stock market as a whole gives better expected returns than the bond market but keep in mind the stock market and the bond market are somewhat negatively correlated that means when the stock market goes down the bond market often goes up and vice versa investing some of your money in bonds will slightly reduce your expected return but will also reduce your standard deviation and your maximum annual loss canadian couch potato has an interesting write up on how to estimate stock and bond returns it 's based on your stocks being invested equally in the canadian u.s. and international markets as you live in the u.s. that likely does n't directly apply to you you probably ignore the canadian stock market but your returns will be fairly similar i 've part of that table here as you can see your expected return is highest with a 100 allocation in stocks with a 20 year window you likely can recover from any crash if you have the stomach for it it 's the allocation with the highest expected return once you get closer to retirement though you have less time to wait for the stock market to recover if you still have 90 or 100 of your investment in stocks and the market crashes by 44 it might well take you more than 6 years to recover canadian couch potato has another article does a 60/40 portfolio still make sense a 60/40 portfolio is a fairly common split for regular investors typically considered not too aggressive not too conservative the article references an ap article that suggests in the current financial climate 60/40 is n't enough even they are n't recommending a or a split though personally i think 60/40 is too conservative however i do n't have the stomach for a split or even a split okay to get back to your question so long as your time horizon is far enough out the expected return is highest with a 100 allocation in stocks be sure that you can tolerate the risk though a 30 or 40 hit to your investments is enough to make anyone investing a portion of your money in bonds slightly lowers your expected return but can reduce your risk as you get closer to retirement and your time horizon you have less time to recover from a stock market crash and do need to be more conservative 6 years is probably too short to keep all your money in stocks is your stated approach reasonable well only you can answer that

that has little or nothing to do with it   workers do n't matter enough to have policies actually crafted against them   rather policies are crafted without a thought towards workers   once the robots get truly cheaper in a total cost of ownership sense workers will be replaced regardless of how well they do or do not themselves to their capital holder masters   working for $ 6 vs $ 14 per hour is just a way to possibly delay the inevitable for a little bit longer   $ 6 per hour in no way changes the inevitable outcome

gt my issue understanding this is i 've been told that banks actually do n't hold 10 of the cash and lend the other 90 but instead hold the full 100 in cash and lend 900 is this accurate   that 's the money multiplier effect being poorly described   you take a loan out but that loan eventually makes its way to other banks as cash deposits which then are loaned out and go to other banks and loaned etc so that the economy is running on 10x cash where 1x is in physical cash and the other is in this deposit loan deposit phenomenon   gt the issue i see with it is that it becomes exponential growth that is   not true if there is $ 1b outstanding physical cash the money supply with a 10 reserve then the maximum amount of money flowing through is $ 1b 10 = $ this assumes everything legally possible is loaned out or saved in the banking system as such it represents a cap    if you have an excel spreadsheet handy you can easily model this out in four columns    label the first row as follows deposit reserve cash reserve loan amount   a2 will be your money supply for simplicity put $ 100    b2 your reserve column will be 10   should be = a2 b2 which will be the cash reserve in the bank   should be a2 which is the new loan amount extended    a3 should be = as the loans extended from the last step become deposits in the next    = b2   now drag the formulas down say 500 rows   if you then sum the deposits column it 'll total $ 1,000 the cash reserve will total   $ 100 and the loan amount will be $ 900 thus there is a cap

it 's not really fair for him to say share buybacks are 4 of gdp because share buybacks do n't directly contribute to gdp presumably if a company has excess cash than what can profitably be reinvested into the business then it should return that cash to the shareholders buybacks then it is up to the shareholders to decide how to reallocate that capital theoretically shareholders will allocate that capital into profitable ventures the assumption being distributing capital to profitable ventures is more efficient than distributing capital to non profitable ventures and the efficient distribution of capital should increase gdp in the long run   if you believe that sort of thing personally i d rather that every employee was paid a respectable wage for their labor not the bare minimum that they 'll accept to avoid starvation but that 's another issue all together so nevermind

you are very young you make a huge amount of money and you have from what information you provide very little debt if you simply want to buy a house for whatever reason sure but be honest with yourself about why you want to buy it i see a lot of people who think they 're doing it for smart financial reasons but then when i ask them about their pension savings and credit card debts and so on there is no evidence that they are actually the kind of person who makes decisions for smart financial reasons if you want a house because that seems like the thing that people do maybe you could think more about what you actually want if your concern is putting your money to work for you you seem to dislike that you pay rent each month and after that month you do n't have anything to show for your money except of course that you did n't spent the last month living on the streets you can do a lot better than getting a mortgage for example living frugally you should be able to dump 50k a year into investments if you did that for a few years you could reasonably expect the return to cover your rent and bills in a surprisingly small number of years a lot less than a 25 year mortgage your question seems to be starting from the position that you should buy a house you 're asking if you should buy it now or wait you are rich enough now and if your earnings keep going up will be even more rich in a few years that you should perhaps question your need to buy a house with your kind of money at this stage of your life you can do a lot better

there is a strategy called merger arbitrage where you buy the stock of the acquired company when it sells for less than the final acquisition price usually the price will rise to about the acquisition price fairly rapidly after the merge is announced so you have to move fast the danger is that the merger gets called off regulatory reasons the acquired company board votes no and you get left holding shares bought at a price higher than the price after the merger collapses this is kind of an advanced strategy and a tough one to back test since each deal is unique

you can execute block trades on the options market and get exercised for shares to create a very large position in energy transfer partners lp without moving the stock market you can then place limit sell orders after selling directly into the market and keep an of low priced shares the technical analysis traders wo n't know what you specifically are doing and will call this resistance if you hit nice even numbers multiples of 5 multiples of 10 with your sell orders you can exacerbate selling as many market participants will have their own stop loss orders at those numbers causing other people to sell at lower and lower prices automatically and simultaneously keep your massive ask in effect if your position is bigger than the demand then you can keep a stock lower the secondary market does n't inherently affect a company in any way but many companies have borrowed against the price of their shares and if you get the share price low enough they can get suddenly margin called and be unable to service their existing debt you will also lose a lot of money doing this so you can also buy puts along the way or attempt to execute a collar to lower your own losses the collar strategy is nice because it is unlikely that other traders and analysts will notice what you are doing since there are calls puts and share orders involved in creating it one person may notice the block trade for the calls initially but nobody will notice it is part of a larger strategy with multiple legs with the share position you may also be able to vote on some things but that solely depends on the conditions of the shares

you should definately have a stop loss in place to manage your risk for a time frame of 5 to 10 years i would be looking at a trailing stop loss of 20 to 25 off the recent high   another type of stop you could use is a volatility stop here the more volatile the stock the larger the stop whilst the less volatile the stock the smaller the stop you could use 3 or 4 x weekly average true range to achieve this the reason you should always use a stop loss is because of what can happen and what did happen in 2008 some stock markets have yet to fully recover from their peaks at the end of 2007 almost 9 years later what would you do if you were planning to hold your positions for 5 years and then withdrawal your funds at the end of june 2021 for a particular purpose and suddenly in february 2021 the market starts to fall by the time june comes the market has fallen by over 50 and you do n't have enough funds available for the purpose you planned for instead if you were using a trailing stop loss you would manage to keep at least 75 of the peak of your portfolio you could even spend 10 minutes each week to monitor your portfolio for warning signs that a downtrend may be around the corner and adjust your trailing stop to maybe 10 in these situations protecting 90 of the peak of your portfolio if the downtrend does not you can adjust your trailing back to a higher percentage if you do get stopped out and shortly after the market recovers then you can always buy back in or look for other stocks and etfs to replace them sure you might lose a bit of profits if this happens but it should always be part of your investment plan and risk management how you will handle these situation if you are not using stop losses risk management and money management you are essentially gambling if you say i am going to buy these stocks and etfs hold them for 10 years and then sell them then you are just hoping to make gains which is essentially gambling

as nathan has correctly noted ach processes transactions in daily batches the reason for that is accounting the money does n't actually change hands for each transaction all the transactions are aggregated and calculated in the batch process and the money only changes hands for the difference consider this if each transaction was to be handled separately each time banks would have to adjust their books to account for the money movement but if we do it in batch we have this the resulting inter bank transfers total for the original 30 transactions 2 transactions between the banks and if you need money to be transferred immediately relatively you can use wire transfer some banks will still aggregate and batch process those but more than once a day they 'll charge you additional fee for their inconvenience

1 yes both of your scenarios would lead to earning $ 10 on the transaction at the strike date if you purchased both of them call it scenario 3 you would make $ 20 2 as to why this transaction may not be possible consider the following the call and put pricing you describe may not be available what you have actually created is called arbitrage 2 identical assets can be bought and sold at different prices leading to a zero risk gain for the investor in the real marketplace if an option to buy asset x in january cost $ 90 would an option to sell asset x in january provide $ 110   without adding additional complexity about the features of asset x or the features of the options buying a call option is the same as selling a put option well when selling a put option you do n't have the ability to choose whether the option is exercised meaning buying options has value that selling options does not but ignore that for a moment that means that you have arranged a marketplace where you would buy a call option for only $ 90 but the seller of that same option would somehow receive $ 110   for added clarity consider the following what if in your example the future price ended up being $ 200 then you could exercise your call option buying a share for $ 90 selling it for $ 200 making $ 110 profit you would not exercise your put option making your total profit $ 110 now consider what if in your example the future price ended up being $ 10 you would buy for $ 10 exercise your put option and sell for $ 110 making a profit of $ 100 you would not exercise your call option making your total profit $ 100 this highlights that if your initial assumptions existed you would earn money at least $ 20 and at most unlimited based on a skyrocketing price compared to your $ 90 put option regardless of the future price therefore such a scenario would not exist in the initial pricing of the options now perhaps there is an initial fee involved with the options where the buyer or seller pays extra money up front regardless of the future price that is a different scenario and gets into the actual nature of options where investors will arrange multiple simultaneous transactions in order to limit risk and retain reward within a certain band of future prices   as pointed out by r this fee would be very significant for a call option which had a price set below the current price typically options are sold out of the money initially which means that at the current share price at the time the option is purchased executing the option would lose you money if you purchase an in the money option the transaction cost initially would by higher than any apparent gain you might have by immediately executing the option for a more realistic options example assume that it costs $ 15 initially to buy either the call option or the put option in that case after buying both options as listed in your scenarios you would earn a profit if the share price exceeded $ 120 the $ 120 sale price less the $ 90 call option = $ 30 which is your total fee initially or dropped below $ 80 the $ 110 put price less the $ 80 purchase price = $ 30 this type of transaction implies that you expect the price to either swing up or swing down but not fall within the band between $ perhaps you might do this if there was an upcoming election or other known event which might be a failure or success and you think the market has not properly accounted for either scenario in advance i will leave further discussion on that topic arranging options of different prices to create specific bands of profitability loss to another answer or other questions which likely already exist on this site or in fact other resources because it gets more complicated after that point and is outside the root of your question

guaranteed annual return sounds too good to be true am i    right are there likely high fees etc you 're right guaranteed annual return is impossible especially when you 're talking about investments for such a long period of time ponzi and madoff their investors using promises of guaranteed return see this note in wikipedia in some cases returns were allegedly determined before the account was even her financial advisor does n't charge by the hour he takes a    commission so there 's obviously some incentive to sell her things    even if she may not need them definitely not a good sign if the advisor gets a commission from the sale then he 's obviously not an advisor but a sales person the problem with this kind of investment is that it is very complex and it is very hard to track the commission to the broker makes it hard to evaluate returns you pay 10 upfront and it takes awhile to just get that money back before even getting any profits and since you 're only able to withdraw in 20 years or so there 's no real way to know if something wrong until you get there and discover that no money also many annuity funds if not all limit withdrawals to a long period i.e. you can not touch money for like 10 years from investment regardless of the tax issues the tax deferred investment can be rolled over to another tax deferred account but in this case you ca n't i suggest you getting your own financial advisor that will work for you to look over the details and talk to your mother if it is really a scam

an llc does not pay taxes on profits as regards tax a llc is treated as a partnership but instead of partners they are called members the llc is a passthrough entity as in partnerships members can have a different percentage ownership to the share of profits the llc reports the share of the profits of the members then the members pay the tax as an individual the profit of the llc is deemed to have been transferred to the members regardless of any funds transferred this is often the case as the llc may need to retain the profits for use in the business late paying customers may mean there is less cash in the llc than is available to distribute   the first answer is wrong only a c corporation files a tax return all other corporate structures are passthrough entities the c corporation pays corporation tax and is not required to pass any funds to the shareholders if the c corporation passes funds to the shareholders this is a dividend and taxable to the shareholder hence double taxation

when discussing buying a home i often hear people say they like having    a mortgage because they get the benefit of writing off the interest i assume this is the united states   you need to also consider that many people can take the standard deduction of about $ 12k for married couples filing jointly so even if they itemize the interest it would only make sense to write it off if you are able to itemize deductions greater than the standard deduction   source so some people will input the mortgage interest and other related deductions into the computer only to find out that their itemized deductions do n't add up where it benefits people sometimes is if they have medical bills which are greater than 10 of their income in addition to the mortgage interest so it benefits them to itemize there are other major sources of but medical bills are very common other common items are auto registration taxes or interest from student loans it is going to be situation dependent but if you are within a few years of paying off the mortgage it would make sense to make micropayments to accelerate the payoff date if you have 30 years to go it would make more sense to generate an emergency fund pay off a car or save up for other things in life than worry about paying off a mortgage take the benefit of deducting the mortgage interest if you can but i imagine that many people would be surprised to hear that it 's not always black and white

there 's no need for an index to have a currency as its purpose is not to act as an asset but rather to signal investors about the performance of a collection of stocks an index can be price weighted meaning that its value equals the arithmetic average of the prices of each stock in the index with no stock splits the return on this index is the same as the return on a portfolio composed of one share of each stock if there is a stock split however instead of dividing by the number of stocks as you normally would when taking the arithmetic average you divide it by the number that will make the value of the index pre stock split arithmetic average equal to the value post stock split then use that dividing number for all periods until a new stock split occurs   an index can be value weighted meaning that its changes in value track the percentage changes in total market capitalization of the stocks in the index price weighted indexes ignore for firm size and percentage changes in price weighted indexes are not robust to stock splits value weighted indexes take firm size into account and are robust to stock splits djia is price weighted s&p 500 is value weighted

a person name matthew or a similar name owes money on their loan and it has gone to collections the collections company is trying to match the account to a real person with money they sent a letter to somebody your grandmother with the same last name the debtor may have even lived in that town at sometime   the reason you received the letter is because your grandmother forward it on because the rest of your info ssn and birth date do n't match the loan it is unlikely they can attach the debt to you unless you provided your address to the company you could in the future receive a letter from them but i doubt they are going to send letters to everybody with the same name i would not worry about it unless they actually send a letter or call you directly

are there any other losses that can be expected beyond the above the lender may have to invest some money into the house in order to get it in shape to sell also while the lender possesses the house they are liable to the property taxes and possibly utilities are there any statutes or pressures to motivate the financial institution to get fair price when the property is sold the lender is motivated to at least break even when selling the property in order to limit losses on their investment this means they are very motivated to seek a higher price but they 're also motivated to sell the property quickly in order to limit their losses due to property taxes usually the lender takes a loss of the investment if foreclosure occurs only 10 percent to 20 percent   of auctioned foreclosed houses did yield a surplus when the lender sells the foreclosed property using a realtor they 're motivated to sell it as quickly as possible so long as they break even in this case there is little motivation to sell the property for a surplus if the property is being sold via auction then time is not a factor and the lender will just sell to the highest bidder

bonds are valued based on all of this using the concept of the time value of money simply stated money now is worth more than money later because of what you can do with money between now and later case in point let 's say the par value of a bond is $ 100 and will mature 10 years from this date these are common terms for most bonds though the u.s. treasury has a variety of bonds with varying par values and maturation periods with a 0 coupon rate nothing 's paid out prior to maturity if the company or government issuing the bonds needs one million dollars and the people buying the bonds are expecting a 5 rate of return on their investment then each bond would only sell for about $ 62 and the bond issuer would have to sell a par value of $ million in bonds to get its $ 1 m now these numbers are based on equations that calculate the future value of an investment made now and conversely the present value of a future return back to that time value of money concept money now that you 're paying to buy the bond is worth more than money later that you 'll get back at maturity so you will expect to be returned more than you invested to account for this time difference the percentage of rate of return is known as the yield or the discount rate depending on what you 're calculating what else you take into consideration when defining the rate like inflation and whom you talk to now that $ m in par value may be hard for the bond issuer to swallow the issuer is effectively paying interest on interest over the lifetime of the bond instead many issuers choose to issue coupon bonds which have a coupon rate determining the amount of a coupon payment this can be equated pretty closely with you making interest only payments on a credit card balance each period in which interest is compounded you pay the amount of interest that has accrued to avoid this compounding effect   from an accounting standpoint the coupon rate lowers the amount of real monies paid the same $ 1 m in bonds maturing in 10 years with a 5 expected rate of return but with a 5 coupon rate now only requires payments totalling $ 1.5 m and that half million in interest is paid $ 50k at a time annually or $ 25k semi annually but from a finance standpoint because the payments made in the first few years are worth more than the payments made closer to and at maturity the present value of all these coupon payments plus the maturity payout is higher than if the full payout happened at maturity and so the future value of the total investment is higher   coupon rates on bonds thus allow a bond issuer to plan a bond package in less complicated terms if you as a small business need $ 1 m for a project which you will repay in 10 years and during that time you are willing to tolerate a 5 interest rate on the outstanding money then that 's exactly how you issue the bonds $ 1 million worth to mature in 10 years and a 5 coupon rate now whether the market is willing to accept that rate is up to the market right now they 'd be over the moon with that rate and would be willing to buy the bonds for more than their face value because the present value would then match the yield they 're willing to accept as in any market system you as the seller will sell to the highest bidder to get the best price available if however they think you are a bad bet they 'll want an even higher rate of return and so the present value of all coupon and maturity payments will be less than the par value and so will the purchase price

yes your business needs to be in the business of making money in order for you to deduct the expenses associated with it i suppose in theory this could mean that if you take in $ 10,000 and spend $ 30,000 every year you not only do n't get a net deduction of $ 20,000 your loss but you have to pay tax on $ 10,000 your revenue however this is super just only deduct $ of your expenses small profit for all the gory details including how they consider whether you have an expectation of profits see this expectation of profit rule appears to apply to things like i sell home items or home decorating advice and therefore need to take several multi week trips to exotic vacation destinations every year and deduct them as business expenses if you 're doing or in your home and selling on etsy you do n't particularly have any expenses it 's hard to imagine a scenario where you consistently sell for less than the cost of materials and then end up dinged on paying tax on revenue

living in one unit of a multi family while renting out the others although not without its risks can be a viable if gradual way to build wealth it 's been recently as house hacking but the underlying mechanics have been around for many years many cities in the northeast in particular remain full of neighborhoods of homes built and used for exactly that purpose for decades though now frequently sub divided into condos   it 's true you 'd need to borrow money but there are a number of reasons why it 's certainly at least worth exploring which is what you seem to be asking should you bother doing the homework tl;dr yes and yes you would be relying on tenants to meet your monthly expenses including a mortgage bill that will arrive whether the other units are vacant or not but in most markets rental prices are far less volatile than home prices from the san francisco federal reserve the main result from this is that the behavior of the    price rent ratio for housing mirrors that of the price dividend ratio    for stocks the majority of the movement of the price rent ratio comes    from future returns not rental growth rates emphasis added it 's also important to remember that rental income must do more than just cover your mortgage there 's lots of other expenses associated with a rental property including insurance taxes maintenance vacancy an allowance for the periods when the property will be empty in between tenants reserves for capital improvements and more as with any investment it 's all about whether the numbers work you mentioned not being interested in the upkeep work so that 's another 8 10 off the top to pay for a property manager if you can find a property at an attractive price secure financing on attractive terms and can be reasonably confident that it will rent in the ballpark of 1.5 2 of the purchase price then it might be a fine choice for you assuming you are willing and able to handle the work of being a landlord something worth at least as much of your research time as the investment itself   it sounds like you 're still a ways away from having enough for even an fha down payment which gives you a great opportunity to find and talk with some local folks who already manage rental properties in your area for example you might look for a local chapter of the national real estate investment association to get a sense of what 's really involved

that number may be based on a long term historical view of the stock market   if you look at some long term charts for the dow   or the s&p500 you 'll see that overall the upward trend is pretty good   however there are some pretty huge flat spots in those charts and if the majority of your have been made during one of those periods you may not have seen a lot of growth if you look at periods between 10 17 years or so you can find places where it would have really sucked to be you look at the s&p chart and imagine 66 to 83 ouch and places where things were stellar    if you expand to about say 30 years or so then it 's hard to find a period without at least some good growth in there somewhere   if you panicked during a downturn and sold on the low things of course get much worse   how your own portfolio has done will depend a lot on how the funds you chose have done how much you put into equity vs fixed income and if the fixed income was in actual bonds or a bond fund    bond funds are subject to a lot more as interest rates rise or fall than something like a t bill or i bond that you own outright and plan to hold to maturity

why do banks charge a significantly lesser rate for a 15 yr fixed mortgage than a 30yr though they know it will not earn them the same amount of money   a simplistic model of where banks get the money to lend to borrowers is that they borrow money from investors that want to earn a return on the money that they provide   the actual mechanics of that process are much more complicated but the gist is that if those investors want to tie their money up for a longer period they expect to get a higher return thus 30-year mortgages require a higher interest rate than 15-year mortgages   in addition the usual consensus in the market is that interest rates will rise in the future so interest rates for longer term loans are higher   while it 's true that the bank gets more money overall from a higher rate mortgage the fact that that additional money does n't come until several years into the loan and that money loses value over time due to inflation makes a lower rate 15 year mortgage roughly equivalent to a higher rate 30-year mortgage

have you been rejected from a rental for a specific reason leading to this question   landlords are in the business of exchanging space for regular payments with no drama   anything they ask in an application should be something to minimize the risk of drama    the happy path optimistic goal is that you pay your rent by the due date every month   if your income is not sufficient for this demonstrating you have assets and would be able to pay for the full term of the lease is part of the decision to enter into the lease with you    in the non happy path say you fall off the face of the earth before ending the lease   the landlord could be owed several months of rent and could pursue a legal judgment on your assets   with a court order they can make the bank pay out what is owed having bank information reduces the landlord 's cost and research efforts in the event the story has to this point in the jargon of landlording this means the tenant is collectable   while of course you could have zeroed out your accounts or moved money to a bank you did n't tell the landlord in the meantime if you are not the bad actor in this story you probably would n't have    if you get any kind of sense about a landlord or property at all there is probably a better rental situation in your city   you also want to minimize drama   if the landlord is operating like a business they 're not in this to perform identity theft   if the landlord is sloppy or has sloppy office workers that would be different    in the event sharing your asset information truly bothers you and the money is for rental expense anyway you could offer to negotiate a 1 year prepaid rental of course knock another off for time value of money and lower risk to landlord if you 're sure you would n't want to leave early

if you are the only owner then morally there is nothing wrong with this as long as you make sure that everything is tracked so that you pay the proper taxes from the correct entity the danger for you and your business is if the transfers are n't planned because you may not be re investing enough of the profits back into the company that means that the equipment may be aging but you are n't replacing it it can also mean that you are n't spending enough on business development   if you pay yourself so much that you bankrupt the company that is n't good if you live the good life but starve the employees and they realize it or if you starve the business and the employees realize it then you might have a problem motivating and retaining employees

we can not know if you owe them anything but at the least i would expect that they do n't just say you owe us but we found out that we were supposed to pay you $ x but we paid you $ y which is more and then we can go from there   there are things like we should have paid you $ per hour for the last year but we paid you $ 12.50 per hour where you can tell them that by paying you that rate you assumed it was correct one you would n't have worked for less so they effectively gave you a raise on the other hand if they say you worked here for 38 hours a week but we paid you for 40 hours a week and you did indeed work only 38 hours then most likely they are correct

running for profit business does n't pressure those involved to make the best product it pressures them to make the best profit   making the best profit pressures those involved to produce the cheapest product that the market wo n't reject marked at the highest price the market wo n't reject   private companies have the freedom to avoid or limit the effect of that pressure if they choose and sacrifice some profit for quality and improved customer satisfaction though many still choose profit   public companies who are eventually to shareholders who sole goal is profitability are much less likely to avoid the pressures to increase profits at all costs   particularly in the age of day traders and ceo merry go round long term planning is very difficult when short term profitability is on the line   a company that made one widget a year for $ 1 and sold that widget for $ 10 billion would be a very successful company from the profit standpoint and would likely have an excellent share price if the business model looked secure for the next year or two   competition helps alleviate this and pushes for better products and lower prices by upping the bar of what the market will reject over time increase the available alternatives and the features quality price scale shifts   the importance of having a level playing field anti monopoly laws and ensure that new players can come onto the scene is fundamental to capitalism working otherwise those who hold monopoly positions will prevent competition from emerging and charge as much as is possible for the cheapest product people will still buy   this is of particular issue when not buying the product is a threat to one 's life or safety medical care emergency services food etc

agreed it 'll be faster   let 's do a little math   tesla is trying to hit 500k units in 2018   they want 1 m in 2020   if tesla can do 1 m in 2020 how many evs can all other western auto manufacturers build in 2020 gm + nissan + vw + + etc   i 'd take a swing at 2 3 m   what about chinese auto manufacturers   probably 3 m more since evs are a focus there   so if you count that up it 's 7 8 m evs in 2020 which is 10 of worldwide new car sales   this can all be accomplished in the $ market   this also provides the volume to drive down battery and electronics costs to hit $ 30k and then $ 25k price points later in the 2020 's   so if we 're at 10 by 2020 i 'd be shocked if we did n't have 50 75 evs of new car sales by 2030   20 50 growth over 10 years adds up quickly   the oil price crash of 2014 was caused by a 2 imbalance between supply and demand   so this predicts crashes in the price of oil and oil company stocks in the early 2020 's   there 's likely also political unrest in oil producing countries as their economies start having revenue shortfalls   given the of evs to demand response i 'd think we 'd just keep building intermittent renewables   when the wind blows and sun evs charge and turn off otherwise   this will increase electricity demand but put pressure on expensive and dirty coal and natural gas   all of this drives down the cost of electric driving and co2 emissions

this falls under value investing and value investing has only recently picked up study by academia say at the turn of the therefore there is n't much rigorous on value investing in academia but it has started however we can describe valuations in short valuations are randomly distributed in a log variance gamma fashion with some reason nonsense mixed in you can check for yourself on   you can basically download the entire us market and then some with many financial and technical characteristics all in one spreadsheet re fisher he was tied for the best monetary economist of the 20th century and created the best price index but as for stocks he said this famous quote 12 days before the 1929 crash stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau i do not feel there will be soon if ever a 50 or 60 point break from present levels such as bears have predicted i expect to see the stock market a good deal higher within a few months    irving fisher ph.d. in economics oct. 17 1929 edit value investing has almost always been ignored by academia   irving fisher and other proponents of it before it was codified by graham in the mid 20th century certainly did n't help with comments like the above   it was almost always believed that it was a sucker 's game the bigger sucker game to be more precise because value investors get destroyed during recession collapses   so even though a economy would allow value investors and everyone never to suffer collapses value investors are looked down upon by academia because of the inevitable yet nearly always collapse   this expresses that sentiment perfectly it did n't help that benjamin graham did n't care about money so never reached the heights of buffett who frequently with bill gates as the richest person on the planet   buffett has given much credibility and academia finally caught on around in 2000 or so after he was proven right about a pending tech collapse that nearly no one believed would happen at least that 's where i begin seeing papers being published into value concepts   if one looks harder academia 's even taken the torch and discovered some very useful tools yes investment firms and fellow value investors kept up the information publishing but they are not academics the days of professors throwing darts at the stock listings and beating active managers despite most active managers losing to the market anyways really held back this side of academia until buffett entered the and embarrassed them all with his club 's performance in the article which is still relatively ignored   before that it was the obsession with beta the ratio of a security 's variance to its covariance to the market a now abandoned theory because it has been utterly discredited the of beta have embraced the p b not giving the satisfaction to buffet by the p e.    tiny technology firms receive ridiculous valuations because a long surviving tiny tech firm usually does n't stay small for long thus will grow at huge rates   this is why any solvent and many insolvent tech firms receive large valuations risk adjusted they should pay out huge on average   still most fall by the dead and those 100 p s valuations quickly crumble valuations are influenced by growth   one can see this expressed more easily with a growing perpetuity where p is price i is income r is the rate of return and g is the growth rate of i.   rearranging r looks like here one can see that a higher p relative to i will dull the expected rate of return while a higher g will boost it it 's fun for us value investor traders to say that the market is totally inefficient   that 's a stretch   it 's not perfectly inefficient but it 's efficient   valuations are clustered very tightly around the median but there are mistakes that even us little guys can exploit and teach the smart money a lesson or two if one were to look at a distribution of rs see that they 're even more tightly packed   so while it looks like p es are all over the place industry to industry rs are much more well clustered tech finance and frequently have higher growth rates so higher p es yet average rs   utilities and non have lower growth rates so lower p es yet average rs

no it wo n't go on the front page because it uses bullshit math and reveals a deep lack of understanding of how the numbers are calculated the unemployment rate is calculated from the current population survey as well as the participation rate to add to the unemployment rate of one month survey by calculating the participation rate from a different month survey is very problematic   if you are looking to include those who have stopped looking for a job because of poor job prospects you could try using the unemployment estimate the number includes those who have recently stopped looking for a job it only goes back a year for the respondents but at least it is comparable because it is in the same month survey   the author also states that the u6 unemployment estimate should be 20 without explaining why it can be calculated like that i do n't think the participation rate can be used to suggest that the u6 is higher than it is when the u6 already takes into account a large percent of those that have stopped looking for economic reasons

yes this is definitely possible you can optimize your credit worthiness within 18 months you would first start with a secured credit card just to establish a little bit of credit history and then use that as a jumping point 6 months later to do several unsecured credit card applications as a student your primary limiting factor will be your truthful income when you apply for the cards resulting in low limits where using less than 30 of those limits is not a useful amount of money your credit scores can be looked at as a spendable balance new inquiries spend some of that balance low utilization earns you more of the balance they will trend upwards with the right approach and you can use the balance at their highs to time more inquiries note my answers typically differ in that i narrowly tailor my answers to the question asked and do n't or acknowledge the idea of advice impulsive spenders with credit have bad credit i can live with that

i would say a lot of the answers here are n't quite right the main issue here is that banking is a highly industry there are few key players the uk for example has only 5 major banks operating under a variety of brands it 's all the same companies underneath and the market is very very hard to enter owing to the immense regulatory burden because the landscape is so narrow and it 's possible to keep close tabs on all   your competitors there 's no incentive to spend money on shiny new things to keep up with the competition the industry is purely reactive   if nobody else has an awesome feature filled online portal there 's no need for any one bank to make one   if everybody is reactive and nobody proactive then it 's a short logical deduction that improvements happen at a pace also take into account that when you 've got this toxic bare minimum form of competition the question for these people soon turns to what can we get away with which results in things like subpar online portals with as much information as you like delivered on paper for a hefty charge and price fixed administrative fees   furthermore your transaction history is super valuable information   there are one or two highly profitable companies who international transaction data and whose sole job in life is to restrict access to that information to the highest bidders   your transaction history is an asset in a multibillion dollar per year industry and as such it is not surprising that banks do n't want to give it out for free

no problem and more than happy to help    both posting locations i 've indicated for you to browse and apply any helpful info and to answer your question in your post i think the federal trade commission would address any regulatory concerns as internet does not seem to fall under the fcc for communications but likely the ftc regarding advertising    i do n't think you will have many obstacles but in addition to the ftc link below maybe check out privacy policies and legal links on other job sites for reference    also posting your question in r etc may get you good free feedback from legal redditors hope this helps and best of luck

under the assumption you 're not looking for a particular credit union bank since that 'll make this question off topic you can apply for a secure credit card that 's where you essentially put up a sum of money as collateral that would be the safe way for someone with little or no credit history and wants to build credit any big bank wells fargo chase etc should be able to do that for you you can also do that online provided you have the means to transfer money into the account

not better companies they pick the largest market cap companies which is n't guaranteed to be the best if they were so much better than there would be a much bigger difference between the s&amp;p 500 and the vanguard total stock market fund      but as you can see above there is barely any difference in the gains between s&amp;p and the total stock market fund

over my lifetime over sixty now i found that having both options and blue collar available always meant i could get work by the age of twenty one i had two paths available by the age of forty five i had four the key is to not lock yourself into one path and always be learning something new which means having an awareness of your society and its technology and be interested in it the sad truth is that most people just are n't intelligent enough to be able to so this and that is not a bad thing we 're not all the same and so ca n't be held to the same measuring stick

at the very least you should invest as much as you can that your employer will match as they are basically giving you free money for saving after that i would prioritize a roth ira as that offers similar tax benefits with more liquidity provided you have enough money available in your emergency fund and have plenty for everyday expenses i see no reason not to max out your 401k after that if you can afford it however if your emergency fund is lacking be sure to put some there other investments like a 529 may come into play if you have kids you plan on sending to college but it all depends on your situation

what you describe there is the textbook definition of a proxy fight buy a 5 10 stake we 're talking $ billion here for major money center banks work with other shareholders try to replace the directors change business practices etc it 's a strategy that works   in many cases but the sheer amount of stock you 'd have to buy to effect a traditional proxy fight makes this strategy neither probable nor plausible like i said the only believable way to do this is a proxy fight via the press buy a small number of shares table resolutions at the annual meetings and leverage those resolutions with the press

the largest problem and source of anxiety ruin for homeowners during the housing market collapse was caused by the inability to refinance many people had bought homes which they were stretched to afford by using variable rate mortgages   these would typically offer a very attractive initial rate with an annual cap on the potential increase of rate   many of these people intended to refinance their variable rate to a fixed rate once terms were more favorable   if their house wo n't appraise for the value needed to obtain a new loan they are stuck in their current contract with potentially unfavorable rates in the later years above prime was not unheard of also many people especially those in areas of high inflation in the housing market used a financial device known as a balloon mortgage which essentially forced you to get a new loan after some number of years 2 5 10 when the entire note became due   some of those loans offered payments less than principal + interest so say you move near los angeles and ca n't afford the $ 1.2 m for the ranch in which you wish to live   you might work out a deal with your mortgage broker banker in which you agree contractually to only pay $ 500/month with a balloon payment of $ 1.4 m due in 5 years which seemed like a good deal since you and everyone else actually expect the house to be worth $ 1.5 m in 5 years this type of thing was done all the time back in the day   now imagine the housing bubble bursts and your $ 1.2 m home is suddenly only valued at perhaps $ 750k   you still owe $ 1.4 m sometime in the next several years maybe very soon depending on timing and can only get approved financing for the current $ 750k value so you 're basically anticipating becoming homeless and bankrupt within the same year that is a source of much anxiety about being upside down on a loan see this question for an unfortunate example

may i suggest putting it in a roth ira $ 5,500 per year   right now you can contribute to both 2015 and 2016 so that 's $ 11k.   based on your description it sounds like your tax rate is very low so it is awesome to put it away now and avoid taxes later on any gains you make on it   you can use roth ira money to pay for college a home or retirement within your roth ira any of the investment options mentioned here will work for example cd 's or money market accounts if you just want it to grow in a pretty much savings account like manner   you could also buy diversified mutual funds or have some fun buying individual stocks with some of it i 'm sorry to say that in the current market conditions you are not going to find a completely safe cash like investment or account that makes your money grow substantially   to do that you have to bear risk by buying risky stuff like stocks

that does n't make it the perfect medium for theft the system makes it okay to make non controversial items because its not like someone is going to put in the effort to track you for that    yet if you are buying something illicit a large part of the blockchain can already be analyzed to see where stuff is coming from and they can start work from there    for example let 's say you buy off local bitcoin well even if the fbi does n't know your address or who it belongs to they monitor the site and know that the funds came from a certain account they know this because that certain someone bought coins from a regulated company    its not the perfect medium for theft at all do you actually research bitcoin or are you just looking for any reason not to like it its really much more complex grand than most make it out to be

have you tried complaining to the real estate institute in your state and if that does n't work try taking them to fair trading i know from doing some work for real estates that getting money from them is like getting blood from a stone but you just need to keep bugging them talk to the manager or director and tell them you have been waiting too long for your money give them a deadline not more than 3 business days and tell them if you have not received the money by then you will make a complaint to the real estate institute and take them to fair trading sometimes you have to go to the person who runs the business as the workers usually do n't care especially when it is extra work for them and they get no reward for doing it plus the longer the real estate do n't pay you the longer they earn interest on your money

to answer your question as far as what 's available in addition to your 401(k at work most financial types will say to contribute up to the match first you may qualify for a roth ira qualification is based on income if not then you may have to go with a traditional ira   you and your husband can each have one and contribute up to the limit each year   after that you could get just a straight up mutual fund and/or contribute up to limit on your 401(k my two cents this may sound counter intuitive and i 'm sure some folks will disagree but instead of contributing to your 401(k now take whatever that amount is and use it to pay extra on the car loan   also take the extra being paid on the mortgage and pay it on the car loan too   once the car loan is paid off then set aside 15 of your gross income and use that amount to start your retirement investing    any additional money beyond this can then go into the mortgage   once it 's paid off then you can take the extra you were paying plus the mortgage and invest that amount into mutual funds you may want to check out chris 's retire inspired book or podcast as well

good post just to note to self to add my comments this weekend   a couple thoughts that came to mind sorry was working on an idea this weekend   when comparing companies reviewing accounting policies in detail for any substantive differences a notable example would be telecom companies who expense wireless subsidies vs. capitalizing them obviously makes a large difference in a ebitda based i always approach a company from a perspective hidden assets or otherwise many businesses have various segments which if they can be reliably broken off provide good insight into underlying op performance if appropriate i.e. will never be reinvested tax adjusting cash balances that are offshore cyclical industries always compare on a mid cycle basis dynamic schedules i.e. at various prices for instruments and proceeds thereof for most large caps this is not relevant but for certain industries it is much more popular e.g. resource tech

generally bank transfers are not in themselves liable for tax however making profit generally is taxed either as income capital gains or some combination of the two it seems that in the uk cryptocurrencies are being treated like other currencies for tax purposes and that trading profits losses may count as either income or capital gains depending on the circumstances however i do not know how to unravel whether particular trading activity would count as income or capital gains i would suggest gathering as much information as possible and then discussing this with an accountant

my recommendation would be to pay off your student loan debt as soon as possible you mention that the difference between your student loan and the historical long term return on the stock market is one half percent   the problem is the 7 return that you are counting on from the stock market is not guaranteed   you might get 7 over the next few years but you also might do much worse   the 6.4 interest that you will save by aggressively paying off your debt is guaranteed you are concerned about the opportunity cost of paying your debt early   however this cost is only temporary   by drawing out your debt payments you have a long term opportunity cost   by this i mean that 4 years from now you could still have 6 years of debt payments hanging over your head or you could be debt free with all of your income available to save spend or invest as you see fit in my opinion debt just to try to come out 0.5 ahead is not worth the hassle or risk
