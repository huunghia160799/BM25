the globe and mail has an interesting article on what you can do with your rrsps be aware that the article is from early 2011 and rules change they describe holding your own mortgage inside your rrsp that is if you have $ 100,000 inside your rrsp already and your remaining mortgage is $ 100,000 you can use that money to pay off your mortgage then pay back the money at interest generating a tax deferred profit inside your rrsp that approach may be viable though you 'd want to talk to your accountant first i 'd be very cautious about loaning money to someone else for a second mortgage using my rrsp though second mortgages are inherently risky so this is a very speculative investment once you make an rrsp contribution that space is used up barring a couple of exceptions such as the life long learning plan so let 's say you used $ 100,000 of your rrsp to loan to someone for a second mortgage any interest payments should be sheltered inside the rrsp substantial benefit but if the person defaults on the second mortgage which you should expect to be a significant possibility you 've lost your entire $ 100,000 contribution room as well as obviously the $ 100,000 that you loaned out i ca n't tell you whether or not it makes sense to invest in risky second mortgage loans and i ca n't tell you whether if you choose to do so it definitely should be done inside an rrsp there are substantial risks in the loan and there are both costs and benefits to doing so inside an rrsp hopefully though i 've helped you understand the questions you should be asking yourself

i worked for a major shoe retailer 's e commerce division   our return rate on shoes was nearly 70 shoe manufacturers do not size consistently at almost any price point customers had no idea what their size was and would often order a size up and a size down 3 pairs of shoes and return all three   they were unable to measure their feet because there are really no standard measurements for feet   we thought about a 3d scanner from feet but customers would have to come into the store for that then we 'd have to scan every shoe   shoes can be high margin but they are extremely expensive to sell online there really is no silver bullet here foot locker has nice stores and a great selection they are cash positive and ebitda profitable   if amzn cuts into any body 's shoe business my guess would be walmart target or    imo the biggest threat to is just general death of the mall but whatever model replaces malls could just as well have a fl    i think the market has dramatically this is n't sears it 's a profitable business that 's missed earnings a couple quarters i bought in and i am long

the bottom line is that you are doing the right thing now   correcting your past   get those collections taken care of then start saving for a down payment   of course during this time you should pay your bills early or on time during that time your credit will improve dramatically i bet that this will not be an issue once you have your down payment saved so the point is moot    however with outstanding collections it is very unlikely you will get a loan   in my own case i had to pay a collection that i did not owe in order to obtain a mortgage   it was for a small amount and the loan officer told me that it is the cost of doing business   ship $ 150 and my loan when through free and clear

you have 3 assumptions about the use of credit cards for all your purchases 1 may be a moot point at current interest rates that will not make much of a difference if somebody links their card to a checking account that does n't pay any interest there will be no additional interest earned if the rate on their account is < 1 they may make a couple of dollars a month 2 make sure that the card delivers on the benefits you expect do n't select a card with an annual fee cash is better than miles for most people also make sure the best earnings are n't from only shopping at one gas station or one store you might not make as much as you expect especially if the gas station is generally the most expensive in the area sometimes the maximum cash back is only for a limited time or only after you have charged thousands of dollars that year 3 it can have a positive impact on your credit rating i have also found that the use of the credit card does minimize the chances of accidentally overdrawing the linked account there is only one big scheduled withdraw a month instead of dozens of ones there is some evidence that by the drop in balance from the purchase people spend more they say i am getting x% back but then are shocked when they see the monthly bill

they used to pay over 90 during the glorious 30s 1940 1970 all of this is about the capture of politicians by the rich both democrats and republicans and the balance of power between labor and capital which has tilted on favor of capital as warren buffet said there is a class war and we are winning it with the free movement if capital it 's super easy for the super rich to get their money out of a country   now regarding of taxes and their level if you posit that taxes take away your hard earned work then both 10 and 90 are unacceptable it 's like a thief arguing he only stole 10 of a bank how is it more or less acceptable    of course i do n't subscribe to this logic at all i just want to point out that either any level of taxation is fair regardless of the level or unfair there are n't any in    to finish i would use market mechanisms to set taxation taxes on the super rich should be gradually increased until there is a noticeable effect on productive investment

typically the least formal agreement for any type of lending is a note of which you can find plenty across the web although i 'd suggest picking up a nolo book from the library and using their templates i think the book holding your type of form would be the personal legal forms book still $ 10k is a very large amount of money to lend to a friend and he probably is better off going to a bank and asking for an unsecured line of credit not a credit card but rather a general loan and doing the money that way because typically that amount of money is small to the bank and they will already have the licenses assets in place to handle collateral and such which can be very tricky to do on your own

looks like it is a 20 penalty on the withdrawal along with income tax   funds can be withdrawn for any reason but withdrawals that are not for documented qualified medical expenses are subject to income taxes and a 20 penalty the 20 tax penalty is waived for persons who have reached the age of 65 or have become disabled at the time of the withdrawal then only income tax is paid on the withdrawal   wikipedia hsa article even though you are leaving the country you still earned and contributed to the plan while you were working living so it is still subject to the taxes laws in place on a somewhat related note check out this question here as it may help you out a bit similar but not really duplicate how do i withdraw all money from my hsa account as a non resident

because a wire transfer requires the individual bank to bank process it is usually more expensive than an automated clearing house which requires minimal involvement by individuals at financial institutions many ach transactions come with only a small fee or even no fee at all since they are run with more efficiency however if you want a better guarantee that your money will arrive on time it might be worth it to pay the wire transfer fee with both cases it is possible for errors to be made however since you often get to review the information before it is sent with a wire transfer the method is a little more secure also because identities are verified with wire transfers that take place between bank accounts there is less chance of fraud wire transfers that take place between financial institutions are generally considered quite secure from

good question i know you can keep the isa in the uk and it wo n't lose its tax free status but you 're not able to contribute it while you 're not a uk resident not that its tax free status buys you that much if you 're a non resident as you could apply to receive tax gross on pretty much any savings account anyway given that the idea of tax free saving outside a retirement account does n't really exist here in the us i would assume that you will have to declare the interest as income and if you do n't pay any other taxes in the uk that would cover the amount you 'd have to pay on your isa under the foreign tax credit you 'd end up giving the irs their pound of flesh as i mentioned in an answer to a previous question you really need to talk to an us accountant cpa preferably one that is familiar with uk taxation law as well

it sounds like the postage amount was paid to you rather than returned   if it had been returned and the payment originated on the card they would have to return it to the card   if it was processed as a payment it looks like someone is giving you money   paypal ca n't credit it to the card as the sender could request a refund   if paypal put the money on the card against a previous payment then they would n't be able to refund    if they add money to your bank account then they can withdraw it if a refund is required    one reason that you might get a payment is if you were being reimbursed for spending money outside of paypal   if the amount is more than you originally paid they ca n't put it on your card   they can only refund to the card   they ca n't deposit to it    if you do n't want to give them your bank account information you can just wait until the next time you use paypal and use your balance to pay   then you can bill the remainder to your credit card    if you do n't normally use paypal and just want your money back you can process a chargeback through your credit card   note that this would probably annoy paypal as it costs them and potentially money   to do this you must have paid the postage with your credit card originally   if you spent money outside paypal and were reimbursed through paypal then there 's nothing to chargeback   in that circumstance you 'd have to accept one of their options   pay with balance or deposit to bank account

there is no distribution limit only a contribution limit   you can empty your hsa completely without tax or penalty as long as the expenses are used for eligible medical expenses in addition you can reimburse yourself in the future for expenses that you have now as long as you have an hsa account in place   for example you said that your dental bill was $ 3500 and you only had $ 3300 in your hsa so you emptied your hsa and paid the rest from your checking account   when you do get more money in the hsa even if it is n't until next year you can reimburse yourself for the $ 200 that you had to pay out of pocket on your dental bill   and if you do n't have enough money in your hsa this year to cover all of your birth expenses congrats by the way you can reimburse yourself in a future year just make sure you keep good records on what the distributions were used for in case you get audited

you 're potentially in very deep water here you do n't know who this person is that you 're dealing with   before you 'd even met him he just gave you his banking info seemingly without a second thought    you have no idea what the sources of his money are so what happens if the money is stolen or otherwise illegal   if it is determined that you used any of that money you 'll be on the hook to return it at the very least   who knows what the legal ramifications are either so it sounds like you began spending his money before you had any kind of written agreement in place   does n't that seem odd to you to have someone just so trusting as to not even ask for that was the source of the email about the $ 2500 from paypal or from him or his advisor   paypal always sends you a notice directly when funds are received into your account and even if they were going to put a temporary hold on them for whatever reason sometimes they do that it would still show up in your account i would highly can i be more advise you not to go anywhere near his bank account until or unless you can absolutely verify who he is where his money comes from and what the situation is if you start dipping into his account whether you think you 're somehow entitled to the money or not he could cry foul and have you arrested for theft this is a very odd situation and for someone who says he 's normally cautious and skeptical you sure let your guard down here when you started spending his money without making any serious effort to confirm his bona just because he passes himself off as smart and the doctor type does n't mean squat   the very best scammers can do that ever see the movie catch me if you can based on a true story so you have no basis for knowing he 's anything at all i am thoroughly confused as to why you 'd just willfully start using his money without knowing anything about him   that 's deeply because you 've opened yourself up to a world of potential criminal and civil liability if this situation goes south if this guy was giving you money as an investment in your business and you instead used some of that money for your own personal expenses then you could land in very serious trouble for co mingling of funds   even if he told you it was okay it does n't sound like there 's anything in writing so he could just as easily deny giving you permission to use the money that way and have you charged with embezzlement you need to step back take a deep breath stop using his money and contact a lawyer for advice   every attorney will give you a free consultation and you need to protect yourself here be careful my friend   if this makes you suspicious then you need to listen to that voice in your head and find a way to get out of this situation

the goal is to understand the movements of the market as a whole and understand the fortunes of every investor in the   as for why it is n't price weighted it is because price is a arbitrary notion whereas market cap is at least real in some sense   imagine berkshire hathaway vs apple in the s&amp;p apple takes up about 75 more of the index because it 's market cap is compared to for berkshire this makes intuitive sense apple is worth 75 more so it takes up that much more of the index   now lets look at price in a price weighted index of only those two stocks apple with a stock price of would take up .06 compared to berkshire hathaway at due to its stock price the only difference is apple has way more shares outstanding nothing of economic value other than a bit of liquidity is captured in a price weighted index

paying the minimum balance on a loan can be devastating and is highly un recommended it is important you understand your loan and the terms associated with it loans are given for a period of time but if you pay the minimum it does not mean you will pay it all off by the end when paying a loan money is applied to the interest first and any extra amount is then applied to the principle here 's an example if i have a $ 12 loan for 1 year the interest is 100 my minimum payment each month is $ 1 if i pay that minimum only i will be stuck paying $ 12 at the end of the loan why you ask because each month i 'm being charged $ 1 interest and the payment i am making is only going towards that interest however if i paid $ 2 instead now $ 1 goes to the principal the original $ 12 i borrowed this means that next month i will only be charged interest on $ 11 dollars instead of $ 12 you need to know how much is going towards the interest of your loan and how much is going towards the principle you can speak with your bank about this and they will help you understand in many cases they actually provide you with the numbers on your with examples of how long it would take to payoff your loan with minimum only and how long it would take if you added an extra x amount each month i recommend using the snowball method to pay of your debt it 's simple and effective how much you should add to each monthly payment depends on how much you can afford to add here are some calculators you can play around with cnn money bank rate calc edit so with the additional information you provided we can estimate that you have about 2200 free cash flow each 's your cash after you pay all your bills we can put away 500 each month for a rainy day fund just to be loss accidents or anything we ca n't predict so assuming that is all your expenses including the money you spend on entertainment that leaves you with $ 1700 you can add on to your loan payments so you can pay off your third loan in 1 month then add the remaining balance to the 2nd loan with this income it should take you less then a year to pay off all your loans

's answer has a very good discussion of the types of pe ratio so i will just answer a very specific question from within your question and who makes these estimates is it the market commentators or the company saying we 'd expected to make this much future earnings estimates are made by professional analysts and analytical teams in the market based on a number of factors if these analysts are within an investment company the investment company will use a frequently updated value of this estimate as the basis for their pe ratio some of these numbers for large or liquid firms may essentially be generated every time they want to look at the pe ratio possibly many times a day in my experience they take little notice of what the company says they expect to make as those are numbers that the board wants the market to see instead analysts use a mixture of economic data and forecasting surveys of sentiment towards the company and its industry and various related current events to build up an ongoing model of the company 's finances how sophisticated the model is is dependent upon how big the analytics team is and how much time resource they can devote to the company for bigger firms with good investor relations teams and high liquidity or small fast growing firms this can be a huge undertaking as they can see large rewards in putting the extra work in the   at least one analytics team at a large investment bank that i worked closely with even went as far as sending analysts out onto the streets some days to get a feeling for some companies and industries growth potential each analytics team or analyst only seems to make public its estimates a few times a year in spite of their being calculated internally as an ongoing process the reason why they do this is simple this analysis is worth a lot to their trading teams asset managers and paying clients than the pr of releasing the data although these projections are good at time of release   their value diminishes as time goes on particularly if the firm launches new initiatives etc this is why weighting analyst forecasts based on this time variable makes for a better average most private individual investors use an average or time weighted average on time since release of these analyst estimates as the basis for their forward pe

whether it 's wise or not depends on what you think and what you should consider are the risks both ways what are the risks for let 's say that the company produces great value and its current price and initial price are well below what it 's worth   by investing some of your money in the company you can take advantage of this value and capitalize off of it if the market recognizes this value too or when the market does if it 's a successful company it will be a matter of when other reasons to be for it are that the tech industry is considered a solid industry and a lot of money is flowing into it   therefore if this assumption is correct you may assume that your job is safe even if your investment does n't pay off meaning you do n't lose income but your investment may not be a great move against let 's say that you dump a lot of money into your company and invest in the stock   you 're being paid by the company you 're taking some of that money and investing it in the company meaning that depending on how much you make outside the company you are increasing your risk of loss if something negative happens to the company ie it fails other reasons to be against it are just the opposite as above due to the nsa some analysts like mish zerohedge and others think that the world will cut back on doing it business with the united states thus the tech industry will take a major hit over the next decade   in addition to that jesse colombo on twitter is predicting that there 's another tech bubble and it will make a mess when it pops to be fair to colombo he was one of analysts who predicted the housing bubble and his predictions on trading are often right finally there is a risk of lost money and there is also a risk of lost opportunity   looking at your past investments which generally hurt more   that might give you a clue what to do

like have said can i create a paypal account and receive € 200 or a similar amount without adding a bank account credit card or anything but my email address the answer is no you can transfer the money to your paypal account but until you verify it with your personal information with at least a credit card or mostly likely a bank account paypal will hold those funds until otherwise can i then use that money to buy on amazon still without adding anything but my email address if not can i buy gift cards and use those on amazon amazon does not accept paypal

something not in answers so far   define your goals   what is important to you my goals if i were in your shoes would include a debt free home passive investment income so i would not have to work and have health insurance covered   i could think of many more details and already have but you get the idea to help determine which investment information to learn first consider how much risk you can tolerate   i know that 's vague at this point but if you 're looking for safe investments first you could learn about mutual funds and then index funds specifically   at the risky extreme you could learn about stock options but i would not recommend such risk

outstanding principal balance is the amount you owe at any given time not including the amount of interest you need to pay as soon as possible the capitalized interest shown is consistent with an average of 13.5 months between when each dollar is borrowed and when the repayment period begins suppose you borrow the first half of the money on september 1 2017 and the second half of the money on february 1 2017 5 months later   at that point half the money has been accruing interest for 5 months   on january 1 2018 half the money accrued interest for 16 months and half the money accrued interest for 11 months   the lender now expects you to start repaying the loan with the first payment due at the end of january 2018 or the beginning of february 2018   if you make the minimum payments on time the lender expects you to make 120 monthly payments   the last monthly payment would be at the end of december or the beginning of january the lender or the website should provide details about the actual payment plan grace periods provisions for handling inability to pay due to unemployment and other terms in the united states most installment loans pretend that for purposes of calculating interest every month has 30 days even february and july   each month 1/12 of the annual percentage rate apr is charged as interest   if you do the compounding a 6.8 percent apr corresponds to 1 + 1 = percent annual percentage yield apy also the apr is understated   the 6.8 percent applies to the full balance including the loan fees even though the borrower only gets the amount minus the loan fees   the 6.8 percent rate is useful for doing calculations after the loan fees have been charged though   these calculations include the capitalized interest and the monthly payment amounts a true calculation of the apr would take the loan fees into account and give a higher number than 6.8 percent   but the corrected apr would not be useful for calculating the capitalized interest nor for calculating the monthly payment amounts

very generally speaking if you have a loan in which something is used as collateral the leader will likely require you to insure that collateral    in your case that would be a car   yes certainly a lender will require you to insure the vehicle that they finance toyota or otherwise   of course if you purchase a vehicle for cash which is advisable anyway then the insurance option is somewhat yours some states may require that a certain amount of coverage is carried on a registered vehicle   however you may be able to drop the collision rental car and other options from your policy saving you some money so you buy a new car for cash $ 25 k or so and store the thing   what happens if the car suffers damage during storage   are you willing to save a few dollars to have the loss of an asset   you will have to insure the thing in some way and i bet if you buy the proper policy the amount save will be very minimal sure you could drop the road side assistance rental car and some other options during your storage time but that probably will not amount to a lot of money

i think you 're misunderstanding amazon 's business practices they are not concerned with profits and losses on a short term basis like most companies typically they re invest profits back into themselves for growth which sometimes means they do n't show a profit even though they are a profitable company however recently they have been profitable in no small part due to the growth of aws    this is fundamentally different than operating at a loss to avoid taxes in the case of the whole foods price slashing they are just doing it to hurt the competition and gain market share they also do n't need the margins to be as large as whole foods did since they are so much bigger

ditto but let me add a couple of comments but more mentioned transaction costs yes many tax shelters require setting up accounts doing paperwork etc often you have to get a lawyer or accountant to do this right if the tax shelter could save you $ 1 million a year in taxes it makes sense to pay a lawyer $ 10,000 to set it up right if it could save you $ 100 a year in taxes paying $ 10,000 to set it up would be foolish in some cases the tax savings would be so small that it would n't be worth the investment of spending $ 20 on a fedex package to ship the paperwork inconvenience arguably this is a special case of transaction costs the cost of your time suppose i knew that a certain tax shelter would save me $ 100 a year in taxes but it would take me 20 hours a year to do the paperwork or whatever to manage it i probably would n't bother because my free time is worth more than $ 5 an hour to me if the payoff was bigger or if i was poorer i might be willing complexity perhaps a special case of 3 if the rules to manage the tax shelter are complicated it may not be worth the trouble you have to spend a bunch of time and if you do it wrong you may get audited and slapped with fines and penalties even if you do it right a shelter might increase your chance of being audited and thus create uncertainty and anxiety i 've never intentionally cheated on my taxes but every year when i do my taxes i worry what if i make an honest mistake but the government decides that it 's attempted fraud and nails me to the wall qualification again as others have noted tax shelters are n't generally if you fill out this form and check box d you get 50 off on your taxes the shelters exist because the government decided that it would be unfair to impose taxes in this particular situation or that giving a tax break encourages investment or some other worthy goal sometimes that worthy goal is pay off my campaign contributors but that 's another subject the rules may have unintended loopholes but any truly gaping ones tend to get plugged so if say they say that you get a special tax break for investing in medical research you ca n't just declare that your cigarette and whiskey purchases are medical research and claim the tax break or you talked about off shore tax havens the idea here is that the us government can not tax income earned in another country and that has never even entered the us if you make $ 10 in france and deposit it in a french bank account and spend it in france the us ca n't tax that so american companies sometimes set up bank accounts outside the us to hold income earned outside the us so they do n't have to bring it into the us and pay the high us tax rate us corporate taxes are now the highest of any industrialized country you could i suppose open an account in the caymans and deposit the income you earned from your us job there but if the money was earned in the us working at a factory or office in the us   by a person living in the us the irs is not going to accept that this is foreign income

the easiest way to get started on a budget is just to track where you spend your money if you have set bills each month i would make a category for each of those to make sure you have enough to pay you can try and split up the remaining income into categories but the easiest way to start is just to track your spending for a month or two this gives you a birds eye view of what is actually realistic start with that total as your preliminary budget and then adjust as you go along to meet other financial goals we use for tracking our income

this is great i 'm not a cpa but work in finance as such my course professional work is focused more on the economic and profitability aspects of transfer pricing as you might imagine it tended to analyze corporate strategy decisions under various cost allocation models which you thoroughly discuss   i would agree with the statement that it is based on the matching principle but would like to add that transfer pricing is interesting as it falls under several fields accounting finance and economics fundamentally it is based on the matching principal but it 's real world applications are based on all three it 's often used to determine and even individual sales peoples profitability as is the case with bank related funds transfer pricing on stuff like time deposits in this case the correct accounting principal allows you to when done properly better understand the economics strategy and operations of an organization    in effect when done correctly it provides transparency for strategic decision making to executives as i said since my coursework tended to focus more on that aspect i definitely have a natural tendency towards it   this is an amazing explanation esp about interest on m&amp;a bridge loans i get that of the more detailed stuff truthfully i 'm not as familiar with it and was just trying to show more of the conceptual than nitty gritty    thanks for the reply

perhaps there is no single formula that accounts for all the time intervals but there is a method to get formulas for each compound interest period you deposit money monthly but there is interest applied weekly let 's assume the month has 4 weeks   so you added x in the end of the first month when the new month starts you have x money in your account after one week you have x + money after the second week you have x + + and so on always taking the previous ammount of money and multiplying it by the interest b you have this gives you for the end of the second month   this looks complicated but it 's easy for computers call it that is it is a function that gives you the ammount of money you would obtain by the end of the second month do you see that the future money inputs are given with relation to the previous ones then we can do the following for notice the x is the end of the formula it 's the deposit of money in the end of the month i 'm assuming it 'll pass through the compound interest only in the first week of the next month   and then write   there is something in mathematics called recurrence relation in which we can use these two formulas to produce a simplified one for arbitrary b and n. doing it by hand would be a bit complicated but fortunately cases are able to do it easily i used mathematica commands and it gave me the following formula   all the work you actually have to do is to figure out what will be and then write the f(n for in terms of notice that i used the command in my code mathematica comes with algorithms for formulas so if it did n't find something simpler you probably wo n't find it by yourself if the code looks ugly it 's because of mathematica formatting in the software it looks like this   notice that i wrote the entire formula for but as it 's also a recurrence relation it can be written as   that is this should give you much simpler formulas to apply in this method

most banks offer prepaid cards nowadays that should fit the bill here i would recommend first checking with your bank to see what they offer as that 's probably the easiest and perhaps cheapest option my bank for example has an entirely fee free prepaid card that while marketed towards teens is entirely applicable for this case   other banks seem to offer similar products some of them have more or less fees but almost all that i 've seen are better than the commercial products you 'd find in a grocery store    as an example and i do n't know anything about it so i do n't specifically recommend this just what i mean note that the fees vary some should be able to be used without ever incurring fees and some have fees you wo n't avoid   most seem to have the concept of sponsor or it you are the cardholder your dad would be the companion cardholder but in either way it means you can load money and generally would be the sole money and your dad could then spend it if your bank does n't offer what you want you may want to consider getting an account with a provider that offers what you 're looking for so to make deposits easier   most of these allow deposits from other sources than checking accounts with that bank but in many cases you may incur a fee or take longer for the money to clear

what is best for everyone is maximizing the effectiveness of the resources at hand   we are most certainly not doing that as there is just so much capacity sitting idle right now   demand is what we are lacking   stimulus creates demand   demand puts people to work it builds companies it brings ideas to fruition   effective can be used to avoid consequences of an overheating economy when that time comes but we are far away from that point   imposing these silly that somehow someday the u.s. is going to get to a point where we ca n't pay back our debt is making us lose focus on the fact that real people are suffering today and that we can do something about it   without artificial constraints like congress putting a limit on the debt it is impossible for the u.s. government to default

note   this is my opinion so please have i am not trying to insult or put down anyone   i merely want to play the devils advocate and contribute to the dialogue in a constructive manner   thanks    you 're better trying to short magazines or the publishing industry   the reason why the music industry fell was because they were disorganized even before itunes came around   the internet has a fantastic distribution system i agree   but many of these streaming websites are trying to eat tv and cable 's lunch    many of the people who under estimate tv do not realize the amount of money talent research staff and infrastructure needed to produce top level high quality shows and programming   it is easy to stream a tv show or movie after it 's been already produced and broadcast but do you really think the internet will give us a mad men lost walking dead game of thrones   i highly doubt it and that 's a big reason why tv is here to stay   yes there is talk of netflix trying to buy the rights to some shows but it 's only in the initial phase and you can be damn sure that tv cable is testing the waters on their part too   if they decide that the relationship with netflix is n't working then they are not obligated to work with netflix   in this case netflix needs tv more than tv needs the netflix or hulu   what makes netflix hulu any more right than a viacom or comcast   you seem to think a future of netflix and itunes is utopia when in reality it would be an oppressive dystopian closed system with no competition   at least with tv and cable you have networks actively competing with each they are literally tripping over themselves working as hard as they can to please you- the audience   you talk about how a future without tv is a good thing but you fail to realize that it would actually be a bad thing for american culture     people seem to think that sitting in front of the computer monitors at a table for one is preferable to a 50 inch lcd screen with surround in the den   i am not surprised because the internet is comprised of people who mainly dwell on the internet where people who watch tv are probably watching tv right now     on top of that many people would lose their jobs   just because apple or netflix can distribute shows and movies cheap does not mean that many thousands of people should lose their jobs especially if the majority of america still prefers to watch programming on their tv 's and not locked in their room on a small computer screen with the sounding computer speakers   this is one of the reasons why we 're having an unemployment problem because these jobs are disappearing by the cold mechanical algorithms of a computer program   think of the many thousands of jobs that have been lost in the music industry do n't you think college kids would have loved to start their careers at a record label promoting music and encouraging growth   instead we have mp3 's and instant gratification music is arguably dead read 90 's music   and if we think a future without tv is utopia then i have some bad news for you it is n't   tv is american we do it best and we should not be turning our backs on it   once we do that we lose our culture    who do you think will own the internet in 50 years   i can tell you it wo n't be the us of a.   think very carefully and be careful what you wish for

anyone can do many jobs that require a degree can you cut leaves and put them in a test tube because that pays $ 20 an hour after 2 years in raises because i do n't need 4 years of college to learn this skill you do n't know that guy maybe he 's qualified for the 80 year old piping and no one else is security clearance at a highly guarded private school can have 2 janitors and not 3 because he 's highly efficient 100k in manhattan is like 40k everywhere else but yeah you 're right the fact her job requires a degree to put leaves in test tubes means she deserves benefits and a great pay and a guy who needs to know what chemicals ca n't mix with each other does n't does he deserve 100k if the school requires any 4 year degree

first check out some of the answers on this question oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing when you have determined that you are ready to invest for retirement there are two things you need to consider the investment and the account   these are separate items the investment is what makes your money grow the type of account provides tax advantages and restrictions   generally these can be considered separately for the most part you can do any type of investment in any account briefly here is an overview of some of the main options in your situation the roth ira is what i would recommend this grows tax free and if you need the funds for some reason you can get out what you put in without penalty you can invest up to $ 5500 in your roth ira each year in addition to the above reasons which are true for anybody a roth ira would be especially beneficial for you for three reasons for someone that is closer in age to retirement and in a higher tax bracket now a roth ira is less attractive than it is for you inside your roth ira there are lots of choices you can invest in stocks bonds mutual funds which are simply collections of stocks and bonds bank accounts precious metals and many other things discussing all of these investments in one answer is too broad but my recommendation is this if you are investing for retirement you should be investing in the stock market however picking individual stocks is too risky you need to be diversified in a lot of stocks stock mutual funds are a great way to invest in the stock market   there are lots of different types of stock mutual funds with different strategies and expenses associated with them managed funds actively buy and sell different stocks inside them but have high expenses to pay the managers index funds buy and hold a list of stocks and have very low expenses the conventional wisdom is that in general index funds perform better than managed funds when you take the expenses into account   i hope this overview and these recommendations were helpful if you have any specific questions about any of these types of accounts or investments feel free to ask another question

i 'd imagine it would only be a threat or interference in an election if a person could prove that only people who voted for obama were laid off otherwise it is just a blanket statement that says if x candidate   wins there will be lay offs due to laws that will be enacted   a better way for him to say it without being so politically charged would be to point out the specific laws and taxes that would affect his company and then allow his employee 's to go determine how the candidates at large support oppose those laws and taxes   edit for example law which is currently to go into affect on xx xx xxxx requires that companies of our size pay an extra of revenue to the government due to this restriction i will need to lower labor costs in order to maintain a profitable company if you feel this law should not be enacted i encourage you to contact your congressmen and do research on where your current presidential candidates lay their support    still has the same message though

i 'm not sure what you expect in terms of answers but it depends on personal factors it pretty well has to depend on personal factors since otherwise everyone would want to do the same thing either everyone thinks the current price is one to sell at or everyone thinks it 's one to buy at and there would be no trades you would n't be able to do what you want except on the liquidity provided by market makers once that 's hit the price is shifting quickly so your calculation will change quickly too purely in terms of maximising expected value taking into account the time value of money it 's all about the same the market should already know everything you know which means that one time to sell is as good as any other the current price is generally below the expected acquisition price because there 's a chance the deal will fall through and the stock price will plummet that 's not to say there are n't clever sure fire trading strategies around acquisitions but they 're certain to be based on more than just timing when to sell an existing holding of stock if you have information that the market does n't and assuming it is legal to do so then you trade based on that information if you know something the market does n't that 's going to be good for price hold if you know something that will reduce the price sell now and know can be used in a loose sense if you have a strong opinion against the market then you might like to invest based on that nothing beats being paid for being right finally bear in mind that expected return is not the same as utility you have your own investment goals and your own view of risk if you 're more risk averse than the market then you might prefer to sell now rather than wait for the acquisition if you 're more risk prone than the market then you might prefer a 90 chance of $ 1 to that 's fine hold the stock the extreme case of this is that you might have a fixed sum at which you will definitely sell up put everything into the most secure investments you can find and retire to the caribbean if that 's the case then you become totally risk averse the instant your holding crosses that line sell and order cocktails

one wonders where the author thinks the monies for the generous boomer pension payouts will come from   and of course they utterly ignore the fact that things like 401k 's and ira 's require that a person begin at a progressive rate after one hits age 70 1/2   yes post retirement fund sales minus the taxes on the proceeds of course which taxes are not to be ignored these people could turn the entire remainder of those monies back around and then re invest them back into the stock market as non tax deferred retail stock purchasers but that is pretty unlikely to happen   in addition the boomers as a generation have become accustomed to a far higher lifestyle newer cars larger amp fancier homes more vacations etc than the previous and so just as with many other things where boomers broke the mold relying the the data from those generations as an economic model of how much wealth retirees tend to cash in and how they spend versus what they sit on and hoard for their heirs may be rather foolish somewhat akin to building an economic model on 20 years of data that americans do n't default on their mortgages yeah that turned out to not be very wise   and then finally i wonder if this author really the meaning of the phrase at the margin after all everyone in a neighborhood does n't have to default on their mortgage to drive house prices down in fact all it takes is a lack of buyers and prices can not be sustained   so the problem with the boomer en masse retirement is not just the possibility that they will all sell everything at the same time but rather that the demographic bulge will at a certain tipping point change from buyer hoarders to sellers and that inevitably will have a major affect on the float and thus the prices of stocks and just as inevitably at some stage of that change herd behavior even panicked herd behavior will take over   it really does n't take much to drive a stock down nor even an entire stock market if the authors wisdom were true would we ever have had any stock market crashes in the first place

so it seems like a lot of people here are n't exactly sure about why this works and its financial implications    so what you are referring to is in finance something called funds transfer pricing or ftp often referred to as just transfer pricing like anything else ftp has its place most companies however do n't use it properly ftp theoretically has one primary purpose although it 's developed a second to properly allocate opportunity costs across divisions   let 's say company a produces widgets they sell these widgets for $ 200 at a total cost of $ 150 and book profits of $ 50 now to produce the widget division 1 makes a computer chip at a cost of $ 50 that it then sells to division 2 for $ 60 division 1 then books a profit of $ 10 division 2 then makes some plastic stuff and the device this is labor intensive so division 2 's costs are $ 100 company a sells the completed device for $ 150 division 2 subsequently books profits of $ 40 and appears much more profitable than division 1 on the surface   the problem arises when division 1 could sell the chip to the open market for $ 125 now it costs them $ 50 to produce and they could make a theoretical profit of $ 75 this is more than the company makes as a whole on the entire device by having division 2 pay effectively fair market price for that chip you realize that division 2 is really operating at a loss the opportunity cost of not selling the chip to market is greater than producing the completed device company a would be better off getting rid of division 2 and solely focusing on division 1 in a good ftp system division 2 would pay the fair market price of $ 125 if done properly management would   hopefully realize it should divest division 2   that 's the fundamental premise behind ftp in actuality things get much more complicated because of economics the company itself branding it operations management labor laws etc that s why most companies screw it up all that other stuff falls under what s called cost allocation accounting it gets very complex and entire masters courses are dedicated to it different methods etc    the other thing you can do with ftp is get crazy tax breaks due to various tax laws the simplified explanation is that divisions pay taxes on profits to the government that division is located in this works on the state level too btw ge does a lot of this and it 's a big part of why they pay almost no taxes again it gets more complicated when you involve audits as there 's some grey area legally    for simplicity assume tax rates are 40 in the us and 10 in india so let 's say ge makes an airplane engine in the us but finishes manufacturing in india these specific engines costs $ 5,000,000 for the us division to make up to a certain point   the us division can then sell the engine at a break even to india so india pays $ 5,000,000 for the engine the us division then books no profit india finishes the manufacturing with additional costs of $ 1,000,000 the india division then sells the engine to the open market for $ therefore the india division books a profit of $ and pays taxes of $ 300,000 now ge as a whole makes a profit of $ less taxes of $ 300,000 = net profit of $   further let 's say the fair market value of the engine as is when the us sells to india is $ that would mean us should book profits of $ 2,000,000 and india should book profits of $ 1,000,000 total taxes by ge are now $ 800,000 us + $ 100,000 india = $ 900,000 however what 's important is that net profit is now $ ge just saved $ 600,000 in taxes by doing the beauty of this is divisions are supposed to charge fair market value for products internationally however it 's really hard for the irs to say what the value of an unfinished product really is heck you could be offering bulk discounts etc   the fact is often us divisions have skilled labor that is difficult to replicate elsewhere they just show us divisions operating at losses to make the company as a whole better the problem again arises when top management do n't fully appreciate or understand the reasoning behind this stuff they end up making cuts to us labor because it 's unprofitable without thinking about the entire story    i know this is very long winded but hope it helps   tldr companies ftp to recognizes profitability and opportunity costs of divisions as well as use it for overseas tax breaks   side note politically speaking people who know how this works are pissed off about it in the u.s. do n't worry though most politicians on both sides do n't have a clue we have high corporate tax rates relative to other countries and irs loopholes allow this kind of thing lobbying $ $ it 's also why economically you ca n't just raise corporate tax rates to increase domestic tax as more companies will just implement this process it 's complicated to do properly also please do n't say 50 years ago tax rates were higher and raising taxes increased receipts the fact is most companies could n't even fathom doing this 50 years ago no less even 20   edit some clarification in wording

the key is to look at total return that is dividend yields plus capital growth some stocks have yields of and no growth in that case you get the dividends and not a whole lot more these are called dividend stocks other stocks pay no dividends but if they can grow at a year or more you 're fine these are called growth stocks the safest way is to get a balanced combination of dividends and growth say a yield of 3 growing at a year for a total return of meaning that you get the best of both worlds these are called dividend growth stocks

maybe it would turn into an oligopoly on it 's own but regulation as that pervasive is what i 'm trying to avoid here   i advocate worker co ops as the best examples for these firms because they actually allow a sense of welfare taken up by the workers who can self provide with actual trades and because their co ownership allows a voluntary loophole in minimum wage laws you get a real chance to prove adam smith 's theory of flexible prices and wages based on economic activity   with self provided welfare the government can pull out of both transfer payments as well as financial regulations because these markets have become more differentiated to a diversity of opinions so government can step back and focus on its more important role of researcher and developer which it tends to do better at than other roles   firms ca n't do this if they are breaking even like they would in perfect competition

gt your question is expressed as a run on sentence which i 'm having trouble parsing maybe you could restate   the one in the title if yes here it is restated   as i currently understand we owe much of our national debt to ourselves the reason for this is that people are being charged interest that does not exist in the system therefore if we tried to pay the debt like some conservative politicians are fighting for it would be a massive transfer of wealth from the 99 to the 1 since most of the debt is owed to the 1 banks   so i was wondering if this conclusion summary understanding is flawed in some way

start by going onto and click through every publicly traded fortune 500 company click on all their charts and look through their graphs for any there will almost always be a pattern even if it is vague and fairly unpredictable then look for any jumps or drops in price look for the reason of the jump or drop it could range commonly from news lay off announcements acquisitions etc or just moving along with the market direction for the day looking at each stock is key because every stock has its own pattern trying to understand the market at a whole is quite impossible but when you narrow it down to just one stock it is much more doable for practice try most of my time on it during high school and create 10 100 accounts and use various techniques for each portfolio    just from that you will have much more practice than the majority of traders it is all very time consuming but if you truly try on it you will do better i have to market drop today good time to buy   i 'll answer more questions later

i 'm not following what 's the meaning of open a mutual fund you do n't open a mutual fund you invest in it there 's a minimum required investment $ 2000 could be some funds have lower limits you do n't have to go with the fidelity one necessarily but in general it has nothing to do with your roth ira account you can invest in mutual funds with any trading account not just roth ira or any other specific kind if you invest in etf 's   you can invest in funds just as well subject to the minimums set as to the plan itself buying and selling etf 's will cost you commission ~2 3 of your investment over several months you may get positive returns and may get negative returns but keep in mind that you start with the 2 3 loss on day 1 within a short period of time especially in the current economic climate which is very unstable just out of recession election year etc etc i would think that keeping the cash in a savings account would be a better choice while with etf you do n't have any guarantees other than -3 then with savings accounts you can at least have a guaranteed return of ~1 apy i.e. wo n't earn much over the course of your internship but you 'll keep your money safe for your long term investment for the long term the fluctuations of month to month do n't matter much so investing now for the next 50 years you should n't care about the stock market going 10 in april so keep your 1000 in savings account and if you want to invest 5000 in your roth ira invest it then assuming of course that you 're completely positive about not needing this money in the next several decades

lot utilities permits taxes financing charges building costs and contingency allowance come to   talk with a banker about how much you can afford   talk with a build on your lot builder about how much house you can get for that budget   consider a new mobile or manufactured home   but if you do choose one ask your banker how that affects what you can borrow and how it affects your rates and terms   talk with a good real estate agent about how much the resale value might be finished lot budget how much can you budget for the lot utilities permits required to get zoning approval fees interest and taxes before you start construction down payment   it sounds like you have a plan for this loan underwriting   talk with a good bank loan officer about what their expectations are   ask about the front end and back end debt to income ratios   in oregon i recommend washington federal for lot loans and construction loans   they keep all of their loans and service the loans themselves   they use appraisers who are specially trained in evaluating new home construction   their appraisers tend to appraise a bit low but not ridiculously low like the incompetent appraisers used by some other banks in the area   i know two banks with lots of oregon branches that use an appraiser who ignores 40 of the finished heated area of some to be built homes   avoid any institution including usaa and that their lending to lot loan   in oregon washington federal offers lot loans with 30 down payments 20-year amortization and one point on approved credit   the interest rate can be a fixed rate but is typically a few percentage points per year higher than for a mortgage secured by a permanent house   if you have the financial wherewithal to start building within two years washington federal also offers short term lot loans   ask about the costs of appraisals points and recording fees rent   how much will it cost to rent a place to live between when you move back to oregon and when your new

a finished lot when comparing lot deals easements these provide access to your property access for others through your property and affect your rights   utility companies often ask for far more rights than they need   until you sign on the dotted line you can negotiate them down to just what they need   talk to a good real estate attorney zoning how much will you be allowed to build   in terms of home square footage garage square footage roof area and surfaces   how can the home be used   as a business as a farm how many unrelated people can live there etc   what setbacks are required   how tall can the be   are there setbacks from streams or steep choosing a builder   for construction loans banks want builders who will build what is agreed upon in a timely fashion   if you want to build your own house talk to your loan officer about what the bank expects in a builder and permits   the construction loan process if you hire a general contractor and if you have difficulties with the contractor you might be forced to refuse to accept some work as being complete   a good bank will back you up   ask about points appraisal charges and inspection fees insurance during construction   some companies have good plans if the construction takes 12 months or less   some but not all auto insurance companies also offer good homeowners insurance for homes under construction   choose your auto insurance company accordingly property taxes do n't forget to include them in your post construction budget homeowners insurance   avoid properties that need flood insurance   apply a sanity

require you to calculate how large a heating system you need   do not trust their design temperatures they may not allow for enough heating during a cold snap especially if you have a heat pump   some heat pumps work at -10 ° f but most lose their effectiveness between 10 ° f and 25 ° f   you can use these calculations in combination with the number of heating degree days and cooling degree days at your site to accurately estimate your energy bills   if you choose a mobile or manufactured home calculate how much extra its energy bills will be home design   here are some good sources of ideas a pattern language by christopher alexander   alexander emphasizes building homes and neighborhoods that can grow and that have niches within niches within niches the not so big house by sarah   this book applies many alexander 's design patterns to medium and large new houses before the architect   the late ralph emphasized the importance of plywood flashing pocket doors wide wide attic and open or i floor systems   lots of outlets and incandescent lighting are good too   it is possible to have too much detail in a house plan and too much room in a house   for examples see any of his plans tim the builder 's engineer   since oregon is in earthquake country and the building codes do not fully reflect that risk emphasize that you want a building that would meet san jose california 's

here 's my view as a old who grew up in auckland when you purchase a residential property whether or not you intend to live in it you 're essentially counting on the possibility that one of the following will occur this report by the nz royal society going by memory from a presentation i attended predicts ongoing population growth in nz mainly driven by immigration and mostly in auckland building of new housing is n't keeping up with population growth so my bet would be that the property values especially in auckland are going to continue to climb   other factors that might influence your decision are things only you can know such as where you might be likely to settle down how much risk you 're willing to take how much capability you have to look after a rental property and how much knowledge you have about the property market bear in mind that government schemes and world events may change the outlook for number of houses being built and immigration levels both of which heavily affect property values my personal view is that the government is n't doing nearly enough to provide affordable housing for our young adults in nz not only that the govt is essentially responsible for the problem in the first place as zoning rules for local authorities artificially inflate land prices which prevent the building of affordable houses furthermore foreign investment in rental properties is unregulated and both these problems could be resolved with appropriate legislation though central city prices are unlikely to be relieved as much as other areas simply because prices are also inflated due to the desirability to live centrally the problem is a severe one and high housing prices for even the smallest are going to make inequality and the social problems that go with it far worse i 'd like to see new cities or towns being planned and built from scratch such as and

the best strategy for rsu 's specifically is to sell them as they vest usually vesting is not all in one day but rather spread over a period of time which assures that you wo n't sell in one extremely unfortunate day when the stock dipped for regular investments there are two strategies i personally would follow sell when you need if you need to cash out cash out rebalance if you need to rebalance your portfolio i.e. not cash out but reallocate investments or move investment from one company to another do it periodically on schedule for example every 13 months in the us where the long term cap gains tax rates kick in after 1 year of holding rebalance you would n't care about specific price drops on that day because they also affect the new investments speculative strategies trying to sell high buy low usually bring to the opposite results you end up selling low and buying high but if you want to try and do that you 'll have to get way more technical than just dollar cost averaging or similar strategies most people do n't have neither time nor the knowledge for that and even those who do rarely can beat the market and never can in the long run

maybe if it required immense talent or skill it would all you really need to do is be able to handle people for several hours a day which is a prerequisite to any job instead you get a bunch of salty usually individuals with zero marketable skills who could n't get a job elsewhere or are lazy and know they can slack off like shit and not get fired working there my best friend and roommate was one of those people and he worked there a year and barely got the minimum raises everyday he about how dumb everyone he worked with was despite the fact he 's one of the dumbest people i know he thought the world owed him something and he did n't care how he got it that was about 60 of the people there that i knew on the other hand the other 40 of people i knew working there were still young kids but did n't think every person with a somewhat dumb question was an idiot they showed up on time got their work done and were pleasant to be around despite having a shitty job they were the same age and from the same background as my friend but they did n't come to work with a chip on their shoulder after several months most of them had been promoted to higher positions or even assistant managers they were making considerably more money and had more responsibility they could not be replaced the next day by someone with no training or experience and were worth even more to the company than their time a dozen former peers who acted like assholes   if you let your starting salary or position dictate your attitude toward a job you 're never going to get anywhere in life the world does n't owe a huge salary and benefits i 'm hardly arguing for big companies that can and do treat employees badly but having seen what that sometimes consists of i do n't tend to get my panties in a bunch over it anymore i 've worked my fair share of shit jobs in the beating sun and heat for shit money and i did n't treat people like shit because of it hell i actually really enjoyed one of them the difference is i never thought the world owed me something because two people had the idea to fuck one night

i am not going to discuss legality because with family members you are able to give a lot of guidance and assistance without running into legal issues   the biggest problem is that when they transfer the funds to you and you invest the money all the tax rates and tax limits are determined by your situation plus you have more investments than you should have so you hit those limits and brackets quicker for example in the united states a person can put $ 5,500 or $ 6,500 into a ira or roth ira each year if you combine the funds for three with your funds then you are giving up three quarters of the amount that you can invest in that type of account the decision regarding roth or not depends on age and income level but now their decision is related to what is best based on your situation the ability to even deduct ira deposits would be based on your situation of course for taxable accounts the tax rate is determined by your income not theirs if they want you to have the ability to make investment decisions for them then power of attorney is the way to go the money is deposited in their name and all the rules and tax rates are determined by their situation you make sure they have all the information they need to login and review the accounts but you make the all the moves within and between accounts

you do not need to inform your employer of your additional activity but it is your responsibility not to work for more than 48 hours per week as long as you are an employee so if you are working 38 hours for your employer you may not work for yourself for more than 10 hours it is however not so easy in practice to draw the line between work and a hobby as long as you are not being paid by the hour the main reason to present your employer with an addition to your work contract is to make it legally very clear that he holds no intentions to claim copyright to your work he may attempt to do something funky like claim your home computer is in fact a work computer because you used it once a month to work from home and your work contract may contain a paragraph that all work performed on a work computer results in copyright ownership for your employer i have no idea how likely this is in practice but this is the reason i know is commonly given as legal advice to have a contract so the normal contract you present your employer with says in order to earn user contribution money from a website you need to register as a sole proprietor and pay trade tax and sales tax alternatively you claim small trade exception which also makes a tax return mandatory i would guess however and this is not legal advice in any way just my guess that a couple of contributions towards server cost in a strictly non profit endeavor is not commercial at all but private in the same way that you may write an invoice to someone you sold your old bike to or a kid may get paid to mow someone 's lawn based on that guess my non legal advice recommendation is to take the contributions and do nothing else as long as the amount is nowhere near breaking even if you count your work input

legally i ca n't find any reason that the llc could not lend money to an individual however i believe the simplest course of action is to first distribute money from your company to your personal account and then make it a personal loan whether the loan is done through the business or personally financially i do n't think there is much difference as to which bucket the interest income goes into since your business and personal income will all get lumped together anyway with a single person llc even if your friend defaults on the loan either the business or you personally will have the same burden of proof to meet that the loan was not a gift to begin with and if that burden is met the deduction can be taken from either side if a debt goes bad the debtor may be required to report the debt as income

if i buy vusa from one exchange can i sell it in a different exchange assuming my brokerage account lets me trade in both exchanges or is it somehow tied to the exchange i bought it from this does n't happen for all securities and between all stock exchanges so that is dependent on broker and country i checked for vusa with they categorically refused allowing me to trade in vusa in different exchanges i can only buy and sell in same currency only albeit in the same exchange where i from should be the same behaviour for all brokers for us mere mortals if you are a bank or a millionaire than that might be a different question   the vusa you quote is quoted in gbp in lse and in eur in and the etf has been created by an irish entity and has an irish isin   as chris mentioned below happens between us and canadian exchanges but not sure it happens across all exchanges you can not deal in inter listed stocks in lse and nyse since it 's the same asset its value should not vary across exchanges once you compensate for exchange rates right yes else it opens up itself for arbitrage profit without any risk which everybody wants so even if any such instance occurs either people will exploit it to make the arbitrage profit zero security reflects the equilibrium price or the profit from such transaction is so less compared with the effort involved that people will tend to ignore it anyways arbitrage profit is very difficult to garner nowadays considering the super computers at work in the market who exploit these discrepancies the moment they see them and bring the security right to the zero arbitrage profit point if there 's no currency risk because of 2 what other factors should i consider when choosing an exchange to trade in liquidity something else time difference by the time you wake up to trade in japan the japanese markets would have closed tax implications across multiple continents law of the land providing protection to investors finding a broker dealing in markets you want to explore or dealing with multiple brokers regulatory headaches

well the article did mention that if you continually beat your you 're likely to get rejected in future which is hilarious but personally i have actually bet on sports and i 've found that it 's a fairly easy game to win at if you do n't go for bets with huge odds and i do n't think i 've ever placed a bet where after i lost and said what the hell just happened i only really bet on and soccer though so team sports may be a bit less prone to corruption from the   i 'm not saying i think this is a safe way to do business though i do n't think day trading is either i think they are both speculation i just think that sports betting has a lot more for a speculator to work with before they develop a strategy    for instance i always bet on new zealand winning a game their players line up as the top in their respective positions and their game strategy essentially has the rules of the game exploited to the maximum all of the data on this team based on their past performance is actually applicable to their future performance skilled players usually continue to be so up till a certain age skilled coaches who stay in their position mean no variation in team strategy that makes me feel confident that even though new zealand might lose a game here or there   that they will continue to be winners and even though the gains on their wins are n't much consistently winning with them over time builds up to a nice bit of profit    with day trading in the stock market so much of the variation in prices is due to non accounting fundamentals and even though historical data can be useful we know that investor sentiment secret information and a myriad of other factors mean that unless you are extremely experienced or have a natural eye for reading markets that most traders will lose i know developing strategies do work for some people but i think i 've seen it said on this sub a couple times that trading strategies work until they do n't i only speak as a uni student who has limited research beyond bloomberg articles etc but from what i can tell the majority of day traders lose money eventually and even with ai the profits are only when the capital input is extremely high    sports events ca n't really be by the confidence of supporters and yes corruption is rampant in sports as with every industry but at least the data you have tells a fairly good story about where the bets will head in the future

cheapest is one thing   you can absolutely shop in the market and find the lowest possible price   i can think of three places to shop each with an up and downside i would think that what you really mean is the best price for the service   just like shopping for a car you have to decide what you need vs what is nice to have decide what features you need   do you need long distance   do you need caller i d   do you need to call friends and family find out what you have available to you through associations   often schools work or a club you belong to have deals for service discounts   look at your insurance plan or aaa membership for the crazy discounts decide what kinds of service will meet your needs buy the cheapest service do not enter a contract   even if the price is slightly lower   at least not at first   if you try out your service and love it enter the contract if and only if the total price measured over length of the contract is less   with cell phones especially it is absolutely possible to save money buying month to month vs a 2 year contract   even when you buy equipment for full price up front ask for the bare minimum service from your local phone company because phone companies are often regulated monopolies they might have a bare minimum level of service they are required to offer by the municipality   they probably do n't advertise it or push it but it might exist if you call and ask   you basically get a dial tone price is dictated by a government board so you do n't have to worry about shopping for deals not the cheapest possible solution this is popular plan the youth oriented market but more and more people of all demographics are using their cellphones only   there are downsides 911 etc and shopping for the best cell phone plan can be a full time job but it does offer a way to save money by simply not having home phone service might be possible to score organizational discounts through work or groups you belong to cellphones require batteries and can go dead not good for emergencies voice over internet protocol uses your existing internet connection   you can buy a cheap regular phone and plug it into the voip box and use it like any other phone   voip can either be very inexpensive for all the features you get or just plain inexpensive   there are providers who sell a monthly service yearly service or no service plan at all you buy a device and get service as long as you own the device   taxes to the government are always due so nothing is ever free sometimes the provider is just computer software so a minimalist would like that emergency services are more reliable than cellular if you follow extra steps to set them up can be confusing to buy   some require contracts some special devices some require a bit of technical know how to setup   be sure to evaluate the total cost of ownership when comparing prices

are you sure you 're not just looking at prices that are adjusted for the split e.g. yahoo for example gilead sciences split a few months ago but if you look at a price chart there is n't an interruption even though the split is clearly marked look in the past six months it split in january however you could also simply be watching companies that happen to not split for a variety of reasons this is n't a criticism but rather just a consequence of whatever stocks you happen to be watching   however a quick search for information on stock splits yields a few articles mainly from the motley fool that argue that fewer companies are performing stock splits in recent years the articles mainly talk about tech companies and they make the argument that even though the shares in google and apple have a high stock price google and apple are n't all that expensive by traditional valuation    metrics google trades at just 15 times next year 's projected    profitability apple a mere 13 times fiscal 2012 's bottom line estimates these articles are a bit dated in terms of the stock prices but the rationale is probably still good similar logic could apply for other companies for example since may 2009 panera 's stock price has climbed by almost a factor of 4 without splitting the articles also make the point that stock splits were traditionally seen as bullish signs because companies splitting to bring their share prices back down to more    accessible levels were optimistic in building those sand back    up one could make a fair argument that the overall economic climate is n't as bullish as it used to be although i would only be convinced that this was affecting stock splits if data could be gathered and tested a stock split can also raise the price of a stock because if small investors feel the stock is suddenly more accessible to them they purchase more of it and might therefore drive up the price see the investopedia article on stock splits for more information companies might not see the necessity in doing this because their stock price is n't high enough to warrant a split or because the price is n't high enough to smaller investors   one interesting point to make however is that even though stock splits can drive small investors to buy more of the stock this is n't always a gain for the company because professional investors firms institutions etc have a tendency to sell after a split the paper is a bit old but it 's still a very neat read it 's possible that more and more companies no longer see any advantage to splitting because it might not affect their stock price in the long run and arguably could even hurt it considering that large professional investors likely hold a higher percentage of a company 's shares than smaller investors if a stock split triggers a wave of selling by the former the increasing propensity to buy of the latter may not be enough to offset the decline in price   note my answer only refers to standard stock splits the reasons above may not apply to a decrease in the number of reverse stock splits which may not be a phenomenon i do n't know

one advantage of paying down your primary residence is that you can refinance it later for 10 15 years when the balance is low refinancing a rental is much harder and interest rates are often higher for investors this also assumes that you can refinance for a lower rate in the nearest future the question is really which would you rather sell if you suddenly need the money i have rental properties and i 'd rather move myself than sell the investments because they are income generating unlike my own home so in your case i 'd pay off primary residence especially since the interest is already higher on it would be a harder decision if it was lower

let 's say i have two loans say 2 car loans and the high interest loan has a higher balance   both have a monthly payment of say $ 500 my income fluctuates a lot so occasionally i only have $ 750   i get hit with big fees those months or maybe i just have to eat beans for those months   i come on some extra money   maybe enough to get rid of the low interest small loan paying off the smaller loan frees up cash   i do n't have to eat beans on the bad months

update 2013 this product is no longer available as of december 1 2010 travelex announced a product the travelex cash passport which is chip and pin protected you can buy it in the us and then load it up with either euros or british pounds there are a few things to know about this right now it is not available online at the travelex website you must purchase it in person at participating travelex retail locations i bought mine right downstairs from the stack overflow world headquarters the fees that travelex charges for foreign currency transactions will take your breath away i purchased a £ 300 card for $ which comes out to a 15 service charge travelex will give you better rates if you purchase larger amounts there is a further 3 fee if you use a credit card i used a debit card to avoid this think long and hard about whether to load it with pounds or euros they charged me 5.5 above the interbank exchange rate to spend my pound card in euros you get two cards which is very convenient you can refill the card on the web due to the high fees the chip and pin cash passport is not a good idea for everyday transactions for getting cash from an atm and certainly not for paying for big ticket items like hotels you 're going to want to reserve it for purchasing things from those automated kiosks in europe especially gas stations ticket machines in train stations and toll booths that will not work with a standard magnetic stripe card the card worked perfectly buying tickets on the tube in london i have n't had a chance to check it out in other countries

for some very small private companies i know of and am part of paper stocks do exist you can sit at the table with the damn things in your hand and wave them in people 's faces   they tell everyone how much of the company you own as a result of the money you up on the other hand most stocks are now electronic nothing to hold just electronic records to review they still represent how much you own of the company because of some amount of money you have put at risk but they are n't anywhere near as much fun as the old paper proofs as mrchrister notes you can pay a small fee to get paper if you like even for some big companies some of these paper stocks are remarkably elaborate and fine looking but hardly necessary you can see more info about what stocks are and what sort of stocks exist here

how do people do it firstly i 'd advise you to explicitly budget all taxes the reason is because taxes get complicated when you have a child deduction not that raising a child is profitable post taxes but it can change your perspective with high income get by just fine the rest sacrifice they buy less house or rent they drive more than 30 minutes to work every day they work second jobs they stop saving for retirement and when they fail to save or plan they borrow from family or rack up huge credit card debt they do n't buy the sweet new truck they were planning on they cut cable and cook meals at home they skip church because they ca n't afford the and say it 's because they do n't have time do n't want their children to disrupt services etc   so right now that other basket is looking pretty juicy and the taxes can maybe be examined as well but ultimately if you 're looking at a 30 percent hit in pay that wo n't cut it mortgage + food alone is nearly half your budget

the way i would use it is every trade done by a broker has a client side and a street side   the client side is for their brokerage account and the street side is whoever they traded with say john doe calls me at charles schwab and wants to buy 100 ibm   i look at the market and decide that the best execution is on arca   i trade on arca for the client   then i book a client side trade into his account and a street side trade against arca   if i myself was a dealer in ibm and executed against my inventory the street side would basically be internal booking a trade against my account

a. bank transfer is the normal way to do it the law society will eventually make good any losses incurred on money held by solicitors acting fraudulently so your money should not be at risk provided you make sure to transfer the money to the account number your solicitor gave you b. it 's not just normal but essential to transfer the money before exchanging contracts since the deposit has to be paid by your solicitor to the vendor 's solicitor as part of the   exchange process you ca n't wait to pay the deposit until after you 've exchanged because you have n't exchanged until you 've paid the deposit c. if you really want to put down the 10 deposit now and pay the rest upon completion that should be possible talk to your solicitor about it

in the us if it 's a large donation to a tax exempt organization or equivalent you may want to consider giving appreciated equities stocks bonds mutual fund shares which are now worth more than you paid for them   you get to claim the deduction 's value at the time you transfer it to their account and you avoid capital gains tax   they would pay the capital gains tax when they redeem it for cash but if exempt they get the full value and the tax is completely avoided   effectively   your donation costs you less for the same impact   it does take a bit of work to coordinate this with the receiving organization and there may be brokerage fees so it probably is n't worth doing for small within the same brokerage house may avoid those so again you should talk to the charity about what 's best but for larger donations where larger probably starts at a few thou it can save you a nice chunk of change

i 'm not entirely sure about some of the details in your question since i think you meant to use $ 10,000 as the value of the futures contract and $ 3 as the value of the underlying stock those numbers would make more sense that being said i can give you a simple example of how to calculate the profit and loss from a leveraged futures contract for the sake of simplicity i 'll use a well known futures contract the e mini s&p500 contract each e mini is worth $ 50 times the value of the s&p 500 index and has a tick size of 0.25 so the minimum price change is 0.25 $ 50 = $ 12.50   here 's an example say the current value of the s&p500 is 1,600 the value of each contract is therefore $ 50 1,600 = $ 80,000 you purchase one contract on margin with an initial margin of 5 or $ 4,000 if the s&p 500 index rises to the value of your futures contract increases to $ 50 = $ once you return the 80,000 4,000 = $ that you borrowed as leverage your profit is = $ 4,500   since you used $ 4,000 of your own funds as an initial margin your profit excluding commissions is 4,500 4,000 = $ 500 which is a = 12.5 return if the index dropped to the value of your futures contract decreases to $ 50 = $ after you return the $ in leverage you 're left with $ 3,000 or a net loss of 3,000 = the math illustrates why using leverage increases your risk but also increases your potential for return consider the first scenario in which the index increases to if you had forgone using margin and spent $ 80,000 of your own funds your profit would be 80,000 = this is smaller than your leveraged profit by a factor of 20 the inverse of the margin requirement .05 = 12.5 in this case the use of leverage dramatically increased your rate of return   however in the case of a decrease you spent $ 80,000 but gained $ for a loss of only 1.25 this is 20 times smaller in magnitude than your negative return when using leverage by forgoing leverage you 've decreased your opportunity for upside but also decreased your downside risk 1 for futures contracts the margin requirements are set by the exchange which is cme group in the case of the e mini the 5 in my example is higher than the actual margin requirement which is currently $ usd per contract but it keeps the numbers simple also note that cme group refers to the initial margin as the performance bond instead

if you want to convert more than a few thousand dollars one somewhat complex method is to have two investment accounts at a discount broker that operations both in canada and the usa then buy securities for usd on a us exchange have your broker move them to the canadian account then sell them on a canadian exchange for cad   this will of course incur trading fees but they should be lower than most currency conversion fees if you convert more than a few thousand dollars because trading fees typically have a very small percentage component using a currency etf as the security to buy sell can eliminate the market risk in any case it may take up to a week for the trades and transfer to settle

housing prices are set by different criteria it can become memoryless the same as the stock if the criteria used to set its price in the past is no longer valid for example take phoenix or las vegas in the past these were considered attractive investments because of the economical growth and the climate of the area while the climate has n't changed the economical growth stopped not only there but also in the places where people buying the houses lived which is all over the world really what happened to the housing market dropped sharply and stays flat for several years now at the bottom so it does n't really matter if the house was worth $ 300 k in phoenix 5 years ago you can only sell it now for k and that 's about it the prices have been flat low for several years and the house price was $ 50 k but does it mean its going to stay so no once economy gears up the prices will go up as well so its not exactly memory less but the stocks are not memory less as well there is correlation between the past and the future performance if the environment conditions are similar the performance is likely to be similar for stocks however there 's much more environment conditions than the housing market and its much harder to predict them but even with the housing people were burnt a lot on the misconception that the past performance correlates to the future it does n't necessarily

the expense ratio is 0.17 so does nt that mean that for every 10 k i    keep in the money market fund i lose $   not really the expense ratio is taken before distributions are paid which applies to all mutual funds should i care about this   in this case not really if it was a taxable account then other options may be more tax efficient that is worth noting the key with money market funds is that the expense ratio often represents how much money the administrators will take before paying out the rest so if your money market fund bought investments that paid .25 then you 'd likely see .08 as that is what is left over after the .17 is taken in the dividends if at the start of the year the funds nav is $ 1 and at the end of    the year the funds nav is still $ 1 i have nt lost anything right right wikipedia has a good article on money market funds keep in mind that most money market funds are run as one of a number of funds from a fund family that may have to take a little less profit on the money market funds when rates are low

oddly enough in the usa there are enough cost and tax savings between buy and hold of a static portfolio and buying into a fund that a few brokerages have sprung up around the concept such as to make it easier for small investors to manage numerous small holdings via fractional shares and no commission window trades a static buy and hold portfolio of stocks can be had for a few dollars per trade   buying into a fund involves various annual and one time fees that are quoted as percentages of the investment   even 1 2 can be a lot especially if it is every year   typically a us mutual fund must send out a 1099 tax form to each investor stating that investors share of the dividends and capital gains for each year the true impact of this is not obvious until you get a tax bill for gains that you did not enjoy which can happen when you buy into a fund late in the year that has realized capital gains   what fund investors sometimes fail to appreciate is that they are taxed both on their own holding period of fund shares and the fund 's capital gains distributions determined by the fund 's holding period of its investments for example if abc tech fund bought google stock several years ago for $ 100/share and sold it for $ in the same year you bought into the abc fund then you will receive a capital gains distribution on your 1099 that will include some dollar amount which is considered your share of that long term profit for tax purposes the amount is not customized for your holding period capital gains are distributed pro rata among all current fund shareholders as of the ex distribution date morningstar tracks this as potential capital gains exposure and so there is a way to check this possibility before investing funds who have unsold losers in their portfolio are also affected by these same rules have been called free rides because those funds if they find some winners will have losers that they can sell simultaneously with the winners to remain tax neutral   see on the lookout for tax traps and free riders morningstar pdf in contrast buying and holding a portfolio does not attract any capital gains taxes until the stocks in the portfolio are sold at a profit   a fund often is actively managed   that is experts will alter the portfolio from time to time or advise the fund to buy or sell particular investments note however that even the experts are required to tell you that past performance is no guarantee of future results

in a retirement portfolio is usually a function of your age and your risk tolerance your portfolio is usually a mix of the following asset classes you can break down these asset classes further but each one is a topic unto itself if you are young you want to invest in things that have a higher return but are more volatile because market fluctuations like the current financial meltdown will be long gone before you reach retirement age   this means that at a younger age you should be investing more in stocks and foreign developing countries if you are older you need to be into more conservative investments bonds money market etc   if you were in your and still heavily invested in stock something like the current financial crisis could have ruined your retirement plans   a lot of baby boomers learned this the hard way for most of your life you will probably be somewhere in between these two   start aggressive and gradually get more conservative as you get older   you will probably need to re check your asset allocation once every 5 years or so as for how much of each investment class there are no hard and fast rules   the idea is to maximize return while accepting a certain amount of risk   there are two big unknowns in there 1 how much return do you expect from the various investments and 2 how much risk are you willing to accept   1 is a big guess and 2 is personal opinion a general portfolio guideline is 100 minus your age   this means if you are 20 you should have 80 of your retirement portfolio in stocks   if you are 60 your retirement portfolio should be 40 stock   over the years the 100 number has varied   some financial advisor types have suggested 150 or 200   unfortunately that 's why a lot of baby boomers ca n't retire now above all re balance your portfolio regularly   at least once a year perhaps quarterly if the market is going wild   make sure you are still in line with your desired asset allocation   if the stock market tanks and you are under invested in stocks buy more stock selling off other funds if necessary   i 've read interviews with fund managers who say failure to rebalance in a down stock market is one of the big mistakes people make when managing a retirement portfolio as for specific mutual fund suggestions i 'm not going to do that because it depends on what your 401k or ira has available as investment options   i do suggest that your focus on selecting a passive index fund not an actively managed fund with a high expense ratio personally i like total market funds to give you the broadest allocation of small and big companies   this makes your question about large small cap stocks moot   the next best choice would be an s&p 500 index fund you should also be able to find a low cost bond index fund that will give you a healthy mix of different bond types however you need to look at expense ratios to make an informed decision   a better performing fund is pointless if you lose it all to fees also watch out for overlap between your fund choices   investing in both a total market fund and an s&p 500 fund undermines the idea of a diversified portfolio an aggressive portfolio usually includes some foreign developing nation investments   there are n't many index fund options here so you may have to go with an actively managed fund with a much higher expense ratio   however this kind of investment can be worth it to take advantage of the economic growth in places like china

it depends on the terms student loans are often very low interest loans which allow you to spread your costs of education over a long time without incurring too much interest they are often government subsidized   on the other hand you often get better mortgage rates if you can bring a down payment for the house therefore it might be more beneficial for you to use money for a down payment than paying off the student load

i have n't dealt with this kind of thing in any way but i found some quotes from irs publications which i think are relevant and hopefully help your scenario sounds to me like a qualified tuition reduction as described in publication 970 tax benefits for education it appears the rules are different for graduate study as opposed to pre graduate work though i do n't see anything about any dollar amount limit there are various requirements and exceptions so hopefully reading through that section of the publication can help you understand whether the benefit is supposed to be taxable if taxable it should show up on your w-2 like any other income any tuition reduction that is taxable should be included as wages on your form w-2 box 1 report the amount from form w-2 box 1 on line 7 form 1040 or form 1040a or line 1 form 1040ez   it does n't appear that there is any special designation or box for the tuition reduction as opposed to normal work it just is income that 's been earned like any other if you need guidance on how much of the income is for normal work and how much is for the tuition reduction you probably need to see if you can figure it out from her pay stubs or contact the university 's hr department well looking through the credits i see in publication 970 there appear to be two possible credits the american opportunity credit section under no double benefit allowed says things like my emphasis added you ca n't do any of the following   my understanding from reading through the section is that expenses are only excluded if they were tax free so that there ca n't be a double dipping of benefits if they 're included as taxable income i think they would count under your second interpretation that the employer paid them like any other income and your wife spent them as educational expenses just like other students and they would qualify for educational credits in fact it explicitly states do n't reduce qualified education expenses by amounts paid with funds the student receives as which sure sounds to me that anything that counts as w-2 box 1 wages would be payments received that then the expenses were logically paid separately from the other credit the lifetime learning credit appears to use identical language no double benefits and do n't reduce by wages obviously this is just from my looking through publication 970 there may be more nuances here and for real advice you may want to speak more to the university hr department who perhaps have dealt with this before and/or a real tax advisor you might also see if you can get any sort of a receipt or even a form 1098-t from the university of what amount was paid on your wife 's behalf to help document it is truly that she was just paid more wages and spent them on classes as far as tax law is concerned

thirty thousand in credit card debt is a big elephant to eat so to speak   but you do it by taking a bite at a time   one positive is that you do not want to borrow from your 401k.   doing so is a horrible idea the first question you have to ask yourself and understand is how you accumulated 30 k in credit card debt in the first place   most people get there by running up a relatively small amount say 5 k and playing the zero transfer game a few times   then add in a late payment and a negative event or two like the car breaking down or a trip to the emergency room and poof a large amount of credit card debt    obviously i have no idea if this is how you got there and providing some insight might help    also your age approximate income and other debts might also help provide more insight   i assume you are still working and under age 59.5 as you are talking about borrowing from your 401k. where i come from is that my wife then girlfriend found ourselves under stifling debt a few years ago   when we married we became very intentional and focused on ourselves of debt and now sit completely debt free including the house   during our debt payoff time we lived off of less than 25 of our salary   we both took extra jobs when we were able   intensity was our key      if i were you i would not refi the house   there are costs associated with this and why would you put more debt on your home i might cash out the annuity provided that there are no negative tax consequences and depending on how much you can get for it   numbers are the key here   however i feel like doing so will not retire this debt the first thing you need to do is get on a written budget   a game plan for spending and stick to it   if you are married your spouse has to be part of this process   the budget has to be fresh each month and each month you and your wife should meet   to deviate from the budget you will also need to have a meeting   my wife and i still do this despite being debt free and enjoying very healthy incomes secondly it is about cutting expenses   cable off   no eating out or vacations   cut back on cell phone plans only basic clothing   gift giving is of the $ 5 variety and only for those very close to you   forget lattes etc   depending on your income i would cut 401 k contributions to zero or only up to the company match if your household income is above 150k year third it is about earning more   ebay deliver pizzas cut grass overtime whatever    all extra dollars go to credit card balance reduction   at a minimum you should find an extra $ 1000/month however i would shoot for   if you can find 2 k you will be done with this in 13 months   i know the math does n't work out for that but once you get momentum you find more how good will it feel to be out from under this oppression next march   i know you can do this without cashing in the annuity or refinancing   do you believe it

if the stock has dropped from $ 10 to $ 2 and now is range trading between $ 2 and $ 3 and you were not able to sell your shares earlier then i would no be holding on to them now as soon as the price hit $ 3 sell them after you have sold them and you noticed the stock still range trading one strategy you could apply is to go long after the price bounces off the $ 2 support placing a stop just below $ 2 then as the price moves up you trail your stop up with the price as it starts getting close to $ 3 tighten your stop if it keeps range trading and bounces off the resistance at $ 3 and you get stopped out you can either go short and reverse the process or wait for it to bounce off the support at $ 2 again one word of warning though the longer a stock range trades the bigger the outbreak out of the rage either up or down will be that is the reason why you should first wait for confirmation that the price has bounced off support resistance before opening a position and secondly why you should use a stop loss to get you out instead of just selling when it hits $ 3 because if it breaks through $ 3 you can continue profiting as it moves up

like almost all investing question it depends boring companies generally appreciate slowly and as you note pay dividends more speculative investing can get you some capital gains but also are more likely to tank and have you lose your original investment the longer your time horizon and the more risk you are willing to take then it is reasonable to tilt towards but not exclusively invest in more speculative stocks a shorter horizon or if you have trouble sleeping at night if you lose money or are looking for an income stream would then tend towards the boring side good luck

how you use the metric is super important    because it subtracts cash it does not represent value   it represents the ongoing financing that will be necessary if both the equity plus debt is bought by one person who then pays himself a dividend with that free cash    so if you are private equity this measures your net investment at not the price you pay at t=0   if you are a retail investor who a wo n't be buying the debt b wo n't have any control over things like tax jurisdictions c wo n't be receiving any cash dividend etc etc the metric is pointless

if the share is listed on a stock exchange that creates liquidity and orderly sales with specialist market makers such as the nyse there will always be a counterparty to trade with though they will let the price rise or fall to meet other open interest   on other exchanges or in closely held or private equity scenarios this is not necessarily the case nasdaq has market maker firms that maintain the bid ask spread and can do the same thing with their own inventory as the specialists but are not required to by the brokerage rules as the nyse brokers are   the nyse has listing requirements of at least 1.1 million shares so there will not be a case with only 100 shares on this exchange

if the index goes up every single day during your investment you would indeed be better off with 2x etfs assuming no tracking errors however this is basically never the case indexes fluctuate up and down and the problem is with these sorts of etfs you double your win on the upside but your downside is more than double if an index goes up 10 one day and down 10 the next you lose 1 of the value of your investment 1.1 0.9 if you are using 2x etfs you lose 4 of the value of your investment 1.2 0.8 not 2 if you are using 3x etfs you lose 9 of the value of your investment 1.3 0.7 not 3 so if the index will continue to rise during your holding period yes you are better off with these 2x or 3x etfs if the index falls on some days but rises most other days the added downside is all but certain to make you lose money even though the stock trends upward that 's why these etfs are designed for single day bets over the long term the volatility of the stock market combined with your exponentially increased downside guarantees you will lose money

assuming nothing here helps here are some thoughts first if principal financial knows the 401k was rolled over to an ira then it must have been a custodian to custodian transfer which means they need to know who the recipient custodian was so i 'd call them back and push a little harder next they could n't have just created an ira out of thin air and moved some money into it without some paperwork and signatures from you so you should have copies of that paperwork principal may also still have archived copies of that paperwork that they may be able to provide to you although they 'll probably charge for that service also there would have been tax reporting around the rollover for the year the rollover occurred in you would have received a 1099-r and 5498 the 1099-r would have to have been reported on your federal and possibly state income tax for that year it may be possible to obtain copies of old 1099-r 's from the irs maybe call them and ask in subsequent years you should have received at least a year end statement if you do n't have any of that and contacting principal and the irs do n't help then i 'm not sure there 's much that anyone can do to help you as far as i know there 's no universal clearinghouse for iras and there are a lot of ira custodians i would expect you to receive a year end statement from the custodian for 2015 sometime in early 2016 so maybe just wait for and watch for that and take this as an object lesson that you need to keep better track of your finances no one 's going to do it for you unless you pay them a bunch of money

the main difference between a bull market and a bear market is due the the leverage effect the leverage effect refers to the observed tendency of an asset ’s    volatility to be negatively correlated with the asset ’s returns    typically rising asset prices are accompanied by declining    volatility and vice versa the term leverage refers to one possible    economic interpretation of this phenomenon developed in black 1976    and 1982 as asset prices decline companies become    mechanically more leveraged since the relative value of their debt    rises relative to that of their equity as a result it is natural to    expect that their stock becomes riskier hence more volatile more volatile assets in a bear market are not such good investments as less volatile assets in a bull market

back in the late 80 's i had a co worked do exactly this in those days you could only do things quarterly change the percentage change the investment mix make a withdrawal there were no roth 401 k accounts but contributions could be pre tax or post tax long term employees were matched 100 up to 8 newer employees were only matched 50 up to 8 resulting in 4 match every quarter this employee put in 8 and then pulled out the previous quarters contribution the company match continued to grow   was it smart he still ended up with 8 going into the 401k. in those pre enron days the law allowed companies to limit the company match to 100 company stock which meant that employees retirement was at risk of course by the early 2000 's the stock that was purchased for $ 6 a share was worth $ 80 a share now what about the irs since i make designated roth contributions from after tax income can i make tax free withdrawals from my designated roth account at any    time no the same restrictions on withdrawals that apply to pre tax    elective contributions also apply to designated roth contributions if    your plan permits distributions from accounts because of hardship you    may choose to receive a hardship distribution from your designated    roth account the hardship distribution will consist of a pro rata    share of earnings and basis and the earnings portion will be included    in gross income unless you have had the designated roth account for 5    years and are either disabled or over age 59 regarding getting just contributions what happens if i take a distribution from my designated roth account before the end of the year period if you take a distribution from your designated roth account before    the end of the year period it is a nonqualified    distribution you must include the earnings portion of the    nonqualified distribution in gross income however the basis or    contributions portion of the nonqualified distribution is not    included in gross income the basis portion of the distribution is    determined by multiplying the amount of the nonqualified distribution    by the ratio of designated roth contributions to the total designated    roth account balance for example if a nonqualified distribution of    $ 5,000 is made from your designated roth account when the account    consists of $ of designated roth contributions and $ 600 of    earnings the distribution consists of $ of designated roth    contributions that are not includible in your gross income and $ 300    of earnings that are includible in your gross income see regarding rollovers of designated roth contributions for    additional rules for rolling over both qualified and nonqualified    distributions from designated roth accounts

no   if the share price drops to $ 0 it 's likely that the company is in bankruptcy usually debt holders especially holders of senior debt are paid first and you 're entitled to whatever the bankruptcy proceedings decide to give holders of equity after the debt holders are paid off more often than not equity holders probably wo n't get much to give an example corporate bankruptcy usually involves one of two options liquidation or reorganization in the us these are called chapter 7 and chapter 11 bankruptcy respectively canada and the united kingdom also have similar procedures for corporations although in the uk reorganization is often referred to as administration many countries have similar procedures in place i 'll use the us as an example because it 's what i 'm most familiar with in chapter 7 bankruptcy the company is liquidated to pay its debts investopedia 's article about bankruptcy states during chapter 7 bankruptcy investors are considered especially low on the ladder usually the stock of a company undergoing chapter 7 proceedings is usually worthless and investors lose the money they invested if you hold a bond you might receive a fraction of its face value what you receive depends on the amount of assets available for distribution and where your investment ranks on the priority list on the first page in chapter 11 bankruptcy the company is turned over to a trustee that guides it through a reorganization the investopedia article quotes the sec to describe what happens to stockholders when this happens during chapter 11 bankruptcy bondholders stop receiving interest and principal payments and stockholders stop receiving dividends if you are a bondholder you may receive new stock in exchange for your bonds new bonds or a combination of stock and bonds if you are a stockholder the trustee may ask you to send back your stock in exchange for shares in the reorganized company the new shares may be fewer in number and worth less the reorganization plan spells out your rights as an investor and what you can expect to receive if anything from the company the exact details will depend on the reorganization plan that 's worked out local laws court agreements etc for example in the case of general motor 's bankruptcy stockholders in the company before reorganization were left with worthless shares and were not granted shares in the new company

why do n't you just put your down payment on one of your credit cards note i 'm not actually suggesting that you do this please read on there are a few reasons why you would n't or could n't do this the interest rates on the cards you have is very high   you do n't have enough of a credit limit on any one of your cards for the down payment   these two reasons highlight the answer to your question   credit card companies charge very high interest rates these high rates allow them to make money even when some of their customers default they know that not everyone will pay them back so they make sure to make a hefty profit on those who do   secondly credit card limits are often much lower than the amounts of car and home loans this limits the risk to the credit card company sure you have $ 100,000 in total credit limit but this is split among nine different companies   when a bank offers a traditional loan for a large sum of money at relatively low interest they need to be able to limit their risk somehow they do this by ensuring that their customers actually have the ability to pay them back

i 've done various side work over the years computer consulting writing and i briefly had a video game company so i 've gone through most of this disclaimer i have never been audited which may mean that everything i put on my tax forms looked plausible to the irs and so is probably at least generally right but it also means that the irs has never put their stamp of approval on my tax forms so that said 1 you do not need to form an llc to be able to claim business expenses whether you have any expenses or not you will have to complete a schedule c. on this form are places for expenses in various categories note that the categories are the most common type of expenses there 's an other space if you have something different if you have any property that is used both for the business and also for personal use you must calculate a business use percentage for example if you bought a new printer and 60 of the time you use it for the business and 40 of the time you use it for personal stuff then 60 of the cost is tax deductible in general the irs expects you to calculate the percentage based on amount of time used for business versus personal though you are allowed to use other allocation formulas like for a printer i think you 'd get away with number of pages printed for each but if the business use is not 100 you must keep records to justify the percentage you ca n't just say oh i think business use must have been about 3/4 of the time you have to have a log where you write down every time you use it and whether it was business or personal also the irs is very suspicious of business use of cars and computers because these are things that are readily used for personal purposes if you own a copper mine and you buy a mine boring machine odds are you are n't going to take that home to dig in your backyard but a computer can easily be used to play video games or send emails to friends and relatives and lots of things that have nothing to do with a business so if you 're going to claim a computer or a car be prepared to justify it you can claim office use of your home if you have one or more rooms or designated parts of a room that are used regularly and exclusively for business purposes that is if you turn the family room into an office you can claim home office expenses but if like me you sit on the couch to work but at other times you sit on the couch to watch tv then the space is not used exclusively for business purposes also the irs is very suspicious of home office deductions i 've never tried to claim it it 's legal just make sure you have all your ducks in a row if you claim it skip 2 for the moment 3 yes you must pay taxes on your business income if you have not created an llc or a corporation then your business income is added to your wage income to calculate your taxes that is if you made say $ 50,000 salary working for somebody else and $ 10,000 on your side business then your total income is $ 60,000 and that 's what you pay taxes on the total amount you pay in income taxes will be the same regardless of whether 90 came from salary and 10 from the side business or the other way around the rates are the same it 's just one total number if the withholding on your regular paycheck is not enough to cover the total taxes that you will have to pay then you are required by law to pay estimated taxes quarterly to make up the difference if you do n't you will be required to pay penalties so you do n't want to skip on this basically you are supposed to be withholding from yourself and sending this in to the government it 's possible that this wo n't be an issue if you 're used to getting a big refund and the refund is more than what the tax on your side business will come to then you might end up still getting a refund just a smaller one but you do n't want to guess about this get the tax forms and figure out the numbers i think and please do n't rely on this check on it that the law says that you do n't pay a penalty if the total tax that was withheld from your paycheck plus the amount you paid in estimated payments is more than the tax you owed last year so like lets say that this year just to make up some numbers your employer withheld $ 4,000 from your paychecks at the end of the year you did your taxes and they came to $ 3,000 so you got a $ 1,000 refund this year your employer again withholds $ 4,000 and you paid $ 0 in estimated payments your total tax on your salary plus your side business comes to $ 4,500 you owe $ 500 but you wo n't have to pay a penalty because the $ 4,000 withheld is more than the $ 3,000 that you owed last year but if next year you again do n't make estimated payment so you again have $ 4,000 withheld plus $ 0 estimated and then you owe $ 5,000 in taxes you will have to pay a penalty because your withholding was less than what you owed last year to you had paid $ 500 in estimated payments you 'd be okay you 'd still owe $ 500 but you would n't owe a penalty because your total payments were more than the previous year 's liability clear as mud do n't forget that you probably will also owe state income tax if you have a local income tax you 'll owe that too scott mentioned self employment tax you 'll owe that too note that self employment tax is different from income tax self employment tax is just social security tax on self employed people you 're probably used to seeing the percent it is these days withheld from your paycheck that 's really only half your social security tax the other half is not shown on your pay stub because it is not subtracted from your salary if you 're self employed you have to pay both halves or about 15 you file a form se with your income taxes to declare it 4 if you pay your quarterly estimated taxes well the point of estimated taxes is that it 's supposed to be close to the amount that you will actually owe next april 15 so if you get it at least close then you should n't owe a lot of money in april i usually try to arrange my taxes so that i get a modest refund do n't loan the government a lot of money but do n't owe anything april 15 either once you take care of any business expenses and taxes what you do with the rest of the money is up to you right though if you 're unsure of how to spend it let me know and i 'll send you the address of my kids colleges and you can donate it to their tuition fund i think this would be a very worthy and productive use of your money back to 2 i just recently acquired a financial advisor i ca n't say what a good process for finding one is this guy is someone who goes to my church and who me after bible study one day to make his sales pitch but i did talk to him about his fees and what he told me was this if i have enough money in an investment account then he gets a commission from the investment company for bringing the business to them and that 's the total compensation he gets from me that commission comes out of the management fees they charge and those management fees are in the same ballpark as the fees i was paying for private investment accounts so basically he is not costing me anything he 's getting his money from the kickbacks he said that if i had not had enough accumulated assets he would have had to charge me an hourly fee i did n't ask how much that was had n't meant to write such a long answer

well what you said about money is the reason people say things are only worth what people are willing to pay for them there is plenty of economic reasons to for instance conserve and the environment because deforestation and destruction have negative externalities associated with that have to paid out in the future by who ever suffers from those externalities however there is n't a market for eco bonds or a way to value that effectively which is a real issue for ecological conservation   there are people trying to do what and there is an interesting article this week in the new scientist about such nexus between and economics but while there is clear value somewhere assigning it a price only works if people are willing to buy or invest in it    its quite sad how many of the critics of modern banking do n't really appreciate what they do and what finance does or more commonly confusion arises about what finance even is let alone what it does

generally for tax questions you should talk to a tax adviser do n't consider anything i write here as a tax advice and the answer was not intended or written to be used and it can not be used by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer does irs like one payment method over other or they simply do n't care    as long as she can show the receipts they do n't care as long as she withholds the taxes 30 unless specific arrangements are made for otherwise she should withhold 30 of the payment and send it to the irs the recipient should claim refund if the actual tax liability is lower it 's only consulting work at the moment so most of the communication    is done over phone should they start engaging in written    communication to keep records of the work done yes if she wants it to be a business expense is it okay to pay in one go to save money transferring fees can she    pay in advance again she can do whatever she wants but if she wants to account for it on her tax returns she should do it the same way she would pay any other vendor in her business she can not use different accounting methods for different vendors basically she has not outsourced work in previous years and she    wants to avoid any red flags then she should start by calling on her tax adviser and not an anonymous internet forum

in the uk there is a significant difference between taking money out of a bank account and out of a credit card account banks typically require explicit authorisation before they will transfer money out of a bank account for example a direct debit agreement north american banks are much less strict and will transfer your money to any reasonably reputable financial organization who asks for it do n't get me started however credit cards run very differently essentially the onus is on the vendor to get the authorization which is why you can sign a credit card slip at the corner store or give your credit card details over the phone or fill in an online form and have your credit card account charged when you signed the credit card agreement you agreed to let people do this it 's also why the credit card company will reverse a transaction if you claim it was unauthorized so essentially paypal is like the specialty store you phone up to order something and give your credit card details to they have just as much authorization to charge your account your only protection is that the credit card company will investigate any transactions you claim are fraudulent and will reimburse you if it even if they ca n't recover the money themselves

in canada the majority of your taxes are remitted by the employer on your behalf after the employer deducts the calculated amount from your pay then when you file your income tax return you pay or get reimbursed the difference from your particular social situation note that this is optional the employer has to pay its own part of some deductions but the employee can opt out from getting the standard amount of income tax deducted at source it is his responsibility alone to pay for his taxes so in this context it 's entirely possible to advertise an approximate net salary most of the accounting over here is done by way of accounting software and those that support payroll go through a testing and acceptance phase for each revision to the tax tables so the amount calculated is usually pretty exact i got reimbursed 120 $ last year

the can and the should have been discussed in other answers and comments   and so i will discuss the how   as others have noted it is important to make sure that the additional money goes to reducing principal and not towards   prepayment of interest   unfortunately very few bank tellers understand how mortgages work and very few bank officers even loan officers understand how mortgages work too thus a statement that you want the extra money to go towards principal will likely be met with a blank look furthermore what they do with the money and how it is entered on the bank books that afternoon when the transactions are recorded may have no to what was discussed and agreed to earlier in the day   based on my personal experiences and   many arguments with banks about how they handled my prepayments and how interest was computed i would   recommend the following which is easier now that automated payments are possible for the standard monthly payment and additional payments are possible via electronic funds transfer make sure that automated payments are made on the day that the payment is due not at the end of the ten day grace period that banks love to grant you for making the monthly payment yes there is no penalty for late payment as long as you pay before the end of the grace period but interest continues to be charged and so more of each delayed payment goes to interest   and less towards principal make the additional payment on the same day as the standard monthly mortgage payment is made this ensures that at worst just one day 's interest is owing when the additional payment is made also payment in the middle of the monthly cycle is an almost sure way of getting ripped off on the interest because the bank 's computers will post the payment in the manner most favorable to them and usually contrary to the terms of your mortgage   i have   complained to banks about mid month payments and won every time and on many occasions the bank officer would say we have always done it this way and nobody   ever complained till you did today i doubt very much if the bank 's programs got changed as a result of my complaints if you are not sure how mortgages work and how interest   is calculated or do n't have the time or inclination to go hassle with the bank each time but do prefer not to get ripped off make the payment as described on the dot and at the same time as the regularly scheduled monthly payment the amortization schedule that the bank should have given you shows how much the principal amount is after the monthly   payment is made on each due date   assuming that you have   not been taking advantage of the grace periods and so the schedule is correct make an additional payment not of a round sum but an exact amount down to the last penny that will jump you from principal owing after today 's regular payment to principal owing after the regular payment n months from today here of course you choose n based on how much extra money you were planning on paying towards your mortgage   by making the extra payment you will effectively have cut the length of   the mortgage by n months and the same amortization schedule will apply over the shorter period   since very little of the principal is repaid in the early life of the mortgage an additional principal only payment can reduce the length of the mortgage by years paying a specific amount that matches the amortization schedule also helps if you ever need to hassle with the bank it is their print out you are arguing from and not trying to explain to a clueless bank officer how the bank did not compute interest   correctly after you paid $ extra at beginning of last month

let p denote the amount of the investment r the rate of return and i the rate of inflation   for simplicity assume that the payment p is made annually right after the return has been earned   thus at the end if the year the investment p has increased to and p is returned as the annuity payment if i = 0 the entire return can be paid out as the payment and thus p = that is at the end of the year when the dust settles after the return has been collected and paid out as the annuity payment p is again available at the beginning of the next year to earn return at rate r. we have p = p if i > 0 then at the end of the year after the dust settles we can not afford to have only p available as the investment for next year next year 's payment must be p*(1+i and so we need a larger investment since the rate of return is fixed   how much larger   well if the investment at the beginning of next year is p*(1+i it will earn exactly enough additional money to pay out the increased payment for next year and have enough left over to help towards future increases in payments note   that we are assuming that r > i. if r < i a perpetuity can not be created   thus suppose that we choose p such that p = p*(1+i    multiplying this equation by we have p*(1+i = in words at the start of next year the investment is p*(1+i and the return less the increased payout of p*(1+i leaves an investment of for the following year   each year the payment and the amount to be invested for the following year increase by a factor of solving p = p*(1+i for p we get   p = i   as the initial perpetuity payment and the payment increases by a factor each year   the initial investment is p and it also increases by a factor of each year in later years the investment is at the start of the year the payment is and the amount invested for the next year is this is the same result as obtained by the op but written in terms that i can understand that is without the financial jargon about discount rates pv fv and the like

it 's more complicated than that governments raise money in a number of ways   first they tax economic activity within their borders and for connected companies and individuals   then some governments have actual revenues from state owned enterprises licences patents courts business revenues and so on whatever shortage arises between state expenditure and this income is the deficit which is usually financed through debt government usually issues a bond wikipedia for a list of government bonds of various types some with extremely lengthy maturation dates   these bonds can be purchased both locally and by foreign investment funds   the nature of who buys is important from the wikipedia link you 'll see that most government debt is very highly rated based on the ability of the state to simply raise taxes in order to fund redemption   pension funds are legally bound to only invest in highly rated investment classes and the bulk of bonds may be purchased to support local pensioners a state that defaults on debt will first hit its own most vulnerable citizens   in addition the fall out will result in a cut in ratings   countries like argentina and zimbabwe which have both refused to repay their debts even to the imf are currently unable to raise investment at all   this has a tremendous impact on local economic development so default is out of the question without severe penalties the second part of your question is about paying down the debt   as debts increase more and more of the revenue that a country does earn is spent on servicing debt repayments   sometimes bonds are issued merely to refinance old debt   a country that spends too much on refinancing debt is no different from an individual   less and less money is available to do other things in conclusion governments can neither default nor binge borrow unless they wish to severely limit economic opportunities for their citizens

of the two an option is a more reliable but more expensive means to get rid of a stock as sdg said a put option is basically an insurance policy on the stock you pay a certain price for the contract itself which locks in a sale price up to a particular future date if the stock depreciates significantly you exercise the option and get the contract price otherwise you let the contract expire and keep the stock long term these are bad bets as each expired contract will offset earnings but if you foresee a near term steep drop in the stock price but are n't quite sure a put option is good peace of mind a sell stop order is generally cheaper but less reliable you set a trigger price say a loss of 10 of the stock 's current value if that threshold is reached the stop order becomes a sell order and the broker will sell the stock on the market take his commission or a fixed price depending on your broker and you get the rest however there has to be a buyer willing to buy at that price at the moment the trigger fires if a stock has lost 10 rapidly it 's probably on the way down hard and the order might not complete until you realize a 12 loss or a 15 or even 20 a sell stop limit a combination stop order and limit order allows you to say that you want to sell if the stock drops to $ x but not sell if it drops below $ x y. this allows you to limit realized losses by determining a band within which it should be sold and not to sell above or below that price these are cheaper because you only pay for the order if it is executed successfully if you never need it it 's free or very cheap some brokers will charge a token service fee to maintain a stop or stop limit however if the price drops very quickly or you specify too narrow a band the stock can drop through that band too quickly to execute the sell order and you end up with a severely depreciated stock and an unexercised order this can happen if the company whose stock you own buys another company very quickly both stocks will adjust the buying company will often plummet inside a few seconds after news of the merger is announced based on the steep drop in working capital and/or the infusion of a large amount of new stock in the buying company to cover the equity of the purchased company you end up with devalued stock and a worthless option but one company buying another is not usually reason to sell if the purchase is a good idea their stock will recover another option which may be useful to you is a swaption this basically amounts to buying a put option on one financial instrument and a call on another rolled into one option contract specifying a swap this allows you to pick something you think would rise if your stock fell and exchange your stock for it at your option for example say the stock on which you buy this swaption is an airline stock and you contract the option to swap for oil if oil surges the airline 's stock will tank sharply and you win both ways avoiding loss and realizing a gain you 'd also win if either half of this option realized a gain over the option price oil could surge or the airline could tank and you could win you could even do this naked since its your option if the airline 's stock tanks you buy it at the crashed price to exercise the option and then do so the downside is a higher option cost the seller will be no fool so if your position appears to be likely anyone who 'd bet against you by selling you this option will want a pretty high return

what 's the primary factor keeping a consumer from handing out fees as as corporations or small businesses do power can an individual or more appropriately what keeps an individual from being able to charge fine or penalize a business if it could be accomplished but at a high cost let 's assume it 's based on principal and not monetary gain and have a legal entitlement to money back   no   you are of course welcome to send your doctor a letter stating that you would like $ 50 to make up for your two hour wait last time around but there 's no legal obligation for him to pay up unless he signed a contract stating that he would do so corporations also can not simply send you a fine or fee and expect you to pay it you must have either agreed to pay it in the past or now agree to pay it in exchange for something in these cases the corporations have the power you have to agree to their rules to play ball    however consumers do have a significant power as well in well competed markets the power to do business with someone else   you do n't like the fee   buy from amazon which offers free shipping on returns   you do n't like paying a no show fee from the doctor   find a doctor without one or with a more forgiving fee or with a low enough that you do n't have to make appointments early   your ability to fine them exists as your ability to not continue to patronize them in some markets though consumers do n't have a lot of power for example cable television or other utilities the fcc has a list of customer service standards which cable companies are required to meet and many states have additional rules requiring penalties for missed or late appointments tougher than that    and in the case of the doctor if your doctor is late find one that is   or try sending him a bill   it does apparently work from time to time particularly if the doctor wants to keep your business

the main reason for paying your mortgage off quickly is to reduce risk should a crisis happen   if you do n't have a house payment you have much higher cash flow every month and your day to day living expenses are much lower so if an illness or job loss happens you 'll be in a much better position to handle it you should have a good emergency fund in place before throwing extra money at the mortgage so that you can cover the bigger surprises that come along there is the argument that paying off your mortgage ties up cash that could be used for other things but you need to be honest with yourself would you really invest that money at a high enough rate of return to make up your mortgage interest rate after taxes   or would you spend it on other things   if you do invest it how certain are you of that rate of return   paying off the mortgage saves you your mortgage interest rate guaranteed finally there is the more intangible aspect of what it feels like to be completely debt free with no payments whatsoever   that feeling can be a game changer for people and it can free you up to do things that you could never do when you 're saddled with a mortgage payment every month

the service processors are providing is absorbing the risk   the flow goes roughly and i say roughly because it 's a complicated process   1 you swipe insert your card at bob 's house of and get charged $ 10 for a bucket of ramen or something 2 the device you swipe your card in a terminal the card number amount and some other transaction details and contacts a payment gateway    3 the gateway the of data and is responsible for determining the issuing financial institution chase us bank etc 4 the gateway contacts the above and asks can card 555 charge $ 10 5 the gateway also sends this answer to the processor    5 the processor immediately that yes no back to the merchant 's terminal 6 the processor having a transaction id and a yes no sends the response to the merchant 's systems so your receipt can be printed or order processed and so on    7 meanwhile the processor has a transaction id and is busy figuring out things like interchange fees   the amount depends on a whole host of things and almost everyone involved in the process wants their cut the bank the gateway the processor and it all depends on the type of card customer rewards and so on    8 at the end of the day week whatever the processor collects money from the issuing financial institution and is responsible for giving the right amount less fees to the merchant     the processor here also the risk and costs for things like chargebacks as almost everyone in that chain gateway issuing bank want their pound of flesh for a chargeback and often the processor does n't pass that full cost on to the merchant and instead does some risk analysis to determine if they think this merchant is going to be okay to do business with     that 's what you 're paying for

a quick craigslist search in my area new england pops up a number of in claimed good running condition in the $ 2000 $ 5000 range so it 's not too good to be true that a motivated seller would sell one slightly below market selling things is a lot of work and lowering prices is essentially paying the buyer to not make you do that work of course you should still do you due diligence if the seller objects to you doing this then you should be suspicious inexperienced sellers e.g. a widow whose husband may have handled these things in the past might get spooked by asking to take it to a mechanic so be prepared to on that front   otherwise it 's no more risk than any used vehicle purchase

gambling is never a wise investment even assuming that the stated odds are correct there can be multiple winners and the jackpot is shared between the winners so the individual payout can be significantly less than the total jackpot if i were to take a dollar from you and a dollar from your buddy on the promise that i 'd give the two of you a total of $ 3 back if you both guessed the result of a single fair coin toss would you take the offer note also that the jackpot value is quite misleading it 's the sum of the annual payments and if you reduce that to present value it 's significantly less

i do n't think its a taxable event since no income has been constructively received talking about the rsu shareholders here i believe you 're right with the irc and the basis of the rsu is the basis of the original stock option probably zero edit see below however once the stock becomes vested then it is a taxable event not when the cash is received but when the chance of forfeiture diminishes even if the employee does n't sell the stock and is an ordinary income not capital that is my understanding of the situation do not consider it as a tax advice in any way i gave it a bit more though and i do n't think irc is relevant you 're not doing any exchange or conversion here because you did n't have anything to convert to begin with and do n't have anything after the conversion your iso 's are forfeited and no longer available basically you treat them as you 've never had them what happened is that you 've received rsu 's and you treat them as a regular rsu grant based on its vesting schedule the tax consequences are exactly as i described in my original response you recognize ordinary income on the vested stocks as they vest your basis is zero i.e. the whole fmv of the stock at the time of vesting is your ordinary income it should also be reflected in your w2 accordingly

there are only two ways to increase your savings you are young and both of these are likely to happen you will be promoted and get raises and your loans will be paid off removing the loan payment it would seem that you need only to wait a year or so and there will a lot more than $ 87 left over each month and your savings will grow almost without any action from you but somehow that is not what happens in real life as people get older they need more than they did before larger home more expensive things etc and they never manage to get around to saving so it 's great that you are wondering how to do it but you are not truly making it a priority you mention that you also pay spend for friends the internet play joy cloth gifts book etc and this entirely optional spending is the difference between such precision and 90 of your salary in other words it is 17 18 or more than your rent think about that for a moment every month you spend more than your rent on friends play joy books and good old etc if you were to cut that in half you could save 8 or 9 of your salary maybe after your next raise you can get that up to 10 how can you cut that optional fun stuff in half well i do n't know because i do n't know what it is and i suspect you do n't either so track it for a month or two are you getting takeout food or coffee every day are you always the one who pays when you go out with friends do you eat in restaurants a lot do you always wear the latest buy $ 500 shoes pay people to do your nails or dye your hair buy a new phone every year have the top end phone plan top end cable plan you have to know where that worth of money goes every month then you can figure out how to send some of it to savings instead   in some ways you are in a hard generation your parents did n't need to save for their retirement because they had you and they know you will send money home for them but you probably do n't expect the same from the children you do n't have yet so you have to save for yourself this is a challenge if you were saving the money you send your parents you 'd be fine yet you do n't want to reduce what you send they need it still people have faced bigger challenges and overcome them start by understanding where your fun money is going then look at how to send some aim for half of that to savings instead you wo n't regret it

the failure of the facebook ipo has everything to do with public access to markets it certainly was overvalued at issue and there were a host of other problems as well but the main issue that has caused the problem is that there were too many armchair analysts in on it less investors got in on facebook at $ 38 + because they liked facebook and everyone they knew liked facebook by and large they could n't read a balance sheet or describe how the firm made money as such as soon as it began to decline they sold without regard for the loss very few if any professionals actually it at launch and more than one pro shorted the position and cleaned up i find it humorous that while most people would never think of trying to buy a house a realtor they are perfectly happy buying thier own stocks without professional advice say what you want about the finance industry but for the vast majority of people having an advisor is a far smarter option

because a paying down a liability and thus gaining asset equity is not technically an expense gnucash will not include it in any expense reports however you can abuse the system a bit to do what you want   the mortgage payment should be divided into principle interest and escrow tax insurance accounts for example a mortgage payment will then be a split transaction that puts money into these accounts from your bank account for completeness the escrow account will periodically be used to pay actual expenses which just moves the expense from escrow into insurance or tax this is nice so that expenses for a month are n't inflated due to a tax payment being made now this is all fairly typical and results in all but the principle part of the mortgage payment being included in expense reports the trick then is to duplicate the principle portion in a way that it makes its way into your expenses one way to do this is to create a principle expense account and also a fictional equity account that provides the funds to pay it every time you record a mortgage payment add a transfer from this equity account into the principle payments expense account this will mess things up at some level since you 're inventing an expense that does not truly exist but if you 're using gnucash more to monitor monthly cash flow it causes the income expense report to finally make sense example transaction split

the thing you need to keep in mind is that if you take on debt you need to have a plan to pay it off and execute on it   you also need to understand what your carrying cost is what you will pay in finance charges every month   there are times when you need to take on debt in order to be a productive person   for example in many places in the us you need a car in order to have a job   it 's ludicrous for someone to assert that you should n't take on any debt in order to get a reliable vehicle   that does n't mean you go out and lease the car that you can get on your income in this case i 'd say it 's a bit of a grey area   could you live in an apartment for a while   perhaps   many people would have a hard time living like that and it could affect your ability to perform at work   i would argue that buying a decent mattress to sleep on falls under the same category as getting a car so that you can work   you do n't want to be missing work because your back is in from sleeping on the floor or a worn out mattress as far as the rest of it goes it really depends on how fast you can pay it off   if you are looking at more than a few months 6 tops to pay off the purchase in full you should reassess   realize that the interest you are paying is increasing the cost of the furniture and act accordingly   as mentioned you can often get 0 financing for a limited period   understand that if you do n't pay off the entire balance in that period you will normally be retroactively charged interest on the entire starting amount and that interest rate will likely be quite high the problem with credit is when you start using it and continually growing the balance   it 's easy to keep saying that you will start paying it off later and the next thing you know you are buried   it 's not a big one time purchase by itself that normally gets people into trouble it 's continual spending beyond their means month after month

historically the advice was to buy the best policy possible not cheapest at the lowest price with the highest benefit   the cost relative to the benefit is very cheap and your much more likely to use disability than life insurance for instance   it is usually cheaper to pay for it with after tax dollars than to buy more insurance in theory you want to buy enough disability to replace 100 of your after tax income or more since there is no inflation protection built into most policies   insurance companies often will not sell this due to moral hazard although you may be able to combine policies to reach 80 or so    keep in mind that you will need to continue to save invest if you are on long term disability since most policies cease payment at 65 or when your eligible for social security   in addition your expenses often rise due to the increased medical expenditures possibly needing cobra private health insurance etc

i guess other than tradition and inflation probably because the merchants want them    in the us what currently costs $ 2.00 used to cost $ 0.10    so 75 years ago those individual cents made a pretty bid difference   inflation causes prices to go up but does n't get us to just change our currencies patterns in your example you are assuming that in an average day the rounding errors you are willing to accept happen a couple of times   2 or 3 cents here and there mean nothing to you   however to the merchant doing hundreds or thousands of transactions per day those few cents up and down mean quite a bit in terms of profit to an individual looking at a time frame more than a single day because who only participates in economies for a single day there are potentially millions of transactions in a lifetime mean potentially giving away millions of dollars because they did n't want to wait and as for the comment that people working each 3 cents every 10 seconds i would assume at least some of the time when they are waiting for rounding errors they are not at work getting paid   that concept is assuming that somebody is always willing to pay them for their time regardless of where that person is in the world i have no facts and wild assumptions but surely that ca n't be true for even a majority of workers finally you should be happy if you happy to have an income high enough that you do n't care about individual cents   but there are those business people who see opportunity in folks like you and profit greatly from it   i personally worry very much about who has my money gov't gets paid to the penny and i expect returns to the penny   a super polite service employee who a lot serving me a beer is getting all the rounding errors i have

you need to find out exactly   how the two accounts are titled if an account   is an ugma uniform gifts to minors act account that is in your name with your mother father as custodian then you are entitled to all the money in the account when you become an adult if the account is indeed a ugma account   the bank is supposed to not let the custodian operate the account once the   child becomes an adult but this does not always happen   there was a   question earlier on money se which i can not find at this time in which   the 25-year old person asking the question claimed that   his father was still buying and selling shares in his ugma brokerage   account and the irs was asking why the profits and losses from these transactions were not being reported on the 25-year old 's tax return money in an ugma account is not supposed to be used for payment of household expenses food etc which is the parent 's responsibility during the minority but this can well be abused as to whether money was taken out and then restored or possibly not restored as you seem to suspect it is possible to sue the custodian for improper handling of the ugma account and recover the funds but whether one wants to sue a parent over what might be a relatively small sum is another matter consider whether most of what is recovered might go to pay legal fees or other costs of the recovery process and will likely ruin a family relationship if the accounts are titled as joint accounts then either party can empty the account without informing the other but doing so would need information about the account number etc which you may not have for tax purposes there is also the issue of whose social security   number is listed on the account yours or your parent 's see also this answer   for a view of what happens from the other side

in general you are allowed to deduct up to $ 50/month per student see page 4 but only if you are n't reimbursed in your case since you are receiving a stipend the full $ 2000 will be treated as taxable income but the question of is it worth it really depends on how much you will actually spend and also what you 'll get from the experience suppose you actually spend $ 1000/month to host them and if your combined tax rate is 35 you 'll pay $ 700 in additional taxes each month but you 'll still profit $ 300 each month if your primary motivation for hosting students is to make a profit you could consider creating a business out of it if you do that you will be able to deduct all of your legitimate business expenses which in the above example would be $ 1000/month keeping with that example you would now pay taxes on $ 1000 instead of $ 2000 which would be $ 350 meaning your profit would now be $ increasing your profit by $ 350/month you will only need to keep spending records if you plan to go the business route my advice assume you wo n't be going the business route and then figure out what your break even point is based on your tax rate the formula is max you can spend per month without losing money = 2000 2000 t e.g. if t = 35 the break even point is $ 1300 side note my family hosted 5 students in 5 years and it was always a fantastic experience but it is also a very big commitment teenagers eat a lot and they drive cars and go on dates and play sports and need help with their homework especially english papers and they do n't seem to like bed times or imho it 's totally worth it even without the stipend

most of the time you 're selling to other investors not back to the company the stock market is a collection of bid buy offers and asks sell offers when you sell your stock as a retail investor at the market price you 're essentially just meeting whatever standing bid offers are on the market   for very liquid stocks e.g. apple you can pretty much always get the displayed price because so many stocks are being traded however during periods of very high volatility or for low volume stocks the quoted price may not be indicative of what you actually pay   as an example let 's say you have 5 stocks you 're trying to sell and the bid side order book is 2 stocks for $ 105 2 for $ 100 and 5 for $ 95 in this scenario the quoted price will be $ 105 the best bid price but if you accept market price you 'll settle 2 for 105 2 for 100 and 1 for 95 after your sell order goes through the new quoted price will be $ 95 for high volume stocks there will usually be so many orders near the midpoint price $ 105 in this case that you wo n't see any price slippage for small orders   you can also post limit orders which are essentially open orders waiting to be filled like in the above example they ensure you get the price you want but you have no way to guarantee they 'll be filled or not   edit as a cool example check out the bitcoin on coinbase for a live example of what the order book looks like for stocks you 'll see that the price of bitcoin will drift towards whichever direction has the less dense order book e.g. price upwards when there are far more bids than asks

there is no unique identifier that exists to identify specific shares of a stock just like money in the bank there is no real reason to identify which exact dollar bills belong to me or you so long as there is a record that i own x bills and i can access them when i want of course unlike banks there is still a 1:1 relationship between the amount i should own and the amount they actually hold if i may reach a bit the question that i assume you are asking is how are shared actually tracked transferred and recorded so that i know for certain that i traded you 20 microsoft shares yesterday and they are now officially yours given that it 's all digital while you can technically try and request a physical share certificate it 's very cumbersome to handle and transfer in that form   ownership of shares themselves are tracked for brokerage firms in the case of retail trading which i assume is the context of this question as we 're discussion personal finance your broker has a record of how many shares of x y and z you own when you bought each share and for how much and while you are the beneficial owner of record you get dividends voting rights etc your brokerage is the one who is holding the shares when you buy or sell a stock and you are matched with a counterparty the process of which is beyond the scope of this question then a process of settlement comes into play in the us settlement takes 3 working days to process and technically ownership does not transfer until the 3rd day after the trade is made though things like margin accounts will allow you to effectively act as if you own the shares immediately after a buy sell order is filled settlement in the us is done by a sole source the depository trust clearing corporation this is where retail and institutional trade all go to be sorted checked and confirmed and ultimately returned to the safekeeping of their new owners representatives your brokerage interestingly the is also the central custodian for shares both physical and virtual and that is where the shares of stock ultimately reside

i think the primary reason it is so pricey now is that it is an inflation hedge and considering how shaky the economies and out of control the spending is in many countries right now people are running to it as a safe harbor the increased demand raises the price as it does with any asset   this brings us to the question why does gold have value the same reason anything has value there is someone out there who wants it enough to trade something else of value to get it   it is in the news so much because it is so high right now which unfortunately is going to cause a lot of people to foolishly invest in it at likely the worst possible time

immigration increases the supply side of the labor market which drives down wages thus driving down costs for the companies that hire them that 's how the employers pay less   one of the major reasons why silicon valley firms are so outrageously profitable today is because they 've utilized the h-1b visas to reduce wages    some people libertarians especially would argue that even if wages within certain markets are decreased the economy as a whole is still better off since lower costs for businesses results in lower prices for consumers which can expand markets more people willing to buy stuff when it 's cheaper and the money saved can now be allocated elsewhere creating more jobs advancing technology etc   but that is a separate and much more complex discussion that involves a lot more variables in order to understand the true cost of the increased immigration including public services social crime etc versus economic benefits

after reviewing the tax treaty between new zealand and australia i think the issue is whether or not you have an interest in a permanent establishment in australia where you do business   the bank is not relevant as it is merely the vehicle by which you collect payment and would only come into the picture if you had an income bearing account which you have indicated you do not even if you work out of the offices of the australian company you do not have a financial interest in their offices and as such would pay taxes on the income in new zealand see documentation below

if we 're including psychological considerations then the question becomes much more complicated will having a higher available credit increase the temptation to spend will eliminating 100 of a small debt provide more positive reinforcement than paying off 15 of a larger debt etc if we 're looking at the pure financial impact the question is simpler the only advantage i see to prioritizing the lower interest card is the float when you buy something on a credit card interest is often calculated for that purchase starting at the beginning of the next billing cycle rather than immediately from the purchase date i 'm not clear on what policies credit card companies have on giving float for credit cards with a carried balance so you should look into what your card 's policy is   other than than paying off the higher interest rate card is better than paying off the lower interest rate on top of that you should look into whether you qualify for any of the following options presented from best to worst

as points out when people say they like having a mortgage because they get the benefit of writing off the interest they typically mean as opposed to renting you can deduct interest and real estate property tax payments as well as some closing costs in the year you purchase the home you are also building equity instead of helping your landlord build his or her equity   take for example a single person paying $ 1,000/month to rent an apartment this is not deductible he has $ 1,800 a year in other expenditures that would otherwise be deductible charitable contributions etc but he does n't itemize because it is n't more than the $ standard deduction so it does n't matter   he takes out a mortgage for $ 150,000 at 6 over a 30-year term to buy a similarly appointed home his new mortgage payment is about $ plus he puts $ 100/month into an escrow account for property taxes roughly totaling his former rent payment over the first full year he pays about $ 9,000 in deductible mortgage interest and $ 1,200 in deductible real estate taxes and because he is now itemizing he can also write off the aforementioned $ 1,800 at a top marginal tax rate of 25 he shaved nearly $ 1,500 .25 9000 + 1200 + 1800 off his federal income tax bill with the same living expenses this is a simple example with some arbitrary numbers to prove the point and there are a lot of other pros and cons to buying vs. renting but again this is probably what they mean when you hear this others have covered the overpaying angle and there are a bunch of other money se posts on the same or similar subjects

if you spoke in front of a group of people in 2001 about the possibility of be lowered you would be written off as a now s&p is talking about a negative credit outlook scary stuff it 's scary because a base assumption in any risk model is that us treasury debt is utterly reliable and comes with zero default risk so publicly about the notion that us treasury debt may be less the aaa in two years is a shock to the system and changes the way many people assess risk it 's also scary because treasury debt is auctioned will a spooked market still accept a 2.9 return for a 7 year t bill but while the prospect of a credit downgrade is truly a bad thing you also need to take the s&p statements with a grain of salt since being a named a villain during the mortgage implosion these were the guys who declared junk mortgage securities as aaa they now err on the side of doom and gloom so while things are bad they 've been bad since the bush administration was forced to put fannie mae freddie mac on the government balance sheet to stave off a bank panic the scary stuff about default in july due to the debt ceiling debate is not very credible at all unless the republican house plans on dramatically slashing spending on medicare defense or social security and have the votes to stick to that strategy the debt ceiling will be raised after much politicians talk tough but have a proven track record of creating financial problems tomorrow to fix electoral problems today

the papers you would need to buy are called futures and they give you the right to buy or sell a certain amount of oil at a certain location some large harbor typically for a certain price on a certain day you can typically sell these futures anytime if you find someone that buys them and depending on the direction you bought you will make or lose money according to oil rice changes if you have the future to get oil for 50 $ and the market price is 60 this paper is obviously worth 10 $ note that you will have to sell the future at some day before it runs out or you get real oil in some harbor somewhere for it which might not be very useful to you as most traders do n't want really any oil that might happen automatically or by default but you need to make sure of that note also that worst case you could lose a lot more money than you put in if you buy a future to deliver oil for 50 $ and the oil price runs you will have to procure the oil for new price meaning pay the current price for it there is no theoretical limit so depending on what you trade you could lose ten times or a thousand times what you invested i worded that without technical lingo so it is clear for beginners this is the concept not the full technical explanation

if you only have to pay 23k federal taxes on 100k that means you are in the long term capital gains tax rate which is the lower of the tax rates available first you get your federal income tax marginal tax rate and then find the matching long term capital gains tax rate for example if your marginal federal income tax rate is 28 your capital gains tax rate would be 15 or rather if the amount of the gain would put you in the 28 rate then your long term capital gains tax rate is 15 you can reduce that by having more losses if you have anything else invested anywhere that is taking a loss then you can sell that this year and it will offset the other gains you have realized the only note is that your losses have to be long term capital losses too tax loss harvesting takes this to an extreme where you sell something at a loss to lock in the tax loss but you did n't really want to get rid of that investment so then you buy a nearly identical investment ie if you owned shares of tech sector etf and it was at a loss you would sell that and then immediately buy tech sector etf the competing product that does the exact same thing then there is charity this still requires spending money and you not having it any longer if you feel that a cause can use the money more directly than the us government you can donate an appreciated asset to the charity not report a gain and also take a charitable deduction

gold is not debt money is debt whatever it is made of   in the example above everything could have been exactly the same except using certificates written on sharks instead of on paper    now sharks have value paper has value and gold has value when you print money the stuff you make it out of has some utility separate from its use as currency but when you are using it as currency regardless of what it is made from it is a marker for debt    you go to work for an hour your boss gives you a marker that you can trade for a cheeseburger or some gasoline or a or or whatever you want that marker is an iou for the work you did you give it to the store and it becomes an iou for the value of one they give it to the store employees or the grower or whatever and so on    it does n't matter what that marker is made out of its function is the same if it were gold you could melt it down and make a ring out of it if it 's paper you could use it as a bookmark or a shopping list or to blow your nose if it 's a shark you scare people with it in the pool   this is totally separate from the question of whether we should be using gold as a currency which has to do with the fact that the gold supply is a lot more stable than the paper supply and whether being able to easily print more money on demand is a good thing or a bad thing

this depends on here in the us where i am interest rates were around 3.9 when i fixed my mortgage this underperforms the market e.g. a total market etf like $ vti or an sp500 etf like $ voo have expected returns of the current market growth rate so in theory i am better off paying into the market and making returns greater than my interest rate rather than paying into the equity   however past market returns do not guarantee future market returns the market could reset it could crash are you willing to accept this risk you have to analyze what happens if the market suffers say a 30 correction and you lose a lot of money quickly   i would certainly not invest in individual non etf stocks or you are really exposing yourself to risk

debit cards with the visa or mastercard symbol on them work technically everywhere where credit cards work there are some limitations where the respective business does not accept them for example car rentals want a credit card for potential extra charges but most of the time for day to day shopping and dining debit cards work fine however you should read up the potential risks a credit card gives you some security by incorrect fraudulent charges from your account and credit card companies also help you reverse incorrect charges before you ever have to pay for it if you use a debit card it is your money on the line immediately any incorrect charge even takes your money from your account and it is gone while you work on reversing the charge any theft and your account can be cleaned out and you will be without money while you go after the thief many people consider the debit card risk too high and do n't use them for this reason however many people do use them it is up to you

i 'd say there 's a lot of oversight in the public companies like maintaining transparency to the public by having public consultations and sending out lots of communication there 's also the way budgets are managed in public companies that are very different from a private company so there 's way more oversight into where the money goes the reason public projects take so long generally falls under these considerations   private companies at least where i 'm from also have to follow some pretty strict rules that there is a lot of pushback on but considering that a lot of the oversight boils down to things like do n't increase traffic by x amount without creating a route do n't increase flows to a river that would flood out people downstream do n't build houses so close together that a fire can jump from one to the next etc but i agree with having the strict regulation because it means that in fifty years we wo n't have the same massive problems that there have been before   also it 's a tough sell to get some things done by private investment like a country road so it 's a lot easier to have the government do it that 's why there 's usually a division between capital works and development where capital works will build the roads and in existing areas while development will be and industrial complexes where the developer has to put in all of the infrastructure as part of their development that they 're making sales or rentals to turn a profit on so there is a balance but it 's capital works that gets the most media attention for being horrible and in need of repair

you are not locked in to this percentage of new money forever you may change it every paycheck pick a split that makes you feel comfortable then revisit how you allocate new money every year if congress makes changes to the brackets or your compensation changes or the rules regarding retirement funds changes adjust accordingly note that the roth ira came long after the ira and that the roth 401 k came long after the 401k. you have no idea what types of investments you will be able to contribute to with your next employer or how your martial situation and income will change the scope of available retirement options heck you can even convert non roth to roth in the future if that makes sense pick a percentage for now but do n't forget to revisit it

i think the idea here is that because of the way mortgages are amortized you can drop additional principal payments in the early years of the mortgage and significantly lower the overall interest expense over the life of the loan a heloc accrues interest like a credit card so if you make a large principal payment using a heloc you will be able to retire those chunks of debt quicker than if you made normal mortgage payments i have n't worked out the numbers but i suspect that you could achieve similar results by simply paying ahead making even one extra payment per year will take 7 9 years off of a 30 year loan i think that the advantage of the heloc approach is that if you borrow enough you may be able to recalculate lower the payment of the mortgage

my feeling on this is that anything to do with a child and raising a family has to be a joint effort it is very rare that both of you will have exactly the same income or the same time to spend into caring for your family so work out what you can do for us i work 70 + hour weeks my wife works 18 hour weeks far more of my money goes on clothes kids food etc than her money because that is where the bulk of our income is from it 's just part of sharing she does n't feel dependent and when she was on maternity leave 3 times the agreement was that we would just rely on my income i have the same attitude as you it is a shared pool that you each contribute to in your own way and once the essentials are paid for this includes post pregnancy clothing then you can worry about other bits and pieces having said that while most of our finances are shared we do each keep a separate account for buying gifts things for ourselves etc which gives some flexibility

the hardest part seems to be knowing exactly when to sell the stock   well yes that 's the problem with all stock investing reports come out all the time sometimes even from very smart people with no motivation to lie about expected earnings for this company or for that industry whether those predictions come true is something you will only find out with time what you are considering is using financial information available to you and equally available to the public to make investment choices this is called fundamental analysis that is the analysis of the fundamentals of a business and what it should be worth it forms the basis of how many investment firms decide where to put their money   in a perfectly efficient market all information available to the public is immediately factored into the market price for that company 's stock ie if a bank report states with absolute certainty through leaked documents that coca cola is going to announce 10 revenue growth tomorrow then everyone will immediately buy coca cola stock today and then tomorrow there would be no impact even if pwc is 100 accurate in its predictions if the rest of the market agrees with them then the price at the time of ipo would equal the future value of the cashflows meaning there would be no gain unless results surpassed expectations so what you are proposing is to take one sliver of the information available to the public have you also read all publicly available reports on those businesses and their industries and using that to make a high risk investment are you going to do better than the investment firms that have teams of researchers and years of experience in the investment world you can do quite well by picking individual stocks but you can also lose a lot of money if you do it be aware that there is risk in doing any type of investing there is higher than average risk if you invest in equities the stock market there is higher risk still if you pick individual stocks there is yet even higher risk if you pick small startup companies   there are some specific interesting side elements with your proposal to purchase stock about to have an ipo those are better dealt with in a separate question if you want more information search this site for ipo and you should find a good starting point in short the company about to go public will hire a firm of analysts who will try to calculate the best price the public will accept for an offering of shares stock often goes up after ipo but not always sometimes the company does n't even fill its full ipo order adding a new type of risk to a potential investor that the stock will drop on day 1 consider an analogy outside the investing world   let 's say auto trader magazine prints an article that says all 2015 honda civics are worth $ 15,000 if they have less than 50,000 miles assume you have no particular knowledge about cars if you read this article and you see an ad in the paper the next day for a honda civic with 40k miles should you buy it for $ 14k the answer is not without more research and even if you determine enough about cars to find one for $ 14k that you can reasonably sell for $ 15k there 's a whole world of mechanics out there who buy and sell cars for a living and they have an edge both because they can repair the cars themselves to sell for more and also because they have experience to spot low offers faster than you and if you pick a or a stock that does n't perform even when everyone expected it would then you could lose some serious money as with buying and selling individual stocks there is money to be made from car trading but that money gets made by people who really know what they 're doing people who go in without full information are the ones who lose money in the long run

i read this so often and it 's such bullshit   do you know why robots wo n't replace fast food workers because the fast food workers are cheap dirt cheap   why do n't people realize this i guess because most people earn pretty shitty wages themselves so they do n't see how $ is next to nothing especially when your average mcdonald 's store makes $ in revenue per day 3 shifts of 6 workers means your wage costs are $ 1,080 for workers ex managers wages are 15 cost of sales   that 's nothing   would robots cost less hmm maybe how much do they cost to buy how often do you need to maintain them how much do parts cost it staff to manage them do you still need a manager to take in deliveries and is he going to stack and organize them now robots ca n't do that they lack the also are the managers going to start cleaning the toilets now doubtful and robots ca n't do that either   in other words this robots are taking over is true but robots are going to crowd out minimum wage workers is complete and total horseshit i think lower middle class and middle class office workers are being fed this line to oppose minimum wage increases which of course boost corporate margins   but they 're the ones at risk   you know who robots can replace more easily than minimum wage workers office workers secretaries actuaries investment managers marketing analysts it managers accountants journalists   do n't worry middle class america the robots are n't coming for the people who clean your toilets who cook your food and who wash your dishes no they 're coming for you

as a general proposition no you do not need to report money transfers into the us   if a transaction exceeds $ 10,000 then the bank must report it anyway   note that structuring your transactions to avoid a $ 10,000 deposit is illegal so be careful if you are moving lots of money as a general rule no transferring your own individual money from a foreign account to a us account does not incur taxes only lawyers are authorized to practice law in the us   they should generally be bar licensed in the state of practice   certified public accountants can assist you with tax preparation and return positions though tax lawyers may be necessary for some situations or for formal tax opinions   be sure to use an experienced advisor to file your tax returns and information reporting

you are making an assumption that may not be true to me some apartment debt i paid had already been sold to a collections agency before i actually paid it typically debts are sold to a debt buyer whereas a collection agency works on commission to collect debts on behalf of the creditor if your debt was actually sold you should have been notified in writing of this fact and who the new creditor was i suspect your debt was not sold because if it was the apartment complex would not have been legally allowed to cash your check when you finally paid them therefore it is most likely that the collection agency was working on commission and the apartment complex never informed them that you had settled your debt as for what to do about it here are 3 options ordered by likelihood of success good luck and if you do n't mind please update us later on what you did and what the result was your experience will be helpful for others having this issue in the future

as others have pointed out the theoretical prices in each exchange rate are identical however the cost to you may vary you need to work out the opportunity cost of using each of the three currencies because you lose money every time you convert between two currencies let 's supposed for example that you live in canada and earn and spend cad there but also happen to have some hkd to keep this simple i 'll ignore the usd but you can apply the same reasoning to that if you 're not planning on visiting hong kong for a while then your holdings of hkd are just gathering dust so your choices are to convert them to cad and make the gbp purchase in cad or to spend the hkd directly on the gbp purchase probably the first option will end up costing you more in conversion fees than the second but you need to look at the precise costs to verify this if you are planning on visiting hong kong soon and will need the hkd then the choices are somewhat different you can either spend cad on the gbp purchase or you can spend the hkd on the gbp purchase and then soon convert some cad into more hkd for your trip in this case the first option will probably end up costing you less in conversion fees

before buying a new car determine whether you really need one if there 's an automotive discussion you should ask there first to get opinions on how much all wheel drive helps you may not want to change cars at all remember most of us in the northeast are not driving all wheel drive vehicles and all cars have all wheel brakes all wheel drive is better at getting you moving from a stop if one of the drive wheels would otherwise be slipping it makes less difference during actual driving   traction control is much more important and much more common hence much cheaper and probably already present in your camry and good tires make a huge difference top of the line all season tires are adequate but many folks do switch to snow tires during the winter and switch back again in summer   tires even if you get a second set of to put them on are a heck of a lot cheaper than changing cars beyond everything else driving in winter conditions is a matter of careful practice most of the time simply avoiding making sudden starts stops turns and not driving like you 're in a video arcade got ta pass three more or i lose my game will do the job you 'll learn the feel of how the car responds some basic instruction in how to handle a will prepare you for the relatively rare times when that happens some folks actively learn by practicing in a nice open parking lot if they can find one i never have but it makes some sense if in doubt about the driving conditions wait until the roads have been and salted remember teenagers learn to do this and they 're non if they can do it you can do it before buying a new car determine whether you really need one

the blue line is illustrating the net profit or loss the investor will realise according to how the price of the underlying asset settles at expiry the x axis represents the underlying asset price   the y axis represents the profit or loss in the first case the investor has a naked put write position having sold a put option   the strike price of the put is marked as a on the x axis   the maximum profit possible is equal to the total premium received when the option contract was sold   this is represented by that portion of the blue line that is horizontal and extending from the point above that point marked a on the x axis   this corresponds to the case that the price of the underlying asset settles at or above the strike price on the day of expiry   if the underlying asset settles at a price less than the strike price on the day of expiry then the option with be in the money   therefore the net settlement value will move from a profit to a loss depending on how far in the money the option is upon expiry   this is represented by the diagonal line moving from above the a point on the x axis and moving from a profit to a loss on the y axis   the diagonal line crosses the x axis at the point where the underlying asset price is equal to a minus the original premium rate at which the option was written i.e. net profit = zero   in the second case the investor has sold a put option with a strike price of b and purchase a put option with a strike price a where a is less than b.   here the reasoning is similar to the first example however since a put option has been purchase this will limit the potential losses should the underlying asset move down strongly in value the horizontal line above the x axis marks the maximum profit while the horizontal line below the x axis marks the maximum loss note that the horizontal line above the x axis is closer to the x axis that is the horizontal line below the x axis   this is because the maximum profit is equal to the premium received for selling the put option minus the premium payed for buying the put option at a lower strike price   losses are limited since any loss in excess of the strike price a plus the premium payed for the put purchased at a strike price of a is covered by the profit made on the purchased put option at a strike price of a

the statistic you cited comes from the federal reserve board 's survey of consumer finances a survey that they do every three years most recently in 2013   this was reported in the september 2014 issue of the federal reserve bulletin   they list the percentage of americans with any type of debt as in 2013 down slightly from in 2010 the bulletin also has a table with a breakdown of the types of debt that people have and primary residence mortgages are at the top of the list   so the answer is yes the 75 statistic includes americans with home mortgages the bigger question is are you really in debt if you have a home mortgage   the answer to that is also yes   when you take out a mortgage you really do own the house   you decide who lives there you decide what changes you are going to make to it and you are responsible for the upkeep   but the mortgage debt you have is secured by the house   this means that if you refuse to pay the bank is allowed to take possession of the house   they do n't even get the whole house though they will sell it to recoup their losses and give you back whatever equity you had in the house after the loan is satisfied is it good debt   many people think that if you are borrowing money to purchase an appreciating asset the debt is acceptable   with this definition a car loan is bad credit card debt is very bad and a home mortgage might be okay   even dave ramsey radio host and champion of the debt free lifestyle is not opposed to home mortgages   home mortgages allow people to purchase a home that they would otherwise be unable to afford interestingly according to the bulletin credit card balances were only included as debt for the survey purposes if there was a balance after the most recent bill was paid not including purchases made after the bill   so people that do not carry a balance on their credit card were not considered in debt in this statistic

an llc does not pay taxes on profits as regards tax a llc is treated as a partnership but instead of partners they are called members the llc is a passthrough entity as in partnerships members can have a different percentage ownership to the share of profits the llc reports the share of the profits of the members then the members pay the tax as an individual the profit of the llc is deemed to have been transferred to the members regardless of any funds transferred this is often the case as the llc may need to retain the profits for use in the business late paying customers may mean there is less cash in the llc than is available to distribute   the first answer is wrong only a c corporation files a tax return all other corporate structures are passthrough entities the c corporation pays corporation tax and is not required to pass any funds to the shareholders if the c corporation passes funds to the shareholders this is a dividend and taxable to the shareholder hence double taxation

the company released its 2nd quarter revenue of $ a couple days ago however the stock did not move up in any way why if the company is making money should n't the stock go up during the time between earnings announcements analysts occasionally publish their assessment of a company including their estimate of the company 's value and future earnings and as part of an earnings report companies often include guidance their prediction for the upcoming quarter this will frequently be a conservative estimate so they 're more likely to achieve it investors make their purchase and sale decisions based on this information when the earnings report comes out investors compare these actual returns to analysts predictions and the company 's guidance if their results are in line with these predictions the stock price is unlikely to move much as those results are already incorporated into the stock price if the company is doing better than predicted it 's usually a good sign and the price often rises conversely if it 's doing worse the price will likely fall but it 's not as simple as this as others have explained for long term investors stock prices are based on expectations of future activity if the results of that quarter include some one time actions that are unlikely to repeat investors will often discount that portion

many individual states counties and cities have their own income taxes payroll taxes sales taxes property taxes etc you will need to consult your state and local government websites for information about additional taxes that apply based on your locale wages salaries tips cash bonuses and other taxable employee pay strike benefits long term disability earnings from self employment earned income is subject to payroll taxes such as earned income is also subject to income taxes which are progressively higher depending on the amount earned minus tax credits exemptions and/or deductions depending on how you file there are 7 tax rates that get progressively larger as your income rises but only applies to the income in each bracket 10 for the first 2017 through 39.6 for any income above the full list of rates is in the above linked article about payroll taxes earned income is required for contributions to an ira you can not contribute more to an ira than you have earned in a given year interest ordinary dividends short term capital gains retirement income pensions distributions from tax deferred accounts social security unemployment benefits worker 's compensation alimony child support income earned while in prison non taxable military pay most rental income and s corp passthrough income ordinary income is taxed the same as earned income with the exception that social security taxes do not apply this is the pure taxable income referred to in the other linked question dividends paid by us corporations and qualified foreign corporations to stock holders that are held for a certain period of time before the dividend is paid are taxed at the long term capital gains rate explained below ordinary dividends like the interest earned in your bank account are included with ordinary income   stocks bonds real estate carried interest held for more than a year income from assets that increase in value while being held for over a year long term capital gains justified by the idea that they encourage people to hold stock and make long term investments rather than buying and then quickly reselling for a short term profit   the lower tax rates also reflect the fact that many of these assets are already taxed as they are appreciating in value real estate is usually taxed through local property taxes equity in us corporations realized by rising stock prices and dividends that are returned to stock holders reflect earnings from a corporation that are already taxed at the 35 corporate tax rate taxing capital gains as ordinary income would be a second tax on those same profits another problem with long term capital gains tax is that a big portion of the gains for assets held for multiple decades are not real gains inflation increases the price of assets held for longer periods but you are still taxed on the full gain even if it would be a loss when inflation is calculated capital gains are also taxed differently depending on your income level if you are in the 10 or 15 brackets then long term capital gains are assessed at 0 if you are in the 25 28 33 or 35 brackets they are assessed at 15 only those in the 39.6 bracket pay 20 capital assets sold at a profit held for less than a year income from buying and selling any assets such as real estate stock bonds etc that you hold for less than a year before selling after adding up all gains and losses during the year the net gain is taxed as ordinary income collectibles held for more than a year are not considered capital assets and are still taxed at ordinary income rates

gt i think you would need to know the man pretty well before you could make that judgement    i think his record speaks for itself   gt;a lot of people that knew him better than you do seem to have reached a different conclusion   and a lot of them are similar they wash each others backs basically   gt;that 's someone else describing him   no that 's the description from the front webpage of his own hire me as a technology visionary speaker   the first part i 'm trying to imagine how he could be the quintessential of any kind of entrepreneur is more off than the last part which you could even imagine applying to a historian who had studied innovation in business amp tech   the whole thing is of the kind of that he is and yeah it 's all crap that has nothing to do with reality   the guy was good at marketing soda water or at least at taking the credit for a successful marketing campaign for soda water i rather highly doubt he was really responsible for any of the actual creative or critical decisions he just got the credit for them

depends on your definition of value tulips do n't carry much value but their price sure was driven up it was speculation on the future price tag that lead to the bubble you might suggest there is actual value in bitcoin i 'd suggest that its a asset and that its held more dear than other identically valuable cryptos which points to speculation

the 70b would be their regulatory amp class action liabilities and penalties sometimes it depends on the size of the company or the breach other times it will be fixed fines and assessed fines based on a framework standard   firstly they will pay a smaller amount because of their insurance retention deductible then insurance will pay they amount they are covered for then equifax will be liable for the remainder it will their bottom line i imagine   edit the biggest cyber insurance stack i know of is $ 500 m and i do n't think equifax took part in that
