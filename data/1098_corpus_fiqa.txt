you must pay your taxes at the quarterly intervals for most people the withholding done by their employer satisfies this requirement however if your income does not have any withholding or sufficient then you must file quarterly estimated tax payments   note that if you have a second job that does withhold then you can adjust your w4 to request further withholding there and possibly reduce the need for estimated payments   estimated tax payments also come into play with large investment earnings the amount that you need to prepay the irs is impacted by the safe harbor rule which i am sure others will provide the exact details on

every economy wants growth and for growth to come you need investments so you must provide some motive for people to risk their money every investment has inherently a degree of risk or if you want uncertainty about the outcome as a result the tax on capital gains is lower than on other types of income because the risk is almost zero the tax is considered in the calculation of the net interest rate and you can see this as the interest which the investors demand in order to invest their money

the relation between inflation and stock or economic performance is not well understood   decades ago economists thought inflation with periods of high growth and good real returns but since then we have had periods of low inflation and high growth and high inflation with low growth   it is generally understood among current economists that inflation levels especially expected inflation are neither indicative nor of real stock returns many things can affect inflation and economic performance is only a minor one   many things can cause economic performance and inflation is only a minor one   it 's not clear whether the overall relation between inflation and real stock returns is positive or negative notice however that in principle stock returns are real   that is the money companies make is in inflated dollars so profit and dividends for a company whose prospects have not changed should go up and down at the same rate as inflation this would mean if inflation goes up by 5 and nothing else changes you would expect stock prices to go up by the same proportion so you would n't have strong feelings about inflation one way or the other   in real life stock prices will go up by either more or less than 5 but i 'm not comfortable saying which on average bottom line current levels of inflation ca n't really be used to predict real stock returns so you should n't let current inflation guide your decision about whether to buy stock

tax rates do make a difference between whether to invest here or in ireland the rate of return would be lower in a place where you pay higher taxes as taxes are a cost the investment is going to happen sure it just depends on where that occurs    and then secondly the money that american businesses profit overseas stays overseas instead of being repatriated because the taxes are too high to justify paying them before reinvesting the money in the economy this is a problem because it means jobs for everyday americans going to another country where due to the other country is already more attractive in terms of labor costs due to our high price levels here in the us

you did n't put what country you 're in so i 'll work off the basis you 're in the united states i think you 're going to have a very hard time accomplishing what you 're talking about after such an extraordinary amount of time   one has to assume that there would still be records that could be retrieved in order for anyone to determine the amount you 'd have to pay and after 40 years the paper records would be long gone   it 's possible there might be somewhere but i would n't have a clue how easy or possible it would be for it to be retrieved    i assume you 're wanting to repay this as a way to boost social security or other government benefits in your retirement but it 's really hard to say whether repaying the money would make much if any difference    this is really something you 'll have to contact the irs about but unless they are trying to collect funds from you that they say you owe then it 's highly unlikely they have any record of what you 're asking about and they probably do n't even have a mechanism for accepting and crediting such monies   the real issue here is the amount of time that has passed because there would be little compelling reason for the government to keep detailed records they perhaps maintain summaries but little else for extended periods   we all have the impression the government knows all and never forgets but that simply is n't the case

generically like noted in the other answer you will only come ahead in dollar terms when you are significantly riskier than the average otherwise the insurance company would have higher rates to make a profit in the case of apple care there can arguably be other factors involved if you did not insure your $ 2000 laptop and it broke just after the warranty period would you replace it with a new apple product maybe not so apple could lose a customer that means they have an incentive to keep you happy if your product breaks but insurance replaces it you are a happier customer and more likely to buy other apple products this is not an incentive for traditional insurance companies that only do business in insurance now with the profit margins apple likes in general i do n't know if they 've underpriced their insurance i sort of doubt it even but their margins on it are probably not high meaning it 's a closer call even if you are only risky

my super fund and i would say many other funds give you one free switch of strategies per year   some suggest you should change from high growth option to a more balance option once you are say about 10 to 15 years from retirement and then change to a more capital guaranteed option a few years from retirement this is a more passive approach and has benefits as well as disadvantages the benefit is that there is not much work involved you just change your investment option based on your life stage 2 to 3 times during your lifetime this allows you to take more risk when you are young to aim for higher returns take a balanced approach with moderate risk and returns during the middle part of your working life and take less risk with lower returns above inflation during the latter part of your working life a possible disadvantage of this strategy is you may be in the higher higher growth option during a market correction and then change to a more balanced option just when the market starts to pick up again so your funds will be hit with large losses whilst the market is in retreat and just when things look to be getting better you change to a more balanced portfolio and miss out on the big gains a second more active approach would be to track the market and change investment option as the market changes one approach which should n't take much time is to track the index such as the asx200 if you investment option is mainly invested in the australian stock market with a 200 day simple moving average sma the concept is that if the index crosses above the 200 day sma the market is bullish and if it crosses below it is bearish see the chart below   this strategy will work well when the market is trending up or down but not very well when the market is going sideways as you will be changing from aggressive to balanced and back too often possibly a more appropriate option would be a combination of the two use the first passive approach to change investment option from aggressive to balanced to capital guaranteed with your life stages however use the second active approach to time the change for example if you were say in your late 40s now and were looking to change from aggressive to balanced in the near future you could wait until the asx200 crosses below the 200 day sma before making the change this way you could capture the majority of the uptrend which could go on for years before changing from the high growth aggressive option to the balanced option if you where after more control over your superannuation assets another option open to you is to start a smsf however i would recommend having at least $ 300 k to $ 400 k in assets before starting a smsf or else the annual costs would be too high as a percentage of your total super assets

what you are doing is unethical and illegal but is very hard to catch and prosecute the key thing for an unethical person to think about here is insurance   for most government incentive programs you have to have the intention to live there it is extremely hard to prove intent unless you ask this question under your name on a public forum that is archived by many search engines and maintains a log of all changes   for other folks it is common for them to claim that they intended to take residence but were surprised that their finances did n't work the way they anticipated still as long as the bank is paid it is unlikely that they will investigate however what happens if there is a major repair needed you have insurance   because your bank has asked for proof of insurance before they will give a mortgage that insurance is for an owner occupied building which you do not have   your insurance will inspect your claim if the circumstances do not match what you are insured for because you have lied to the insurance company they will not pay your claim which they are entitled to do   you are operating uninsured with tenants this is a hidden risk you may not be considering tenants do not treat property with the same care as an owner this is why they are insured differently you are now paying for insurance that you will have a difficult time ever filing a claim on    in addition if something were to happen that makes it time to claim the insurance value so that you can pay off the mortgage the insurance company will investigate they may very easily refuse to pay your fraudulent claim they may refer you to the police for insurance fraud the bank will want their money if they discover that you were not occupying the property they may just foreclose   they may also notify the government that you were not occupying the property at which point some one might search and find that you were showing intent to defraud the program out of money that is free for you but gotten through deception consider a less risky unethical path like telling people you 've been locked out of your car and just need a little money to pay the locksmith to open it you promise to pay them right back once you get in your car where your wallet is then take their money and go find another sucker it 's ethically equivalent and you are much less likely to go to jail however you have to face the people you are deceiving for money so you may feel less comfortable   good luck making your decisions

even if we accept these claims as being true neither the fact that their clients are more confident nor the fact that people who use an investment professional have a higher net worth tells you anything about the value of the service that such professionals provide   judging a service provider is a complex matter where you take into account multiple variables but the main ones are the cost and quality of the service the cost and quality of doing it yourself and the value you assign to your time and effort i think it 's highly likely that professional gardeners will on average maintain larger gardens than those who do their own garden work and any professional will have more experience at his profession than an average member of the public but to determine if hiring a professional is objectively better requires defining what that word means finance is a bit weird in that respect since we actually do have objective ways of measuring results by looking at performance over time but since the quotes you give here do n't address that at all we can simply conclude that they do not make the case for anything related to financial performance

i 'm assuming that you 're in the us   in that case the answer is that it depends on how your company set up its reimbursement plan   the irs recognizes accountable and plans   accountable plans have to meet certain requirements   anything else is   if you are reimbursed according to an accountable plan this is not income and should not be reported to the irs at all   if you are reimbursed under a plan then this is income but you might be able to get a deduction on your tax return if you itemize most established companies have accountable plans for normal business expenses more detail from irs

in most countries you are deemed to dispose of all your assets at the fair value at that time at the moment you are considered no longer a resident ie on the day your friend leaves brazil brazil will likely consider him to have sold his btc for $ 1m.   the brazilian government will then likely want him to calculate how much it cost him to mine buy it so that they can tax him on the gain no argument about how btc is n't fiat money matters here tax laws will typically apply to all investments in a way similar to stocks etc   the us will likely be very suspicious of such a large amount of money without some level of including that he paid taxes on any relevant gains in other countries by showing the us that he paid appropriate expatriate taxes in brazil if they exist i am speaking generally and have no knowledge of brazilian taxes he is helping to prove that he does not need to pay any taxes on that money in the us typically the btc then is valued for us tax purposes as the $ 1 m it was worth when he entered the us becoming a resident there this may require tax planning prior to entering the us see additional answer here any attempt to bring the btc into the us without paying appropriate brazilian us taxes as applicable i 'm not 100 on either check with a tax lawyer knowledgeable on both us brazilian tax law because the amount of money is material will likely be considered fraud how to commit fraud is not entertained as valid subject matter on this site

suddenly its not just comparing the current price to the price of the contract or is it sure it is   suppose you bought 100 option contracts each for 100 shares and paid a $ 1 per share premium $ 10,000 total   now those options are trading for $ 1.50 per share   you have an unrealized $ 0.50 gain per share or $ 5,000 the $ 10,000 in options you bought are now worth $ 15,000   it holds whether they were bought to open or close a position or whether they are puts or calls   the only difference is whether you bought or sold the options the arithmetic is just reversed for selling an option but lets say we have an option where the payoff is k where ct is the market price what do you do then your current unrealized p&l is different than the payoff   the payoff only happens at maturity   the current p&l is based on current market prices just like stock   option prices all have a time premium making them worth more than their payoff intrinsic value prior to maturity

the fsa can only pay for expenses incurred after it was open   this also applies in case of a mid year change in election such as due to marriage divorce child birth etc for example according to this page you can only be reimbursed for qualifying expenses from the election that was in place at the time the expense was incurred so say you had $ 500 available from january to june then on july 1 had a qualifying event you then elected $ 2000   you can be reimbursed for up to $ 500 in expenses incurred prior to july 1 and then an additional $ 1500 in expenses incurred after up to $ 2000 if you did n't use your full $ 500 more specifically from the irs publication generally distributions from a health fsa must be paid     only to reimburse you for qualified medical expenses you     incurred during the period of coverage the hsa question is more complicated i would talk to a tax accountant or at minimum your benefits coordinator   also read the publication i linked above the first part is about hsas   the short answer to your specific question stop contributing to the hsa unless you were contributing well under the limit of the hsa   if you know your limit and you know you 're under it you can continue contributing until april 15 of next year if you fail to be an eligible individual during     2013 you can still make contributions up until april 15     2014 for the months you were an eligible individual the general rule is you can contribute up to of months you were eligible   so if you changed jobs oct 1 and you 're single then you could contribute or just over $ 2400 in total for the year   if you 've contributed less than that to date you may continue contributing up to that amount but again contact your benefits coordinator or preferably a tax accountant as the rules can be complicated you definitely can not deduct any expenses from the account that you incur after you are no longer eligible and the rules on distributions are pretty complicated and if you get it wrong you may owe a 10 penalty on top of the tax you would normally owe so there is significant incentive not to get it wrong

if anything the price of an etf is more tightly coupled to the underlying holdings or assets than a mutual fund because of the independent creation destruction mechanism with a mutual fund the price is generally set once at the end of each day and the mutual fund manager has to deal with investments and redemptions at that price by the time they get to buying or selling the underlying assets the market may have moved or they may even move the market with those transactions with an etf investment and redemption is handled by independent authorized participants they can create new units of the etf by buying up the underlying assets and delivering them to the etf manager and vice versa they can cancel units by requesting the underlying assets from the etf manager etfs trade intraday i.e. at any time during trading hours and any time the price too far from the underlying assets one of the authorized participants has an incentive to make a small profit by creating or destroying units of the etf also intraday

it depends on how immediately you think you 'll need your emergency fund cash if you anticipate running into problems where you need cash right away e.g. you live paycheck to paycheck and your car breaks down a lot put it into a checking or money market account if you do n't think your emergencies will require immediate access to cash e.g. unemployment then put it in a savings account or cd if there is a lot of money in your accounts that goes unused and you want a bigger safety net then consider investing it though it 's generally a better idea to pay off debts at this point i think the best idea is to split your emergency fund between your checking and savings maybe 20 checking and 80 savings that way you have some extra cash on hand when you need it while most of your money is growing in savings

if you want higher returns you may have to take on more risk from lowest returns and usually lower risk to higher returns and usually higher risk bank savings accounts term deposits on line savings accounts offset accounts if you have a mortgage fixed interest eg bonds property and stock markets   if you want potentially higher returns then you can go for derivatives like options or cfds fx or futures these usually have higher risks again but as with any investments some risks can be partly managed also cmc markets charges $ 11 commission up to $ 10,000 trade this is actually quite a low fee based on your $ 7,000 $ 22 for in and out of a position would be less than of course you might want to buy into more than one company so your brokerage would be slightly higher still this is way lower than full service brokerage which could be $ 100 or more in and then again out again what ever you decide to do get yourself educated first

i still think it will be rather difficult best bet is to call around to the five or so closest dealers and express you are considering the car contingent on price not payment ask for them to send you their best out the door price on a base model then when you get quotes from each of them shop the lowest price around usually dealers will budge a few hundred bucks to beat other dealers    but a 2018 will be difficult if not impossible to negotiate a few grand under msrp understand that the people that buy this car are not doing so because it is a great bargain so dealers can usually push this car at or near msrp    lastly do not set foot in a dealership until you have a firm out the door price they will play sales tricks until you give up on negotiation and will pay anything just to get out of there the only time you should go to the location is to sign papers and drive away with the car do not worry about being nice and with the salesperson    this advice got me my current vehicle at about 15 below the lowest true car estimate i do n't claim this is the best advice out there but it works

although there are some good points made here as to the cause of inflation mostly related to supply and demand does head in a different direction one which i myself was going to take let me give a different angle however another cause of inflation is the printing of money by the government not simply replacing old money with new but adding to the total money in circulation if the government doubles the amount of currency in circulation for the sake of argument and easy math the value of all money decreases by a factor of 2 that 's inflation and the way g. edward in the creature from island puts it it 's really tantamount to a hidden tax in a nutshell the federal government wants to buy some cool stuff like new tanks or planes or they want to give a bunch of food stamps to poor people or they want to fly their private jets around but they do n't have enough money from taxes so they print money and spend it and buy their stuff because they 've just increased the money in circulation however money loses its value for example your savings has dropped in value by half despite the fact that the same number of dollars is in your savings account this is just a way the government can tax you without taxing you they buy stuff and you now have less money i.e. your retirement is worth less and you do n't even know you just got taxed makes me sick that we let our leaders get away with this

edited to incorporate the comments elsewhere of assuming apparently incorrectly that duration is time to maturity first note that the question does not mention the coupon rate the size of the regular payments that the bond holder will get each year   so let 's calculate that consider the cash flow described   you pay out 1015 at the start of year 1 to buy the bond   at the end of years 1 to 5 you receive a coupon payment of x.   also at the end of year 5 you receive the face value of the bond 1000   and you are told that the pay out equals the money received using a time value of money of 4.69 so if we use the date of maturity of the bond as our valuation date we have the equation maturity + future value of coupons = future value of bond purchase price 1000 + x 1 + = 1015 ^ 5 solving this for x we obtain   the coupon rate is   you will receive at the end of each of the five years    now we can take this fixed schedule of payments and apply the new yield rate to the same formula above   only now the unknown is the price paid for the bond y. 1000 + 1 + 1 = y ^ 5 solving this equation for y we obtain y =

it may or may not be a good idea to borrow money from your family there are many factors to consider here not the least of which is what you would do if you got in serious financial trouble and could n't make your scheduled payments on the loan would you arrange with them to sell the property asap or could they easily manage for a few months without your scheduled payments if it were necessary a good rule of thumb that some people follow when lending to family is this do n't do it unless you 're 100 ok with the possibility that they might not pay you back at all that said your question was about credit scores specifically having a mortgage and making on time payments would factor into your score but not significantly more heavily than having revolving credit eg a credit card and making on time payments or having a car loan or installment loan and making on time payments i bought my house in 2011 and after years of paying the mortgage on time my credit score has n't changed at all myfico has a breakdown of factors affecting your credit score here the most significant are a history of on time payments low revolving credit utilization carrying a $ 4900 balance on a card with a $ 5000 limit is bad carrying a $ 10 balance on the same card is good and overall length of your credit history as to credit mix they have this to say types of credit in use credit mix determines 10 of my fico score the fico ® score will consider your mix of credit cards retail accounts installment loans finance company accounts and mortgage loans it 's not necessary to have one of each and it 's not a good idea to open credit accounts you do n’t intend to use the credit mix usually wo n’t be a key factor in determining your fico score but it will be more important if your credit report does not have a lot of other information on which to base a score have credit cards but manage them responsibly having credit cards and installment loans with a good payment history will raise your fico score people with no credit cards tend to be viewed as a higher risk than people who have managed credit cards responsibly

if you have the money and the determination to pay off all the cards in six months then the order will make little difference to your credit score and to your finances   if you had less money available say you could pay off $ 500 a month in total then it would be good for financial reasons to pay off the credit card with the highest interest rate first so you pay less interest it would be good for psychological reasons to pay the card with the smallest amount first so you feel successful quickly and some people need that feeling of success to continue paying off just psychological and if these things contradict each other figure out what is more important   and whatever you do paying back your debt is better than not paying it back so if you ca n't make up your mind then you pay 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 then 5

the short answer is that you would want to use the net inflow or net outflow aka profit or loss    in my experience you 've got a couple different uses for irr and that may be driving the confusion   pretty much the same formula but just coming at it from different angles    thinking about a stock or mutual fund investment you could project a scenario with an up front investment net outflow in the first period and then positive returns dividends then final sale proceeds each a net inflow in subsequent periods   this is a model that more closely follows some of the logic you laid out thinking about a business project or investment you tend to see more complicated and less smooth cashflows   for example you may have a large up front capital expenditure in the first period then have net profit revenue less ongoing maintenance expense then another large capital outlay and so on    in both cases you would want to base your analysis on the net inflow or net outflow in each period   it just depends on the complexity of the cashflows trend as to whether you see a straightforward example initial payment then ongoing net inflows or a less straightforward example with both inflows and outflows    one other thing to note you would only want to include those costs that are applicable to the project   so you would not want to include the cost of overhead that would exist even if you did not undertake the project

he offered a 15 stake   he showed willingness to move from his original position by moving to 20   this left the door open for further discussions but if the last shark was n't offering royalties or something else to sweeten the pot he was n't going to budge much more than maybe to 22.5   you give away too much too easily and a seasoned negotiator smells blood and goes for it   every round of negotiations needs to offer a bit more but less than the additional offered in the previous round and not without receiving something in return so after increasing by 5 to 20 he would not have added another 35 based on their arguments he would reason why an additional 2.5 would be the most he could offer without additional consideration if he jumped from 15 to say 40 too easily the other negotiator would be looking for an additional 20 after that   so he went from 15 to 20 in response to the 75 equity stake and did nothing to seem or unreasonable while setting the tone for the next and last negotiator   the last guy was n't willing to walk away and showed that he was n't going to be pushed into a bad deal so a deal got done   dunno if that makes sense but his assertions coupled with strong but fair negotiating skills and a product that at least one person saw value in or any negotiation would be pointless won the day

it 's a good question i am amazed how few people ask this to is it really worth paying substantial fees to arrange a generic investment though your high street bank almost certainly not however one caveat you did n't mention what kind of fund(s you want to invest in or for how long you also mention an advice fee are you actually getting financial advice i.e. a personal recommendation relating to one or more specific investments based on the investments suitability for your circumstances and are you content with the quality of that advice if you are it may be worth it if they 've advised you to choose this fund that has the potential to achieve your desired returns while matching the amount of risk you are willing to take then the advice could be worth paying for it entirely depends how much guidance you need or are you choosing your own fund anyway it sounds to me like you have done some research on your own you believe the building society adviser is trying to sell a fund and you are n't entirely convinced by their recommendation if you are happy making your own investment decisions and are merely looking for a place to execute that trade the deal you have described via your bank would almost certainly be poor value and you 're looking in the right places for an alternative ~ ~ ~ on to the active vs passive fund debate that amc of 1.43 you mention would not be unreasonable for an actively managed fund that you strongly feel will outperform the market however you also mention etfs a passive type of fund and believe that after charges they might offer at least as good net performance as many actively managed funds good point although please note that many comparisons of this nature compare to all actively managed funds the good and bad including e.g. poorly managed life company funds a better comparison would be to compare the fund managers you 're considering vs. the benchmark although obviously this is past performance and wo n't necessarily be repeated at the crux of the matter is cost of course so if you 're looking for low cost funds the cost of the platform is also significant therefore if you are comfortable going with a passive investment strategy let 's look at how much that might cost you on the platform you mentioned hargreaves lansdown two of the most popular ftse all share tracker funds among hargreaves lansdown clients are you 'll notice they have slightly different performance btw that 's a funny thing with trackers they all aim to track but have a slightly different way of trading to achieve it to hold either of these funds in a hargreaves lansdown account you 'll also pay the 0.45 platform charge this percentage off for values higher than £ 250,000 if you get that far so in total to track the ftse all share with these funds through an account you would be paying this gives you an indication of how much less you could pay to run a diy portfolio based on passive funds nb both the above are a 100 equities allocation with a large uk companies weighting so wo n't suit a lower risk approach you 'll also end up invested in eg mining tobacco oil companies whoever 's in the index perhaps you 'd prefer to be more selective if you feel you need financial advice with nationwide or portfolio management with you have to judge whether these services are worth the added charges it sounds like you 're not convinced in which case all the best with a low cost passive funds strategy

to your secondary question appropriately consider all estimated numbers involved with keeping the house compared to your closest estimate of what the home could sell for weigh out the pros and cons yourself as a stranger will not be able to 100 appreciate what you value and dislike   remember to include insurances taxes and the actual mortgage payment depending on how you also plan to rent out the property include whichever utilities you intend to cover if any   there will also be costs for property management and upkeep as things will break overtime and tenants will not hesitate to get you or your management to fix them either way that means you are paying i would also keep in mind while homes typically appreciate in value there is a higher risk with tenants for the value to depreciate to damages and poor upkeep   there are increased legal risks to renting so be sure you have properly vetted whichever management you are going with   in extreme circumstances you also could be required to retain an attorney to defend yourself again litigation because whichever management team you hire will most likely defend themselves and not include you in that umbrella   my family lives in the la area as well and a judge refused to throw out an obvious frivolous suit when my parents attempted to rent out a house   the possible renters after signing the main paperwork never showed to finish a second set of documents for renting   parents immediately declined to rent to these people as they missed something so important without any explanation and they sued claiming racism emotional damages and some other really crazy things despite my parents never having met them first meeting was between property management and renters only personally and professionally i would only suggest renting our the place and not selling if you can turn a profit after all the above mentioned costs if renters are only paying to keep the property in the black you have yourself a non earning asset which will be damaged over time and require repairs which will come out of your pocket   also while the property is you also must remember it is not earning at that time much of this may sound obvious etc i simply wish to provide my family 's experience to help you in making your decisions    best of luck with your endeavor edit   also you will be required to report all earned rental income on your taxes they will fall under the schedule e and possibly k-1 area   i would strongly recommend consulting with an actual accountant about the impacts to you

i 'm going to suggest a slightly different approach most answers seem to suggest paying off the lower rate card to clear it some answers comments also talk about emergency funds one risk of paying off a card is that the card issuer may choose to reduce your credit limit if they see you as high risk to prevent you re spending the money if you do n't trust yourself with the card then this could be a good thing and remember you 're always free to ask for a limit decrease but if you want access to emergency funds then i would suggest paying half onto each card that way if one card cuts you off you have a chance of still having access to the other in an emergency

private investors as mutual funds are a minority of the market   institutional investors make up a substantial portion of the long term holdings   these include pension funds insurance companies and even corporations managing their money as well as individuals rich enough to actively manage their own investments    from business insider with some aggregation    numbers do n't add to 100 because of rounding   also i pulled insurance out of household because it 's not household managed   another source is the tax policy center which shows that about 50 of corporate stock is owned by individuals 25 and individually managed retirement accounts 25    another issue is that household can be a bit confusing   while some of these may be people choosing stocks and investing their money this also includes employee stock ownership plans esop and company founders   for example jeff bezos owns about 17 of amazon.com according to wikipedia   that would show up under household even though that is not an investment account   jeff bezos is not going to sell his company and buy equity in an index fund    anyway the most generous description puts individuals as controlling about half of all stocks   even if they switched all of that to index funds the other half of stocks are still owned by others   in particular about 26 is owned by institutional investors that actively manage their portfolios    in addition day traders buy and sell stocks on a daily basis not appearing in these numbers   both active institutional investors and day traders would hop on stocks either shorting the overvalued or buying the undervalued    it does n't take that much of the market to control prices so long as it is the active trading market   the passive market does n't make frequent trades   they usually only need to buy or sell as money is invested or withdrawn   so while they dominate the ownership stake numbers they are much lower on the trading volume numbers    tl;dr   there is more than enough active investment by organizations or individuals who would not switch to index funds to offset those that do   unless that changes this is not a big issue

in general stock markets are very similar to that however you can also put in limit orders to say that you will only buy or sell at a given price these sit in the market for a specified length of time and will be executed when an order arrives that matches the price or better traders who set limit orders are called liquidity or price makers as they provide liquidity i.e. volume to be traded to be filled later if there is no counterparty i.e. buyer to your seller in the market a market maker a large bank or brokerage who is licensed and regulated to do so will fill your order at some price that price is based on how much volume i.e. trading there is in that stock on average this is called average daily volume adv and is calculated over varying periods of time we use which is the 30 day average you can always sell stocks for whatever price you like privately but a market order does not allow you to set your price you are a price taker therefore that kind of order will always fill at a market price as mentioned above limit orders will not fill until the price is hit but will stay on book as long as they are n't filled expired or cancelled

can they reject a hundred dollar bill as a payment of debt no a creditor can not refuse payment in cash whatever denomination you use however when you 're buying stuff you do n't owe anything to the business owner there 's no debt so the above rule does n't apply as long as there 's no debt in existence the matter of payment is decided between two parties based on the mutual agreement the demand not to use large bills is reasonable in places like or taxi cab that are frequently robbed or at a small retailer that does n't want to invest into forgery detection and fraud prevention so the answer to this question is it the case where this practice of accepting small bills and    rejecting large bills is perfectly legal is yes you can find the full explanation on including code references

yes you should incorporate if you plan on seriously investing in real estate this not only limits liability in terms of paying back the debt but also in case your tenants sue you   pass through entities typically an llc but it depends on the state if they have good or bad llc laws pennsylvania is a state where you would not want to incorporate as an llc other options include s corps and   loans are taken out by corporations against the property typically mortgage loans are non recourse if you set up a company for each property this further insulates you against the bank capturing other properties within the pool however recourse can still end up getting you on the hook personally for the loans these typically include voluntary bankruptcy you would very rarely have to file for bankruptcy anyway for your real estate investments at worst it will end in foreclosure but banks typically would prefer deed in lieu just because it is faster and easier for them too you just turn over the keys and walk away it will have very little impact on your personal finances or record everyone in real estate walks away from properties and leaves them with the bank it 's a fact of doing business and your lender should have been comfortable owning your property at the basis they lent money to you if they were n't they were just stupid   yes every real estate investment requires equity in the property typically it 's a 20 equity check but if the lender the property to a lower value than what you purchased it for you may have to line up more expensive financing

that is mostly true in most situations when there are more buy orders than sell orders higher buy volume orders than sell volume orders the price will generally move upwards and vice versa when there are more sell orders than buy orders higher sell volume orders than buy volume orders the price will generally move downwards note that this does not always happen but usually it does you are also correct that for a trade to take place a buyer has to be matched with a seller or the buy volume matched with the sell volume but not all orders get executed as trades say there are 50 buy orders in the order book with a total volume of 100,000 shares and the highest buy order is currently at $ 10.00 on the other side there are only 10 sell orders in the order book with total volume of 10,000 shares and the lowest sell order is currently $ at the moment there wo n't be a trade unless a new buyer or seller enters the market to match the opposing side or an existing order gets amended upper or lower to match the opposing side with more demand than supply in the order books what will be the most likely direction that this stock moves in most likely the price will move upwards if a new buyer sees the price moving higher and then looks at the market depth they would most likely place an order closer to the lowest sell order than the current highest buy order say $ 10.01 to be first in line in case a market sell order is placed on the market as new buy orders enter the market it drives the price higher and higher until the buy orders dry up

file a john doe lawsuit plaintiff to be determined and then subpoena the relevant information from mastercard   john doe does n't so you 're pretty safe doing this   but it probably wo n't work   mastercard would your subpoena   they will claim that you lack standing to sue anyone because you did not take a loss which is a fair point     they are after the people doing the hacking and the security gaps which make the hacking possible   and how those gaps arise among businesses just trying to do their best   it 's a hard problem   and i 've done the abuse wars professionally   is a big deal   you simply can not reveal your methods or even much of your findings because that will expose too much of your detection method   the ugly fact is the bad guys are not that far from winning and catching them depends on them unwisely using the same known techniques over and over   when you get a truly novel technique it costs a fortune in engineering time to unravel what they did and build against it   if maybe 1 of attacks are this it is manageable but if it were 10 you simply can not staff an enforcement arm big enough the trained staff do n't exist to hire unless you steal them from visa amex etc   so as much as you 'd like to tell the public believe me i 'd like to get some credit for what i 've done they just ca n't say much or they educate the bad guys and then have a much tougher problem later   sorry   i know how frustrating it is the credit card companies hammered out pci payment card industry data security standards   this is a basic set of security rules and practices which should make hacking unlikely   compliance is achievable not easy and if you do it you 're off the hook   that is one way amy can be entirely not at fault   example deleted for length but as a small business you just ca n't be a pci security expert   you rely on the commitments of others to do a good job like your bank and merchant account salesman   there are so many ways this can go wrong that just are n't your fault    as to the notion of saying it affected amy 's customers but it was the contractor 's fault that does n't work the internet lynch mob wo n't hear the details and will kill amy 's business then she 's suing mastercard for false light a type of there the facts are true but are framed falsely    and defamation has much more serious consequences in europe   anyway even a business not at fault has to pay for a pci audit   a business at fault has lots more problems at the very least paying $ 50 90 per customer to replace their cards   the simple fact is 80 of businesses in this situation go bankrupt at this point    usually fraudsters make automated attacks using scripts they got from others   only a few dozen attacks on sites succeed and then they use other scripts to intercept payment data which is all they want they are cookie cutter scripts and are n't customized for each site and ca n't go after whatever personal data is particular to that site so in most cases all they get is payment data it 's also likely that primary data like a cloud drive photo collection or medical records are kept in completely separate systems with separate security unlikely to hack both at once even if the hacker is willing to put lots and lots of engineering effort into it   most hackers are script able to run scripts others provided but unable to hack on their own    so it 's likely that none was leaked is the reason they did n't give notification of private information leakage   lastly they ca n't get what you did n't upload   site hacking is a well known phenomenon   a person who is concerned with privacy is cautious to not put things online that are too risky   it 's also possible that this is blind guesswork on the part of visa mc and they have n't positively identified any particular merchant but are replacing your cards out of an abundance of caution

not to state the obvious but whenever an investment is being made the nuts and bolts is your return on investment   analyzing the rate of return on an investment is the primary factor in any decision   ideally once the actual mechanics of investment and side benefits are factored out the goal is to be able to analyze the pure financial return usually the biggest problem faced in analyzing various investments is comparing the present value of an investment to a series of payments that may be made or received in the future   when considering the purchase of a large equity for example you might be looking at what series of payments are required to purchase the asset   you can also reverse this and ask what amount of money is equivalent to this series of payments ultimately the present value of an annuity is the way to make these comparisons equal    fundamentally the present value of an annuity is an amount of money that should in theory be equivalent to a series of payments   there is for example technically no difference between $ today and $ 100 a month for a year at an interest rate of 1 per month   grant you most people would be happier with the money now but that is what interest does it compensates you for waiting on your money    you can fire up a spreadsheet and calculate the present value as long as you have the monthly payment interest rate and number of periods   alternatively you can calculate any one of those missing four variables and the key is usually to understand what that rate would be in order to compare the investments finally the taxable implication is really just an adjustment to the rate of return imagine the following three scenarios obviously the rates are fictional the goal is to show they are the same scenarios 1 2 are really just two sides of the same coin   using the future value formula in excel = 12 -100 you get $   in scenario 1 you would have $ in your bank account   in scenario 2 your bank would have $ from you and you would have $ 100 less debt per month   they are equivalent transactions    scenario 3 is really just a variation on scenario 2 localized to the united states   because the interest is tax deductible however the rate of 6 is n't really accurate   assuming you had a 25 tax bracket you 'd actually be getting back one quarter of your interest   put another way 7.5 mortgage interest costs you as much as 6 credit card debt this is how you compare apples and just turn everything into an annuity or a lump sum using present value calculations    finally quick rule of thumb if you owe taxes in both canada and the us your canadian taxes are probably higher than your american ones   as such any tax incentives will be higher   if you only can only use canadian tax incentives then look to those incentives other things being equal

the decision as to what counts as income is up to the bank you 'll need to ask them whether or not rental income can be included in the total i can offer some anecdotal evidence when i applied for a mortgage to buy my home i already had a rental property with a buy to let mortgage on it initially the bank regarded that property as a liability not an asset because it was mortgaged however once i was able to show that there was a good history of receiving enough rent they chose to ignore the property altogether i.e. it was n't regarded as a liability but it was n't regarded as a source of income either more generally as says residential mortgages are computed based on affordability which is more than just a multiple of your salary to answer your specific questions covered above it 's up to the bank if you 're married and you do n't have a written tenancy agreement and you 're not declaring the rent on your tax return then it seems unlikely that this would be regarded as income at all conversely if your partner is earning why not put their name on the mortgage application too buy to let mortgages are treated differently while it used to be the case that they were assessed on rental income only nowadays lenders may ask for proof of the landlord 's income from other sources note that a btl can not be used for a property you intend to live in and a residential mortgage can not be used for a property you intend to let to tenants at least not without the bank 's permission

there are two primary reasons shares are sold short   1 to speculate that a stock 's price will decline and 2 to hedge some other related financial exposure the first is acknowledged by the question   the second reason may be done for taxes shorting against the box was once permitted for tax purposes for arbitrage positions such as merger arbitrage and situations when an outright sale of stock is not permitted such as owning restricted stock such as employer granted shares why would a shareholder lend the investor the shares the investor loaning his stock out to short sellers earns interest on those shares that the borrower pays   it is not unusual for the annualized cost of borrowing stock to be double digits when there is high demand for heavily shorted shares   this benefit is however not available to all investors

i would say that you should keep in mind one simple idea   leverage was the principal reason for the 2008 financial meltdown   for a great explanation on this i would highly recommend michael lewis book the big short which does an excellent job in spelling out the case against being highly leveraged as dale m. pointed out losses are greatly magnified by your degree of leverage that being said there 's nothing wrong with being highly leveraged as a short term strategy and i want to emphasize the short term part   if for instance an opportunity arises where you are n't presently liquid enough to cover then you could use leverage to at least stay in the game until your cash situation improves enough to de leverage the investment   this can be a common strategy in equities where you simply substitute the term leverage for the term margin   margin positions can be scary because a rapid downturn in the market can cause margin calls that you 're unable to cover and that 's disastrous interestingly it was the 2008 financial crisis which lead to the undoing of bernie madoff   many of his clients were highly leveraged in the markets and when everything began to unravel they turned to him to cash out what they thought they had with him to cover their margin calls only to then discover there was no money   not being able to meet the redemptions of his clients forced madoff to come clean about his scheme and the rest is history the banks themselves were over leveraged sometimes at a rate of 50 1 and any little hiccup in the payment stream from borrowers caused massive losses in the portfolios which were magnified by this leveraging   this is why you should view leverage with great caution   it is very very tempting but also fraught with extreme peril if you do n't know what you 're getting into or do n't have the wherewithal to manage it if anything should go wrong in real estate i could use the leverage of my present cash reserves to buy a bigger property with the intent of de leveraging once something else i have on the market sells   but that 's only a wise play if i am certain i can unwind the leveraged position reasonably soon seriously know what you 're doing before you try anything like this   too many people have been by not understanding the pitfalls of leverage simply because they 're too by the profits they think they can make   be careful my friend

the u.s. bankruptcy laws no longer make it simple to discharge credit card debt so you ca n't simply run up a massive tab on credit cards and then just walk away from them anymore   that used to be the case but that particular loophole no longer exists the way it once did further you could face fraud charges if it can be proven you acted deliberately with the intent to commit fraud    finally you wo n't be able to rack up a ton of new cards as quickly as you might think so your ability to amass enough to make your plan worth the risk is not as great as you seem to believe as a closing note do n't do it   all you do is make it more expensive for the rest of us to carry credit cards   after all the banks are n't going to eat the losses   they 'll just pass them along in the form of higher fees and rates to the rest of us

buy and sell orders always include the price at which you buy sell that 's how the market prices for stocks are determines so if you want to place a buy order at 106 you can do that when that order was fulfilled and you have the stock you can place a sell order at 107 it will be processed as soon as someone places a buy order at 107 theoretically you can even place sell orders for stocks you have n't even bought yet that 's called short selling you do that when you expect a stock to go down in the future but this is a very risky operation because when you the market you might end up owing more money than you invested no responsible banker will even discuss this with you when you can not prove you know what you are doing

fee only meaning the only money they make is the fee your folks pay directly no kickbacks from financial products they 're selling the answer to this is for god 's sake leave it alone   i commend you on wanting to help your family avoid more losses you are right that having most of one 's retirement in one stock or sector is just silly and again yes if they 're retired they probably need some bonds   but here 's the thing if they follow your advise and it does n't work out it will be a serious strain on your relationship of course you 'll still be a family and they 'll still love you but emotionally you are the reason they lost the money and that will an elephant in between you this is especially the case since we 're talking about a lot of money here presumably and retirement money to boot    you must understand the risk you 're taking with your relationships if you they lose at best it 'll make things awkward and you 'll feel guilty about their impoverished retirement at worst it can destroy your relationship with your folks   what about if you win wo n't you be and appreciated by your folks for saving them from themselves yes for a short while then life moves on everything returns to normal   but here 's the thing you wo n't win you ca n't because even if you 're right here and they win that means both they and you will be eager for you to do it again and at some point they 'll take a hit based on your advise     can i be blunt here you did n't even know that you ca n't avoid capital gains taxes by reinvesting stock gains you do n't know enough and worse you 're not experienced enough i deduce you 're either a college student or a recent grad which means you do n't have experience investing your own money you do n't know how the market moves you just know the theory   you know who you are you 're me 20 years ago and thank god my grandparents ignored my advise i was right about their utilities stocks back then too but i know from what i learned in the years afterwards investing on my own account that at some point i would have hurt them and i would have had a very hard time living with that   so tell your folks to go visit a fee only financial adviser to create a retirement plan   perhaps i 'm reading into your post but it seems like you 're enthusiastic about investing stocks bonds building wealth etc i love that my advise go for it pull some money together and open your own stock account do some trading as much as people about it the market really is glorious it 's like playing monopoly but for keeps i mean that in the best way possible it 's fun you can build wealth doing it and it provides a very useful social purpose   in the spirit of that check out these ideas just for you not for your folks based on ideas in your post   good luck

through your question and then clarification through the comments it looks like you have a u.s. llc with at least two members   if you did not elect some other tax treatment your llc will be treated as a partnership by the irs   the partnership should file a tax return on form 1065   then each partner will get a schedule k-1 from the partnership which the partner should use to include their respective shares of the partnership income and expenses on their personal forms 1040 you can also elect to be taxed as an s corp or a c corp instead of a partnership but that requires you to file a form explicitly making such election   if you go s corp then you will file a different form for the company but the procedure is roughly the same income gets passed through to the owners via a schedule k-1   if you go c corp then the owners will pay no tax on their own form 1040 but the c corp itself will pay income tax as far as whether you should try to spend the money as business expense to avoid paying extra tax that 's highly dependent on your specific situation   i 'd think you 'd want to get tailored advice for that

a bit strange but okay   the way i would think about this is again that you need to determine for what purpose you 're computing this in much the same way you would if you were to build out the model the ipo valuation is not going to be relevant to the accretion dilution analysis unless you 're trying to determine whether the transaction was net accretive at exit but that 's a weird analysis to do for longer holding periods like that you 're more likely to look at irr not eps eps is something investors look at over the short to medium term to get a sense of whether the company is making good acquisition decisions and to do that short to medium term analysis they look at earnings    damodaran would say this is a shitty way of looking at things and that you should probably be looking at some measure of instead and i tend to agree but i do n't get paid to think like an investor i get paid to sell shit to them if only in indirect fashion the short answer to your question is that no you should not incorporate what you are calling liquidation value when determining accretion dilution but only because the market typically computes accretion dilution on a 3-year basis tops i 've never put together a book or seen a press release in my admittedly short time in finance that says the transaction is estimated to be x% accretive within 4 years that just seems like an absurd timeline   final point is just that from an accounting perspective a gain on a sale of an asset is not going to get booked in either ebitda or so just mechanically there 's no way for the ipo value to flow into your accretion dilution analysis there even if you are looking at ebitda shares you could figure the gain on sale into some kind of adjusted ebitda shares version of eps but this is neither something i 've ever seen nor something that really makes sense in the context of using eps as a standardized metric across the market typically we take out non recurring shit in eps we do n't add it in adding something like this in would be much more appropriate to measuring the success of an acquisition investing vehicle like a private equity fund not a standalone operating company that reports operational earnings in addition to cash flow from investing and as i suggest above that 's an analysis for which the irr metric is more ideally situated   and just a semantic thing we typically would n't call the exit value a liquidation value that term is usually reserved for dissolution of a corporate entity and selling off its physical or intangible assets in piecemeal fashion i.e. not accounting for operational synergies across the business ipo value is actually just going to be a measure of market value of equity

i disagree with the selected answer there 's no one rule of thumb and certainly not simple ones like 20 cents of every dollar if you 're 35 you 've made a good start by making a budget of your expected expenses if you read the mr. money mustache titled the shockingly   simple math behind early retirement you will understand that it is usually a mistake to think of your expenses as a fixed percentage of your income in most cases it makes more sense to keep your expenses as low as possible regardless of your actual income   in the financial independence community it is a common principle that one typically needs 25 30 times one 's annual spending to have enough money to sustain oneself forever off the investment returns that those savings generate this is based on the assumption of a 7 average annual return 4 after inflation so the real answer to your question is this update brought to my attention that this formula does n't work that well when the savings rates are low 20 range this is because it assumes that money you save earns no returns for the entire period that you are saving this is obviously not true investment returns should also count toward your annual spending goal for that reason it 's probably better to refer to the blog post that i linked to in the answer above for precise calculations that 's where i got the 37 years at 20 savings rate figure from depending on how large and small x and y are you could have enough saved up to retire in 7 years at a 75 savings rate 17 years at a 50 savings rate or 37 years at the suggested 20 savings rate for olds as you go through life your expenses may increase eg starting a family starting a new business unexpected health event etc or decrease kid wins full scholarship to college so could your income however in general you should negotiate the highest salary possible if you are salaried use the 25x rule and consider your life and career goals to decide how much you want to save and stop thinking of expenses as a percentage of income

great questions the fact that you 're thinking about it is what 's most important i think a priority should be maximizing any employer match in your 401(k because it 's free money second would be paying off high interest debt because it 's a big expense everything else is a matter of setting good financial habits so i think the order of importance will vary from person to person that 's why i ordered the priorities the way i did employer matching is the easiest way to get more income with no additional work and paying down high interest debt is the best way to lower your long term expenses after that continue to maximize your income and savings and be frugal with your expenses avoid debt take a vacation once in a while too

no it 's not a loan it 's an equity investment think of it as a business the parents bought 75 of the equity with $ 115 k and are entitled to 75 of the sale proceeds should you someday liquidate the business i.e. selling the house the $ 500 per month is just business revenue and is paid to your parents as a dividend imagine you rent it out to your self and charge a $ rent you take 25 of that back and give your parents the rest like any equity investment the risk for them is that if the value of the house goes down they will have to shoulder the loss   and you are right there is no way to build equity you already sold that to your parents

if you can make the trip to bc yourself i 'd recommend opening an account with td canada trust   they allow non citizens to make accounts apparently the only canadian bank to do so   the customer service is great and they have a good online banking site that will allow you to manage it from the us if you have an account with td bank in the us it 's also very easy to set up a td canada account through them that will be linked on their online site though you will still have separate logins for both and manage them separately   i 've done the reverse as a canadian living in the us   you can set it up over the phone their cross border banking number is listed here   they also offer better currency conversion rates than their standard ones when you do a cross border transfer you could also look into hsbc as well   they operate in washington as well as across the border in bc   if you ca n't open a cad account locally they can help you open and manage one in canada from the us   it may or may not require having a small business account instead of a personal account

if you really want to decrease inequality in a sustainable way the solution is to make energy cheaper the rate of median household income growth started flattening in the 1970s and it is n't coincidental that it happened when fossil fuel prices sustained significant rises if we ca n't make energy at least as cheap as it was before the 1970s we have to adjust to a much slower rate of ngdp growth the government targets a straight line upward moving rate of ngdp growth through massive debt spending and loose monetary policies if it does n't pull back on these the increasing rates of growth of the ngdp and sustainable economic growth puts us on track for a future correction that will be bigger than the great depression

good debt is very close to an oxymoron   people say student loans are good debt but i beg to differ   the very same good debt that allowed me to get an education is the very same bad debt that does n't allow me to take chances in my career meaning i would prefer to have a steady job over starting a business   that 's my of course but i am not willing to take that risk provided the two really good reason for using cash over borrowing   we have a tendency in this culture to find reasons to borrow   it is better for you to make a budget based on what you want and save up for it   make a dream list for what you want then add up the costs for everything   if that number makes your head hurt start down on things you want   maybe you install just a wine cooler instead of a wine cooler and a beer tap or vice versa   and besides if something comes up you can always stop saving money for this project and deal with whatever came up and then resume saving when you 're done or in the case of the kitchen maybe you do it in stages cabinets one year the next flooring the year after that and then the appliances last   you do n't have to do it all at once as someone who is working toward debt freedom it feels nice whenever we have one less payment to budget for every month   do n't burden yourself to impress other people   take your time get bids for the things you ca n't or wo n't do yourself and then make a decision that 's best for your money

it depends on how much you save how much your savings earns each year   you can model it with a very simple spreadsheet   formula view   you can change this simple model with any other assumptions you wish to make and model this spreadsheet presumes that you only make $ never get a raise that your savings earns 6 per year and that the market never has a crash like 2008 the article never states the assumptions that the author has made and therefore we ca n't honestly determine how truthful the author is   i recommend the book engineering your retirement as it has more detailed models and goes into more details about what you should expect i wrote a slightly more detailed post that showed a spreadsheet that is basically what i use at home to track my retirement savings

generally it goes by when they receive the check not when they cash the check though if the check was received prior to midnight on december 31st but after the bank closes they would probably let the tax payer decide to count it for the next year of course if the check is from person a to person b then the only issue is gift tax or annual limit calculations   if it is company to person then income tax could be involved   the irs calls this constructive receipt income    under the cash method include in your gross income all items of    income you actually or constructively receive during your tax year if    you receive property or services you must include their fair market    value in income example    on december 30 2011 mrs. sent you a check for interior    decorating services you provided to her you received the check on    january 2 2012 you must include the amount of the check in income    for 2012   constructive receipt    you have constructive receipt of    income when an amount is credited to your account or made available to    you without restriction you do not need to have possession of it if    you authorize someone to be your agent and receive income for you you    are treated as having received it when your agent received it example     interest is credited to your bank account in december 2012 you do not    withdraw it or enter it into your passbook until 2013 you must    include it in your gross income for 2012   delaying receipt of income     you can not hold checks or postpone taking possession of similar    property from one tax year to another to avoid paying tax on the    income you must report the income in the year the property is    received or made available to you without restriction example    jones a service contractor was entitled to receive a $ 10,000    payment on a contract in december 2012 she was told in december that    her payment was available at her request she was not paid until    january 2013 she must include this payment in her 2012 income because    it was constructively received in 2012   checks    receipt of a valid    check by the end of the tax year is constructive receipt of income in    that year even if you can not cash or deposit the check until the    following year example dr. received a check for $ 500 on december 31 2012 from a    patient she could not deposit the check in her business account until    january 2 2013 she must include this fee in her income for 2012 in general it is best not to cut it close if the check is to be counted as an january event it is best to send it in january if it is to be december event it is best to send it early enough to be able to say with confidence that the check arrived at the destination before the end of the year

first thing to do when you notice a credit card fraud is to call the respective banks who issues the credit card and most banks immediately as far as my experience goes twice they will cancel the credit card and issue a new card with different number your credit card account will remain the same no effect on credit score as the account is still active its just the credit card number is changed if you are more concerned about identity theft there are two further options you can pursue place a fraud alert ask 1 of the 3 credit reporting companies to put    a fraud alert on your credit report they must tell the other 2    companies an initial fraud alert can make it harder for an identity    thief to open more accounts in your name the alert lasts 90 days but    you can renew it as per federal trade commission credit freeze if you ’re concerned about identity theft those reported mega data breaches or someone gaining access to your credit    report without your permission you might consider placing a credit    freeze on your report as per federal trade commission

for a non technical investor meaning someone who does n't try to do all the various technical analysis things that theoretically point to specific investments or trends having a diverse portfolio and rebalancing it periodically will typically be the best solution for example i might have a long term growth portfolio that is 40 broad stock market fund 40 large industry specific market funds and 20 bond funds   if the market as a whole tanks then i might end up in a situation where my funds are invested 30 market 35 industry 35 bonds   okay sell those bonds which are presumably high and put that into the market which is presumably low   now back to    then when the market goes up we may end up at say in which case we sell some of the broad market fund and buy some bond funds back to   ultimately ending up always selling high whatever is currently the other two and buying low whatever is underperforming    having the industry specific fund(s means i can balance a bit between different sectors maybe the healthcare industry takes a beating for a while so that goes low and i can sell some of my tech industry fund and buy that    none of this depends on timing anything you can rebalance maybe twice a year not worrying about where the market is at that exact time and definitely not targeting a correction specifically   you just analyze your situation and adjust to make everything back in line with what you want this is n't guaranteed to succeed any more than any other strategy is of course and has some risk particularly if you rebalance in the middle of a major correction so you end up buying something that goes down more   but for long term investments it should be fairly sound

it depends on how much money it is going to save you how secure your job is and how much risk is acceptable to you the main problem with taking out a 401k loan for anything is that you have to pay it back within ~60 days of loosing your job which would be precisely when you need your savings the most and then you get the tough choice of using your savings to repay the 401k loan assuming you have an emergency fund or possibly not having enough money to live on until you find another job if you do n't have an emergency fund you are going to get stuck with a substantial tax bill 10 penalty plus taxes at your marginal rate there are definitely advantages to avoiding pmi and you will probably get a pretty decent return on investment mortgage interest rate + cost of pmi but there are risks as well

disclaimer it 's hard to be definitive as there may be some law or tax rule i 'm not aware of from a uk perspective this should be perfectly legal if it 's just a one off or occasional thing for personal reasons rather than being done in the course of a business there probably are n't any tax implications in theory if there 's an identifiable profit from the transaction e.g. because you originally obtained the inr at a lower exchange rate then you might be liable to capital gains tax however this is only payable above approximately £ 10 k capital gains see so unless this is a very large transaction or you have other gains in the tax year you do n't need to worry about that i would only recommend doing this if you trust each other if one side transfers the money and the other does n't the international nature will make it quite hard in practice to enforce the agreement legally even though i think that in theory it should be possible if the sums involved are large you may find that the transaction is automatically reported to the authorities by your bank under money laundering regulations or they may want documentation of the source of the funds reason for the transaction this does n't automatically mean you 'll have a problem but the transaction may receive some scrutiny i think that reporting typically kicks in when several thousand pounds are involved

it sounds like something is getting lost in translation here a business owner should not have to pay personal income tax on business expenses with the caveat that they are truly business expenses here 's an example where what you described could happen suppose a business has $ 200 k in revenue and $ 150 k in legitimate business expenses wages and owner salaries taxes services products goods etc the profit for this example business is $ 50k. depending on how the business is structured sole proprietor llc s corp etc the business owner(s may have to pay personal income tax on the $ 50 k in profit if the owner then decided to have the business purchase a new vehicle solely for personal use with say $ 25 k of that profit then the owner may think he could avoid paying income tax on $ 25 k of the $ 50k. however this would not be considered a legitimate business expense and therefore would have to be reclassified as personal income and would be taxed as if the $ 25 k was paid to the owner if the vehicle truly was used for legitimate business purposes then the business expenses would end up being $ 175 k with $ 25 k left as profit which is taxable to the owners note this is an oversimplification as it 's oftentimes the case that vehicles are partially used for business instead of all or nothing in fact large items such as vehicles are typically depreciated so the full purchase price could not be deducted in a single year if many of the purchases are depreciated items instead of deductions then this could explain why it appears that the business expenses are being taxed it 's not a tax on the expense but on the income that has n't been reduced by expenses since only a portion of the big ticket item can be treated as an expense in a single year

i think you take some pretty big liberties assuming i think people deserve failure if you assume i think that please note that this speaks more to how you view people who are not wealthy than i do   that aside i think you 're using lucky in a way that most people do not in this instance   is it lucky to eventually achieve a reasonable goal with decades of consistency sure in the ways that i mentioned nuclear war did n't break out no fatal traffic accidents happened etc   do you think that is what people usually mean when they say people who have more money are just lucky or do you think they use the term lucky to mean there is no merit basis for the difference   side note i 'm not saying everyone with money has it because of merit any more than i am saying everyone without money deserves to be broke if anything i 'm disagreeing with the semantics used to discuss wealth and income disparity partly because it is divisive

its called a grace period and you are not paying interest on the 0 bt you are paying interest on the amount you spent in purchases if you do not pay your balance in full by the due date your grace period ends this means that you have to pay interest on the purchased amount from the day it is made this is why when you do a balance transfer the card should be put in the sock drawer until the bt is paid off in order to restore the grace period you must pay the balance in full and the grace period will start during the next payment cycle lets assume statement cuts on the 1st and due date is the 20th you make the minimum payment of $ 10 balance now is $ 100 since you have a balance of $ 100 from the previous statement and a new purchase of $ 50.00 when the next statement cuts you will have to pay interest according to the terms on the $ 50.00 portion in order to get the grace period back you will have to pay in full and wait for the next cycle in case i did not explain it well here is a quote from dot com website the cost of carrying a balance    this is because carrying a balance of    any size into the next billing cycle means there is no grace period on    your purchases during that cycle the card company will begin charging    interest on your purchases the day you make them so leaving even $ 1    in unpaid balance on your card will cost you considerably more than    the measly finance charges on that dollar to see how this works let 's consider an imaginary card user named    sally she 's so happy she got a new credit card that she charges    $ 1,500 in purchases on the first day of her monthly billing cycle    after the cycle ends sally pays off the entire $ 1,500 by the due    date wiping her balance to zero as a result her purchases during    the second month are also free of interest she has used her grace    period wisely to avoid finance charges what happens if sally leaves just $ 1 of her balance from the first    month unpaid that $ 1 begins to accrue interest starting the first day    of the billing cycle it 's just $ 1 so the interest is not a big deal    but because she used up her grace period without paying off her entire debt her new purchases during the second month also start to    get hit with interest charges immediately starting the day of the    transaction assuming she makes another $ 1,500 in purchases at the    average annual interest rate of about 13 percent that means $ 16 in    finance charges for the month if sally repeats this pattern the    interest costs add up to $ 190 over the course of a year

have you considered a self directed ira to invest rather than the stock market or publicly traded assets your ira can actually own direct title to real estate loan money via secured or unsecured promissory notes much like a hard money loan or invest into shares of an entity that invests in real estate the only nuance is that the ira holder is responsible for finding and deciding upon the investment vehicle   just an option outside of the normal parameters if you have an existing ira or old 401(k or other qualified plan this might be an option for you

gnucash is much more designed for accounting than for budgeting while it does have some simple budgeting features they 're largely based around tracking how much has been spent in the expense categories accounts and seeing how close one is to a limit that 's been set because the point of gnucash is accounting there 's not a way to track an expense in two expense categories simultaneously you can split a transaction across multiple categories to have a grocery store purchase of $ 150 be split across $ 100 food and $ 50 phone minutes or whatever but not have a $ 150 purchase be tracked as $ 150 food and $ 150 household expenses because that 's not how double entry accounting works the closest way to do what i think you 're looking for is to take advantage of the account structure and repeat as needed for example this would allow you to see household expenses vs. vacation expenses and still see what it got spent on reporting on all food purchases if you want to do so is slightly more tricky as you 'd need to select all those food categories separately in your report but it 's possible you speak about wanting to track expenses multiple ways so i think that this would allow you to record data sufficient to track it but the point of tracking any data is to be able to report on it in some fashion so if you have more specific reporting requirements you might want to ask about that as well

the issue of unclaimed life insurance policies is a hot topic right now your questions are exactly the reason why for a long time unclaimed life insurance policies have been a boon to life insurance companies but the states are cracking down there is a lot of new legislation that requires the companies to make a diligent effort to find the rightful beneficiary in some states if the beneficiary ca n't be found the proceeds wind up in the states abandoned assets fund the death benefit is payable if the policy was in force on the date of death since no premium is actually due after the insured dies it does n't matter if the policy after the insured dies you 're correct that there is no one place to go to find out if you are the beneficiary of an unclaimed life insurance policy our agency has a resource page which gives you tactics to follow in order to do a search see how to find lost or unclaimed life insurance policies

there are a few factors at work here supply and demand being the main one the office for national statistics has some good information supply has historically struggled to compete with demand in the uk and this situation has been since the 1980s when margaret thatcher was prime minister   she set up a variety of schemes to encourage people to own their own home such as tax relief and since then home ownership in the uk has increased dramatically the then conservative government also set up the right to buy scheme in 1980 that allowed council tenants to purchase their council houses at a discounted rate   the effect of this was to increase the number of home owners whilst reducing the amount of housing available for councils to rent to new tenants   anecdotal evidence i ca n't find a documented source to back this up suggests that councils did not build sufficient new homes to replace those purchased by their ex tenants the population of the uk has also increased by around 10 million since 1980 around 20 and this has pushed up demand for housing   house building in the uk has not kept pace with these factors that has led to a shortage of supply that has pushed up prices there 's another factor at play here as well   if you go back to the 1970s around 53 of women would go out to work but in 2013 this figure increased to 67 as it became more common for households to have double incomes   this extra supply of cash also pushed up house prices your question regards a debt based monetary system is not entirely clear but there are limitations put onto how much money people can borrow that are potentially limiting how much house prices can rise by   today most lenders are more conservative in how much they will lend but this was n't the case in the mid 2000s when house prices rose very quickly    lenders are more cautious today after the crash of the late 2000s but things are to relax again and they are starting to lend more which could in turn lead to further house price rises in line with what was seen in the 2000s recessions have with house prices falling back or at least being stable   in the 1980s house prices from 1980 to 1988 but then fell back a little as the recession hit before starting to rise again in 1997   this rise was sustained until 2008 during which time prices again   based on this you could assume prices will again as we come out of the recession as long as this is sustained for 8 years or so however as the potential for more households to become double income is reduced high female employment already and wages are unlikely to raise that quickly this may not be realistic unless the mortgage lenders become extremely lax to the point of reckless to answer your other question about the affordability of housing this will be based on the level of wages in the uk and how strict or lax the lenders are also taking into effect the availability of housing for purchase   if wages rise house prices will rise if lenders are willing to lend more money house prices will rise and if demand continues to supply prices will rise none of the major uk political parties are likely to solve the problems of population growth and not enough houses being built so it is likely prices will rise but you could argue that they are not far off a peak based on current wages and lenders attitudes   if the uk economy continues to recover from the recession it is possible they will fuel another housing boom by lending ever increasing salary multiples as happened in the 2000s unless there is government intervention ie regulation of the lenders

first check out some of the answers on this question oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing when you have determined that you are ready to invest for retirement there are two things you need to consider the investment and the account   these are separate items the investment is what makes your money grow the type of account provides tax advantages and restrictions   generally these can be considered separately for the most part you can do any type of investment in any account briefly here is an overview of some of the main options in your situation the roth ira is what i would recommend this grows tax free and if you need the funds for some reason you can get out what you put in without penalty you can invest up to $ 5500 in your roth ira each year in addition to the above reasons which are true for anybody a roth ira would be especially beneficial for you for three reasons for someone that is closer in age to retirement and in a higher tax bracket now a roth ira is less attractive than it is for you inside your roth ira there are lots of choices you can invest in stocks bonds mutual funds which are simply collections of stocks and bonds bank accounts precious metals and many other things discussing all of these investments in one answer is too broad but my recommendation is this if you are investing for retirement you should be investing in the stock market however picking individual stocks is too risky you need to be diversified in a lot of stocks stock mutual funds are a great way to invest in the stock market   there are lots of different types of stock mutual funds with different strategies and expenses associated with them managed funds actively buy and sell different stocks inside them but have high expenses to pay the managers index funds buy and hold a list of stocks and have very low expenses the conventional wisdom is that in general index funds perform better than managed funds when you take the expenses into account   i hope this overview and these recommendations were helpful if you have any specific questions about any of these types of accounts or investments feel free to ask another question

i really like keshlam 's answer your age is also a consideration if you make your own target fund by matching the allocations of whatever vanguard offers i 'd suggest re balancing every year or every other year but if you 're just going to match the allocations of their target fund you might as well just invest in the target fund itself most not all just most target funds do not charge an additional management fee so you just pay the fees of the underlying funds same as if you mirrored the target fund yourself check the prospectus to see if an additional fee is charged or not you may want to consider a more aggressive approach than the target funds you can accomplish this by selecting a target fund later than your actual retirement age or by picking your own allocations the target funds become more conservative as you approach retirement age so selecting a later target is a way of moving the risk reward ratio i 'm not saying target funds are necessarily the best choice you should get professional advice etc etc

while a margin account is not required to trade options a margin account is necessary to take delivery of an exercised put the puts can be bought in a cash account so long as the cash necessary to fund the trade is available if you do choose to exercise which almost never has a positive expected value relative to selling except after the final trading time before expiration taxes notwithstanding then your shares will be put to your counterparty since options almost always trade in round lots 100 shares will have to fund the put exercise or a margin account must satisfy the difference for your situation trading out of both positions would be probably be best

there are a few reason why the stock price decreases after a dividend is paid   what 's the point of paying a dividend if the stock price automatically decreases do n't the shareholders just break even companies have to do something with their profits they beholden to their shareholders to make them money either by increasing the share value or paying dividends so they have the choice between reinvesting their profits into the company to grow the business or just handing the profits directly to the owners of the business the shareholders some companies are as big as they want to be and investing their profits into more capital offers them diminishing returns these companies are more likely to pay dividends to their shareholders i assume the price of the stock naturally increases over the year to reflect the amount of the dividend payment this is kind of a vague question but then does n't it make it difficult to evaluate the fluctuations in stock price in the way that you would a company that does n't pay a dividend it depends on the company the price may recover the dividend drop could take a few days to a week and that on the company 's performance and the overall market performance   with respect to options i assume nothing special happens so say i bought $ 9 call options yesterday that were in the money all of a sudden they 're just not is this typically priced into the option price is there anything else i need to know about buying options in companies that pay dividends what if i had an in the money option and all of a sudden out of nowhere a company decides to pay a dividend for the first time am i just screwed one key is that dividends are announced in advance typically at least if not always not sure if it 's required by law but i would n't be surprised this is one reason people will sometimes exercise a call option early because they want to get the actual stock in order to earn the dividend for out of the ordinary large cash dividends over 10 is the guideline stock splits or other situations an option can be adjusted if you have an options account they probably sent you a characteristics and risks of standardized options booklet it has a section discussing this topic and the details of what kinds of situations trigger an adjustment a regular pre announced < 10 dividend does not while a special large dividend would is what i roughly get from it that characteristics and risks of standardized options is worth reading by the way it 's long and complicated but well options are complicated finally do all companies reduce their stock price when they pay a dividend are they required to i 'm just shocked i 've never heard of this before the company does n't directly control the stock price but i do believe this is automatic i think the market does this automatically because if they did n't there would be enough people trying to do dividend capture arbitrage that it would ultimately drive down the price

a financial planner can help with investments insurance estate planning budgeting retirement planning saving for college tax planning prep and other money topics one way to get a sense is to look at this certified financial planner topic list another idea is to look at this book my favorite i 've read which covers roughly a similar topic list in a concise form it could not hurt at all to read that before deciding to visit a planner so you have baseline knowledge by the way look for the cfp certification which is a generalist certification a cfp might also have a deeper cert in certain topics or connect you with someone who does for example you really want a generalist cfp who may have an additional credential as well the idea is to look at what you 're trying to accomplish and all finance related areas especially because there may be tradeoffs the cfp would then refer you to or work with lawyers accountants etc importantly some advisors are fiduciaries must act in your interests and some are not in particular many stockbrokers are neither qualified planners no cfp or equivalent nor are they fiduciaries stay away there are several models for paying a financial planner including there 's an organization called napfa for fiduciary non commission based planners membership there is a good thing to look for since it 's a third party that defines what fee only means and requires the no commissions fiduciary standard finally the alternative i ended up choosing was to just take the cfp course myself you can do it online via correspondence course it costs about the same as 1 year of professional advice i also took the exam just to be sure i learned the stuff this is the extreme diy approach but it is cheaper over time and you know you are not going to defraud yourself you still might do things that are counterproductive and not in your interests but you know that already probably anyway i think it 's equivalent to about a quarter 's worth of work at a decent college or so there are about 6 textbooks to dig through you wo n't be an experienced expert at the end but you 'll know a lot to get an actual cfp cert you need 3 years experience on top of the courses and the exam i have n't done that just the book learning someone who puts cfp after their name will have the 3 years on top of the training some editorial many planners emphasize investing and many people looking for planners or books on finance emphasize investing this is a big mistake in my view investing is more or less a commodity and you just need someone who wo n't screw it up overcharge and/or lose your money on something idiotic or inappropriate some people are in plain bad and inappropriate investments do n't get me wrong but once you fix that and just get into anything decent your biggest planning concerns are probably elsewhere on investments i 'd look for a planner to just get you out of overpriced annuities and expensive mutual funds you may have been sold anything you were sold by a salesperson is probably crap and look for them to help you decide how much to invest and how much in stocks vs. bonds those are the most important investment decisions

if you have a mortgage making part of it a mortgage backed overdraft anz call theirs a loan is worth looking at i 'm in a similar situation consulting since 2010 i pay gst and provisional tax every six months if i 've budgeted right the balance on the mortgage backed overdraft loan goes to zero right before i send the massive payment to the tax department in may and october   one problem is that some banks do n't like to give these accounts to sole traders using a mortgage broker may help get around that restriction

everyone tells stories so that their side is the good guy and the other the bad guy   one way we do this is to cast good acts as a reaction to other bad acts   they acted first and we are just restoring balance and justice to the universe   gt;they're strategically aligning stimulus with tax changes benefitting the rich to make it appear as though the tax changes make the economy better because they know it will make it worse   that is one way to frame the issue   we are preserving the norm and they are changing things for the worse   the problem is the truth of the matter is a long succession of back and forth moves   it is trivial to the issue   take the affordable care act   income taxpayers also help pay for obamacare the health law requires workers to pay a tax equal to 0.9 of their wages over $ 200,000 if single or $ 250,000 if married filing jointly to finance medicare ’s hospital insurance it also imposes a 3.8 on various forms of investment income for taxpayers whose modified adjusted gross income is over $ 200,000 if single or $ 250,000 if married filing jointly those provisions will account for $ billion in revenues by 2025 according to the cbo money collection is obamacare paid   are they benefitting the rich or correcting a harm   if you pass legislation which entails spending and your consistent solution is to burden one portion of the populace to provide benefits all around because the rest can not afford how you attempt to solve the problem then do you think those you burden might politically organize   do n't get me wrong   i lived in japan for over a decade and very much appreciated living in a country with national health care   i just do n't believe in good guys and bad guys in all this

my shocking suggestion would be to not bandwagon onto knee jerk first idea that popped into the op 's head actions instead why not put the most people on the issue give them time to make a proposal i am thinking quants and the folks that know the issues inside and out    drives me up a wall that we have phds serving coffee and we still try and fix complex issues by racing to out the first and loudest    anyway my might be not a tax a   time delay based on typical trade execution might work small enough to be unnoticed by distant traders but enough to level the playing field    but again i would rather the answer did nt come from idiots such as myself and the op i think the exchanges have some motivation to the issues i hope they put the smartest folks available on it

to me the simple answer might be to tap the equity in the $ 400k home you owe $ on and use the proceeds to purchase the new retirement home even if you were to do that you 'd still have almost $ 100k in untapped equity in the existing home no mortgage on the retirement home nothing out of pocket other than refi fees and probably no more of a mortgage payment than you already have on the house with equity   i do n't see any reason why the bank would n't go for that especially if you 've got a good payment history on your existing mortgage i hope this helps good luck

suppose you have been paying interest on previous charges in the past your monthly statement is issued on april 12 and since you just received your income tax refund you pay it off in full on april 30   you do n't charge anything to the card at all after april 12   thus on april 30 your credit card balance   shows as zero since you just paid it off   but your april 12 statement billed you for interest only till april 12   so on may 12 your next monthly bill will be for the interest for your nonzero balance from april 13 through april 30 assuming that you still are not making any new charges on your card and pay off the may 12 bill in timely fashion you will finally have a zero bill on june 12 what if you charge new items to your credit card after april 12 well your balance stopped revolving on april 30 and that 's when interest is no longer charged on the new charges but you do owe interest for a charge on april 13 say until april 30 when your balance is no longer revolving and this will be added to your bill on may 12 purchases made after april 30 will not be charged interest unless you fall off the wagon again and do n't pay your may 12 bill in full by the due date of the bill some time in early june

this is incentive financing simply put the car company is n't in the business of making money by buying government bonds they 're in the business of making money by selling cars if you are qualified from a credit standpoint and want to buy a $ 20k car on any given sunday you 'll typically be offered a loan of between 6 and 9 let 's say this loan is for three years and you can offer $ 4000 down payment and/or trade the required monthly payment on the remaining $ 16k at the high end of 9 is $ which over 3 years means you 'll pay $ in interest now that may sound like a good chunk of change and for the ordinary individual it is possibly enough that you decide not to buy today now let 's say all other things being equal that the company is offering 0.9 incentive financing same price same down payment same loan term your payments over 3 years decrease to $ and over the same loan term you would only pay $ in interest you save over $ in interest over three years which for you is again a decent chunk of change theoretically the car company 's losing that same $ in interest by offering this deal and depending on how it 's getting the money it lends you most financial companies are middlemen getting money from bond buying investors who expect a rate of return that could be a real loss and not just opportunity cost but that incentive got you to walk in their door and not their competitor 's it helped convince you to buy the $ 20,000 car the gross margin on that car price minus direct costs is typically 20 for the dealer plus another 20 for the manufacturer so by giving up the $ 2,000 on the financing side the dealer and manufacturer just earned themselves 4 times that much on top of that by buying that car you 're committing to buy the parts for the car a side business with even higher margins of which the car company gets a pretty big chunk you may even be required to use dealer service while the car 's under warranty in order to keep the warranty valid another when you get right down to it the loss from the incentive financing is drowned in the gross profits they make from selling the car to you now in reality it 's a fine balance the percentages i mentioned are gross margins earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization sales general and administrative costs basically just revenue minus direct cost of goods sold add in all these side costs and you get a net margin of only about 3.5 of revenue so your $ 20k car purchase may only make the car company 's stakeholders $ 700 on the sale plus slightly higher net margins on parts and service over the life of the car because incentive financing is typically only offered through the company 's own financing subsidiary the loss is n't in the form of a cost paid but simply a revenue not realized but it can still move a car company from net positive to net negative earnings if the program is too successful this is why not everyone does it and not all at the same time if you 're selling enough cars without it why give away money   typically these incentives are offered for two reasons to clear out old cars or excess inventory or to maintain ground against a competitor 's stronger sales numbers keeping cars on a lot ready to sell is expensive and so is not having your brand driving around on the street turning heads and their name on the minds of potential customers

quoted from nasdaq has come up with an auction approach called the opening cross here 's how it works in the morning a computer program looks at all the orders that have come in overnight in each different stock based on those orders the program picks a price level that would be the best opening price however it also looks to see if there 's a trade imbalance for example if a company announced bad news after the market closed there might be 10 times more sell orders than buy orders nasdaq then broadcasts the price and imbalance information to its network of dealers with the goal of offsetting the imbalance it then lets dealers place orders this all happens very quickly in a time window of two minutes or so right before the market opens dealers can place orders and those orders are factored into the opening price further reading here opening price calculation

aside from the fact that probably nobody is ever going to come and ask for that proof unless your amounts get five digits or you 're unlucky if you never before reimbursed yourself your old tax would clearly show that you ca n't prove a negative so the only potential is that you had reimbursements before and an audit might ask you to prove that the new ones are not duplicates of those in this case if you have other receipts proof for all those other reimbursements they are obviously not duplicates

gt not to mention that pnl is really all you have to judge a trader   this is how i know your only experience is retail trading   voice trading still represents a large amount of volume in the market especially in otc products and having existing relationships is a guarantee for better points   i see the reality of this every fucking day     not to mention traders performance is also susceptible to in house analysis and risk management both of which at a major firm are determined and managed by different individuals research and risk officers   it 's not like two sigma welcomes you in gives you a $ 500 fi portfolio and lets you do whatever the fuck you want   hedge fund traders operate under the strategy that was to the investors   traders are there to execute profit earning transactions within the guidelines of the overall strategy of the firm and within their risk profile meaning if you 're managing a pension fund on a global macro strategy at one firm and achieve moderate returns of 15 20 you 're going to be viewed far more favorably than at another firm making 20 25 managing an alternative investments listed derivatives fund

a few points that i would note call options could the bond be called away by the issuer this is something to note as some bonds may end up not being as good as one thought because of this option that gets used tax considerations are you going for corporate treasury or different ones may have different tax consequences to note if you are n't holding the bond in a tax advantaged account e.g roth ira ira or 401k convertible or not some bonds are known as since the bond comes with an option on the stock that can be worth considering for some kinds of bonds inflation protection some bonds like tips or series i savings bonds can have inflation protection built into them that can also be worth understanding in the case of tips there are principal adjustments while the savings bond will have a change in its interest rate default risk some of the higher yield bonds may have an issuer go under which is another way one may end up with equity in a company rather than getting their money back on the other side for some one could have the risk of the bond not quite being as good as one thought like some detroit bonds that may end up in a different result given their bankruptcy but there are also revenue bonds that may not meet their target for another situation that may arise some bonds may be insured though this requires a bit more research to know the credit rating of the insurer as for the latter question what if interest rates rise and your bond 's value drops considerably do you hold it until maturity or do you try to sell it and get something that has a higher yield based on face value

some lenders want to discourage the borrower from making these additional payments because they want to sell this as a service they might set this up for you or they have a contract with a 3rd party to set it up these services generally charge you to initiate the process and may have a recurring fee they take 1/2 a payment every 2 weeks then forward the money on the first of the month to the lender once a year they will send in the 13th monthly payment this gives them control of up to a months payment per account   there is no law that says they have to accept early payments so check the documents to make sure it is allowed for that mortgage then send in a test payment directing that the excess funds go to pay down principal verify online that the extra funds were credited correctly even it works once the borrower will have to keep checking to make sure it is handled correctly each month

the difference is in the between the varied investments you make hedging is about specifically offsetting a possible loss in an investment by making another related investment that will increase in value for the same reasons that the original investment would lose value gold for instance is often regarded as the ultimate hedge its value is typically inversely correlated to the rest of the market as a whole because its status as a material durable store of value makes it a preferred safe haven to move money into in times of economic downturn when stock prices bond yields and similar investments are losing value that specific behavior makes investing in gold alongside stocks and bonds a hedge the increase in value of gold as stock prices and bond yields fall limits losses in those other areas investment of cash in gold is also specifically a hedge against currency inflation paper money account balances and even debt instruments like bonds and cds can lose real value over time in a hot economy where there 's more money than things to buy with it by keeping a store of value in something other than currency the price of that good will rise as the currencies used to buy it decrease in real value maintaining your level of real wealth other hedges are more localized one might for example trade oil futures as a hedge on a position in transportation stocks when oil prices rise trucking and airline companies suffer in the short term as their margins get squeezed due to fuel costs currency futures are another popular hedge a company in international business will often trade options on the currencies of the companies it does business in to limit the seen in the forex spot market caused by speculation and other transient changes in market demand diversification by contrast is about choosing multiple unrelated investments the idea being to limit losses due to a localized change in the market companies stocks gain and lose value every day and those companies can also go out of business without bringing the entire economy to its knees by spreading your wealth among investments in multiple industries and companies of various sizes and global locations you insulate yourself against the risk that any one of them will fail   if tomorrow kroger grocery stores went bankrupt and all its stores people in the regions it serves might be but the market as a whole will move on you however would have lost everything if you 'd bet your retirement on that one stock nobody does that in the real world instead you put some of your money in kroger some in microsoft some in home depot some in some in pg&e etc etc by investing in stocks that would be more or less unaffected by a downturn in another if kroger went bankrupt tomorrow you would still have say 95 of your investment next egg still alive well and continuing to pay you dividends the flip side is that if tomorrow kroger announced an exclusive deal with the girl scouts to sell their cookies making them the only place in the country you can get them you would miss out on the full possible amount of gains you 'd get from the price spike if you had bet everything on kroger   hindsight 's always 20/20 i could have spent some beer money to buy bitcoins when they were changing hands for pennies and i 'd be a multi millionaire right now you ca n't think that way when investing because it 's survivor bias you see the successes topping the index charts not the failures you could just as easily have invested in any of the hundreds of internet startups that do n't last a year

i would go even farther than victor 's answer   there is little evidence that candlestick patterns and technical analysis in general have any predictive power    even if they did in the past of which there is some evidence in modern times they are so easy to do on computers that if they worked algorithmic traders would have scanned almost all traded stocks and bought sold the stock before you even had a chance to look at the graph while the best technical traders who are very good at quickly using pattern recognition across many indicators as victor mentioned might be able to add some advantage   the odds that a pattern so simple to code such as bullish would have predictive power is tiny

a friend asked me a similar question in her case it was in the larger context of a marriage and house purchase in reply i wrote a detail article student loans and your first mortgage   the loan payment easily fit between the generally accepted qualifying debt ratios 28 for for all debt if the loan payment has no effect on the mortgage one qualifies for that 's one thing but taking say $ 20 k to pay it off will impact the house you can buy for a 20 down purchase this up to $ 100k less house or worse a lower down payment percent then requiring pmi   clearly i had a specific situation to address which ultimately becomes part of the list for pay off student loan pro con   absent the scenario i offered i 'd line up debt highest to lowest rate tax adjusted of course and hack away at it all it 's part of the big picture like any other debt save for the cases where it can be cancelled   personal finance is exactly that personal advisors the good ones make their money by looking carefully at the big picture and not offering a cookie cutter approach

if you are looking for a simple formula or buying order strategy to guarantee a lower buying price unfortunately this does not exist   otherwise all investors would employ this strategy and the financial markets would no longer have an validity aka arbitrage   buying any investment contains a certain level of risk other than us treasuries of course having said that there are many option buying strategies that can employed to help increase your ror or hedge an existing position   most of these strategies are based a predicted future direction of a stock on the investor 's part   for example you hold the ford stock and feel they are releasing their earnings report next week   you feel that they will not meet investors expectations   you do n't want to sell your shares but what you can do is buy put options   if the stock does indeed go down then you make money on your put options here is a document on options   it is moderately technical but very good if you want a good introduction on the subject   the strategy that i described above is on pg 33

gt;i propose to make the requirements for finish high school and college degrees much much higher as it was in the past   not gon na happen the paradigm is that low scores are entrenched and therefore unable to be lifted without the kids parents having higher education   therefore waiting for disadvantaged kids to get higher scores will not happen until they get accepted into college   if you force schools to gain their income from future students earnings they will have high concern for kids that have a good p e ratio   it will also stop the loan industry from putting these kids into debt    the downside is that it may turn colleges into trade techs but that is much better than what is going on now useless degrees and high debt

if they really want cash you notify your bank in advance of the amount and have it put in your account then you both sign the paperwork at the bank and after everything is signed you have the bank hand them the money it after that is entirely their problem personally i would consider this a stupid request and tell them to have their lawyer discuss it with my lawyer in the hope they can be talked out of it   as far as where to get the money same as for any purchase find a bank willing to write a mortgage for you on this new house what you choose to do about the other two houses is an independent question you can sell one or both but that may take money so you probably wo n't finish doing so before needing to pay for the new house of course when they do sell you can use the money toward paying down paying off the new mortgage

yes instead of paying a cash dividend to shareholders the company grants existing shareholders new shares at a previously determined price i 'm sorry but scrip issues are free for all ordinary shareholders and are in proportion to existing share holding no payment is required from shareholders so instead of having 10 $ 1 shares the shareholder if accepts now could have 20 50p shares if it was a one for one scrip issue

as the other answer said the person who owns the lent stock does not benefit directly   they may benefit indirectly in that brokers can use the short lending profits to reduce their fees or in that they have the option to short other stocks at the same terms    follow up question what prevents the broker lending the shares for a very short time less than a day pocketing the interest and returning the lenders their shares without much change in share price because borrowing period was very short what prevents them from doing that many times a day lack of market    short selling for short periods of time is n't so common as to allow for many times a day   some day traders may do it occasionally but i do n't know that it would be a reliable business model to supply them   if there are enough people interested in shorting the stock they will probably want to hold onto it long enough for the anticipated movement to happen    there are transaction costs here   both fees for trading at all and the extra charges for short sale borrowing and interest   most stocks do not move down by large enough amounts many times a day   their fluctuations are smaller   if the stock does n't move enough to cover the transaction fees then that seller lost money overall   over time sellers like that will stop trading as they will lose all their money    all that said there are no legal blocks to loaning the stock out many times just practical ones   if a stock was varying wildly for some bizarre reason it could happen

there are two different tax returns you 'll be doing one is for her until the day of her death the other is for the estate the personal one you could probably do on your own it 's nothing different from the one for a living person except for the cut off date in the middle of the year the estate tax return may be a bit more nuanced since it is a trust return and not an individual return and is done under a different set of rules i 'd suggest talking to a tax professional who 'd help you your estate should be doing the estate tax return or hiring someone to do it sorry for your loss

i 'll try to answer using your original example   first let me restate your assumptions slightly modified the mutual fund has note that i say the mutual fund has those gains and losses that 's because they occur inside the mutual fund and not directly to you as a shareholder i use realized gains and losses because the only gains and losses handled this way are those causes by actual asset stock sales within the fund as directed by fund management   changes in the value of fund holdings that are not sold are not included in this as a holder of the fund you learn the values of x y and z after the end of the year when the fund management reports the values   for gains you will also typically see the values reported on your 1099-div under capital gains distributions   for example your 1099-div for year 3 will have the value z for capital gains besides reporting any ordinary dividends in another box    your year 1 1099 will have $ 0 capital gains distributions shown because of the rule you highlighted in bold net realized losses are not distributed   this capital loss however can later be used to the mutual fund holder 's tax advantage   the fund 's internal accounting carries forward the loss and uses it to offset later realized gains   thus your year 2 1099 will have a capital gain distribution of y x not y thus recognizing the loss which occurred thus the loss is taken into account   note that for capital gains you the holder pay no tax in year 1 pay tax in year 2 on y x and pay tax in year 3 on z. all the above is the way it works whether or not you sell the shares immediately after the end of year 3 or you hold the shares for many more years   whenever you do sell the shares you will have a gain or loss but that is different from the fund 's realized losses we have been talking about x y and z

historically most economists considered a sustained negative interest rate impossible for just the reason you describe an investor could outperform a bond with a negative interest rate by simply hoarding cash for background see wikipedia by central banks in the wake of the 2007 financial crisis however demonstrates that slightly negative interest rates are possible first of all note that the zero lower bound on interest rates has everything to do with the existence of cash as an alternative it 's a lower bound on the nominal interest rate rather than the real interest rate that is on the rate before adjusting for inflation in most situations the real interest rate is more economically meaningful as it 's the real interest rate that measures the market 's preference for stuff now as opposed to stuff later there 's nothing in principle or in practice to stop a negative real interest rate there are always some people who want stuff now and some people who want stuff later a negative real interest rate just means that people who want stuff later are more dominant in the market as i stated earlier what creates the zero lower bound is the existence of cash as an alternative to bonds even though that lower bound applies it 's not strict hoarding cash in large quantities can be difficult and expensive especially when central banks are doing their best to prevent you from doing it consequently investors who strongly prefer stuff later to stuff now are willing to pay a slightly negative nominal interest rate on bonds in order to avoid those costs if it were significantly negative however you 're right that no sane investor would buy such a bond

collateralized secured are interchangeable terms note the following two quotes from wikipedia links below a secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges some asset e.g. a car or property as collateral for the loan which then becomes a secured debt owed to the creditor who gives the loan in lending agreements collateral is a borrower 's pledge of specific property to a lender to secure repayment of a loan this website also uses the terms interchangeably loan line of credit are not interchangeable terms   in a loan you receive a one time disbursement repay it over a fixed amortization schedule think home mortgage in a line of credit you can pay back re borrow from your credit line as often as you need think credit card or home equity line of credit

from your question i believe that you are looking for what these mean in accounting terms and not the difference between a debit and a credit card i 'll deal with purchase and sale first as this is easier they are the same thing seen from different points of view if i sell something to you then i have made a sale and you have made a purchase every sale is a purchase and every purchase is a sale debits and credits are accounting terms and refer to double column accounting the most common accounting system used the way a set of accounts works is accounts are set up under the following broad the first 3 appear on the balance sheet so called because the accounts balance assets = liabilities + equity this is always a point in time snapshot of the accounts 1 june 2015 that last 3 appear on the profit and loss sheet profit or loss = income cost of goods sold expenses this is always an interval measure 1 july 2014 to 30 june 2015 changes in these accounts flow through to the equity part of the balance sheet when you enter a transaction the debits always equal the credits they are simply applied to different accounts debits increase assets cost of goods sold and expenses and decrease liabilities equity and income credits do the reverse for your examples 1 a customer buy something from me what is the debit and credit i will assume they pay $ 1,000 and the thing cost you $ 500 your cash asset goes up by $ 1,000 debit your inventory asset goes down by $ 500 credit your sales revenue income goes up by $ 500 credit this gives you a profit of $ 500 2 a customer buy something of worth 1000 but gives me 500 what is      debit and credit your cash asset goes up by $ 500 debit your debtors asset goes up by $ 500 your inventory asset goes down by $ 500 credit your sales revenue income goes up by $ 500 credit this also gives you a profit of $ 500 3 if i buy a product from supplier worth 1000 and pay equally what is credit and debit i assume you mean pay cash your cash asset goes down by $ 1000 credit your inventory asset goes up by $ 1000 debit there is no profit or loss here you have swapped one asset cash for another inventory 4 if i buy a product from supplier worth 1000 and do n't pay what is credit and debit your creditors liability goes up by $ 1000 credit your inventory asset goes up by $ 1000 debit there is no profit or loss here you have gained an asset inventory but incurred a liability creditors the reason for confusion is that most people only see debits and credits in one place their bank statement your bank statement is a journal of one of the banks liability accounts its their liability because they owe the money to you even loan accounts adopt this convention credits happen when you give money to the bank they credit   your account increase a liability and debit their cash balance increase an asset debits are when they give money to you they debit your account decrease a liability and credit their cash balance decrease an asset if at the end of the period you have a credit balance then they owe money to you a debit balance means you owe money to them if you were keeping a book of accounts then your record of the transactions would be a mirror image of the bank 's because you would be looking at it from your point of view

what you may be looking for are multi manager etfs these invest in a basket of diversified funds to get the best out of all of the funds the problem with multi manager funds is of course that you pay fees twice once to the fund itself and once to each of the funds in the fund the low fees on etfs mean that it is not very profitable to actively maintain one so there are not many around googling returns very few noting that historic success does n't guarantee future success and that fees are being applied to fees these funds only really benefit from diversification of manager performance risk partial source of information and an example of a non outperforming multi manager etf

there some specific circumstances when you would have a long term gain option 1   if you meet all of these conditions then you 've got a long term gain on the stock   the premium on the option gets rolled into the capital gain on the stock and is not taxed separately   from the irs if a call you write is exercised and you sell the underlying stock increase your amount realized on the sale of the stock by the amount you received for the call when figuring your gain or loss the gain or loss is long term or short term depending on your holding period of the stock option 2 if you did n't hold the underlying and the exercise of the call that you wrote resulted in a short position you might also be able to get to a long term gain by buying the underlying while keeping your short position open and then crossing them to close both positions after one year in other words do n't buy to cover just buy so that your account shows both a long and a short position in the same security   your broker probably allows this but if not you could buy in a different account than the one with the short position   that would get you to this rule as a general rule you determine whether you have short term or long term capital gain or loss on a short sale by the amount of time you actually hold the property eventually delivered to the lender to close the short sale option 1 is probably reasonably common   option 2 i would guess is uncommon and likely not worthwhile i do not think that the wash sale rules can help string along options from expiration to expiration though   option 1 has some elements of what you wrote in i find that paragraph a bit confusing but the wash sale does not help you out

until you find a job i would recommend doing nothing more than a bank checking account or a checking and savings account   some alternatives such as savings bonds would be okay if you were perfectly sure you did not need the money in the next six months   consider working for a place such as mcdonald 's in the meantime once you have stable employment there are two paths you could take   the first is a bond fund   it would provide fair market returns for the time between now and the collection of social security   the second would be a traditional annuity   you have to be careful with them   if it sounds much better than what others are offering it is probably a scam   your interest in an annuity is that it will pay you money for as long as you live   if you live to be 105 you will still be getting payments   a bond fund would have run out of money long ago by that time the biggest thing for you right now is getting to when medicare takes over from private health   looking for any job is important right now to preserve cash although i do not normally recommend annuities i do with smaller amounts of cash   it is unlikely you will ever recover this sum again and the time remaining to save is very short   the greatest challenge with an annuity is regret   you ca n't get the money back once you have turned it into an income stream   on the other hand it will last as long as you live the only important caveat is that if you are in poor health then the bond fund would be better for you because you may not live to be very old

cheapest is one thing   you can absolutely shop in the market and find the lowest possible price   i can think of three places to shop each with an up and downside i would think that what you really mean is the best price for the service   just like shopping for a car you have to decide what you need vs what is nice to have decide what features you need   do you need long distance   do you need caller i d   do you need to call friends and family find out what you have available to you through associations   often schools work or a club you belong to have deals for service discounts   look at your insurance plan or aaa membership for the crazy discounts decide what kinds of service will meet your needs buy the cheapest service do not enter a contract   even if the price is slightly lower   at least not at first   if you try out your service and love it enter the contract if and only if the total price measured over length of the contract is less   with cell phones especially it is absolutely possible to save money buying month to month vs a 2 year contract   even when you buy equipment for full price up front ask for the bare minimum service from your local phone company because phone companies are often regulated monopolies they might have a bare minimum level of service they are required to offer by the municipality   they probably do n't advertise it or push it but it might exist if you call and ask   you basically get a dial tone price is dictated by a government board so you do n't have to worry about shopping for deals not the cheapest possible solution this is popular plan the youth oriented market but more and more people of all demographics are using their cellphones only   there are downsides 911 etc and shopping for the best cell phone plan can be a full time job but it does offer a way to save money by simply not having home phone service might be possible to score organizational discounts through work or groups you belong to cellphones require batteries and can go dead not good for emergencies voice over internet protocol uses your existing internet connection   you can buy a cheap regular phone and plug it into the voip box and use it like any other phone   voip can either be very inexpensive for all the features you get or just plain inexpensive   there are providers who sell a monthly service yearly service or no service plan at all you buy a device and get service as long as you own the device   taxes to the government are always due so nothing is ever free sometimes the provider is just computer software so a minimalist would like that emergency services are more reliable than cellular if you follow extra steps to set them up can be confusing to buy   some require contracts some special devices some require a bit of technical know how to setup   be sure to evaluate the total cost of ownership when comparing prices

if you 're under audit you should get a proper representation i.e. ea or cpa licensed in california and experienced with the ftb audit representation there 's a penalty on failure to file form 1099 but it is with the irs not the ftb if i remember correctly it 's something like $ 50 or $ 100 per instance technically they can disqualify deductions claiming you paid under the table and no taxes were paid on the other side however i doubt they 'd do it in a case of simple of filing 1099 forms check with your licensed tax adviser keep in mind that for the irs 2011 is now closed since the 3-year statute of limitations has passed for california the statute is 4 years and you 're almost at the end of it however since you 're already under audit they may ask you to agree to extend it

this depends on the terms and conditions of your ira account and those of the investments you have chosen in general you are better off investing as quickly as is feasible given those terms   money in your cash account does n't earn much of a return so the quicker you get money into something earning a return the better however pay attention to the fees and costs associated with investing   if there is a per transaction fee you may want to consolidate as it may be more efficient to do so after all if you contribute $ 500 at a shot and it costs you $ 5 to make a trade you 're paying 1 off the top to make that trade if you make 11 of them versus 0.1 to make 1 so the question is do you earn that 1 back over the course of the six months   that will depend on what you are investing in    more than likely you 're going to earn more than 1 over the course of the six months so it 's probably worth investing it in pieces still in that situation but if the transaction cost is higher or the time differential lower you may have a less clear cut answer   i invest at vanguard in their funds and have no transaction fees so i have a more obvious answer invest as soon as possible you also need to consider whether you have minimums to pay attention to maybe your investment is something you can only buy whole shares of for example or you might have a much higher fee if you make small transactions   in that case you should wait until you have the minimum to make that transaction if the fee is more than the return you 'll get so the answer is make the transactions as early as you can subject to considering the fees you will pay for making them

just pick a good bond and invest all your money there since they 're fairly low risk no that is basically throwing away your money and why would you do that and who told you they are low risk that is a very wrong premise what factors should i consider in picking a bond and how would they weigh against each other quite a number of them to say assuming these are n't government uk etc how safe is the institution issuing the bond their income business they are in their past performance business wise and the bonds issued by them if any check for the bond ratings issued by the rating agencies read the prospectus and check for any specific conditions i.e. bonds are callable bonds can be retired under certain conditions what happens if they default and what order will you be debt take priority where are interest rates heading which will decide the price you are paying for the bond and also the yield you will derive from the bond how do you intend to invest the income coupon you will derive from the bonds what is your time horizon to invest in bonds and similarly the bond 's life i have invested in stocks previously but realized that it is n't for me bonds are much more difficult than equities stick to government bonds if you can but they do n't generate much income considering the low interest rates environment now that qe is over you might expect interest rates to rise but you can only wait or go for bonds from stable companies i.e. ge walmart and no i am not saying you buy their bonds in any imaginable way

the mechanism of supply and demand is imperfect   producers do n't know exactly how many purchasers consumers for a good there are   some goods by their nature are in short supply and some are plentiful the process of price discovery is one where in a nominally free market producers and purchasers make offers and counter offers to assess what the price should be   as they do this the historical price changes usually floating around some long term average   as it goes up we experience inflation   as it goes down deflation however there is n't a fixed supply of producers and purchasers so as new ones arrive and old ones leave this too has an impact on supply and prices money either in electronic or physical form needs to be available to reflect the transactions and the economy most central banks at least in more established economies aim for inflation of 2 4 by controlling the availability of money and the cost of borrowing new money   there are numerous ways they can do this printing issuing bonds etc the reason one wants some degree of inflation is because employees will never accept a pay cut even when one would significantly improve the overall economy   companies often decrease their prices in order to match lower demand but employees do n't usually accept decreased wages for decreased labour demand a nominal degree of overall money inflation therefore solves this problem   employees who get a below inflation wage increase are actually getting a wage cut supply and demand must be matched and some inflation is the inevitable consequence of this

the answer to your question is no your credit rating is the way creditors let each other know whether you are in a good position and have a strong tendency to repay your debts not whether you are an easy target for making money on interest and penalties associated with failing to repay debts in full   the fact that you make your payments on time will definitely not lower your credit rating while the banks are not making as much money on you as they would if you carried a balance they are also not spending a lot of money on you nor losing a lot of money on people like you failing to repay debts   the transactions charged to the retailers cover the costs of operating your card and then a little bit   that is enough to make you worth keeping as a customer   they are happy with your arrangement the formula for credit rating computation is proprietary but we know what the factors are overall   making payments on time consistently is a positive not a negative factor   however they do look at the number of cards and overall mix of cards and other types of debt   for example if you have a very large amount of credit capacity in your cards and no mortgage that could possibly be a negative   if you have opened some of those accounts recently it could be a negative   if you have a larger number credit cards than they think is good that could be a negative there are other things as well that could be bringing your score down   probably worth it to take a look if you want to get an idea of what factors are adding positively and negatively to your credit score i 'd encourage you to visit creditkarma.com or another source intended to help you understand and improve your credit rating

cash flow is needed for expansion either to increase manufacturing capacity or to expand the workforce other times companies use it to purchase other companies microsoft and google have both used their cash or stocks to purchase companies examples by google include youtube google earth and now part of motorola to expand into phones if you are investing for the future you do n't want a lot of dividends they do bring tax issues that is not a big problem if you are investing in an ira or 401k. it is an issue if the non tax mutual fund distributes those dividends via the 1099 forcing you to address it on your taxes each year some investors do like dividends but they are looking for their investments to generate cash who would require it would it be an sec requirement even more government paperwork for companies

gt will get hit with a 10 penalty plus income tax   can i confirm this with you   i am aware of 20 withholding but the 10 penalty in my memory was only with regards to in service withdrawals or things like an unpaid loan being deemed a distribution   if an employee terminated from the company there was no 10 penalty on withdrawal   i 've kept up a little bit but it 's been 15 years since i was administering pensions day to day

gt not only that but corporate subsidies and military spending far outweigh medicine expenditures   factually not true   medicare medicaid spending alone is greater than spending on defense   the country is going broke on medicare medicaid not military spending no matter how wasteful   why are the major hospital networks in the us swimming in cash and seeing record profit levels post obamacare passage   duh excessive government spending without regard for risk or value price is a boon to the industry just like free money was a boon to the housing market in 2004 2007

as a woman who was once married to someone who worked offshore in the north sea in the gulf of mexico off the coast of in fact all over the world and my husband 's rig was contracted through exxon by the way exxon contracts rigs but does n't own any this is most certainly a scam   even if you do not believe all the above information i will tell you this   offshore oil companies will either have schedules consisting of two weeks on two weeks off or one month on one month off   if he is in the gulf of mexico it is almost certainly two weeks on two off   which means this person who is your friend is lying to you because contract or not no employer holds any employee on the rig for an entire year   in addition he can leave the rig anytime he wants to due to a personal emergency   and no once a paycheck is deposited in an employee 's account they can not take it back   lol i would like to see them try   do n't do this   it will only cause you   and since all of the posters recommending that you not fall for this pos line of bull have nothing to gain guess who is telling the truth   it 's not your friend

how does one buy this quantity of tips do you simply buy directly from the us treasury you will might have to go through a financial institution like a broker or a bank edit you can also buy bonds directly with treasurydirect is it cheaper to buy a fund that invests in tips it might be cheaper depending on the fund   itself but you ca n't know for sure the price that the fund will be worth at you payout date since bonds can go up in value and are likely to with rates this low is there a way to measure potential downside statistically speaking yes you can look at the variation in price interest of the bonds in the last years to see how they usually move then compute the price range where they are likely to be that can be wide for volatile securities but there is no guarantee that there wo n't be some black swan event that will make the price shoot up down in another word it 's speculation can i mitigate downside risk by choosing different tips maturity there are quantitative strategies to do that like finding that some products that are negatively correlated such that a loss in one is be hedged by a gain in another however those correlation are likely to be just statistics and for every product that you buy you are likely to have to pay some fees for your bank broker which can be more devastating than the inflation itself is there some other strategy i should be considering to protect my cash against inflation or maybe a mixed strategy as i wrote above trying to use complex financial products can incurs loss and will have fees both for buying and selling is it really necessary to hedge from a 2 inflation by taking such risk personally i do n't think so if i were you i would just be buying bonds maturing for your payout date that would negate the reselling risk and reduce the fees

there is no distribution limit only a contribution limit   you can empty your hsa completely without tax or penalty as long as the expenses are used for eligible medical expenses in addition you can reimburse yourself in the future for expenses that you have now as long as you have an hsa account in place   for example you said that your dental bill was $ 3500 and you only had $ 3300 in your hsa so you emptied your hsa and paid the rest from your checking account   when you do get more money in the hsa even if it is n't until next year you can reimburse yourself for the $ 200 that you had to pay out of pocket on your dental bill   and if you do n't have enough money in your hsa this year to cover all of your birth expenses congrats by the way you can reimburse yourself in a future year just make sure you keep good records on what the distributions were used for in case you get audited

scenario 1 is typically the better description if commercial banks were allowed to simply create money they would n't be in the mess they 're in now in the u.s. the central bank is the federal reserve or fed and is the only entity not the government not the banks not the people that is allowed to create money out of thin air it does this primarily by buying government debt the government spends more than it takes in and so to come up with the deficit it issues bonds the fed buys a certain amount of these bonds and simply prints the money or more realistically authorized the electronic transfer of $ x to the treasury which the government then spends that places money in the hands of corporations and the people who turn around and spend it however long term the interest charges on money borrowed from the fed will actually remove money from the economy the central banks therefore have to constantly make marginal changes to various monetary policy tools they have when the economy is just along if they do nothing then too much of a short term increase in money supply will result in there being too much money which makes an individual monetary unit worth less inflation while making money too hard to get will reduce the rate at which it 's spent reducing gdp and causing recessions the exact scenario you describe is typically seen in cases where the government is running with a balanced budget and the central bank thus ca n't give its new money to the government to spend when it wants to increase the money supply in that situation the central bank instead lowers its lending rate the percentage interest that it will charge on loans made to other banks thereby encouraging those banks to borrow more of the money created by the central bank those banks will then use the money to make loans invest in the market etc etc which puts the money in the economy   in the u.s. the fed does have this tool as well but increases or decreases in the federal funds rate are typically used to influence the rate that banks charge each other to borrow money thus encouraging or discouraging this lending a lowering in the interest rate makes banks more likely to borrow from each other and from the fed but the amount of money created this way is a drop in the bucket compared to current quantitative easing and thus increases the turnover of the existing money in the economy how many times a theoretical individual dollar is spent in a given time period

i would say it 's a bit more complicated than that do you understand what a market maker does   an ecn electronic communication network is a virtual exchange that works with market makers using a rebate structure that works by paying for orders adding liquidity and charges a fee for removing liquidity so liquidity is created by encouraging what are essentially limit orders orders that are outside of the current market price and therefore not immediately these orders stay in the book and are filled when the price of the security moves and triggers them   so direct answer is nyse arca is where market makers do their jobs these market makers can be floor traders or algorithmic when you send an order through your brokerage your broker has a number of options your order can be sent directly to an ecn exchange like nyse arca sent to a market making firm like americas formerly knight capital or is when the broker uses an in house service to execute your trade brokerages must disclose what they do with orders for example etrade 's this is a good graphic showing what happens in general along with the names of some common liquidity providers

what about the balance in my checking account in    are the that i held for months or years before eventually    deciding to change to dollars considered an investment do n't know you tell us investment defined as an activity taken to produce income did you put the money in the checking account with a full expectation of profits to be made from that or you only decided that it is an investment in retrospective after the result is known because it provides you more tax benefit to me it sounds like you have two operating currencies and you 're converting between them does n't sound like an investment generally from my experience bank accounts are not considered investments even savings accounts are n't once you deposit into a cd or bond or money market you get a cash equivalent which can be treated as an investment but that 's my personal understanding if there are large amounts involved i 'd suggest talking to a us licensed cpa ea specializing on expats in your area pub 54 is really a reference for only the most trivial of the questions an expat may have it does n't even begin to describe the complexity of the that is called the us tax code for expats and foreigners

salaries normally should n't fluctuate with inflation and deflation inflation prevents consumers from spending prices get too high ultimately taking money out of circulation this causes the market to go in to deflation or at least deflate back to normal that 's when people begin to spend again and start the cycle all over again now imagine if salaries increased with inflation inflation would never end everyone could keep affording the high prices a starbucks coffee would eventually cost $ 150 but the middle class would all be millionaires your small change would consist of a wad of useless bills and the government would have to continually print out more money just to keep up note this is not a direct answer to where goes delta but would more be directed to the part prices go up and salary does n't
