for those who do n't know credit card checks are blank checks that your credit card company sends you   when you fill them out and spend them you are taking a cash advance on your credit card account   you should be aware that taking a cash advance on your credit card normally has extra fees and finance charges above what you have with regular credit card transactions that having been said when you take one of these to your bank and try to deposit them it is entirely up to bank policy how long they will make you wait to use these funds   they want to be sure that it is a legitimate check and that it will be honored   if your teller does n't know the answer to that question you 'll need to find someone at the bank who does   if you do n't like the answer they give you you 'll need to find another bank i would think that if the credit card is from chase and you are trying to deposit a credit card check into a chase checking account they should be able to do that instantly   however bank policy does n't always make sense

be sure to consider the difference between roth 401 k and standard 401k. the roth 401 k is taxed as income then put into your account so the money you put into the roth 401 k is taxed as income for the current year however any interest you accumulate over the years is not taxed when you withdraw the money   so to break it down you may also want to look into self directed 401 k which can be either standard or roth check if your employer supports this type of account but if you 're self employed or 1099 it may be a good option

i am a numbers guy the math is great instead of jane was twice her son 's age when he married and is now 1.5 times his age questions in math class i think the math problems should mostly have dollar pound signs in front of them   in general i like the idea of relating to the kids situations as much as possible when my daughter 14 makes a purchase i 'd ask her to be aware of how many hours she had to work to make the money she plans to spend was it worth 4 hours babysitting to buy an ipad case was it worth 2 to buy lunch that we could have made you at home   note the convert price to hours worked is a concept that works great when teaching budgeting to anyone not just kids   the math of tax and discounts for comparison shopping works great as well so long as they understand value a $ 400 at 50 off is n't really a bargain in my opinion    next the math of balancing a checkbook should be high on the list accounting for the checks that did n't clear but are outstanding is beyond many people amazing enough   for the sport fan there are unlimited math problem one can create for game scores stats for the season etc young boys who will fall asleep during a stats class will pay attention if instead of abstract numbers you add goals home runs etc after the numbers   note this question is probably outside the scope of the board no right or wrong answer but i love it as a question in general and if not here i hope it finds a good home

your heart is in the right place especially since they 've got a kid if you really want to help them have the uncomfortable conversation with them that they need to have about money specifically how to develop and stick to a budget it is a painful but valuable lesson for life   depending on what type of relationship you have with them you can approach it in different ways just giving them friendly advice is perhaps the touch you could have but might not make the impression you need   if they are asking you for money i would personally make it a condition that they work through their personal budget with you and then start living within that budget if you 're lending money it 's not too much to ask to follow their accounts or finances so that you can see that they 're on the right track if you 're a close enough friend you could really walk them through it and help them to develop the habits of estimating how much they will earn in a month estimating how much they should spend in a month   tracking how much they are actually spending and   comparing how much they actually earn with how much they actually spend   doing this every month until they get out of the weeds they should at least do it every 3 months when they 're in good financial shape but even then each month does n't hurt setting them up with something like mint.com if they 're in the us would be a handy place to start you can share the login information with them if they trust you and then they can change it once whatever agreed upon terms come around   it sounds weird i know but i have helped two friends out of credit card debt this way the hardest part is getting around the discomfort taboo shame of them knowing they need help and not wanting to accept it

and then there is the issue of people who actually do n't intend to reduce the size of their loan they only want to pay the interest so their debt with the bank remains constant if you are upside down it means you will not have the financial means to remove the debt if for some reason you are no longer able to pay the bank you might lose the house after that you will have no house but you still have a debt with the bank

so my advice for your financial situation depends on your aims are you aiming to    completely clear your debt    clear one card to free up more monthly income      clear some debt to allow further controlled spending    clear one card and focus on just using one having 2nd as emergency there are other things you may wish to do but you said to pay off some all of 2 credit card bills if you want to contact me i can plan this more precisely some seem the same but other factors can come into play as well differing rates of interest make the options clearer my first advice would be to call the card companies and see if you can get better rates first scenario some figures made up for visual credit card debts     8,000        8,000 monthly payment        100            100 apr 10              10 ignoring apr this will be 80 months to repay otherwise 140 months using my example amounts above £ 28,000 repaid over 11 years 8 months   your suggestion as per your suggestion originally paying off cards equally will allow smaller debt on both cards credit card debt       3,000       3,000 monthly payment        100           100 apr 10             10 with a 0 apr this would be paid off in 2 years 6 months cards are available to get free balance transfers need to look into this with the 10 apr this would take 3 years 1 month £ 10,000 lump and £ repaid over 3 years 1 month saving £ and 8 years 7 months aim to clear debt completely my advice here is to use the £ 10,000 lump sum to pay off one credit card the remaining £ 2,000 can then come off the other card this will free up your outgoings was 2 x £ 100 by £ 100 but then use this £ 100 to pay off the card this will result in the following credit card debt       6,000 monthly payment        200 apr 10 with a 0 apr this would be paid off in 2 years 6 months cards are available to get free balance transfers need to look into this with 10 apr this would take roughly 3 years 1 month £ 10,000 lump and £ repaid over 3 years 1 month saving £ and 8 years 7 months    this option is the same as above but you have the options on the odd tight month to reduce payments to £ 100    this also will allow the 2nd card to be used interest free for an emergency purchase to be paid off without any interest charge    if rates are different pay of the one with the higher apr aim clear one card to free up more monthly income   aim clear one card and focus on just using one having 2nd as emergency same as above but do n’t increase to £ 200 leave monthly payment at £ 100 credit card debt       6,000 monthly payment        100 apr 10 with a 0 apr this would be paid off in 5 years with the 10 apr this would take 88 months 7 years 4 months £ 10,000 lump and £ repaid over 7 years and 4 months saving £ and 4 years 4 months    this also allows for some extra spending even racking back up the debt although not advised aim clear some debt to allow further controlled spending as above apart from this will allow you to spend to get back up to full £ 16,000 debt note my figures are theoretical paying off £ 500 £ a month instead of the £ 100 would take lump sum 10,000 remaining 6,000 14 months £ 17,000 paid lump sum 5,000 remaining 2 x 5,500 26 months £ 18,000 paid lump sum 0 remaining 2 x 8,000 40 months £ 20,000 paid now i have finished i hope you have an idea on what you are aiming to achieve and a better idea of what to do when you receive the income stephen

while this is a totally personal decision i still think it would be a good idea to have some life insurance simply because you have someone that is currently dependent on your income   yes you have about 22 years in retirement but if you consider taxes and market risk there 's still some uncertainty there    also while your wife may be willing and able to work now will she want to do that for years just to earn living expenses    i would look at the costs on 10-year term life insurance and see if it 's worth the extra peace of mind to you and your wife   if your wife is fine with using your retirement as life insurance then you can probably be ok without it so to answer the question it may be acceptable but it 's generally a very cheap way to get a lot of peace i would not worry too much about the opinions of your parents unless they are going to pay for the insurance it 's your decision

ror for options you bought is fairly easy current value initial cost gives you the actual return if you want the rate of return you need to annualize that number you divide the return you got above by the number of days the investment was in place and then multiply that number by the number of days in a year 365 if you 're using calendar days about 255 if you 're using trading days ror for options you sold is much more complex the problem is that ror is basically calculating the size of your return relative to the capital it tied up to earn it    that 's simple when you bought something the capital tied up is the money you put up    it 's more complex on a position like a short option where the specific transaction in question generates cash when it 's put on     the correct way to deal with this is to a bundle your strategy options stock and collateral into one ror where appropriate and b include any needed collateral to support the short option in the calculation so if you sell a cash secured put where you have to post the money that you 'd need to take delivery of the shares if they were put to you the initial cost is the total amount you 'd need to put the trade on    in this case it 's the cash amount less the premium you collected for selling the put   that 's just one example     but the approach holds more broadly   if you 're using covered calls your original cost is the cost of the stock less the premium generated by the sale of the call

i think you 've got basics but you may have the order emphasis a bit wrong i 've changed the order of the things you 've learned in to what i think is the most important to understand owning a stock is like owning a tiny chunk of the business owning stock is owning a tiny chunk of the business it 's not just like it the tiny chunks are called shares because that is literally what they are a share of the business sometimes shares are also called stocks the words stock and share are mostly interchangeable but a single stock normally means your holding of many shares in a business so if you have 100 shares in 1 company that 's a stock in that company if you then buy 100 shares in another company you now own 2 stocks an investor seeks to buy stocks at a low price and sell when the price is high not necessarily an investor will buy shares in a company that they believe will make them a profit in general a company will make a profit and distribute some or all of it to shareholders in the form of dividends they will also keep back a portion of the profit to invest in growing the company if the company does grow it will grow in value and your shares will get more valuable price of a stock is affected by supply demand volume and possibly company profits the price of a share that you see on a stock ticker is the price that people on the market have exchanged the share for recently not the price you or i can buy a share for although usually if people on the market are buying and selling at that price someone will buy or sell from you at a similar sort of price in theory the price will be the companies total value if you were to own the whole thing it 's market capitalisation divided by the total number of shares that exist in that company the problem is that it 's very difficult to work out the total value of a company you can start by counting the different things that it owns including things like intellectual property and the knowledge and experience of people who work there subtract all the money it owes in loans etc and then make an allowance for how much profit you expect the company to make in the future the problem is that these numbers are all going to be estimates and different peoples estimates will disagree some people do n't bother to estimate at all the market makers will just follow supply and demand they will hold a few shares in each of many companies that they are interested in they will advertise a lower price that they are willing to buy at and a higher price that they will sell at all the time when they hold a lot of a share they will price it lower so that people buy it from them when they start to run out they will price it higher you will never need to spend more than the market makers price to buy a share or get less than the market makers price when you come to sell it unless you want to buy or sell more shares than they are willing to this is why stock price depends on supply and demand the other category of people who do n't care about the companies they are trading are the high speed traders they just look at information like the past price the volume total amount of shares being exchanged on the market and many other statistics both from the market and elsewhere and look for patterns you can not compete with these people they do things like physically locate their servers nearer to the stock exchanges buildings to get a few milliseconds time advantage over their competitors to buy shares quicker than them

i agree with mhoran_psprep 's answer but would like to add a few additional points to consider    turbotax and the professional it will send to represent you in case of a tax audit   have no more information about your tax return than what you entered into the program   now there are three or four different kinds of audits    the correspondence audit is the most common kind where irs sends a letter requesting copies of documents supporting a deduction or tax credit that you have claimed representation is hardly necessary in this case    the office audit is more serious where you have to make an appointment and go to the local irs office with paperwork that the examining agent needs to see physically and to answer questions etc   it would be better to be accompanied by a representative at these meetings but office audits are not as common as correspondence audits and because they are expensive for the irs usually occur when the irs is fairly sure of recovering a substantial sum of money   if you have been cutting corners and pushing the envelope in taking large enough deductions to make it worthwhile for the irs to go after you you probably should not have been using turbotax to file your income tax return   but should have been using an accountant or tax preparer who would be   representing you in case of an audit if the reason that you used turbotax   is that no accountant was willing to prepare a tax return with the deductions   that you wished to claim i doubt that having turbotax 's representative with you when you go to the irs office will help you all that much an example of a field audit is when the irs agent comes to your home to see if you actually have a space set aside to use exclusively as your home office as you claimed you did etc a taxpayer compliance measurement program audit is where the   irs randomly chooses returns for statistical checks that taxpayers are complying with the regulations the taxpayer has to prove every line of the return you claim to be filing as married filing jointly bring in your marriage certificate   submit birth certificates and social security cards of your dependent children and so on   yes having turbotax represent you for only $ will help but not if you are not married and can not provide the irs with a marriage certificate etc so pay the fee for peace of mind if you like and as insurance as littleadv suggests   but be sure you understand what you might be getting for the   money   most tax returns selected for audit are selected for what the irs believes are good reasons not at random   if what you said if my tax return is randomly selected for audit they will represent me   is interpreted literally turbotax will represent you only if your return is selected for examination under the program not if it is selected for audit because the irs believes that something is fishy about your return   and as always you get what you pay for

i do n't really like to refer to being an expert cause it is all relative really   i know excel better than anyone in my office but i do n't consider myself an expert because my skills do n't touch many of the people on excel related forums   anyway the initiative you are showing wanting to learn this on your own is great    so if you told me that you were in expert in excel but it is clear you know less than me i 'd peg you as someone with bias   what i would want to see is that you are familiar with functions common with finance related excel work that you understand under which situations certain functions are more efficient for completing a task   like math there are many ways to solve a problem but some are more efficient than others in excel the most efficient is not always the most elegant we are talking about using the least amount of processing power and memory   that if you do n't know how to do something in excel you 'll be able to figure it out without help   there are so many resources on the web and you should know how to be able to look at other examples and apply it to your situation   you should be familiar with vba not just using the macro recorder   know what situations when it is better to use vba than excel functions in most situations you want to avoid vba because 1 it makes it difficult for other users to follow your spreadsheet and 2 excel functions are much more optimized and generally perform tasks much faster   know how to build spreadsheets that are easy for others to follow you work write comments etc   nothing is worse than trying to figure out a cluster fuck of a spreadsheet   i would not expect you to be an expert in vba and to be able to write something in depth from scratch but rather be able to figure it out using outside resources   since i am not writing in vba on daily basis i forget shit all the time but if there is something that needs to be done i can guarantee you i will figure out how   knowledge of how to integrate excel with a database via vba is good for both pulling in data and updating a database   tl;dr   1 do n't your excel knowledge but do n't make yourself out to be an excel god you never know how much knowledge the other person has 2 demonstrate that you have experience with commonly used excel related functions efficient construction of 3 demonstrate that if you do n't know how to do something in excel you will be able to figure it out provide an example 4 knowledge of vba is good especially integrating with outside databases   provide example of a time you used vba and why you did   best way to learn this stuff is through experience if you want me to critique your excel work i would happy to   the following project would give you good experience   download data for 20 countries just choose at random make sure you include u.s. though on gdp in us dollar current prices and ppp basis for all years   from imf   1 build a dash board that calculates the year over year growth of both gdp $ and gdp ppp 2 set it so you can dynamically select which country to display 3 set it up so you dynamically change start and end date 3 the chart should automatically adjust its range based on the date selected 4 create three aggregates developing countries developed countries and world ex us 5 with these aggregates have an option to show the y y growth using either the average mean or on a gdp weighted basis    this is just an idea that would give you some good experience   it is not anything i need so only do it if you want to build your skills

with all due respect to economics everywhere and the armchair economist i think they overlook one very basic fact the alternative to buying popcorn   at the cinema is buying it cheaper at the store or making your own and bringing it to the cinema is something you tend to do with a date and sometimes your friends and who wants to look cheap to their date and perhaps their spouse friends bringing popcorn to the cinema   this effect together with convenience is probably the reason why popcorn can remain so expensive at cinemas

index funds etfs if they are tracking the same index will be the same in an ideal world the difference would be because of the following factors expense ratio i.e. the expense the funds charge this varies and hence it would lead to a difference in performance tracking error this means that there is a small percentage of error between the actual index composition and the fund composition this is due to various reasons   effectively this would result in the difference between values demand supply with etfs the fund is traded on stock exchanges like a stock if the general feeling is that the index is rising it could lead to an increase in the price of the etf index funds on the other hand would remain the same for the day and are less liquid this results in a price increase decrease depending on the market the above explains the reason for the difference    regarding which one to buy one would need to consider other factors like a how easy is it to buy etfs do you already hold demat a c access to brokers to help you conduct the transaction or do you need to open an additional account at some cost b normally funds do not need any account but are you ok with less liquidity as it would take more time to redeem funds

it 's an artifact of risk neutral pricing but the intuition is this   a call option can be viewed as a levered equity position meaning you can get the same exposure by borrowing money and buying the stock     say you can buy some call options for $ 150 with a position delta of 1 so it looks just like the stock   you could also buy the stock outright for $ 1000 by borrowing $ 850 at the risk free rate and using your $ 150 cash   if the risk free rate rises your cost of carry on the stock position increases   in the case of the call option the change in price can be viewed as the cost of leverage increasing

also bear in mind you need to pay a deposit which is around the same price as a monthly payment they will also need to do a credit history check on you and since you are a foreigner you wo n't have any there are some renters who care less but mostly serious renters will require it some can require an employment confirmation or even a bank account details it is very complicated and difficult for a foreigner   as in comments mentioned a contract is minimum 1 year the deposit is returned when you leave and the place is left in good condition i would not expect the full amount returned as many renters require a professional cleaning or some even the walls you can do it yourself and give them a receipt but you end up paying for it   what i would suggest is some type of a sharing house where people share rooms in one house but that option has negatives another option is where you even share a room it all depends on where you want to live it is very different if you are in a big city like new york or somewhere in suburbs the prices also vary it 's good to have friends in the usa that can help you especially if you are n't planning on staying too long

gt;there is no fact that shows taxing the rich is good or bad   sure there is   what is the outcome you are trying to achieve   what are the consequences of your solution i.e. how does your solution turn into a problem   if you are using concepts like fair as guiding design principles for a system we are still able to articulate our of fairness when presented with specific facts   is there going to be clear consensus   no   i agree with you in that sense it is opinion   when you dig down and move beyond magic words like fair and get at the reasoning why a thing is fair or not that is how you build common truth and consensus   that 's how you have a meaningful discussion beyond yeah huh and nah uh     bringing facts allows you to ground out your argument and explore how principles are actually being applied decisions historically and connect choices with how they fit in our larger system   are there definitive answers   you are again right there are not but ambiguity tolerance is a sign of intelligence not a failing   gt;and my point is n't that republicans are bad but that they are covering their harmful economic policies with helpful ones the obvious implication is n't that they are bad people but that we should be critical of their bad policies and applaud their good ones   let me just concede that you are policy focused   it is fairy also to say that stimulus causes the general public not to feel the effects of tax cuts until years later and so there is less resistance to them   that can be true however while still seeing their choices made in relation to those made by democrats     further when you explain the situation you can just as easily switch which side labeled harmful and helpful    are solutions to social problems which entail tax burdens placed consistently on one portion of the population again and again the harm   is it the tax cut which now an existing outlay   or is it an unhealthy relationship where one group expands and the other tries to reign in which leads to systemic instability   moving away from language like harmful helpful good bad fair unfair challenges us to articulate the history the desired outcome and move away from us vs. them thinking   you do n't get an ideal correct solution with that approach but you do get closer to practical good enough ones that way

couple of my friends went through a fraud agent who ran off with their money and the landlords were none the wiser so it always pays to be a bit diligent are they a well known letting agents nationally   many agents do have different accounts to manage their properties yours seems a case as such probably i.e. they manage the property on behalf of the landlord so keeping their monies differentiated did you sign an agreement if yes go through what is written in the agreement most of it is same in all agreements but have a look anyway check if there is mention of deposit protection scheme one thing you could do is go to a bank to do the transfer the same bank where the letting agent holds their account and confirm from them if it is really a personal account or a business account i am not sure how possible it is but does n't hurt to ask if it is a personal account then fraud is the most possible cause the sort code should tell you which branch and which bank or the best option is to ask the estate agents to show a recent statement of the bank account where the money is to be deposited into some tips

dividends telegraph that management has a longer term focus than just the end of quarter share price   there is a to at least maintain if not periodically increase the dividend payout year over year   management understands that cutting or dividends will cause dividend investors in market to dump shares driving down the stock price    dividends can have preferential tax treatment in some jurisdictions either for an individual compared to capital gains or compared to the corporation paying taxes themselves   for example reits real estate investment trusts are a type of corporation that in order to not pay corporate income tax are required to pay out 95 of income as dividends each year   these are not the only type mlp master limited partnerships and other partnership structures will always have high dividend rates by design dividends provide cash flow and trade market volatility for actual cash   not every investor needs cash flow but for certain investors it reduces the risks of a liquidity crisis such as in retirement   the alternative for an investor who seeks to use the sale of shares would be to maintain a sufficient cash reserve for typical market recessions

make sure you shop around and ask a lot of places for a good faith estimate   last i knew the good faith document is the same everywhere and long form that makes it easy enough to compare the hard numbers from place to place   i have gotten several estimates for various scenarios and i have had them hand written and printed   i discounted the hand written ones because that broker seemed pretty disorganized in general learn the terms online and start comparing   use the good as a negotiation tool to get lower rates or lower costs from other brokers   see how accurate the person is at listening to you and filling out the paperwork   see how responsive they are to you when you call with questions and want some changes check with at least four places the more places you shop the better idea you will have of what fees are high and what interest rates are low   i might pay a higher fee to get a lower interest rate so there are lots of trade offs to consider

agriculture is a great sector to get into right now   the average farmer in us and canada are at or near retirement age well past 60 and because most farmers are old the sector really has n't changed much they 're proud to say that what they do is passed down for generations   the sector is ready for new blood and ripe for a revolution to increase productivity all that is missing is the capital needed

to understand the twist you need to understand what the yield curve is   you must also understand that the price of debt is inverse to the interest rate so when the price of bonds or notes or bills rises that means the current price goes up and the yield to maturity has gone down   currently early 2012 the short term rate is low close to zero the tools the fed uses setting short term rates for one is exhausted as their current target is basically zero for this debt but my mortgage is based on 10yr rates not 1 yr or 30 day money the next step in the fed 's effort is to try to pull longer term rates down by buying back 10 year notes in this quantity the fed impacts the yield at that point on the curve buying remember supply demand pushes the price up and for debt a higher price equates to lower yield to raise the money to do this they will sell short term debt these two transactions effectively try to twist the curve to pull long term rates lower and push the economy

your argument is biased vastly in favor of the banks   does n't the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial real estate pricing bubbles undermines the case made by yourself that fannie and freddie were at the root of the problem   why does your explanation also leave out predatory lending or that during 2006 22 of homes purchased 1.65 million units were for investment purposes with an additional 14 1.07 million units purchased as vacation homes during 2005 these figures were 28 and 12 respectively in other words a record level of nearly 40 of homes purchased were not intended as primary residences    or that housing prices nearly doubled between 2000 and 2006 a vastly different trend from the historical appreciation at roughly the rate of inflation   or that the proportion of subprime arm loans made to people with credit scores high enough to qualify for conventional mortgages with better terms increased from 41 in 2000 to 61 by 2006    from wikipedia so why did lending standards decline in a award winning program npr argued that a giant pool of money represented by $ 70 trillion in worldwide fixed income investments sought higher yields than those offered by u.s. treasury bonds early in the decade further this pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007 yet the supply of relatively safe income generating investments had not grown as fast investment banks on wall street answered this demand with financial innovation such as the mortgage backed security mbs and collateralized debt obligation cdo which were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies in effect wall street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the u.s. with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage supply chain from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small banks that funded the brokers to the giant investment banks behind them by approximately 2003 the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted however continued strong demand for mbs and cdo began to drive down lending standards as long as mortgages could still be sold along the supply chain eventually this speculative bubble proved unsustainable

your chart and your claim do n't match you 're looking at one marginal tax rate and saying that its historical change does n't impact overall federal revenues this is true on the surface but you 're only looking at one aspect of the overall picture   saying that federal revenue does n't correlate with tax rates is disingenuous an across the board cut or an across the board increase will both have significant effect likewise an increase to the top marginal tax rate by itself would have an impact as long as there were no corresponding cuts or increased expenditures to wipe out the impact   a budget is a budget whether it 's a great big one like the federal government 's or a small one like a household budget   revenues and expenses need to match in order for the budget to balance increasing tax rates increases revenue from everyone within the affected tax bracket it makes an impact

if you are just barely scraping by on your current income then you should n't be thinking about buying a car or house unless you can present at least to yourself clear evidence that doing so will actually lower your monthly expenses yes there are times when even buying depreciating assets such as a car can lower your expenses but you need to think hard about whether that is the case or if it is just something you want to get because you feel you should remember the old adage that rich people buy themselves income streams investments that either earn money or reduce expenses while poor people buy expenses if you are in the situation of barely scraping by on your current income then the first step in my mind is to find out exactly what you are spending your money on do this for a month or two and then try to include non regular or rarely bills such as subscriptions insurance perhaps utilities and so on once you know where your money is going right now outline that in a budget at this point you are n't judging your spending but rather simply looking at the facts once you have a decent idea of where your money is going only then try to think about what you can cut back on some things will be easier than others to change it 's much easier to cancel a premium tv channels package than to move to cheaper living quarters for example although in some cases simply picking the low hanging fruit alone wo n't help you make a revised budget for the next month based on the new numbers and try to live by it keep writing down what you actually spend your money on then rinse and repeat of course you can make a budget for whatever period of time works for you if you get paid every two weeks budgeting per two weeks might be easier than budgeting per month the bottom line is that a budget is useless without a follow up process to see how well your spending actually matches the budgeted amounts so you need to spend some time following up on it and making adjustments no budget will ever match reality exactly think of the budget as a map not a by guide for getting from a to b. when you find some wiggle room in your budget for example let 's say you decide to cancel the premium tv channels package you got some time ago because it turns out you are n't watching much tv anyway do n't put that money into a discretionary spending category there is an old rule in personal finance that says pay yourself first if you are able to find $ of wiggle room put it into savings of some kind if you are unsure what kind of savings vehicle you should use i 'd suggest starting off with a simple savings account it certainly wo n't earn you a great return you 'll be lucky if you can keep up with inflation but it will get you into the habit of saving which at this point is a lot more important and make that savings transfer as soon as the money hits your account if you can get the depositor to put a portion of your income directly into the savings account if you can not make the transfer yourself immediately afterwards and try to force yourself to live with the money that 's left not touching the savings account ideally you should save a decent fraction of your income i 've seen figures everywhere from 10 to 25 of your after tax income recommended by various people and start out by budgeting that to savings and then working with whatever is left in practice saving anything and putting the money anywhere is much better than saving nothing just make sure that the savings are liquid easy to convert to cash and withdraw without a penalty should the need arise set up a regular bank transfer for whatever amount you can find in that budget and try to forget about it until you get the bank statement for the savings account and get that warm fuzzy feeling for actually having a decent amount of money set aside should something ever happen making you need it then later you can decide whether to use the money to buy a car start a company take early retirement or something entirely different having the money will give you the options and you can decide what is more important to you yourself just keep on saving

i will use 10 of this 20 k to pay the loan back on an annual basis agreement an annual payment of 0.8 $ 2,000 $ 250,000 is nowhere near large enough   the interest alone is going to be well over $ 10,000 and probably closer to $ 20,000 on an unsecured loan so you need to plan for at least a $ 20,000 $ 30,000 annual payment depending on the terms length and interest rate on the loan    but in general is this sustainable safe   essentially what you are doing is using leverage to increase the amount you can invest   while this is fantastic when the market rises it can go horribly wrong when the market goes down   generally it is unwise to fund a risky meaning there are large swings in return investment with a risk free meaning you 'll always make a payment loan if you want to see what could happen forecast a 20 market drop and see what you are left with obviously you 'll need to make the loan payment out of your balance since you wo n't have any gains to pull from   an average of 10 12 over a long period of time is reasonable but the variance can cause the return to be anywhere from to + 40 in one year   can you afford those losses    here 's an actual example if you were to invest $ 250,000 in the s&p 500 in january 2000 with an 8 interest only loan your next three years returns would be after three years assuming an interest only payment of $ 20,000 your balance would be just over $ 100,000 you 'd still owe $ 250,000 and you 'd still be making $ 20,000 in interest payments   if your loan interest rate was 25 which is not unreasonable for an unsecured loan you 'd be bankrupt after 3 years you 'd still owe $ 250 k but could not make the interest payment no this is not a good idea   the only time you should borrow money to invest in when you have control over the returns   so if you wanted to start your own business had a stable business plan and had much more certainty over the returns the borrowing money might be plausible    but borrowing money to do passive investment is a huge mistake

california bankruptcy law requires disclosure of any gift made by the person declaring bankruptcy in the past 12 months and any asset transfers in the past 2 years with a couple of minor exceptions this would most certainly include the car if it is back to you such a claim would likely be considered fraudulent though this would be a matter for the lawyers and bankruptcy trustee in question there 's a blog which you may wish to check out the california bankruptcy blog which has a specific entry on gifts now there is a specific exemption for automobiles but only up to a total of $ legally i believe there 's nothing you can do here if the $ 10 k was a loan it will be discharged in bankruptcy if it was a gift it 'll have to be declared and the car will have to be sold if or transferred it must be declared and will likely but not definitely be determined as an invalid disposal of assets either you or your family member will have to discuss this with a bankruptcy lawyer i 'm sorry your generous act is likely to get tangled up here

theoretically there is limited demand for risky investments so higher risk asset classes should outperform lower risk asset classes over sufficiently long time periods in practice i believe this is true but it could be several decades before a risky portfolio starts to outperform a more conservative one stocks are considered more risky than most assets small cap stocks and emerging market stocks are particularly high risk i would consider low fee etfs in these areas like vb or if you want to seek out the absolute riskiest investments you could pick individual stocks of companies in dire financial situations as bank of america was a couple years ago most importantly if you do n't expect to need the money soon i would maximize your contribution to tax advantaged accounts since they will grow exponentially faster than taxable accounts over 50 years a 401(k or ira will generally grow at least 50 more than a taxable account maybe more depending on the tax efficiency of your investments try to contribute the maximum $ 17,500 for most people in 2014 if you can if you can save more than that i 'd suggest contributing a roth 401k rather than a traditional 401(k since roth contributions are post tax the effective contribution limit is higher also contribute to a roth ira up to $ 5,500 in 2014 using a backdoor roth if necessary

so if an out of the money option all time value has a price p say $ 3.00 and there are n days the extrinsic value is n't solely determined by time value as your quote suggests it 's also based on volatility and demand here is a quote from distinguishing between extrinsic time value and extrinsic non time value the time value of an option is entirely predictable time value premium declines at an accelerating rate with most time decay occurring in the last one to two months before expiration this occurs on a predictable curve intrinsic value is also predictable and easily followed it is worth one point for every point the option is in the money for example a call with a strike of 30 has three points of intrinsic value when the current value of the underlying stock is $ 33 per share and a 40 put has two points of intrinsic value when the underlying stock is worth $ 38 the third type of premium extrinsic value increases or decreases when the underlying stock changes and when the distance between current value of stock and strike of the option get closer together as a symptom of volatility extrinsic value may be greater for highly volatile underlying stock and lower for less volatile stocks extrinsic value is the only classification of option premium that is unpredictable the you point out probably had a volatility component affecting value this portion is a factor of expectations or uncertainty so an event expected to conclude prior to expiration but of unknown outcome can cause theta to be higher than p n for example a drug company is being sued and the outcome of a trial will determine whether that company pays out millions or not the extrinsic will be higher than p n prior to the outcome of the trial then drops after   of course the most common situation where this happens is earnings after the announcement it 's not unusual to see a dramatic drop in the extrinsic portion of options this is why sometimes a new option trader gets angry when buying calls prior to earnings when surprise good earnings are announced as hoped the rise is stock price is largely offset by a fall in extrinsic value giving call holders little or no gain as for the reverse situation where theta is lower than p n would expect well you can actually have negative theta meaning the extrinsic portion rises over time this statement is a little confusing because theta is usually described as negative but since you describe it as a positive number negative here means the opposite of what you 'd expect   this is a quote from option volatility pricing keep in mind that they use positive theta to mean the time value increases up over time is it ever possible for an option to have a positive theta such that if nothing changes the option will be worth more tomorrow than it is today when futures options are subject to stock type settlement as they currently are in the united states the carrying cost on a deeply in the money option either a call or a put can under some circumstances be greater than the volatility component if this happens and the option is european no early exercise permitted it will have a theoretical value less than parity less than intrinsic value as expiration approaches the value of the option will slowly rise to parity hence the option will have a positive theta sheldon option volatility pricing advanced trading strategies and techniques kindle locations kindle edition

bonds are valued based on all of this using the concept of the time value of money simply stated money now is worth more than money later because of what you can do with money between now and later case in point let 's say the par value of a bond is $ 100 and will mature 10 years from this date these are common terms for most bonds though the u.s. treasury has a variety of bonds with varying par values and maturation periods with a 0 coupon rate nothing 's paid out prior to maturity if the company or government issuing the bonds needs one million dollars and the people buying the bonds are expecting a 5 rate of return on their investment then each bond would only sell for about $ 62 and the bond issuer would have to sell a par value of $ million in bonds to get its $ 1 m now these numbers are based on equations that calculate the future value of an investment made now and conversely the present value of a future return back to that time value of money concept money now that you 're paying to buy the bond is worth more than money later that you 'll get back at maturity so you will expect to be returned more than you invested to account for this time difference the percentage of rate of return is known as the yield or the discount rate depending on what you 're calculating what else you take into consideration when defining the rate like inflation and whom you talk to now that $ m in par value may be hard for the bond issuer to swallow the issuer is effectively paying interest on interest over the lifetime of the bond instead many issuers choose to issue coupon bonds which have a coupon rate determining the amount of a coupon payment this can be equated pretty closely with you making interest only payments on a credit card balance each period in which interest is compounded you pay the amount of interest that has accrued to avoid this compounding effect   from an accounting standpoint the coupon rate lowers the amount of real monies paid the same $ 1 m in bonds maturing in 10 years with a 5 expected rate of return but with a 5 coupon rate now only requires payments totalling $ 1.5 m and that half million in interest is paid $ 50k at a time annually or $ 25k semi annually but from a finance standpoint because the payments made in the first few years are worth more than the payments made closer to and at maturity the present value of all these coupon payments plus the maturity payout is higher than if the full payout happened at maturity and so the future value of the total investment is higher   coupon rates on bonds thus allow a bond issuer to plan a bond package in less complicated terms if you as a small business need $ 1 m for a project which you will repay in 10 years and during that time you are willing to tolerate a 5 interest rate on the outstanding money then that 's exactly how you issue the bonds $ 1 million worth to mature in 10 years and a 5 coupon rate now whether the market is willing to accept that rate is up to the market right now they 'd be over the moon with that rate and would be willing to buy the bonds for more than their face value because the present value would then match the yield they 're willing to accept as in any market system you as the seller will sell to the highest bidder to get the best price available if however they think you are a bad bet they 'll want an even higher rate of return and so the present value of all coupon and maturity payments will be less than the par value and so will the purchase price

you 're confusing so many things at once here first thing first we can not suggest you what to do business wise since we have no idea about your business how on earth can anyone know if you should sell the software to someone or try to distribute to customers yourself how would we know if you should hire employees or not if you say you do n't need employees why would you consider hiring them if you say you want to sell several copies and have your own customers why would you ask if you should sell your code to someone else does n't make sense now to some more specific issues i heard sole proprietary companies does n't earn more than 250k and    it 's better to switch to corporation or llc etc because of benefits i heard it was today in honolulu so you heard things it does n't make them true or relevant to you there 's no earning limit above which you should incorporate you can be sole proprietor and make millions and you can incorporate for a $ 10k year revenue business sole proprietorship incorporation can be c corp or s corp or llc these are four different types of legal entity to conduct business each has its own set of benefits and drawbacks and you must understand which one suits you in your particular situation for that you should talk to a lawyer who could help you understand what liability protection you might need and to a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state who can help you understand the tax related costs and benefits of each choice on the other hand i heard that if i create llc company in case of    failure they can get everything from me what 's this all about no this is not true who are they how do you define failure and why would they get anything from you at all even without knowing all that your understanding is wrong because the ll in llc stands for limited liability the whole point of forming llc or corporation is to limit your own personal liability but mere incorporation or forming llc does n't necessarily mean your liability is limited your state law defines what you must do for that limited liability protection and that includes proper ways to run your business again talk to your lawyer and your tax adviser about what it means to you i 'm totally unfamiliar with everything related to    taxes companies llc corporation etc familiarize yourself no one is going to do it for you start reading ask specific questions on specific issues and get a proper legal and tax advice from licensed professionals

the mechanism of supply and demand is imperfect   producers do n't know exactly how many purchasers consumers for a good there are   some goods by their nature are in short supply and some are plentiful the process of price discovery is one where in a nominally free market producers and purchasers make offers and counter offers to assess what the price should be   as they do this the historical price changes usually floating around some long term average   as it goes up we experience inflation   as it goes down deflation however there is n't a fixed supply of producers and purchasers so as new ones arrive and old ones leave this too has an impact on supply and prices money either in electronic or physical form needs to be available to reflect the transactions and the economy most central banks at least in more established economies aim for inflation of 2 4 by controlling the availability of money and the cost of borrowing new money   there are numerous ways they can do this printing issuing bonds etc the reason one wants some degree of inflation is because employees will never accept a pay cut even when one would significantly improve the overall economy   companies often decrease their prices in order to match lower demand but employees do n't usually accept decreased wages for decreased labour demand a nominal degree of overall money inflation therefore solves this problem   employees who get a below inflation wage increase are actually getting a wage cut supply and demand must be matched and some inflation is the inevitable consequence of this

one can generalize on traditional vs roth flavors of accounts i suggest roth for 15 money and going pretax to avoid 25 tax   if the student loan is much over 4 it may make sense to put it right after emergency fund   for emergency fund priority i 'm assuming ef really requires 2 phases the $ 2500 broken transmission root canal bill and the lose your job or need a new roof level bills i 'm in favor of doing what let 's you sleep well i 'm also quick to point out that if you owe $ 2500 at 18 yet have $ 2500 in your emergency fund you 're really throwing away $ 450 in interest each year there 's an ongoing debate of credit card as emergency fund no i do n't claim that your cards should be considered an emergency fund per se but i would prioritize knocking off the 18 debt as a high priority once that crazy interest debt is gone fund the er and find a balance for savings and the next level er the 6 of expenses one one can choose to fund a roth ira but keep the asset out of retirement calculations it 's simply an emergency account returning tax free interest and if never used it eventually is retirement money a roth permits withdrawal of deposited funds with no tax or penalty just tracking it each year this actually some people the wrong way as it sounds like tapping your retirement account for emergencies for my purpose it 's a tax free emergency fund not retirement unless and until you are saving so much in the 401(k you need more tax favored retirement money i wrote an article some time ago the roth emergency fund which went into a bit more detail   last keep in mind this is my opinion i can intelligently argue my case but at some point it 's up to the individual to do what feels right paying 18 debt off a bit slower say 4 years instead of 3 in favor of funding the matched 401(k to me you run the numbers watch the 401(k balance grow by 2x your pretax deposits and see that in year 3 your retirement account is jump started and far far more than your remaining 18 cards those who feel the opposite and wish to be debt free first are going to do what they want and the truth is if this lets you sleep better at night i 'm in favor of it

the t+3 rule relates only to accounting and not to trading   it does not prevent you from day trading   it simply means that the postings in you cash account will not appear until three business days after you have executed a trade   when you execute a trade and the order has been filled you have all of the information you need to know the cash amounts that will hit your account three business days later in a cash account cash postings that arise from trading are treated as unsettled for three days but this does not mean that these funds are available for further trading   if you have $ 25,000 in your account on day 1 this does not mean that you will be able to trade more than $ 25,000 because your cash account has not yet been debited   most cash accounts will include an item detailing cash available for trading   this will net out any unsettled business transacted for example if you have a cash account balance of $ 25,000 on day one and on the same day you purchase $ 10,000 worth of shares then pending settlement in your cash account you will only have $ 15,000 cash available for trading similarly if you have a cash balance of $ 25,000 on day one and on the same day you day trade purchasing $ 15,000 and selling $ 10,000 worth of shares then you will have the net of $ 20,000 cash available for trading $ 20,000 = $ 25,000 $ 15,000 + $ 10,000 if by prop account you mean an account where you give discretion to a broker to trade on your behalf then i think the issues of accounting will be the least of your worries   you will need to be worried about not being fleeced out of your hard earned savings by someone far more interested in lining their own pockets than making money for you

the trick to using a credit card responsibly is accounting with your old system you were paying for everything out of your savings account   everytime you had an expense it was immediately withdrawn from your savings account and you saw how much money you had left now with a credit card there is n't any money being withdrawn from your savings account until a month later when you have a huge credit card bill the trick is to treat every credit card transaction as if it was a debit card transaction and subtract the money from your available funds on paper immediately   then you 'll know how much money you actually have to spend not by looking at your bank statement but by looking at your available funds number and when the credit card bill comes you 'll have money sitting there waiting to go to the credit card company this requires more work than you had with your old system and if it sounds like too much work you might be better off with a debit card or cash   but if you want to continue to use the credit card you 'll find that the right software will make the accounting process easier   i like ynab but there are other software products that work as well   just make sure that your system accounts for each credit card transaction as it is spent deducting the amount from your budget now so that there is money set aside for the credit card bill   software that simply your spending after the fact is not as useful

since you 're coming out of college you 're probably a new investor and do n't know too much about stocks etc i was in the same situation as well   i wanted to keep my cash liquid and wanted to make low risk investments what i ended up doing was investing the majority of my money in higher interest gics guaranteed investment certificate and keeping the rest in my chequing savings account i understand that gics are n't exactly the most liquid asset out there however instead of investing it all into 1 gic i put them in to smaller increments with varying lock in times and roll over options i.e. for 15000 keep $ 3000 on hand in your account invested for 2 years invested for 1 year invested for 180 days invested for 90 days when you find that you run out of cash from your $ 3000 you 'll have a gic expiring soon   the problem with gics is that redeeming them before the maturity period usually incurs a penalty in the form of no interest   keeping them in smaller increments allows you to redeem only the amount you need without losing too much interest   at maturity if you do n't need the money you can just have the gic renew    the other problem with gics is that interest rates though better than savings accounts are n't that much more   you 're basically just fighting off inflation   the benefit is that on maturity you are guaranteed your principal and the interest    this plan is easy to implement if your bank credit union allows you to create and manage gics online

with regard to your edit although i did n't downvote one way to reduce the security risk is to separate the payment from the ability to drain your account   a considerable part of the security risk is inherent in giving people a number which is directly linked to a bank account where you keep all your money   if you do n't want that risk do n't do that   instead of or in addition to trying to reduce the chance of fraud you can reduce the impact of fraud even if it occurs by not paying for things using the details of an account where you have all your money   trying to protect against fraud while keeping all your money in the account is sort of like carrying around thousands of dollars in cash in your wallet and then worrying about how to defend against robbery   yes you can carry a weapon or hire a but it 's probably simpler to just not carry that much money in the first place you already mentioned one solution with your option 1 which is to just keep a small amount of money in a separate account and use that for online payments   assuming you can easily transfer money in and out of this account via online banking this effectively is what you say you want in your edit you log in to your bank online but rather than informing it you 're about to make a payment you just transfer money in   you 'll probably have to keep a small amount of money in the account to keep it open but if this is an important issue for you that should n't be that big a deal another solution is a credit card   with a credit card you simply make the payment online   in the us if the merchant or someone else stealing the info makes fraudulent charges the credit card company assumes the liability and the consumer suffers only the inconvenience of having to get a new card issued   i do n't know what the uk laws are regarding credit vs. debit fraud but some sites i found seem to suggest that credit cards have fraud protection in the uk as well   this is probably worth looking into if you are concerned about fraud

you are at the point that many millions of people are at and where i used to be you have no idea where your money is going you just spend spend spend until there 's nothing left and/or you borrow more to keep going   there are general rules of thumb on how much house and car you can afford but there is a great deal of personal variation housing and utility costs vary greatly from location to location city dwellers can use public transit instead of buying and maintaining a car how much other debt do you have that you need to pay off do you have expenses that are not common e.g. medical bills a more personal approach would be to figure out your own budget the first step is creating a written budget figure out how much you can spend in total i.e. your take home pay and the start allocating that money to expenses until you run out i started by looking backwards   look back at how much you spent on each category each month list them in order of priority e.g. food health housing utilities transportation entertainment everything else if the money runs out you either stop spending or reduce spending in another category e.g. can you cook a few extra meals at home instead of going out can you take lunch to work instead of a drive through the amount you have left over now indicates how much more house and car you can afford once you get to a point where you can budget comfortably then you can start looking at saving for retirement and other long term goals this worked for me and highlighted some areas where i overspent because i had good categorized records ironically because i used credit cards which i mostly stopped once i created a budget if you do n't have good records then you have to estimate   how much do you think you spend on food gas etc each month   then set aside that much and once it 's gone do n't spend anymore   now obviously you 're not going to stop eating but the idea is to plan ahead and realize i have only $ 20 left to spend on food this month maybe i should n't go to the movies it takes lots of practice and you wo n't get it right very often if you have enough left over you can set aside some as a cushion in case you do go over your budget but if you want true financial discipline you should start by reducing other categories first this is not easy by any means it will take of practice and trial and error to get to a point that you 're comfortable with the lifestyle that you can afford    so in the end there are only two variables in your equation income and outflow   do you want more house either spend less on other things or increase your income

here 's the real reason okpay actually the banks they interface with wo n't accept us citizens    the foreign account tax compliance act congress passed the foreign account tax compliance act fatca in 2010 without much one reason the act was so quiet was its four year long ramp up fatca did not really take effect until 2014 never before had a single national government attempted and so far succeeded in forcing compliance standards on banks across the world fatca requires any non u.s. bank to report accounts held by american citizens worth over $ 50,000 or else be subject to 30 withholding penalties and possible exclusion from u.s. markets by more than 100,000 foreign entities had agreed to share financial information with the irs even russia and china agreed to fatca the only major global economy to fight the feds is canada however it was private citizens not the canadian government who filed suit to block fatca under the international governmental agreement clause making it illegal to turn over private bank account information read more the tax implications of opening a foreign bank account | investopedia   follow us investopedia on facebook

they 're not going to look very hard at the asset value except for actual cash in the bank which does n't bear much relationship to the real value of the company more likely they will look at the last three years earnings and choose a target p e ratio based on that the owner 's share depends entirely on how much of the business they choose to sell if the business is worth $ 60 m and they want to raise $ 20 m for themselves then that means selling 33 of the company if they want to raise $ 20 m for the business as well then that means selling half the company and retaining ownership of the other half which is now worth $ 80 m because of the cash infusion but many stock exchanges will have minimum requirements for the percentage of the shares that are trading freely so they will have to sell at least that much

there seems to be a common sentiment that no investor can consistently beat the market on returns what evidence exists for or against this first off even if the markets were entirely random there would be individual investors that would consistently beat the market throughout their lifetime entirely by luck   there are just so many people this is a statistical certainty   so let 's talk about evidence of beating the market due to persistent skill i should hedge by saying there is n't a lot of good data here as most understandably most individual investors do n't give out their investment information but there are some ok datasets   there is weak evidence for instance that the best individual investors keep outperforming and interestingly that the trading of individual investors can predict future market movements   though the evidence is more clear that individual investors make a lot of mistakes and that these winning portfolios are not from commonly available strategies and involve portfolios that are much riskier than most   would recommend is there really no investment strategy that would make it likely for this investor to consistently outperform her benchmark there are so many papers many reasonable even out there about how to outperform benchmarks especially risk adjusted basis   not too mention some advisers with great track records and a sea of questionable websites   you can even copy most of what buffet does if you want remember though that the average investor by definition makes the average market return and then pays fees on top of that   if there is a strategy out there that is obviously better than the market and a bunch of people start doing it it quickly becomes expensive to do and becomes part the market   if there was a proven easy to implement way to beat the market everyone would do it and it would be the market so why is it that on this site or elsewhere whenever an active trading strategy is discussed that potentially beats the market there is always a claim that it probably wo n't work to start with there are a large number of clearly bad ideas posed here and elsewhere   sometimes though the ideas might be good and may even have a good chance to beat the market   like so many of the portfolios that beat the market though and they add a lot of uncertainty and in particular for this personal finance site risk that the person will not be able to live comfortably in retirement there is so much uncertainty in the market and that is why there will always be people that consistently outperform the market but at the same time why there will be few if any strategies that will outperform consistently with any certainty

ultimately you are as stuck as all other investors with low returns which get taxed however there are a few possible you can put up to 15k p.a into a normal isa either cash or stocks shares or a combination if your target is to generate the over 5 years you should maximise the amount you put in an isa then when you come to buy you cash in that part needed to top up your other savings for a deposit i.e. keep the rest in for long term savings the help to buy isa might be helpful but yes there is a limit on the purchase price which in london will restrict you several banks are offering good interest on limited sums in current accounts santander is probably the best you can get 3 taxed on up to 20 k this is a good safe return just open a 123 account arrange to pay out a couple of dds and pay in £ 500 a month you can take the £ 500 straight out again i think lloyds and tsb also offer similar but on much smaller be warned this strategy taken to the limit will involve some complexity checking your various accounts each month after that you will end up trading better returns for greater risk by using more volatile stock market investments rather than cash deposits

what 's going on here is that the variable rate loan is transferring some of the risk from the bank to you   in a reasonable deal taking on risk brings with it reward   it 's the same thing as deductibles on insurance they're transferring some risk to you and thus your expected total cost goes down thus the proper evaluation of such deals is whether you can afford the outcome if you draw the short straw   if you feel you can afford the highest payment that can result then the variable rate is a good deal   if you 're near your limit then stay with the safe option of the fixed rate for a house this is easy enough to evaluate run the calculations assuming the highest payment and see what the debt to income ratio is   note that when we were getting mortgages there was another factor involved the variable rate loans had a higher initiation cost   combined with the very low difference between fixed and arm rates at the time we went fixed but given the rates you quote going variable would have been a no brainer for us

i also do n't know the specific details for finland and/or belgium however many countries have tax treaties which generally prevent double taxation i.e. paying tax in both countries on the same base income being that both finland and belgium are eu member states i 'm quite certain there 's a provision that covers this and the same would apply you pay taxes on what you earn while in finland to finland and to belgium what you earn while in belgium all of this is similar to what you presented however there 's also a section where you 'd declare how much taxes were paid in other countries one other thing to note which will be the determining factor in the above is whether eu law requires you to change residence to be for the time you 're there if not   then you 'll be paying taxes in finland the entire time on the entire amount this comes from an irish governmental site by working in another member state and by transferring your residence there you are likely to become resident for tax purposes there the definition of fiscal residence varies from one member state to another you must comply with the laws of the country where you have established your residence the laws on personal taxation vary considerably from one member state to another and you may be liable for taxation in more than one country in general you are subject to income tax in the country where you are living but this may not be the case if you are a posted worker see below in general property is taxed in the country in which it is situated but again there are variations tax agreements have been concluded between most of the member states of the eu which are intended to avoid double taxation if you derive income from different countries in general national fiscal rules must respect the fundamental principle of non discrimination against nationals of another eu country

as you note your question is inherently opinion based   that said if i were in your situation i would sell the stock all at once and buy whatever it is you want to buy hopefully some index etf or mutual fund according to what i see the current value of the hd stock is about $ 8500 and the jnj stock is worth less than $ 500   with a total investment of less than $ 10,000 any gain you are likely to miss by liquidating now is not going to be huge in absolute terms this is doubly true since you were given the stock so you have no specific reason to believe it will do well at all   if you had picked it yourself based on careful analysis it could be worth keeping if you believed in yourself or even if you just wanted to test your acumen but as it is the stock is essentially random   even if you want to pursue an aggressive allocation it does n't make sense to allocate everything to one stock for no reason   if you were going to put everything in one stock you 'd want it to be a stock you had analyzed and picked   i still think it would be a bad idea but at least it would be a more defensible idea so i would say the risk of your lopsided allocation just two companies with more than 90 of the value in just one outweighs any risk of missing out on a gain   if news breaks tomorrow that the ceo of home depot has been or if trump decides to go on the twitter for some reason your investment could disappear another common way to think about it is if you had $ 9000 today to buy stocks with would you buy $ 8500 worth of hd and $ 500 worth of jnj   if not it probably does n't make sense to hold them just because you happen to have them the only potential exception to my advice above would be tax considerations   you did n't mention what your basis in the stock is   looking at historical prices it looks like if all the stock was 20 years old you 'd have a gain of about $ 8000 and if all of it was 10 years old you 'd have a gain of about $ 6000   if your tax situation is such that selling all the stock at once would push you into a higher tax bracket it might make sense to sell only enough to fit into your current bracket and sell the rest next year   however i think this situation is unlikely because a since the stock has been held for a long time most of the gains will be at the lower long term rate b if you have solid income you can probably afford the tax and c if you do n't have solid income your long term capital gains rate will likely be zero

let 's simplify things by assuming you only own 2 stocks by owning voo and vti you 're overweight on and mid cap stocks relative to the market composition likewise by owning vti and vt you 're overweight on u.s. stocks conversely by owning and vt you 're overweight on non u.s. stocks these are all perfectly fine positions to take if that 's what you intend and have justification for for example if you 're in the u.s. it may be a good idea to hold more u.s. stocks than vt because of currency risk but 4 equity index etfs is probably things it is perfectly fine to hold only vti and because these funds comprise thousands of stocks and thus give you sufficient diversification i would recommend holding those 2 etfs based on a domestic international allocation that makes sense to you vanguard recommends 40 of your stock allocation to be international and if for some reason you want to be overweight in and mid cap companies throw in voo you can use morningstar x ray to look at your proposed portfolio and find your optimal mix of geographic and stock style allocation

a debenture is a security document this means that the bond is secured over assets under english law you can issue bonds which if defaulted upon you can enforce your security against the issuer i.e. the company which means you can attempt to get your money back by getting hold of the company 's assets    as for a floating charge i 'll first explain what a fixed charge is say you 're a bank a lender and you lend £ 1000 to x. you take security by way of a fixed charge over x 's photocopy machines x is unable to dispose of the machines without the lender 's consent this means that if x can not pay up the loan you can enforce security by taking possession of the photocopy machines sell them and hopefully get enough money back to cover the default   a floating charge works the same way but over assets which fluctuate e.g. x 's stock of potatoes x sells potatoes to supermarkets all the time so you ca n't just take a fixed charge over it for practical reasons you ca n't just ask the lender each time you want to sell a potato when an event of default occurs i.e. you do n't pay back the loan or breach a condition of the loan agreement the floating charge and becomes a fixed charge thus enabling the lender to sell the potatoes to get their money back   random examples but makes sense   source future english solicitor

if they made deposits 20 years ago and none since the s&p is up over 300 since then i.e. a return of $ 40,000 on $ 10,000 invested we would n't expect to see that full return as a prudent mix of stock and bonds or any treasury bills cds etc would lower the overall return during this period   advice transfer the money directly to an ira at a broker fidelity schwab vanguard etc   for most people going after the advisor is n't worth it unless the sums are large and the poor management pretty clear   the lesson for readers here monitor your investments ask questions it 's not about beating the market which can actually create more risk but about understanding the returns you see and the fees you are spending the mistake did n't occur at the time the money was invested but every year it was n't monitored

the nyse 20 year plus treasury bond index is a multiple security fixed income index that aims to track the total returns of the long term 20 year and greater maturity range of the u.s. treasury bond market the index constituent bonds are weighted by their relative amounts outstanding one can not directly invest in an index index bond maturities 24 to 27 years   to 29 years      index duration years an oversimplification of how bonds value changes as rates change is they are inversely related based on the duration of the bond   think of duration as the time weighted average of all the coupons and the final payment in this case a drop in rates of about 1 will cause a rise in value of about long term rates took a drop in the last year

your question contains two different concepts fractional reserve banking and debt based money   when thinking of these two things i think it is important to analyze these items separately before trying to understand how the whole system works fractional reserve banking as others have pointed out fractional reserve banking is not a ponzi scheme   it can be fraudulent however   if a bank tells all its depositors that they can withdrawal their money at any time i.e. on demand and the bank then proceeds to loan out some portion of the depositors money then the bank has committed fraud since there is no way they could honor the depositors requests for their money if many of them came for their money at one time   this is true regardless of what type of money is deposited dollars gold etc   this is how most modern banks operate debt based money historically the fed would introduce new money by buying us treasuries   this means federal reserve notes are backed by us treasuries   i agree that this seems strange   does this mean if i take my frns to the fed i could redeem them for us treasuries   but us treasuries are promises to pay frns in the future   this makes my head hurt   reminds me of the definition for see here is an experiment   what if we wanted to recreate frns today and none existed   the us government would offer a note to pay 100 frns in one year and pay 5 interest on the note   the fed would print up its first 100 frns to buy the note from the us government   the us government would spend the frns   the first 100 frns have now entered into circulation   at the end of the note 's term the fed should have 105 frns since the government agreed to pay 5 interest on the note   but how is the us government going to pay the interest and principal on the note when only 100 frns exist   i think this is the central point to your question    i can come up with only two answers 1 the fed must purchase some assets that are not debt based 2 the us government must continue to issue debt that is purchased by newly printed frns in order to pay back older debt and interest   this is a ponzi scheme the record debt levels seem to indicate the ponzi scheme option was chosen

assuming in the us there are several possibilities but to be honest anyone here is only going to be able to make guesses   to get the answer the account holder your girlfriend is going to have to contact the bank and ask them directly       some possibilities include   suspicion of money laundering suspicion of possible illegal activities in the account e.g. check kiting suspicion of possible prohibited activities not necessarily illegal but as defined in the account agreement they may not allow activity related to gambling or businesses for example suspicion of business activity taking place in a non business account insufficient kyc know your customer information on the account such as they did not or could not verify required information during the account opening process a negative chexsystems report for example they found out through chexsystems she had derogatory information reported on another account at another bank previously or extended period of time it was usually 30 + days     i should also add that any bank credit union has just as much a right to close an account with a customer as the customer has the right to close their account with the bank credit union at any time without notice       in most cases although not all when a bank closes an account they will send a letter to the address on file for the account beforehand explaining the reasons   have her check her mail       are you sure the account is actually closed and not just blocked    it could just be in a blocked status due to overdraft or some other reason which is very different from being closed       as for where the direct deposit went if the account is truly closed then the money is being returned back to the company that initiated the direct deposit usually takes 2 3 business days   your girlfriend will have to contact the company 's payroll department to arrange other means of payment such as a check       in any case it 's all speculation at this point until the bank can be contacted to find out the real reason why   tip for the future   look at switching to a bank that has 24/7 customer service

a couple ideas use excel it has an irr internal rate of return that can handle a table of inputs as you describe along with dates deposited to give you a precise number   go simple track total deposits over the year assume half of that was present in january so for example your account started the year with $ 10k ended with $ 15k but you deposited $ 4k over the year it should be clear the return gain is $ 1k right but it 's not 10 as you added during the year i 'd divide $ for an return not knowing how your deposits were structured the true number lies between the 10 and 6.7 as extremes you 'll find as you get older and have a higher balance this fast method gaining accuracy as your deposits are a fraction of your account and likely spread out pretty smoothly over the year anyway

talk about coincidence we just recieved letters from our bank saying that our interest only loans will be going up by and if we want to keep our lower rate we will need to change early to now our interest only periods end in 6 months to about 16 months anyway we have decided to change to p&i early and save on our interest expenses why because the main purpose of investing is to make money not to save on tax even if you are on the highest marginal tax rate for every extra dollar of expenses you spend and claim as a deduction you will only get about 50 cents back through tax savings if you are on the lowest marginal tax rate your tax savings will reduce to less than 20 cents for every extra dollar spent if you are investing in order to save on tax you may be investing for the wrong reasons your primary reason for investing should be to make money for wealth creation a good reason to stay with an interest only loan for an investment property would be if you require the extra cash flow you would receive compared with an loan

i have a car loan paid in full and even paid off early and 2 personal loans paid in full from my credit union that do n't seem to reflect in a positive way and all 3 were in good standing but you also   my credit card utilization is 95 i have a total of 4 store credit cards a car loan 2 personal loans so assuming no overlap you 've paid off three of your ten loans 30   and you still have 95 utilization    what would you do if you were laid off for six months   regardless of payment history you would most likely stop making payments on your loans   this is why your credit score is bad   you are in fact a credit risk   not due to payment history   if your payment history was bad you 'd likely rank worse   but simple fiscal reality is that you are an adverse event away from serious fiscal problems    for that matter the very point that you are considering bankruptcy says that they are right to give you a poor score   bankruptcy has adverse effects on you but for your creditors it means that many of them will never get paid or get paid less than what they loaned    the hard advice that we can give is to reduce your expenses   stop going to restaurants   prepare breakfast and from scratch and bag your lunch   do n't put new expenses on your credit cards unless you can pay them this month   cut up your store cards and do n't shop for anything but necessities   whatever furniture appliances clothes shoes etc you have now should be enough for the next year or so    cut your expenses   have premium channels on your cable or the extra fast internet   drop back to the minimum instead   turn the heat down and the a c temperature up so it cools less   turn off the lights if you are n't using them   if you move move to a cheaper apartment   nothing to do   get a second job   that will not only keep you from being bored it will help with your financial issues    bankruptcy will not itself fix the problems you describe   you are living beyond your means   bankruptcy might make you stop living beyond your means   but it wo n't fix the problem that you make less money than you want to spend   only you can do that   better to stop the spending now rather than waiting until bankruptcy makes your credit even worse and forces you to cut spending    if you have extra money at the end of the month pick the worst loan and pay as much of it as you can   by worst i mean the one with the worst terms going forward   highest interest rate etc   if two loans have the same rate pay the smaller one first   once you pay off that loan it will increase the amount of money you have left to pay off your other loans   this is called the debt snowball snowball effect    after you finish paying off your debt save up six months worth of expenses or income   these will be your emergency savings    once you have your emergency fund write out a budget and stick to it   you can buy anything you want so long as it fits in your budget   avoid borrowing unless absolutely necessary   instead save your money for bigger purchases   with savings you not only avoid paying interest you may actually get paid interest   even if it 's a low rate paid to you is better than paying someone else    one of the largest effects of bankruptcy is that it forces you to act like this   they offer you even less credit at worse terms   you wo n't be able to shop on credit anymore   no new car loan   no mortgage   no nice clothes on credit   so why declare bankruptcy   take charge of your spending now rather than waiting until you ca n't do anything else

good question if a person has a choice it is probably better to pay cash but not always if your large pile of cash can earn more being invested than cost of the interest to borrow a similar large pile of cash it is beneficial to get a mortgage otherwise pay cash example a house costs $ 100,000 i have $ 100,000 in extra money i can invest that at 5 per year and i can borrow an additional $ 100,000 at 2 per year since i can make more on my pile of cash than it costs to borrow another pile of cash borrowing is better compound interest is the most powerful force on the planet according to albert einstein maybe that is n't likely for most people though here is the results from some online financial calculators borrowing $ 100,000 with 2 interest for 30 years will cost a total of $ you get $ 100,000 but it cost you $ to do it saving $ 100,000 in a bank account with an interest rate of 5 will be worth $ in 30 years by not spending the money you will earn $ over the course of 30 years so if you can invest at 5 and borrow at 2 you will end up with $ more than if you did n't it is a pretty extreme example and financial advisers make a lot of money figuring out the complex nature of money to make situations like that possible

how should i allocate short term assets in a rising interest rate    environment assuming that the last part is correct there could be bear bond funds that short bonds that could work well as a way to invest however bear in that the the rising interest rate environment is part of the basis that may or may not be true in the end as i 'm not sure i 've seen anything to tell me why rates could n't stay where they are for another couple of years or more long term capital management would be a cautionary tale before about bonds that had assumptions that when something that was n't supposed to happen happened thus while you can say there is rising interest rate environment what else are you prepared to assume and how certain are you of that happening an alternate theory here would be that junk bonds may do well because the economy has to be heating up for rates to rise and thus the bonds that are priced down so much because of default risk may turn out to not go bust and thus could do well course this would carry the your mileage may vary and without a working time machine i could n't say which funds will be good and which would suck as for what i would do if i was dealing with my own money money market funds and cds would likely be my suggestion for the short term where i want to prevent principal risk this is likely what i would do if i believed the rising rate environment is here

401(k withdrawals early or otherwise are not subject to fica or medicare taxes   that 's because they already were taxed when they were contributed   and of course the earnings from the 401(k contributions are not earned income and thus are not subject to payroll taxes for that reason while 401(k contributions are exempt from federal and generally state income taxes they are n't exempt from payroll taxes and as such you 'll see two separate amounts on your w2 and paystub if you contributed the amount that is subject to those taxes and the amount that is subject to income tax so no you do n't have to pay payroll fica social security taxes on your early withdrawal   as for the penalty that is basically an extra tax so if you withdraw $ 1000 you pay income tax at your marginal rate plus 10 penalty if your marginal rate is 25 and you 're not moving across a rate step boundary you will pay +

in general you are allowed to deduct up to $ 50/month per student see page 4 but only if you are n't reimbursed in your case since you are receiving a stipend the full $ 2000 will be treated as taxable income but the question of is it worth it really depends on how much you will actually spend and also what you 'll get from the experience suppose you actually spend $ 1000/month to host them and if your combined tax rate is 35 you 'll pay $ 700 in additional taxes each month but you 'll still profit $ 300 each month if your primary motivation for hosting students is to make a profit you could consider creating a business out of it if you do that you will be able to deduct all of your legitimate business expenses which in the above example would be $ 1000/month keeping with that example you would now pay taxes on $ 1000 instead of $ 2000 which would be $ 350 meaning your profit would now be $ increasing your profit by $ 350/month you will only need to keep spending records if you plan to go the business route my advice assume you wo n't be going the business route and then figure out what your break even point is based on your tax rate the formula is max you can spend per month without losing money = 2000 2000 t e.g. if t = 35 the break even point is $ 1300 side note my family hosted 5 students in 5 years and it was always a fantastic experience but it is also a very big commitment teenagers eat a lot and they drive cars and go on dates and play sports and need help with their homework especially english papers and they do n't seem to like bed times or imho it 's totally worth it even without the stipend

the simple answer for the so called rule of x would be found by in your case update   if you want an approximation closer to the nominal rule of 72 value use this equation that incorporates a better approximation for the natural log the rule of 72 fits this for an interest rate of for a growth multiple of 2 the rule of 72 comes from by the natural as such the 2 is the multiple of growth the rate r here is not in percent so to change to percent say r you have to multiply by 100 the number 72 is often used because it is easier to divide evenly than and is a better fit approximation for the natural log and common interest rates   if you need more you can find all this on wikipedia

i think the best way to handle her fears is to explain the income and expenses of the household overall then explain the savings and investment strategies retirement projections and then finally explain a concrete number for allowable monthly or annual discretionary expenses including charity entertainment vacations etc   you may have delicate relationship reasons for not doing this but if you want a reasonable discussion i would leave it this way please do not open with the question how much do you think we make or anything similar because that comes off as a trick or a quiz   it sounds very condescending and highlights how much more you know about finances than she does   it also highlights subconsciously how little mental control she has over the finances which is likely to make her feel greater anxiety you should emphasize how secure things are and explain why all the savings and investments you 're using are conservatively likely to keep her financially secure   this sets the ground for her to be comfortable with the fact that she now has money in contrast to perhaps a less financially secure personal history after that charitable expenses come out of the expense budget same as vacations recreation etc   if it does not financial security then it 's not dangerous to spend on charity the alternate approach is to avoid the big financial talk and just propose a few small contributions this year then increase it every year incrementally that may be easier to swallow once there 's a psychological track record of donating without incident please go into the discussion remembering three things but above all please do not open up with a quiz   have a simple discussion with her   give her time to consider the expenses budget relative to the savings budget as a proportion of income   and then allow for the fact that she may place a strong premium on savings and a strong discount on charity

to qualify as a woman owned business a woman or group of women must own shares worth 51 of the business if your investor was a woman the entire 5 could come from her share of the company without affecting the 51 ownership requirement could you find a woman to add as an investor if you each had your shares diluted 5 she would be down to ownership and you would be down to ownership the only way for you to get back to a 51 female ownership situation would be to give a ownership stake from your share to a wife sister mom girlfriend or any other woman who you think should benefit from this arrangement this would still put you down at 44 effectively taking the whole 5 from you but by giving some of your share to someone else it does require your partner to make some of the sacrifice while still benefiting someone you care about if you have someone you would like to give that benefit to in summary this is what it would look like

you will almost certainly be able to sell 10,000 shares at once the question is a matter of price if you sell at market then you may get a lower price for each batch of the stock sold one person buys 50 another buys 200 another buys 1000 etc at varying prices will you be able to execute a single order to sell them all at the same price at the same time nobody can say and it 's not really a function of the company size the exchange has what 's called open interest which roughly correlates to how many people have active orders in at a given price this number is constantly changing alongside the bid and ask particularly for active stocks so let 's say you have 10,000 shares and you want to sell them for $ 100 each what you need is at least 10,000 in open interest at $ 100 bid to execute by contrast let 's say you issue a limit order at $ 100 for 10,000 shares your ask will stay outstanding at that price and you 'll be filled at that price if there are enough buyers i you have a limit sell order at $ 100 for 10,000 shares the strike price of the stock can not go to $ 100.01 until all of your sell orders are filled

i started storing and summing all my receipts bills etc it has the advantage of letting me separate expenses by category but it 's messy and it takes a long time   it sounds from this like you are making your summaries far too detailed do n't instead start by painting with broad strokes for example if you spent $ at the grocery store do n't bother splitting that amount into categories like toiletries hygiene products food and snacks just categorize it as grocery spending and move on to the next line on your account statement similarly unless your finances are heavily reliant on cash do n't worry about categorizing each cash expense rather just categorize the withdrawal of cash as miscellaneous and do n't spend time trying to figure out exactly where the money went after that because honestly you probably spent it on something other than savings because really when you are just starting out getting a handle on your spending you do n't need all the nitty gritty details what you need rather is an idea of where your money is going figure out half a dozen or so categories which make sense for you to categorize your spending into you probably have some idea of where your money is going these could be loans cost of living mortgage rent utilities housing home insurance groceries transportation car payments fuel vehicle taxes savings and so on whatever fits your situation add a miscellaneous category for anything that does n't neatly fit into one of the categories you thought of go back something like 3 4 months among your account statements do a quick categorization for each line on your account statements into one of these categories and then sum them up per category and per month calculate the monthly average for each category that 's your starting point the budget you 've been living by intentionally or not after that you can decide how you want to allocate the money and perhaps dig a bit more deeply into some specific category turns out you are spending a lot of money on transportation which you did n't expect look more closely at those line items and see if there 's something you can cut are you spending more money at the grocery store than you thought then look more closely at that and so on once you know where you are and where you want to be such as for example bumping the savings category by $ 200 per month you can adjust your budget to take you closer to your goals chances are you wo n't realistically be able to do an about face turn on the spot but you can try to reduce some discretionary category by say 10 each month and transfer that into savings instead that way in 6 7 months you have cut that category in half

4 finally do all companies reduce their stock price when they pay a dividend are they required to there seems to be confusion behind this question   a company does not set the price for their stock so they ca n't reduce it either   in fact nobody sets the price for a stock the price you see reported is simply the last price that the stock was traded at   that trade was just one particular trade in a whole sequence of trades   the price used for the trade is simply the price which the particular buyer and particular seller agreed to for that particular trade   no agreement well then no trade   there 's no authority for the price other than the collection of all buyers and sellers so what happens when nokia declares a 55 cent dividend   when they declare there is to be a dividend they state the record date which is the date which determines who will get the dividend the owners of the shares on that date are the people who get the dividend payment   the stock exchanges need to account for the payment so that investors know who gets it and who does n't so they set the ex dividend date which is the date on which trades of the stock will first trade without the right to receive the dividend payment   ex dividend is usually about 2 days before record date   these dates are established well before they occur so all market participants can know exactly when this change in value will occur when trading on ex dividend day begins there is no authority to set a different price than the previous day 's closing price   what happens is that all knowledgeable market participants know that today nokia is trading without the payment 55 cents that buyers the previous day get   so what do they do   they take that into consideration when they make an offer to buy stock and probably end up offering a price that is about 55 cents less than they would have otherwise   similarly sellers know they will be getting that 55 cents so when they choose a price to offer their stock at it will likely be about that much less than they would have asked for otherwise

it was a tough call    here 's what i think happened   they needed to use that 2.5 spectrum for something or risk losing it fcc mandates on the purchase of that spectrum lte was nowhere near ready for deployment so they had to go with wimax it was a good technology ready to go at the right time and far cheaper to deploy than lte but the spectrum was n't ideal for all environments they always planned on switching from wimax to lte at some point   unfortunately the infighting with delayed the rollout wimax did n't come to market soon enough and not enough people bought into it sprint saw this outcome as a possibility which is why the spun off their wimax assets into instead of proceeding with their original service they wanted to insulate sprint which also meant that could become a toxic asset probably was n't very happy with that part of the plan cue infighting and rollout delay   since wimax launched over a year late and the competition jumped forward the wimax rollout was cut short verizon pushed up their lte rollout far earlier than planned which caused constant verizon data network outages last year at&amp;t secured dominance with the iphone and their network allowed them to have higher data speeds so they were n't worried about speeding up their lte rollout t mo 's parent company wanted out of the us market but still had high speed and low prices sprint had to move forward with lte or eat everyone else 's dust    that 's why you never got it   to top that off they had to their 800 mhz spectrum which meant killing the ability for them to use it for a few years they also needed to completely rebuild their public image which was shit thanks to 's predecessor gary and his crew all of which got shit canned when took charge they also had to deal with a few somewhat bad calls like the purchase orchestrated by and his crew the good news is that they that 800 mhz spectrum from the deal which was fairly important   here 's the good news sprint 's network overhaul is going to be awesome   the 2.5 spectrum is excellent for data speeds and high traffic densely populated areas will see some amazing speeds where the 2.5 spectrum falls off the 1900 mhz will pick up where 1900 mhz falls off the 800 mhz will pick up everything will deliver a nice smooth and fast experience you 'll start enjoying these improvements within 6 months   i 'm pretty hopeful that softbank will bring back and for between the us and japanese networks

with new cars it 's usually the other way around finance at a low apr or get cash back when you buy it outright with used cars you usually do n't know how much they have invested in the car so it 's more difficult to know how low they 're willing to go regardless i do think it 's odd that they would knock 2 k off the price if you finance with them but not if you pay cash the only reason they would do that is if they intend to make at least 2 k in interest over the life of the loan but they have no way of guaranteeing you wo n't refi therefore i suspect they are and would probably close the deal if you wrote them a check or put the cash on the table for 2 k less however if they wo n't budge and will only knock off 2 k if you finance you could finance and pay it off in full a week later just make sure they do n't have any hidden origination fees or pay off early fees

be careful of the other answers here many are wrong or partially wrong the question implies that you knew this but for everyone else 's benefit you can keep you llc organization and still elect to be treated as a s corp by the irs just for tax purposes   you do this by filing form with the irs you can also by the way elect to be taxed as a regular c corp if you want although that 's probably not advantageous   see form the advantage of electing to be treated as an s corp is that income beyond what constitutes a reasonable salary are not subject to social security and medicare taxes as they would when paid was wages or counted as self employment income on schedule c.   depending on what you need to pay yourself to meet the reasonable salary test your overall income and other factors about your business this could result in tax savings contrary to other answers here making this election will not force you to create a board of directors   you are still an llc for all purposes except taxes so whatever requirements you had in organization and governance at the state level will not change   you will have to file a corporate tax return on form 1120s and likely some corresponding state tax form so that is additional paperwork but this corporate return does not mean the s corp pays taxes itself with a couple of exceptions the s corp pays no taxes directly and therefore does not pay at the corporate tax rate instead the s corp its income expenses and deductions to the owner(s on schedule k.   the owners get their portion reported from the s corp on schedule k1 and then include that on their personal form 1040 to pay tax at their personal rate in addition to filing form 1120s you will have to handle payroll taxes which will create some additional administrative work and/or cost using a payroll service for this will likely be your best option and not terribly expensive you 've also got the issue of determining your reasonable salary within the rules which is the subject of other questions on this site and other irs guidance

short selling can be a good strategy to hedge but you have almost unlimited downside   if a stock price skyrockets you may be forced to cover your short by the brokerage before you want to or put up more capital a smarter strategy to hedge that limits your potential downside is to buy puts if you think the market is going down   your downside is limited to the total amount that you purchased the put for and no more another way to hedge is to sell calls that are covered because you own the shares the calls refer to   you might do this if you thought your stock was going to go down but you did n't want to sell your shares right now   that way the only downside if the price goes up is you give up your shares at a predetermined price and you miss out on the upside but your downside is now diminished by the premium you were paid for the option you 'd still lose money if the shares went down since you still own them but you got paid the option premium so that helps offset that

in theory you do n't have to pay income tax in such a situation in actual fact the transaction looks suspicious because the money went into your account   presumably the money should have gone out of your account in equal amount   having allowed all this to happen what you need to do is to document this activity asap the first thing to do is to retain the paperwork showing the sending of the funds to the third party the second thing to do is to ask your friend for a letter dated today do n't use an earlier date as to why the money was delivered into your account and the fact that it was sent to the third party then if the irs comes calling you will have documentation to prove your point and protect yourself

signing bonuses are probably the most variable of all as there is a general understanding that more personal factors are taken into account as a result hr is n't under a huge obligation to explain away the differences in comparison for salary there 's the wide expectation that same job = same pay since there 's so variable but also fairly rare budget is n't a main concern for many hr departments and they certainly wo n't have a finely grained budget breakdown this year we 'll pay $ for $ 50000 for relocation payments $ 100,000 for pension transfers $ for stock option losses it 's generally tossed on one big heap cost of hiring so what can you ask for that 's really a market question what 's your value to the company how much of that is already reflected in salary and other benefits the main downside to signing bonuses is that a company wo n't know how long you 'd stay your value to the company is probably your monthly work therefore they can not amortize that bonus over a fixed amount of months what if you leave after 3 months for that reason a conditional signing bonus is a reasonable offer from your side e.g. ask for one month salary conditional on you staying for 24 months and otherwise you 'll repay them from your last salary

considering i 'm putting 30 down and having my father cosign is there    any chance i would be turned down for a loan on a $ 100k car according to bankrate the average credit score needed to buy a new car is 714 but they also show average interest rates at for new car loans to people with credit scores in the 660 range high income certainly helps offset credit score to some extent   not every bank dealership does things the same way being self employed you 'd most likely be required to show 2 years of tax returns and they 'd use those as a basis for your income rather than whatever you have made recently if using a co signer their income matters another key factor is debt to income ratio if too much of someone 's income is already spoken for by other debts a lender will shy away so yes there 's a chance given all the information we do n't know and the variability with lender policies that you could be turned down for a car loan how should i go about this if you 're set on pursuing the car loan just go talk to some lenders you 'll want to shop around for a good rate anyway so no need to speculate just go find out include the dealership as a potential financing option they can have great rates personally i 'd get a much cheaper car your insurance premium on a 100k car will be quite high due to your age you might be rightly confident in your earning potential but nothing is guaranteed situations can change wildly in short order a new car is not a good investment or a value retaining asset so why bother going into debt for one if you do n't have to if you buy something in cash now you could upgrade in a few years without financing if your earning prediction holds and would save quite a bit in car insurance and interest over the years between

by your own logic this may not work tax cuts which are matched by government spending cuts will have an immediate negative effect on the economy as government spending contributes a very sizeable chunk of the gdp and employs a not at all insignificant workforce   thus for the net total economic growth to compensate at the very least that entire tax cuts has to be spent in the economy preferably in sectors where the income velocity of money is the highest income velocity has often been proven to be the highest among the low income sections while the lowest among the high income sections for example if the corporate tax cuts is just invested as share buybacks the net velocity is tiny even though share prices will increase   what proof do you really have that this will not be case let alone 35 years even recent data has shown that increasing the monetary supply to corporate america does not really translate to sustained gdp growth as the money velocity remains abysmal this has been demonstrated both on a state level in kansas and in a slightly different way at the federal level through our experience with quantitative easing

regardless of what the credit reporting agencies or brokerages say the fact is that brokerage margin is not reported to the credit reporting agencies i have borrowed hundreds of thousands of dollars on margin from dozens of brokerages over the years and have never seen a dime of it reported nor have i ever heard of it ever being reported for someone else   and it 's easy to see why this would be so because borrowing on margin is n't really borrowing at all because you always must have positive equity in the account at all times so you are n't borrowing anything you just have an investment contract that determines your gains losses as if you had borrowed in other words it 's simulated

what is the goal of the money   if it is to use in the short term like savings for a car or college then stick it in the bank and use it for that purpose if you really want this money to mean something then in my opinion you have only one choice   open a roth ira with something like vanguard or fidelity and invest in an index fund   then do something that will be very difficult   do n't touch it by the time you are 65 it will grow to about 60,000   however assuming a 20 tax bracket the value of that money is really more like 75,000    clearly this will not make or break you either way   the way you live the rest of your life will have far more of an impact   it will get you started on the right path btw this is advice i gave my son who is about your age and does not earn a ton of money as a state   half of his overtime pay goes into a roth   if he lives the rest of his life like he does now he will be a wealthy man despite making an average income   no debt and investing a decent portion of his pay

assuming you max out your roth ira with $ 5000 in inflation adjusted contributions every year from 25 65 your balance at age 65 will depend on the post inflation return you get in the account   assuming you withdraw 4 per year after that here is what your income will be all numbers are in inflation adjusted 2011 dollars    if your post inflation return is zero if you buy treasury bonds money market accounts or something like that you 'll have a simple $ 5000 40 = $ 200,000 which will give you an income of around $ 8000 per year if you get a 3 post inflation return e.g. fairly safe muni bonds corporate bonds and boring stocks you 'll approximately double your money to around $ giving you an income of over $ 15,000 per year if you get a 6 return e.g. more aggressive stocks and more risk taking you 'll approximately double your money again to over $   a 4 withdrawal rate will give you an income of around $ per year stocks have historically returned around inflation + 8 that will get you over $ 1.4 million and an annual income of over $ per year so yes it is feasible to retire on nothing but a maxed out roth ira

a loan from a bank with no real purpose could be a bad idea and end up costing you more money than it needs to as someone with a loan and credit card debts accrued over university i would say avoid it if at all possible certainly do n't sign up to a large loan if you have no current plans for the money car house repair etc it sounds as though you 're fairly careful with your money but just want a bit of extra security in case a purchase you did n't account for slips by if this is the case and you 're set on obtaining a source of credit i 'd suggest getting an overdraft if you have n't already overdrafts are a lot more flexible and are better for short term debt that you plan to pay off immediately such as unexpected charges coming in at the end of the month   it 's worth mentioning that this is from the perspective of a uk banking customer overdraft conditions will vary depending on the country

why does the yield go up if the country is economically unstable the yield will rise when instability increases because the risk of default increases   if the case of greece the instability of government finances resulted in a 50 haircut for bond holders in 2011   in other words bond holders suffered a 50 write down in the nominal value of their bonds   this means that holding these bonds until maturity will mean they will only receive half of the original nominal value of the bond and that is assuming no further write downs occur why does selling a bond drive up the yield significant selling of bonds means that sellers are worried about future prospects   sellers will outnumber buyers so sellers will have to reduce their offer price in order to attract new buyers so if you think greece is not going to default as it 's highly likely a country would completely default would n't it make sense to hold onto the bonds if you think that it is highly unlikely that greece will default and the prices and yields are attractive then greek bonds may look like an attractive investment however keep in mind the fate of bond holders in 2011   they were attracted to greek bonds by the price and yield but they suffered a 50 haircut

you can increase your monthly cash flow in two ways it 's really that simple i 'd even argue that to a certain extent decreasing expenses can be more cash positive than increasing income by the same amount if you 're spending post tax money because increasing income generally increases your taxes so if you have a chunk of cash and you want to increase your cash flow you could decrease debt like chris suggested and it would have the same effect on your monthly cash flow or you could invest in something that pays a dividend or pays interest there are many options other than real estate including dividend paying stocks or funds cds bonds etc to get started you could open an account with any of the major brokerage firms and get suggestions from their financial professionals usually for free they 'll help you look at the risk reward aspects of various investments

idea that somehow people will take a lower income job and automatically grow into a higher paying one   it does n't happen automatically but it does happen all the time it 's climbing the corporate ladder if you will    leads to trying to have a workforce that 's minimum wage with little room for growth   simply untrue at most successful companies if you provide value they pay you what your worth or you jump if you are smart enough i see it all the time    minimum wage may or may not have kept up with inflation by that 's like saying working at mcdonald 's only affords me such and such lifestyle defined circumstances are required to solve the problem inflation is n't directly solved by upping the minimum wage so move on to a better solution    jobs a worthy cry but ca n't be only metric to ensure people have opportunity to live decently    jobs are the opportunity where there is specific abuse in the workplace denying people equal job opportunity we fight it if you do n't pay me enough and i am forced to work for you that 's called indentured servitude which is an abuse and illegal as humans are property in such a case but if you force me to pay you more than i want to somehow that 's okay goes both ways leave to a company that pays you what your worth if i do n't pay you enough this is how the most people grow over time to better salaries and more prestigious titles   lots of college grads with low paying jobs   define low paying i 'm a college grad wife is too lots of people i know are what $ we make varies greatly from person to person based largely upon the opportunities we created took not because of a mandated min wage

borrow money from the central bank wrong premise they can not borrow as much as they want and they can not borrow without collateral i.e. government debt instruments they hold or any other instrument with value   and banks do n’t have unlimited collateral to borrow against   secondly central banks are n’t in the business of lending unlimited money the more money they lend out the more is the money supply which inflation which will eventually lead them to stop lending at any point of time they want a certain amount of money movement so they can control inflation and interest rates within an agreed limit and as limited by their economy no sane central bank would want to by printing money at will e g helicopter money so the only other way for banks is to accept deposits from private individuals you can also argue that banks make money by connecting lenders and borrowers and make their profit by being the middleman without using their assets so you can say they are making a profit with the minimum usage of their capital albeit they have the central bank looking over their shoulder to police their behaviour while some banks do charge fees for keeping deposits yes but many provide certain extra services for which they charge that is how they differentiate between no fee accounts and fee paying accounts

during the hyperinflation of the republic corporate stocks and convertible bonds were thought second only to the species gold silver etc as the only secure currencies   as milton friedman proved inflation is caused solely by the monetary token supply increasing faster than productivity   in the past days of species of currency it was caused by governments the currency e.g. the same amount of silver in 50 coins to 100 coins sudden increases in the supply of precious metals can also trigger it the various gold rushes in 19th century and later improvements in extraction methods caused of inflation most famously the huge amounts of silver the spanish extracted from the new world mines devastated the european economy with high inflation governments use inflation as a form of stealth flat tax money functions as an abstract universal trade good and it all the rules of supply and demand if the supply of money goes up suddenly then its value drops in relation to real goods and service but that drop in value does n't occur instantly the increased quality of tokens has to through the market before the value changes   so the first institution to spend the debased currency can get the full current value from trade the second gets slightly less the third even less and so on in 2008 the federal reserve began printing money and loaning at 0 to insolvent backs who then used that money to buy t bill this had the effect of giving the banks an arbitrary a1 rated asset for their fractional reserve while the federal government got full pre inflation value of the money paid for the t bills as the government spent that money the number of tokens increased fast than the economy   in times of inflation the value of money per unit drops as its supply increases and increases the best hedges against inflation are real assets e.g. land equipment stocks ownership of real assets and convertible bonds which are convertible to stock   it 's important to remember that money is of itself worthless it 's just a technology that and trading which at the base is still a barter system during inflation the barter value of money plunges owing to increased supply but the direct barter value between any two real assets remain the same because their supplies have not changed   the value of stocks and convertible bonds is maintained by the economic activity of the company whose ownership they represent dividends stock prices and bond equity as measured in the inflated currency continue to rise in sync with inflation thus they preserve the original value of the money paid for them not sure why you expect more inflation the only institution that can create inflation in the us is the federal reserve which trump has no direct control off deregulation of banks wo n't cause inflation in and of itself as the private banks can not alter the money supply if banks fail owing to deregulation unlikely i think given the dismal nearly century long record of regulation to date then the federal reserve might fix the problem with another inflation tax but otherwise not

this depends on what the alternative is your loan of .99 is very favorable rate if you have the 15,000 right now but only hold it in your checking account or cash then you might as well just pay it all you have an adequate emergency fund paying the debt off sooner will save you on interest currently if you pay the minimum you will pay a total of $ by the end of the loan a $ 230 premium to $ 15,000 math credit goes to   joe if you have an investment vehicle you feel can successfully yield more then .99 you might want to consider investing that money instead while paying the minimum on your car loan also be sure to check the .99 is not an introductory rate which increases later on it comes down to whether you can get a better return then .99 investing that money or whether you rather just pay off the debt and not worry about it if you do n't want to bother investing the money than just pay it off i also assumed you have no other revolving debt with a higher apr if you do first pay off the higher apr debt

how you should record the mortgage payments depends on if you are trying to achieve correct accounting according to the standards or if you are just tracking everything for you and your friends if you 're just keeping track for personal reasons i 'd suggest that you set up your check or journal entry your preference how you 'd like it to be recorded   then memorize that transaction   this allows you to use it as many times as you need to without having to set it up each time   also note there is no way to record a transaction that decreases cash and increases equity if you 're trying to keep track of everything according to accounting standards which it should be if you 've set up an official business then you have a lot more tracking to do with each payment   mortgage payments technically do not affect the equity accounts of the owners   each mortgage payment should decrease the bank balance increase interest expense and decrease the mortgage balance not to mention tracking any escrow account you may have   the equity accounts would be affected if the owners are contributing funds to the bank account but equity would increase at the time the funds are deposited not when the mortgage payments are made hope this helps

i think that mbhunter hit the nail on the head regarding your question i just want to add that having a policy that is n't sponsored by your employer is a good idea employer policies are regulated by the federal government via erisa independent policies are state regulated and usually have better protections also look for a policy that allows you to increase your coverage later without medical qualification so you do n't need to insurance initially

employers withhold at rates specified in circular e issued by the ir you can request that   additional money be withheld not an issue here or you can have   reduced withholding by claiming additional allowances on a w-4 i.e.   more than just for you and spouse and dependents if you believe that   this will result in withholding that will more closely match the tax due   note added in 2 of the w-4 form has worksheets that can be used to figure out how many additional allowances to request also i wonder if your withholding will be 37 or final tax bill be   26 of your adjusted gross income   the tax brackets are the tax   on marginal income if you are in the 28 tax bracket you owe 28 cents in tax for each additional dollar of income not 28 cents in tax for every dollar of income   your overall tax might well be less than 20 of your income   as a specific example in 2011 a married taxpayer filing jointly would be in the   highest 35 tax bracket if the taxable income was $ or more marginal tax rate of 35 is applicable to every dollar more than $ but the tax on   $ itself works out to be $ or of the taxable income so if you do expect to be earning around $ 350 k or more in salary between now and december 31 to hit that 26 that you expect you will owe you might want to consider paying a tax accountant for advice on how to fill out your w-4 form for your new employer rather than relying on an internet forum such as this for free advice note added in edit   your comment it is a cocktail of federal taxes state taxes local taxes health care on the earlier version of my answer does raise the question of whether you want your employer to withhold 26 instead of 37 and have the money go to meet all these obligations or just 26 towards your federal income tax liability only the federal w-4 form affects only how much money is withheld from your paycheck and sent to the us treasury   some of the money that each of your employers withholds social security and medicare taxes is not affected by what you put down on   the w-4 form   now if you hold two jobs and the total income shown on your w-2s is larger than the ss limit you will   have had too much social security taxes withheld and the excess will be a credit towards your federal income tax liability   you have self employment income too on which you owe social security and medicare taxes and you are making estimated tax payments the excess social security tax payment can count towards this too as well as income tax on your schedule c income   thus if your new employer is withholding too much you might be able to skip making the fourth quarterly payment of estimated tax or make a reduced payment there is no requirement that the four installments   must be equal   in short there are lots of ramifications that you need to take into account before deciding that 26 is the right number instead of filling out a w-4   all by yourself right away i strongly recommend   reading up a lot on income taxes or play with a tax preparation program last year 's version will do a pretty good job of at least getting you in the right ballpark or consult with a tax accountant

if you do n't need to own a car for other reasons i.e. if you are perfectly fine using lyft and public transport a new car loan should have just as much effect on your credit score as say opening a new credit card your credit score would take a temporary dip because of the hard inquiry to acquire the card but your number of credit accounts would increase and your credit utilization rate would go down both of which are good things for your credit score there may be better ways to increase your credit score that others know about but i do n't think getting a car loan when you do n't need a car is the best one note this assumes that you are paying all your credit cards off in full every month

the benefit is not in taxes when you sell a portion of your stock you no longer have a portion of your stock when you get a dividend you still have a portion of your stock dividends are distributed from the net profits of a company and as such usually do n't affect its growth earning potential much although there may be cases when they do so while the price takes a temporary dip due to the distribution you 're likely to get the same dividends again next year if the company continues being similarly profitable if you sell a portion of your stock at some point you 'll end up with no more stocks to sell

i do n't agree that the market as a whole is a ponzi scheme but there are some ponzi like aspects to it if you buy high quality stocks like coca cola johnson and johnson at&amp;t verizon kraft wells fargo the vanilla bank not one of the crazy ones ibm berkshire hathaway etc and simply hold onto them for the next 10 20 years you will make money even over the last decade when stocks went nowhere you still came out ahead through the dividend payments it was just at an unsatisfactory rate of return also the market consists of a lot more than just stocks corporate bonds are a big market and i always recommend people to look at bonds if you can not judge whether a company is credit worthy how can you invest in the common stock i 've made a lot more money myself in the bond market than in the stock market   however for many stocks they do look a lot like ponzi schemes this is true in particular with many of the tech stocks cuban was a tech investor so that is probably where his sentiment is coming from you have many of these companies that create great products however they never have positive cash flow because all the money is spent to develop new products as the share price goes up the company issues new shares to fund research stock options to employees to enrich them etc however eventually they run into a string of bad research that do not yield a new product and the share price plunges perhaps the company goes bankrupt so you have a company that developed great products but the shareholders never got a penny in dividends and the final shareholders have paper worth zero   take a look at research in motion for example creating the blackberry has to be one of the biggest successes in tech over the last decade however has the shareholders gotten any richer only if they traded amongst themselves nobody got a dividend what happened to the many billions of dollars they made during the peak popularity years of blackberry it went to executives employees and was squandered on development that did not effectively defend the phone 's dominant market position now the stock price is back down to the pre prime years and if a shareholder held onto it throughout the entire period he would not have received a single penny and this is a profitable enterprise things look even more bizarre when you start looking at the tech companies that have never had a positive earnings quarter and no plans to ever have positive earnings something like pandora comes to mind often management at these more bizarre companies run the company as a toy to play with their own ideas and to issue themselves stock as compensation and of course they sell a lot of the stock to cash in before they delve into the next risky venture they have no intention of ever enriching anybody who holds into the stock in the long run if for some reason they make money they will put it all into their next toy project until one of them fails and wipes everything out   if you invest in a profitable business with reasonable management you will generally come out ahead some businesses get displaced by unpredictable circumstances and they go bankrupt but on average if a company is good at doing something and they pay out the earnings you come out ahead you get in trouble when businesses are good at something and they take all the money they make and put it into doing something they are not good at a business might only provide good cashflow for 10 20 years when the product is popular and before competitors cut into margins if that money is squandered the long term shareholder may ultimately have very terrible results the long term shareholder ends up being the guy who keeps going all in on a to win bet that is what management is doing when they bet the company on the next unproven product but eventually he gets zeroed out on one loss   this is why if you look at buffett 's investments they are all in simple businesses that spits off cash to the owner shareholder businesses like soft drinks snacks rail roads vanilla banking utility like energy companies insurance etc you might be good at judging the odds of whether a business will succeed or not aka make more money than your original investment or not but you do n't want management of that company to make a wildly different bet for you just because they are great at operating a company does n't mean they are good enough at judging odds or disciplined enough to make those bets for you i may have predicted accurately that business x will be a great success but if manage takes those profits and goes all in on business y without giving me a chance to cash out that may have results

your question asked about a specific time the yield curve flattened or inverted   there are other times when the yield curve inverted or flattened   you also imply in your question that investors were flocking to long term bonds which lowered their yields   i do n't believe this is the case   i believe investors were fleeing from short term bonds causing the yields on short term bonds to rise to meet those of long term bonds the chart below shows the history of yields on us bonds over time   the areas are where the yield curve flattened or inverted   notice that after 1982 it is the short term yields that rise sharply to meet or cross the yields on longer term bonds   the yields on longer term bonds move little compared to the movement in yields on the short term bonds   thus it is investors moving out of short term bonds that cause the yield curve to or   these investors are not moving into longer term bonds since the yields on the longer term bonds do not move much at all at these times   in fact in 2006 the longer term bond market was only 25 of the total us public debt while short term bonds made up 75   it would take less money to move the yields on longer term bonds than it would on short term bonds yet the longer term yields did not move near as much as short term yields   so why are investors or banks moving out of short term bonds causing their yields to rise   i believe this happens for one of two reasons   they are moving into higher yielding investments or they need to raise cash to cover bad investments   charts and more information here

i am only familiar with american banks but generally speaking they will work with you if you can demonstrate that you have an adequate average income over a period of time it is likely they will want a record of your income for at least the last 24 months more would be better the terms of the individual contracts i.e. termination clauses etc should n't be important as long as you have a demonstrated history of making a good income i 'd recommend finding a bank that performs manual underwriting i.e. they actually have someone on staff that will look at your credit history income debt ratios as opposed to them just generating an offer based on a computer model lending standards can vary quite a bit from bank to bank and you have not listed your average annual income so it is difficult to say whether they will offer you a mortgage or for what amount but you have a significant down payment however assuming that your numbers are good and that you can find someone intelligent to work with it 's unlikely that they will deny you simply because your income is uneven best of luck

what most of these answers here seem to be missing is that a stock price is not exactly what we typically expect a price to be for example when we go in to the supermarket and see that the price of a gallon of milk is $ 2.00 we know that when we go to the cash register that is exactly how much we will pay   this is not however the case for stocks for stocks when most people talk about the price or quote they are really referring to the last price at which that stock traded which unlike for a gallon of milk at the supermarket is no guarantee of what the next stock price will be   relatively speaking most stocks are extremely liquid so they will react to any information which the market believes has a bearing on the value of their underlying asset almost if not immediately   as an extreme example if allegations of accounting fraud for a particular company whose stock is trading at $ 40 come out mid session there will not be a gradual decline in the price $ 40 > $ > $ instead the price will jump from $ 40 to say $ 20   in the time between the the $ 40 trade and the $ 20 trade even though we may say the price of the stock was $ 40 that quote was actually a terrible estimate of the stock 's current post fraud announcement price considering that the price of a stock typically does not remain constant even in the span of a few seconds to a few minutes it should not be hard to believe that this price will not remain constant over the 17.5 hour period from the previous day 's close to the current day 's open   do n't forget that as americans go to bed the asian markets are just opening and by the time us markets have opened it is already past in london   in addition to the information and therefore new knowledge gained from these foreign markets movements macro factors can also play an important part in a security 's perhaps the ecb makes a morning statement that is interpreted as negative news for the markets or a foreign government before the us markets open   stock prices on the nyse nasdaq etc wo n't be able to react until 9:30 but the $ 40 price of the last trade of a broad market etf at 4pm yesterday probably is n't looking so hot at this morning do n't forget either that most individual stocks are correlated with the movement of the broader market so even news that is not specific to a given security will in all likelihood still have an impact on that security 's price the above are only a few of many examples of things that can impact a stock 's valuation between close and open all sorts of geopolitical events announcements from large multi national companies macroeconomic stats such as unemployment rates etc announced in foreign countries can all play a role in affecting a security 's price overnight as an aside one of the answers mentioned after hours trading as a reason in actuality this typically has very little if any impact on the next day 's prices and is often referred to as amateur hour due to the fact that trading during this time typically consists of small time investors   prices in ah are very poor of a stock 's price at open

although this has been touched upon in comments i think the following line from the currently accepted answer shows the biggest issue there is a clear difference between investing and gambling the reality is that the difference is n't that clear at all tens of comments have been written arguing in both directions and looking around the internet entire essays have been written arguing both positions the underlying emotion that seems to shape this discussion primarily is whether investing especially in the stock market is a form of gambling people who do invest in this way tend to get relatively emotional whenever someone argues that this is a form of gambling as gambling is considered a negative thing the simple reality of human communication is that words can be ambiguous and the way investors will use the words investments and gambles will differ from the way it is used by gamblers and once again different from the way it 's commonly used what i definitely think is made clear by all the different discussions however is that there is no single distinctive trait that allows us to differentiate investing and gambling the result of this is that when you take dictionary definitions for both terms you will likely end up including lottery tickets as a valid form of investment   that still however leaves us with a situation where we have two terms with a strong overlap which have a distinctive meaning in communication and the original question whether buying lottery tickets is an investment over on there is an absolutely amazing strongly recommended essay which explores countless of different traits in search of a difference between investing and gambling and they came up with the following two definitions investing any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit and which is characterized by some or most of the following in approximately descending order of importance sufficient research has been conducted the odds are favorable the behavior is risk averse a systematic approach is being taken emotions such as greed and fear play no role the activity is ongoing and done as part of a long term plan the activity is not motivated solely by entertainment or compulsion ownership of something tangible is involved a net positive economic effect results gambling any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit and which is characterized by some or most of the following in approximately descending order of importance little or no research has been conducted the odds are unfavorable the behavior is risk seeking an approach is being taken emotions such as greed and fear play a role the activity is a discrete event or series of discrete events not done as part of a long term plan the activity is significantly motivated by entertainment or compulsion ownership of something tangible is not involved no net economic effect results the very interesting thing about those definitions is that they capture very well the way those terms are used by most people and they even acknowledge that a lot of investors are gambling and that a few gamblers are investing read the essay for more on that and this fits well with the way those two concepts are understood by the public so in those definitions normally buying a lottery ticket would indeed not be an investment but if we take for example 's operation example if you have $ 1000 and need $ 2000 by next week or else you ca n't have an operation and you will die and you ca n't find anyone to give you a loan your optimal strategy is to gamble your $ 1000 at the best odds you can get with a possible outcome of $ 2000 so even if you only have a 1/3 chance of winning and getting that operation it 's still the right bet if you ca n't find a better one this can suddenly change the perception and turn gambling into high risk investing

intuitive i doubt it derivatives are not the simplest thing to understand   the price is either in the money or it is n't by the way exactly at the money is not in the money an option that 's not in the money has time value only as the price rises and the option is more and more in the money the time value drops we have a $ 40 stock it makes sense to me that a $ 40 strike price is all just a bet the stock will rise there 's no intrinsic value the option prices at about $ 4.00 for one year out with 25 volatility but the strike of $ 30 is at $ with $ 10 in the money and only in time premium there 's a great calculator on line to tinker with   volatility is a key component of options trading think about it if a stock rises but rarely goes up any more or less just steady up why would you even buy an option that was even 10 out of the money the only way i can describe this is to look at a bell curve and how there 's a 1/6 chance the event will be above one standard deviation if that standard deviation is small the chance of hitting the higher strikes is also small   i wrote an article betting on apple at 9 to 2 in which i describe how a pair of option trades was set up so that a 35 rise in apple stock would return and apple had two years to reach its target i offer this as an example of options trading not being theory but something that many are engaged in what i found curious about the trade was that apple 's volatility was high enough that a 35 move did n't seem like the 4.5 to 1 risk the market said it was as of today apple needs to rise 13 in the next 10 months for the trade to pay off disclosure the long time to expiration was both good and bad two years to recover 35 seemed reasonable but 2 years could bring anything in the macro sense another recession some worldwide event that would impact apple 's market etc the average investor will not have the patience for these long term option trades

the problem is that short term trends are really unpredictable   there is nobody who can accurately predict where a fund or even moreso a single stock or bond is going to move in a few hours or days or even months the long term trends of the entire market however are more or less predictable   there is a definite upward bias when you look at time scales of 5 10 20 years and more   individual stocks and bonds may crash and different sectors perform differently from year to year but the market as a whole has historically always risen over long time scales of course past performance never guarantees future performance   it is possible that everything could crash and never come back but history shows that this would be incredibly unlikely   which is the entire basis for strategies based on buying and holding and periodically rebalancing a portfolio containing funds that cover all market sectors now regarding your 401(k you know your time horizon   the laws wo n't let you withdraw money without penalty until you reach retirement age this might be 40 years depending on your current age   so we 're definitely talking long term   you should n't care about where the market goes over a few months if you wo n't be using the money until 20 years from now the most important thing for a 401(k is to choose funds from those available to you that will be as diverse as possible   the actual allocation strategy is something you will need to work out with a financial advisor since it will be different for every person   once you come up with an appropriate allocation strategy you will want to buy according to those ratios with every paycheck and rebalance your funds to those ratios whenever they start to drift away   and review the ratios with your advisor every few years to keep them aligned with large scale trends and changes in your life

that 's a really good idea though in most cases like this the template letter is sufficient someone with legal expertise drafts a template letter with the that this letter will probably have the desired effect under a specific set of circumstances if this set of circumstances apply to you then you can print this letter out and send it   legally a properly worded denial by an individual is no different than the same denial written by a lawyer so unless someone has actually began litigation there 's rarely a necessity to seek legal advice and in most cases firing off a denial or a fuck off letter is more legally advantageous than silence so it might not even be worth it

typically this is not an option as the monthly payments are fixed it depends on the willingness of your financing bank for such a change you probably will have to refinance with them or another lender which is not a bad thing as you even can get a lower interest rate potentially as of jan 2017 this will change consider too it could be a better solution to instead invest the 25000 and use the investment returns to fill up the difference every month certainly more effort but you probably come out ahead financially

i do n't see a way that this would make matters worse than just giving them the credit card info except that it would make abusing the card easier at some other site or the bank if they have a similar unreasonably weak security by photo test still i 'd strongly recommend you use a separate card for this so you can cancel it without disrupting your other credit card uses   actually i 'd strongly recommend not doing business with folks who have already demonstrated questionable ethics but you seem to have made that decision

hi alex   i 've been alerted you 're seeking a better answer to this question   please accept my apologies for not coming back to this question sooner it got buried   no in general you can not make an early withdrawal penalty free from a 403(b account to use towards the purchase of a home withdrawals before age 59 1/2 are generally subject to the 10 early withdrawal penalty on top of ordinary income tax some 403(b plans may allow for a loan but the availability and conditions vary by plan if you 'd consider a loan you should check with your plan administrator or your plan 's summary plan description often available at one 's company intranet or hr web site   i do contract work for an hr consulting firm that assists others in building such sites and are usually something made available for download in a retirement or wealth section of such web sites note that a loan from a 403(b would need to be paid back into the plan over some period of time e.g. 5 years though i have come across examples of some plans that do permit a longer pay back period of 10 15 even 30 years if the loan is used for a home purchase   but consider this article the 403(b loan the new debtors prison finally to your last point   yes if you have an ira there are rules permitting withdrawal of up to $ 10,000 penalty free for use towards the purchase of a first home   see page 53 in irs publication 590   there 's also a good article at all about iras for first time home buyers such a withdrawal from a traditional ira remains subject to ordinary income tax   if have a roth ira you can withdraw free of income tax but you need to pay attention to the roth ira 5 year rule additional resources

it 's very very unlikely that you received a phone call at work with an incorrect birth date from an actual lending company that thinks it loaned you any money   it 's much more likely that you received a phone call at work from a collections agency that would have bought some loan from the aforementioned agency for pennies on the dollar   they would have been hunting around trying to find someone with your name who was born years earlier   it 's even more likely that this is some sort of phishing scam   if you 're worried you can check your credit rating but it is likely that you can safely ignore the situation   if they call back ask for thorough details about the credit card   if they 're a real collections agency and for some reason they wo n't leave you alone iirc the most course of action is to hire a lawyer to send them a cease and letter

you can if the market is open in a normal trading phase no auction phase works and there is an existing bid or offer on the product you want to trade at the time the market learns of your order keep in mind there are 2 prices bid and offer if the current bid and current offer were the same it would immediately result in a trade and thus the bid and offer are no longer the same market makers are paid given lower fees in order to maintain buy and sell prices called quotes at most times these conditions are usually all true but commonly fail for these reasons most markets have an order type of market order that says buy sell at any price there are still sanity checks put in place on the price with the exact rules for valid prices depending on the stock so unless it 's a penny stock you wo n't suddenly pay ten times a stock 's value the amount you can buy sell is limited by the quantity that exists on the bid and offer if there is a bid or offer the quantity is always at least 1

it 's tempting to think of a corporation as a real thing because in many respects it seems to be but it is n't a thing despite the root word of the name it may own things and employ people but it is not itself a real thing borrowing heavily from prof joseph heath it might be better to think of a corporation as the nexus of four separate entities investors who provide capital employees who do the work suppliers who provide raw material etc and customers who purchase the products or services the corporation buys in different organizations the owners are different in co ops it 's the suppliers mutual insurance companies the customers in employee owned companies the employees but in 90 of cases including monsanto it 's the investors the investors who provided capital by buying shares of stock are the owners and will be compensated this frequently happens indirectly you may own monsanto stock through a mutual fund or other such aggregate which means that your mutual fund will get the money whether that winds up being a profit or loss is more complicated

i have n't seen any of the other answers address this point shares are a form of ownership of a company and thus they are an entitlement to the proceeds of the company including proceeds from liquidation imagine an extreme contrived example whereby you own shares in a company that is explicitly intended to only exist for a finite and definite period say to serve as the producers of a one time event consider a possible sequence of major events in this company 's life so why would the shares of this hypothetical company be worth anything because the company itself is worth something or rather the stuff that the company owns is worth something even or in my example especially in the event of its dissolution or liquidation besides just the stuff that a company owns why else would owning a portion of a company be a good idea i.e. why would i pay for such a privilege buying shares of a company is a good idea if you believe and are correct that a company will make larger profits or capture more value e.g. buy and control more valuable stuff than other people believe if your beliefs do n't significantly differ from others then ideally the price of the companies stock should reflect all of the future value that everyone expects it to have tho that value is discounted based on time preference i.e. how much more valuable a given amount of money or a given thing of value is today versus some time in the future some notes on time preference but apart from whether you should buy shares in a specific company owning shares can still be valuable not only are shares a claim on a company 's current assets in the event of liquidation but they are also claims on all future assets of the company so if a company is growing then the value of shares now should reflect the discounted future value of the company not just the value of its assets today if shares in a company pays dividends then the company gives you money for owning shares you already understand why that 's worth something it 's basically equivalent to an annuity tho dividends are much more likely to stop or change whereas the whole point of an annuity is that it 's a sometimes fixed amount paid at fixed intervals i.e. reliable and dependable as cqm points out in their answer part of the value of stock shares to those that own them and especially to those considering buying them is the expectation or belief that they can sell those shares for a greater price than what they paid for them irrespective of the true value of the stock shares but even in a world where everyone magically had the same knowledge always a significant component of a stock 's value is independent of its value as a source of trading profit as jesse points out in their answer part of the value of stocks that do n't pay dividends relative to stocks that do is due to the potential differences in tax liabilities incurred between dividends and long term capital gains this however is not the primary source of value of a stock share
# 468047
do n't let tax considerations be the main driver that 's generally a bad idea you should keep tax in mind when making the decision but do n't let it be the main reason for an action selling the higher priced shares possibly at a loss even i think    it 's ok to do that and it does n't necessarily have to be fifo it is ok to do that but consider also the term long term gain has much lower taxes than short term gain and short term loss will be offsetting long term gain means you can lose some of the potential tax benefit any potential related to buying a home that can offset capital gains no and anyway if you 're buying a personal residence a home for yourself there 's nothing to write off except for the mortgage interest and property taxes of course selling other investments for a capital loss to offset this sale again why sell at a loss anything related to retirement accounts e.g. i think i recall being able to take a loan from your retirement account in order to buy a home you can take a loan and you can also withdraw up to 10 k without a penalty if conditions are met bottom line be prepared to pay the tax on the gains and check how much it is going to be roughly you can apply previous year refund to the next year to mitigate the shock you can put some money aside and you can raise your salary withholding to make sure you 're not hit with a high bill and penalties next april after you do that as long as you keep in mind the tax bill and put aside an amount to pay it you 'll be fine i see no reason to sell at loss or pay extra interest to someone just to reduce the nominal amount of the tax if you 're selling at loss you 're losing money if you 're selling at gain and paying tax you 're earning money even if the earnings are reduced by the tax

congrats you pulled some irrelevant statistics no where in your response does it verify your claim that the majority of small businesses are n't turning a profit and many small businesses do have a multiple stakeholders   since we are on the subject do you know how large a company can be and still be classified as a small business    it is 500 1,000 or 1,500 employees depending on the industry five hundred employees is not exactly small   oh by the way i 've worked for multiple small businesses under 100 employees and they 've had owners stakeholders investors a board of directors etc on top of all of the employees not every small business is some mom and pop company of 5 15 employees   gt;then put your money where your mouth is and get out there and create some jobs   hahaha this has nothing to do with the discussion but whatever dude if we were both to start our own companies i 'd actually value my workers and you would just complain about labor costs of the people that are needed to run your business   here is the thing i do n't consider creating minimum wage jobs as true job creation because the tax payer is still footing the bill if the company is n't paying a live able news work enough to keep you off welfare and food the majority of people on welfare are working families see same link so what good is job creation of minimum wage positions if the people that work them still have to rely on the government   think about this if we were to remove the minimum wage and i could pay someone $ 1 and hour i could create jobs but we all know that is asinine because no one could live on that yet the same thing happens at the federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 and people like you do n't see that there is no difference between the two examples in both scenarios people still do n't make enough to live without some assistance

i 've done various side work over the years computer consulting writing and i briefly had a video game company so i 've gone through most of this disclaimer i have never been audited which may mean that everything i put on my tax forms looked plausible to the irs and so is probably at least generally right but it also means that the irs has never put their stamp of approval on my tax forms so that said 1 you do not need to form an llc to be able to claim business expenses whether you have any expenses or not you will have to complete a schedule c. on this form are places for expenses in various categories note that the categories are the most common type of expenses there 's an other space if you have something different if you have any property that is used both for the business and also for personal use you must calculate a business use percentage for example if you bought a new printer and 60 of the time you use it for the business and 40 of the time you use it for personal stuff then 60 of the cost is tax deductible in general the irs expects you to calculate the percentage based on amount of time used for business versus personal though you are allowed to use other allocation formulas like for a printer i think you 'd get away with number of pages printed for each but if the business use is not 100 you must keep records to justify the percentage you ca n't just say oh i think business use must have been about 3/4 of the time you have to have a log where you write down every time you use it and whether it was business or personal also the irs is very suspicious of business use of cars and computers because these are things that are readily used for personal purposes if you own a copper mine and you buy a mine boring machine odds are you are n't going to take that home to dig in your backyard but a computer can easily be used to play video games or send emails to friends and relatives and lots of things that have nothing to do with a business so if you 're going to claim a computer or a car be prepared to justify it you can claim office use of your home if you have one or more rooms or designated parts of a room that are used regularly and exclusively for business purposes that is if you turn the family room into an office you can claim home office expenses but if like me you sit on the couch to work but at other times you sit on the couch to watch tv then the space is not used exclusively for business purposes also the irs is very suspicious of home office deductions i 've never tried to claim it it 's legal just make sure you have all your ducks in a row if you claim it skip 2 for the moment 3 yes you must pay taxes on your business income if you have not created an llc or a corporation then your business income is added to your wage income to calculate your taxes that is if you made say $ 50,000 salary working for somebody else and $ 10,000 on your side business then your total income is $ 60,000 and that 's what you pay taxes on the total amount you pay in income taxes will be the same regardless of whether 90 came from salary and 10 from the side business or the other way around the rates are the same it 's just one total number if the withholding on your regular paycheck is not enough to cover the total taxes that you will have to pay then you are required by law to pay estimated taxes quarterly to make up the difference if you do n't you will be required to pay penalties so you do n't want to skip on this basically you are supposed to be withholding from yourself and sending this in to the government it 's possible that this wo n't be an issue if you 're used to getting a big refund and the refund is more than what the tax on your side business will come to then you might end up still getting a refund just a smaller one but you do n't want to guess about this get the tax forms and figure out the numbers i think and please do n't rely on this check on it that the law says that you do n't pay a penalty if the total tax that was withheld from your paycheck plus the amount you paid in estimated payments is more than the tax you owed last year so like lets say that this year just to make up some numbers your employer withheld $ 4,000 from your paychecks at the end of the year you did your taxes and they came to $ 3,000 so you got a $ 1,000 refund this year your employer again withholds $ 4,000 and you paid $ 0 in estimated payments your total tax on your salary plus your side business comes to $ 4,500 you owe $ 500 but you wo n't have to pay a penalty because the $ 4,000 withheld is more than the $ 3,000 that you owed last year but if next year you again do n't make estimated payment so you again have $ 4,000 withheld plus $ 0 estimated and then you owe $ 5,000 in taxes you will have to pay a penalty because your withholding was less than what you owed last year to you had paid $ 500 in estimated payments you 'd be okay you 'd still owe $ 500 but you would n't owe a penalty because your total payments were more than the previous year 's liability clear as mud do n't forget that you probably will also owe state income tax if you have a local income tax you 'll owe that too scott mentioned self employment tax you 'll owe that too note that self employment tax is different from income tax self employment tax is just social security tax on self employed people you 're probably used to seeing the percent it is these days withheld from your paycheck that 's really only half your social security tax the other half is not shown on your pay stub because it is not subtracted from your salary if you 're self employed you have to pay both halves or about 15 you file a form se with your income taxes to declare it 4 if you pay your quarterly estimated taxes well the point of estimated taxes is that it 's supposed to be close to the amount that you will actually owe next april 15 so if you get it at least close then you should n't owe a lot of money in april i usually try to arrange my taxes so that i get a modest refund do n't loan the government a lot of money but do n't owe anything april 15 either once you take care of any business expenses and taxes what you do with the rest of the money is up to you right though if you 're unsure of how to spend it let me know and i 'll send you the address of my kids colleges and you can donate it to their tuition fund i think this would be a very worthy and productive use of your money back to 2 i just recently acquired a financial advisor i ca n't say what a good process for finding one is this guy is someone who goes to my church and who me after bible study one day to make his sales pitch but i did talk to him about his fees and what he told me was this if i have enough money in an investment account then he gets a commission from the investment company for bringing the business to them and that 's the total compensation he gets from me that commission comes out of the management fees they charge and those management fees are in the same ballpark as the fees i was paying for private investment accounts so basically he is not costing me anything he 's getting his money from the kickbacks he said that if i had not had enough accumulated assets he would have had to charge me an hourly fee i did n't ask how much that was had n't meant to write such a long answer

the simple answer is technically bonds do n't have earnings hence no p e. what i think the op is really asking how do i compare stock and bond etfs some mature stocks exhibit very similar characteristics to bonds so at the margin if you are considering investing between 2 such investments that provide stable income in the form of dividends you might want to use the dividend price ratio d p of the stock and compare it to the dividend yield of the bond if you go down to the basics both the bond and the stock can be considered   the present value of all future expected cashflows the cash that accrues to the owner of the stock is future dividends and for the bond is the coupon payments if a company were to pay out 100 of its earnings then the dividend yield d p would be conveniently e p. for a company with p e of 20 that paid out it 's entire earnings one would expect d p = 1/20 = 5 this serves as a decent yard stick in the short term ~ 1 year to compare mature stock etfs with stable prospects vs bond funds since the former will have very little expected price growth think utilities hence they both compete on the cashflows they throw off to the investor this comparison stops being useful for stock etfs with higher growth prospects since expected future cashflows are much more volatile this comparison is also not valid in the long term since bond etfs are highly sensitive to the yield curve interest rate risk and they can move substantially from where they are now

you have not specified what country you are in that radically changes everything in case you are in canada there 's a great blog that covers bankruptcy and student loans at loan fundamentally in order to discharge government backed student loans you must have ceased to be a student for at least seven years prior to filing even then though the government can object in which case you will still have to repay some or all of the loan more generally given that the collection agency appears to be operating in bad faith you 'll want to ensure that they send you written documentation of any offer they are extending you if they refuse to do this you should assume that they are n't actually offering you anything at all and you will have to pay back the full amount plus interest and penalties note that in many countries if you settle the debt that is pay anything less than the full amount plus interest and penalties this will be a black mark on your credit report in this case if you repaid the full $ 16,000 and they the extra $ 4,000 they would most likely still add a note to your credit report indicating that you did not pay the full amount that you owed and this will negatively impact your credit rating even beyond your late payments

bankruptcy should be your last option and you will find that bk will not resolve most of your problems and create many more problems there are two kinds of bk that are available to the average person debt repayment and liquidation   both have severe repercussions and lasting effects on your credit 7 10 years after discharge and the calculations required under the 2005 are complex and may require help to understand liquidation is the more severe course and the trustee would liquidate assets that exceed exemptions vary by state to pay your creditors debt repayment is hard and only 20 25 of those who pursue that route complete the debt repayment plan   your credit score for either course would suffer greatly 200 250 points and would remain reduced for years especially since you would have to rebuild credit and the law is flawed both in design and execution as there is no reward for successful debt repayment few finish their repayment plan 20 25 the mean recovery for unsecured creditors in repayment is zero thus does not help creditors and leaves the debtor with damaged credit for years not a fresh start although you may have made some decisions that have placed you in a difficult position you can find solutions to resolve these problems you may find that simply learning to make better choices will improve your situation take a financial education course such as the dave ramsey course and learn how to budget and make better choices the website offers a simple way to budget by dividing budgeting into only three 3 categories with suggested percentages for each essentials < 50 financial priorities > 20 and lifestyle < 30 the damage to your credit from the derogatory effects of bk would for years but the damage from poor payment history declines much quicker and loses most of the effect after 2 years and should you keep the accounts open leaves you with good history and longer account history thus the effects decline to minimal after as little as 2 years of good behavior payment history make a plan that the debts and how you will resolve the problem and work the plan   based upon the income and debts you mention the situation you have may not be as bad as it appears you may be getting bad advice especially from a debt settlement company that might be more interested in their fees than in your problem since you want to play fair and continue with payments but when people start to get greedy like this i am ready to just stop caring you really need two things a plan and a friend someone who you can talk to honestly and openly and who can support you as you work through the plan you make since you would prefer the option that will give me the most peace of mind and allow me to start saving money as soon as possible you need to find an approach that fits your goals   your statement that you do n't plan on ever using credit again fits with the dave ramsey philosophy and with many of us who have learned that those who grant credit are often harsh masters now that you have provided more information the advice below expands upon the above reflecting upon your specific situation since you make $ year you may be close to the median income and the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 has a presumption of abuse for filing when you have above median income for your state check the law as you may be pushed into debt repayment anyway examine what you could do to repay the debt over 5 years 60 months as that would be a repayment duration since you have $ 8 k of revolving unsecured debt that would be repaid in over 60 months at about $ no interest but you would also be paying 10 to the trustee   there might be some portion of your auto debt which is unsecured and also be repaid unsecured suppose that is $ 3000   that would add another $ 50/month to the plan the car could be repaid over 60 months including interest so you might be repaying $ 300/month for the car estimate although the payment could be higher or lower depending upon how much of the value of the car is unsecured   the trustee might object that the car is too expensive depends upon the value and the trustee and require be liquidated

members of the federal reserve system keep track of what money a bank has if it 's not in the vault who owns what shares of stock who owns what bond etc the part of the federal reserve system that tracks stock ownership is the depository trust company dtc they have a group of subsidiaries that settle various types of security transactions dtc is a member of the u.s. federal reserve system a limited purpose    trust company under new york state banking law and a registered    clearing agency with the securities and exchange commission there 's lots of information on their website describing this process 's subsidiary the depository trust company dtc established in    1973 was created to reduce costs and provide clearing and settlement    efficiencies by securities and making book entry    changes to ownership of the securities dtc provides securities    movements for 's net and settlement for institutional    trades which typically involve money and securities transfers between    custodian banks and broker dealers as well as money market    instruments black pools are trades done where the price is not shared with the market but the dtc is the one who keeps track of who owns which shares they have records of all net the dtc is the counterparty for transactions when stock moves from one entity to another the dtc is involved as the central counterparty for the nation 's major exchanges and    markets clears and settles virtually all broker to broker equity 1 this is the link that shows that settlements are reported on a net basis 2 if broker a sells 1000 shares of something to broker b at 8 and then five minutes later broker b sells the 1000 shares back to a you can not be sure that that total volume will be recorded no net trading took place and there would be fees to pay for no reason if they reported both trades note in dark pool trading quite often the two parties do n't know each other for shares book keeping records to be exchanged it has to be done through a clearing house

the home owner does not start foreclosure the bank decides when to foreclose   therefore you can not really decide a time to foreclose if you are trying to time the decision the process you miss payments and the banks will send you a late notice for the missing payments   expect many notices the bank will call you at home on your cell phone and at work   they will mail you letters regarding the missing payments if you continue to miss payments the bank will probably demand the loan be paid in full   you will owe the bank the full balance of the principle all past due interest all past due late charges and junk fees   the bank wo n't even take a normal monthly payment from you should you try to pay your regular payment again some law enforcement will notify you on the bank 's intent to foreclose   the bank has begun legal proceedings legal notices are published in the local newspaper soon the notices and the legal waiting period will expire   court proceedings happen   the court will then allow the bank to foreclose notices to into the paper again about the updated status of the foreclosure the house is sold at auction money from the auction is used to pay taxes owned then mortgages then other liens or creditors who file further debt for the home owner taxes when sold if the mortgage debt exceeds the home 's fair market value us federal tax rules say the selling price as the fair market value the fair market value can still be higher than the tax basis which i think is the value of the house at the time of original purchase plus improvements    if the fair market value is higher you will own taxes on sale   however tax rules in the us say if you have owned the home more than two years and make less than $ 250,000 in the transaction $ 500,000 if married you will not owe any tax   state taxes can be different additionally if the mortgage lender the debt and does n't create a deficiency that income is taxable as well   this is more an more common these days   there are exceptions if the home is your primary residence this whole process an take several months to occur but depends on where you live   if you continue to live in the home after the auction the new owner must evict you from the property which is another set of legal proceedings your credit and ability to buy are home will be damaged for the next several years i am not so sure on how pmi works for the banks but i know they are getting some money back

personally i avoid making business deals with friends and relatives there 's just too much of a possibility that things can go wrong   let 's assume that you 're honest people and you have no intention of cheating your mother in law still all sorts of things could happen that could make it difficult for you to repay the loan you could lose your job you could get some big medical expense etc then what happens then your financial problems become family problems there 's a strong temptation when people borrow from relatives to make paying the loan the lowest priority in their budget i know i promised to pay per month but things are really tight right now and mom should understand maybe she does understand and can manage without it but maybe not and then it becomes a family fight you promised you 'd pay it back and we will we 're having a hard time right now ca n't you just give us a break etc or she might have some extra expense and say hey ca n't you pay a little more this month i really need some extra cash i 'm sorry we 're struggling just to make the regular payments we ca n't well i was willing to loan you all this money the least you could do is pay me back when i need it etc you can end up ruining family relationships over money your wife can find herself in the position of having to choose whether to side with her mother or her husband etc i 'm sure plenty of people do things like this and it works out just great but there are big risks and by the way apparently this was your idea not your mother in laws i wonder what her reaction is is she eager to help out her daughter and son in law and had nothing in particular to do with the money anyway or is she feeling very imposed on it 's one thing to ask relatives to let you borrow their car for the weekend asking someone to loan you $ 50,000 is a very big request if one of my kids asked me to loan them $ 50,000 from my retirement fund i 'd consider that a very presumptuous request unless they needed the money for life saving surgery for my or some such

i found the best way to do this was to make a spending plan at the beginning of the month with someone else if you 're married or in a relationship where you pool resources then this is a natural way to sync up on your expectations if you do n't have a relationship of that nature it 's still good to have a friend that you talk to about things you are planning on buying if i do n't allow myself to buy things on a whim if i have to take the time to justify my purchases to someone else then i have to first think about the purchase and justify it to myself often the actual process of thinking it through is enough for me to talk myself out of it consider the tactics of car salesmen each time you attempt to leave the lot to think about it overnight they sweeten the offer to try to get you to buy before leaving they know that if you leave the lot you are much less likely to decide that you must have that car you should have a policy of sleeping for one night before making any purchase over an arbitrary dollar amount say $ 250 or $ 500 or $ 1,000 having that rule and following it will save you a lot of buyers remorse as an aside i 've had my eye on a 35 mm prime lens for my camera for over a year now i was ready to pay ~$500 for a nice lens that was discounted by $ 100 and i was a little sad that i missed the discount however i am very deliberate in my shopping and i did n't want to buy until i read enough of the reviews to be certain about it it turns out that the lens has a fatal flaw for landscape photography that most reviewers did n't notice because they were using it for portrait photography i finally concluded that the lens i really wanted was an $ 800 lens i looked at resale prices on my $ 600 lens and they are in the $ 350 range so instead of missing out on a $ 100 discount i missed out on a $ 150 loss trading up to the lens that i really want for the long term

if there are no dependents there is no need for life insurance   you mention getting insurance when it is not needed to protect you against some future risk if you have a policy and a disease crops up that would normally make you un you can keep your insurance for the rest of the term the cost for this would be very high you would have to have a term that would last decades to cover you until some future child is out of college if you never have somebody that depends on you for income there never is a need for life insurance

you 're forgetting the fundamental issue that you never have to actually exercise the options you buy   you can either sell them to someone else or if they 're out of the money let them expire and take the loss it is n't uncommon at all for people to buy both a put and call option this is a straddle when the strike price of both the put and call are the same from investopedia.com a straddle is an options strategy in which the investor holds a position in both a call and put with the same strike price and expiration date paying both premiums this strategy allows the investor to make a profit regardless of whether the price of the security goes up or down assuming the stock price changes somewhat significantly    read more straddle

when investing small amounts you should consider the substantial toll that commissions will take on your investment in your case $ 800 placed in just one etf will incur commissions of about $ 8 each way or a total of 2 of your investment i suggest you wait until you have at least $ 5000 to invest in stocks or etfs since this is in a ira your options are limited but perhaps you may qualify for a vanguard mutual fund which will not charge commissions and will have annual expenses only a trivial amount higher than the corresponding etf it should probably go in a mixed allocation fund and since you are young it should be a relatively aggressive one mutual funds will also allow you to contribute small amounts over time without incurring any extra fees

your idea is a good one but as usual the devil is in the details and implementation might not be as easy as you think   the comments on the question have pointed out your steps 2 and 4 are   not necessarily the best way of doing things and that perhaps   keeping the principal   amount invested in the same fund instead of taking it all out and re investing it in a similar but different fund might be better the other points for you to consider are as follows how do you identify which of the thousands of conventional mutual   funds and etfs is the average risk high gain mutual fund into which you will place your initial investment   broadly speaking most actively managed mutual fund with average risk are likely to give you   less than average gains over long periods of time   the   unfortunate truth to which many pay only service is that   x% of actively managed mutual funds   in a specific category failed   to beat the average gain of all funds in that category or the   corresponding index e.g. s&p 500 index for large stock mutual funds over the past n years where x is generally between 70 and   100 and n is 5 10 15 etc   indeed one of the arguments in   favor of investing in a very low cost index fund is that you are effectively guaranteed the average gain or loss do n't forget the possibility of loss this of course is also the argument used against investing in index funds   why invest in boring index funds and settle for average gains at essentially no risk of not getting the average performance average performance is close to guaranteed when you can   get much more out of your investments by investing in a fund that is among the funds that had better than average returns   the difficulty is that which funds are x rated and which non x rated i.e. rated g = good or pg = pretty good is known only in hindsight whereas what you need is foresight as everyone will tell you past performance does not guarantee future results   as someone john bogle said   when you invest in a mutual fund you are in the position of a in you can see where you have been but not where you are going   in summary implementation of your strategy needs a good crystal ball to look into the future there is no such things as a guaranteed bond fund they also have risks though not necessarily the same as in a stock mutual fund you need to have a plan b in mind in case your chosen mutual fund takes a longer time than expected to return the 10 gain that you want to use to trigger profit taking and investment of the gain into a low risk bond fund and also maybe a plan c in case the of the market cause your chosen mutual fund to have negative return for some time what is the exit strategy

here in the uk the rule of thumb is to keep a lot of equity in your home if you can i assume here that you have a lot of savings you 're considering using if you only have say 10 of the house price you would n't actually have a lot of choice in the matter the mortgage lender will penalise you heavily for low deposits the practical minimum is 5 but for most people a 95 mortgage is just silly albeit not as silly as the 100 or greater mortgages you could get and you should take serious individual advice before considering it according to which the average in the uk for first time buyers is 20 not the best source for that data i confess but a convenient one above 20 is not at all unusual you 'll do an affordability calculation to figure out how much you can borrow which is n't at all the same as how much you should borrow but does get you started basically you decide how much a month you can spend on mortgage payments the calculation will let you put every penny into this if you choose to but in practice you 'll want some discretionary income so do n't do that decide the term of the mortgage for a young first time buyer in the uk i think you 'd typically take a 25-year term and consider early repayment options rather than committing to a shorter term but you do n't have to mortgage lenders will offer shorter terms as long as you can afford the payments decide how much you 're putting into a deposit make for cost of moving stamp duty if applicable fees aka people to your stuff receive back a number which is the house price you can pay under these constraints and of course a breakdown of what the mortgage principle would be and the interest rate you 'll pay this step requires access to lender information since their rates depend on personal details deposit percentage phase of the moon etc our mortgage advisor did multiple runs of the calculation for us for different scenarios since we had n't made up our minds entirely since you have not yet decided how much deposit to make you can use multiple calculations to see the effect of different deposits you might make up to a limit of your total savings putting up more deposit both increases the amount you can borrow for a given monthly payment since mortgage rates are lower when the loan is a lower proportion of house value and of course increases the house price you can afford so unless you 're getting a very high return on your savings £ 1 of deposit gets you somewhat more than £ 1 of house and the calculation will tell you how much more once you 've chosen the house you want the matter is even simpler do you prefer to put your savings in the house and borrow less and make lower payments or prefer to put your savings elsewhere and borrow more and make higher payments but perhaps have some additional income from the savings assuming you maintain a contingency fund a lower mortgage is generally considered a good investment in the uk but you need to check what 's right for you and compare it to other investments you could make the issue is complicated by the fact that residential property prices are rising quite quickly in most areas of the uk and have been for a long time meaning that highly leveraged property investment appears to be a really good idea this leads to the imprudent but tempting conclusion that you should buy the biggest house you can possibly afford and watch its value rises i do not endorse this advice personally but it 's certainly true that in a sharply rising house market it 's easier to get away with buying a bigger house than you need than it is to get away with it in a flat or falling market as stephen says an offset mortgage is a no brainer good idea if the rate is the same unfortunately in the uk the rate is n't the same or anyway it was n't a couple of years ago offset mortgages are especially good for those who make a lot of savings from income and for any reason do n't want to commit all of those savings to a traditional mortgage payment good reasons for not wanting to do that include uncertainty about your future income and a desire to have the flexibility to actually spend some of it if you fancy

yes you tell them   i can say that i pay cash for all my cars and always get cars for lower than the low end   there are basically two steps go test drive negotiate fully leave unless you are given a mind blowing offer   this may take you one to many dealerships   it depends on how well you know what car you want and how much a dealership will negotiate    you pick a night that another dealership that specifically has the car you want or multiple even better is open and you go in 30 45 mins before they close    paying cash is key for this to work   by the time you get to numbers they will be almost closed   their finance guy might be gone so you will get your salesman and a manager   i will use my last car as an example   toyota 2015 with   at with a good deal at   i simply talked to my sales guy said i would like to walk out with the car tonight   i have already talked to xyz dealership and they offered me which is already below low price    i asked for $   boom 10 minutes later car bought at cash is king   the sales guy and manager will bite the bullet on profit for ease of sale   going in late is the key to using the cash   you do n't have the finance guys jumping in and you have less people to move through   also they know they have limited time to deal and if you walk off the lot there is less than 10 chance of you coming back they want to close   they are making minimal profit but doing minimal work   with cash your sales guy is on your side because you are basically throwing him a couple hundred dollars at the end of a shift where most would just be sitting around watching tv some other tips be fair   if they would have said is our lowest that we can go and that 's it   i probably would have still got the car   dealerships will tell you their lowest price if you are close and you are still below it since they did n't show me their lowest price i did n't budge much but still a bit to show good sport    they brought their invoice number out to show that at that they were going to lose $ 1500 on the car   i made the manager laugh because my response was to bring up kbb and show the used car price for the car which was minus $ 2000   so i just said well you lost $ 1500 but i lose $ 2000 driving this off the lot   i then went back to $ to meet in the middle of losing money   this actually closed the deal   anyway do n't ever believe any piece of paper they show you with numbers   these dealerships get monthly bonuses on sales and that is a lot of their profit past selling your trade in if you actually value your money you would never be trading in a car to a dealer so if you are paying cash sell your own car or at least take it to a place like carmax which i do n't endorse but better than dealer

many people assume that if the price of something is $ 10 and they have 1,000 of that thing they should expect to be able to sell them for something around $ 10,000   such an assumption may hold much of the time but it does n't always   worse the cases where it fails to hold are often those where it would be relied upon most heavily   such an assumption should thus be considered dangerous in a liquid market the quantity of a something that people would be willing to buy at something close to the market price will be large relative to the quantity that people would seek to sell in the short term   if at some moment in time one person in the market was willing to immediately buy 500 shares at $ 9.98 and another was willing to immediately buy 750 at $ someone seeking to sell 1,000 shares could immediately receive $ for them selling 500 to the first person and 500 to the second who would then be ready to buy 250 more from the first person who was willing to sell for $   such behavior would be in line with what many people 's assumptions in an illiquid market however the quantity of something that people would be willing to buy near market price could be surprisingly low   this is more often a problem in the marketplace of things like collectibles than of stocks but the same thing can happen in the stock market   if there 's one potential buyer for a stock who thinks it 's overpriced but has potential and would be worth $ 9.50 but that person only has $ 950 to spend and nobody else thinks the stock would be worth more than $ then until people sold a total of 100 shares the price would be $ 9.50 but after that the price would drop instantly to $ 0.02   there would be no of the fall   if the person with 1,000 shares was first in line he 'd get to sell 100 shares for $ 950 to the aforementioned seller but would be unable to get more than $ 18 for the remaining 900 a major danger with markets is that markets which are perceived as liquid attract people to the buying side while those which are seen as illiquid people   the danger in the latter is obvious having people flee a seemingly illiquid market will reduce its liquidity further but the former is just as bad   having people flock to a market because of its perceived liquidity will increase its liquidity but can also create a false price floor causing demand to appear much stronger than it actually is   unless real demand increases to match the false price floor the people who buy at the higher price will never be able to recoup their investment

another way to look at this is if we separate the owner 's account from the business 's account   at the start of the year the owner puts $ 9 into the business account to get the business started at the end of the first day the business account has $ 10 and at the end of the second day the business account has $ 11   the owner does n't need to add any more of his own money into the business account at the end of the day the business will have $ which is $ 365 profit + $ 9 investment   assuming the business has no other expenses the business will calculate profit for the year like this the author is making a strange point the two numbers he is talking about are two different quantities the business owner 's return on investment is $ 365 $ 9 =   but the business 's profit margin is $ 365 $ = 10   both are useful numbers when running the business i disagree with the author 's that a business is doing something tricky when calculating profit margin remember that in addition to the business owner 's monetary investment he worked every day for a year to earn that $ 365

well i am an lessor under dha properties dha lost it identity as a govt agency and try to imitate a worst not the best real agent every year rental valuation is a drama or waste of time and money to lessor they pull down the rent by 10 to 22 and ask for a secondary valuation for no reasons they do n't even agree with market evidence and start bullying or black mailing tactics to force you to a below market rent or the threat of third review a very expensive review shared 50 by lessor and rest the poor tax payers the review also badly influenced by dha by submitting biased valuations and thereby destroying the independence of valuation the api appointed neither follow the dha nor the api guide and also ignore the market reality and take the average rent for the area you also 14 to 18 as management fees paid to dha selling also a problem and its high time the and the in charge of the dha must institute an independent investigation to expose the potential nexus between the and the dha and how the lessor a self funded retiree pensioners and others i already a complaint with ombudsman and waiting for a reply there are 14 all in a private street only dha leased property in that street near ray rd that are leased to dha for more than 10 years please note most of those almost lost $ 10000 per year because dha under cut the rent to them when they paid me the market rent for many years dha by mistake send the rent paid to all we have called for the details of rent paid to all the 14 in that private street from 2008 under the freedom of information act and waiting

gt a dcf works with whatever cash flows you are willing to forecast if you have extreme skepticism about those gt forecasts then you can either adjust them run sensitivity analyses or use a significantly higher discount rate gt or all three all of those approaches will help you establish upper and lower bounds for a valuation   the amount of uncertainty you have makes the upper and lower bounds insanely wide even choosing an appropriate discount rate is non trivial   gt so what you 're saying is that facebook can forecast that by acquiring snapchat they 're able to keep x users gt for y period of time but they then ca n't make the next logical leap to figure out how to apply a profit revenue gt factor to those user numbers in order to create a suitable dcf   why would they waste their time with a dcf sure you can calculate incremental value saved or a hundred different metrics but at the end of the day this is a bet that you only get to make once it would be very tough to gamble with any degree of statistical confidence here   if they got to buy 100 they might be able to do something but in this context it 's a clear bet on strategy and it 's that   forecasting future cashflows is notoriously difficult even with stable firms trying this with a new firm that 's practically a venture bet would be a waste of everyone 's time   zuckerberg made a $ bet that this company would allow them to stay in peoples lives online and that can be sold to advertisers

maybe you can explain their position   it seems to me they should be in favor of   1 universal healthcare public or private for the reduced uncertainty and increased mobility to the working class    2 ending government subsidies of things like energy and farming so that the markets will properly transition and adjust based on the economic realities rather than manipulated markets    3 copyright reform to enable easier access to aged content by creators and the public at large including the creation of new businesses 4 infrastructure investments that fuel growth in the forms of market development and market access    5 industry based for things like waste management a la germany to preclude the need for the government to dictate the standards and practices while actually dealing with the problem   but as far as i have seen they are opposed to all of these things     for example in 1 above what i 've seen is that business likes to have the upper hand in the employer employee equation they like when employees ca n't up and leave because the children would lose health care   but the same informational that enable capitalism to function to their benefit are stifled in that case preventing the employment market from properly equalizing     to put it another way barriers to entry to prevent people from competing with you sounds great but it usually bites you your investors and everyone else in the ass because your products services are stagnant and you are n't competing   why do the so called fiscal conservatives seem to be okay with ass biting externalities and artificial barriers to entry

your math is correct if you take the same amount of pre tax wages assuming that that amount can be fully contributed in both traditional and roth cases and assuming the same flat tax rate when contributing and withdrawing then the two are the same however we do n't have a flat tax and due to the way our tax brackets work there is often a slight advantage to traditional accounts recall that not every dollar of your income is taxed at the same rate the tax bracket only describes the rate that the last dollar of your income is taxed at but some of your income will be taxed at lower brackets no matter what your income is your first $ x of income will be taxed at 10 then $ y at 15 etc so what is the tax rate of the dollars of income that you used to contribute to a retirement account is it the first dollars of income the last dollars of income or what since we are comparing an after tax contribution roth versus a pre tax contribution traditional whose income does n't show up in taxable income and all other income is equal the dollars contributed is considered to come from the top in the roth case similarly when you withdraw in the traditional case the withdrawal counts as income is it the first dollar of income or the last dollar of income again since we are comparing the situation where the withdrawal counts as income traditional with the one where it does n't roth all other income being equal the taxable income is considered to be added to the top the difference is that when you contribute to a retirement account you contribute a very small percentage of your income every year probably no more than 5 10 if we count down from the top this small percentage of your income probably falls wholly within a bracket in other words the taxable income in traditional and roth cases are likely in the same bracket so the entire contribution is at the same rate your marginal rate the rate you cite as your tax bracket however when you withdraw in retirement it is likely that every year the retirement account withdrawals account for a large percentage of your income maybe even half or more if we count down from the top this large percentage of your income probably crosses into lower brackets in other words the taxable income in traditional and roth cases are likely to be in different brackets so the withdrawal is partly taxed at one rate partly taxed at another so if your tax bracket is 15 in the traditional case it 's likely that your withdrawal is taxed partly at 15 and partly at 10 so in this case the average tax rate on the withdrawal is lower than your bracket

agreed it is n't fair but large businesses multinationals will always have the advantage of choosing which legal jurisdiction to do business in   this creates an incentive for such loopholes in order to attract the businesses to do business there at all   it needs to be harder for legislators to write such specialized tax laws as the more complex specialized the tax law becomes the more unfair it inevitably turns out

i had this happen to me with parking ticket when i was still in school   the tickets were issued by the school police and later dismissed because i had purchased a year long parking pass   3 years later i got a letter alleging that i had unpaid parking ticket   so they lost the record of dismissal   but they did not lose the record of having issued the ticket    i am fairly certain this happens because legal entities either lose electronic records and restore data from backups without realizing that some corrupted data remains lost or because they transition to a new system and certain real world events do n't get transferred properly to the new system   of course the people with whom you end up interacting at that point have no idea of any potential technical problems because they may occur only in some technical one off cases   in my case i was able to show that i had received a judgement of dismissal   i actually kept the paperwork the question is what do you do if you lost the records and the state had lost all electronic records of your payments   let 's assume the collections agency has a record produced by the state that you owed the ticket amount but the state claims that no record exists of you having paid the tickets   what do you do then carefully compile the list of all possible banks which you could have possibly used   then request duplicate statements from all the banks which you have on that list   assuming you were a regular consumer and not running a business this should not amount to more than 100 pages or so   if you do manage to find the transactions in those bank records you are in luck   states unlike the federal government are not immune from law suits   so you can consult a lawyer    by fraudulently claiming that you defaulted on payments the state caused you material harm by lowering your credit rating and increasing your cost of borrowing   once you have all the paperwork in hand you still will have difficult time finding anyone in the state to listen to you   and even if you do you will not be compensated for the time and expenses you expanded to obtain these records if you indeed paid the tickets then you are being asked to prove your innocence and you are assumed guilty until you do   again a good lawyer should be able to do something with that to get you a proper compensation for this

no the stock market and investing in general is not a zero sum game   some types of trades are zero sum because of the nature of the trade    but someone is n't necessarily losing when you gain in the sale of a stock or other security i 'm not going to type out a technical thesis for your question   but the main failure of the idea that investing is zero sum is the fact the a company does not participate in the transacting of its stock in the secondary market nor does it set the price this is materially different from the trading of options contracts   options contracts are the trading of risk one side of the contract wins and one side of the contract loses if you want to run down the economic theory that if bought her shares from bob someone else is missing out on 's money you 're free to do that   but that would mean that literally every transaction in the entire economy is part of a zero sum game and really misses the definition of zero sum game poker is a zero sum game   all players bet in to the game in equal amounts one player takes all the money   and hell i 've played poker and lost but still sometimes feel that received value in the form of entertainment

one possibility is to lock in gains by selling where a selling price can attempt to be optimized by initiating a trailing stop loss order you 'll have to look at the pros and cons of that kind of order to see if it is right for you another possibility is to begin hedging with options contracts if that security is puts with the appropriate delta will cost over time against future gains in the stock 's price but will protect your wealth if the stock price falls from this high point these possibilities depend on what your investment goals are for instance if you are buying no matter what price because you like the forward guidance of the company then it changes your capital growth and preservation decisions

yes you can do this buy placing a conditional order to buy at market if the price moves to 106 or above once the price hits 106 your market order will hit the market and you will purchase the stock at 106 or above you can also place a tack profit order at 107 linked to your initial conditional buy order so that once you buy order is executed and you buy at 106 a take profit order will be executed only if the price reaches 107 or above   if the price never reaches 106 neither your market buy order or take profit order will hit the market and you wo n't buy or sell anything

first the good news based on the time involved and the amount of potential profits you will not owe any tax on the sale of the house no matter which option you pick now the details when determining if there are any capital gains the irs cares about the difference between the sale price and the purchase price the amount of the loan the final balance of the loan or the lack of loan do n't factor into the calculation to complicate matters the government does factor into the equation any improvements you have made to the house like a new deck and the cost of buying and selling the house real estate agents if a single person has less than 250 k in capital gains and has used the house as their main residence for 2 of the the previous 5 years their tax is zero for a couple the tax free gain is $ 500k. for your situation since the sale price is less than $ 250 k the capital gains will also be less than $ 250k. you do have one potential area of concern if the house is worth significantly more than $ 150 k the government could claim that the difference between what you charged your parents and what you could have charged was a gift assuming that there are no other factors that you did n't include in the original question it would appear that you will not face any taxes regarding your two options neither will impact the taxes though draining your savings or investments could make it difficult to meet an emergency during the time between the sending of the $ 95 k to the mortgage company and the closing on the deal with your parents if the money came from retirement account it could have an even greater impact on your taxes and retirement situation

it makes sense if the npv is positive but what rate should you use at determining the npv a textbook might say market rate and by definition the market rate to use in bond calculations like yours will mean that your npv will be zero   how can this be well it 's a bit of a circular definition you take less capital to earn a higher return the value of your capital spread over the period of the bond 's maturity is the net difference but the money in your pocket from selling the bond and not purchasing also has value banks and traders do this exact swap every day many many times the rate at which you can execute this swap is what defines the market rate therefore by definition the npv will be zero now this does n't mean it 's a bad idea for you you can on your own accord decide the value you place on the capital versus the yield and make the decision do you expect rates to rise or fall do you expect higher or lower inflation in reality you can form whatever opinion you like for your own circumstance but the market is the net aggregation of opinion you only get to decide whether or not you agree with the market

if you read joel greenblatt 's the little book that beats the market he says owning two stocks eliminates 46 of the non market risk of owning just one stock     this risk is reduced by 72 with 4 stocks by 81 with 8 stocks by 93 with 16 stocks by 96 with 32 stocks and by 99 with 500 stocks   conclusion after purchasing 6 8 stocks benefits of adding stocks to decrease risk are small    overall market risk wo n't be eliminated merely by adding more stocks   and that 's just specific stocks so you 're very right that allocating a 1 share to a specific type of fund is not going to offset your other funds by much you are correct that you can emulate the lifecycle fund by simply buying all the underlying funds but there are two caveats generally these funds are supposed to be cheaper than buying the separate funds individually check over your math and make sure everything is in order call the fund manager and tell him about your findings and see what they have to say if you are going to emulate the lifecycle fund be sure to stay on top of rebalancing one advantage of buying the actual fund is that the portfolio distributions are managed for you so if you 're going to buy separate etfs make sure you 're rebalancing as for whether you need all those funds my answer is a definite no consider mark cuban 's blog post wall street 's new lie to main street asset allocation although there are some highly questionable points in the article one portion is clear   let me translate this all for you i want you to invest in cash and the rest in 10 different funds about which you know absolutely nothing i want you to make this investment knowing that even if there were 128 hours in a day and you had a year long vacation you could not possibly begin to understand all of these products in fact i do n’t understand them either but because i know it sounds good and everyone is making the same kind of recommendations we all can pretend we are smart and going to make a lot of money until we do n’t standard theory says that you want to invest in low cost funds like those provided by vanguard and you want to have enough variety to protect against risk although i ca n't give a specific allocation recommendation because i do n't know your personal circumstances you should ideally have some in us equities us fixed income international equities commodities of varying sizes to have adequate diversification as defined by theory you can either do your own research to establish a distribution or speak to an investment advisor to get help on what your target allocation should be

gt;if banks did not have a big brother to bail them out of loans that went bust whenever they wanted they would be a lot more careful in who they loaned money to     that 's what they became an avenue to offload risk   the reason those banks were making bad loans was the high demand for trading in mortgage backed securities not because freddie and fannie were there they wanted to make those loans anyway so there 'd be more paper to trade if you could transfer half of the risk of a loan you already knew was shitty to another entity but still keep all the profits and fuck around with the derivatives then of course you 'll take full advantage    the intention behind them was to help that margin of people that fell just below the banks historically very high standards for home lending banks seek high profits fannie and freddie were to operate at break even or slim profit but serve a population toward upward economic benefits everyone when the banks lending standards dropped precipitously due to repeal of glass steagall creation of new exotic financial instruments and appalling lack of regulatory enforcement everything kind of went to shit   in my view they 're much more a casualty that 's become a scapegoat than a causal force
