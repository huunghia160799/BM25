you can make estimated tax payments on form 1040-es   most people who make such payments need to do it quarterly because the typical reasons for making estimated payments is something like self employment income that a person will get throughout the year   if you have a one time event like a single large sale of stock however there 's nothing wrong with doing it just one quarter out of the year when it comes time to file your taxes part of the calculate is whether you were timely quarter by quarter not just for the entire year so if you do have a big one time event mid year do n't wait until the end of the year to file an estimated payment   of course if the event is at the end of the year then you can make it a 4th quarter estimated payment

as much as people on the internet and zh like blogs like to harp on auto and other narrow metrics as broader statements about how life around us is all a sham i feel this article does a good job at discussing the here   notably 1 that the sub prime auto market is rather small so while delinquencies may rise it wo n't represent a catalyst for a broader financial crisis    2 the securitized products santander and others are putting together are structured in a way to account for these defaults and loss rates so while the relative uptick in default rates is interesting to note it does n't necessarily spell doom in absolute terms    3 the fact that many auto dealers do n't verify income is n't uncommon and in fact an industry standard practice due to point 2 above the statement these dealers have been lying about incomes and/or is not verifying incomes certainly pulls at the heart strings of the 2008 housing crisis but when discussed within the context of how the auto lending market works it is n't nearly as scary as those statements would suggest in isolation

wow hard to believe not a single answer mentioned investing in one of the best asset classes for tax purposes real estate   now i 'm not advising you to rush out and buy an investment property   but rather than just dumping your money into mutual funds over which you have almost 0 control buy some books on real estate investing   there are plenty of areas to get into single family housing rentals multifamily apartments mobile home parks and even some of those can have their own   learn now and yes you do have some control over real estate you control where you buy so you pick your local market you can always force appreciation by if you rent you approve your renters   compared to a mutual fund run by someone you 'll never meet buying stocks in companies you 've likely never even heard of you have far more control no matter what area of investing you decide to go into there is a learning curve or you will pay a penalty   go slow but move forward also all the advice on using your employer 's matching if available for 401k should be the easiest first step   how do you turn down free money   besides the bottom line on your paycheck may not change as much as you think it might and when weighed against what you get in return well worth the time to get it setup and active

as the saying goes failing to plan is planning to fail    if you want to be successful you must have a plan on how you are going to succeed   part of making that plan is understanding what the potential points of failure are and how you are going to handle them   it is impossible to do this if you do not understand the business   if you have to react to situations and make snap decisions your risks of making bad decisions increase   this increases your chances of your business failing    you also need to be able to tell when there are problems with your business   if you do not understand the business and have little experience with the business then it will take you longer to recognize that there are problems   the earlier you spot or prevent problems the easier and less costly it is to deal with them    when it can work is when you go in as the silent partner with someone who does know the business   if you watch the show shark tank you will notice the sharks invest in either business that they know and understand and can help guide the business through the pit falls or in people they believe in because they just need the money not the partner   none of them say heck neither of us know what i we are doing but lets take a shot together   the reason is there are more fun ways to throw away money than investing your heart soul blood and sweat into learning a business the hard way    most people who do learn and build a business with no prior experience actually start from nothing rather than buying a business that has already been built   of those that succeed big they up with someone who understood the business side but they were the power behind the innovation   and most of them got in when there was virtually no competition your question does not fit in here

yield can be thought of as the interest rate you would receive from that investment in the form of a dividend for stocks or interest payments on a bond   the yield takes into account the anticipated amount to be received per share unit per year and the current price of the investment    of course the yield is not a guaranteed return like a savings account   if the investment yield is 4 when you buy it can drop in value such that you actually lose money during your hold period despite receiving income from the dividend or interest payments

use the $ 11k to pay down either car loan your choice you should be able to clear one loan very quickly after that lump sum after that continue to aggressively pay down the other car loan until it is clear lastly pay off the mortgage while making sure you are financially stable in other areas cash on hand retirement etc reasoning the car loans are very close in value making it a wash as far as payoff speed the interest is not a large factor here as a percentage of all these numbers the few bucks a month is n't going to change your financial situation this is assuming you will pay off both loans well ahead of schedule making the interest rate negligible in the answer paying off the mortgage last is due to the risk associated with the car loans the cars are guaranteed to lose value at an alarming rate while a house certainly may lose value it is far from an expectation it is likely that your house will maintain and/or increase in value unless you have specific circumstances not disclosed here this makes the mortgage a lower risk loan in your financial world you can probably sell the house to clear the loan balance if necessary the cars are far more likely to depreciate beyond the loan balance

in australia there are 2 type of warrants i do n't know if it is the same in the us uk and other countries the first are trading warrants and the second are instalment warrants the trading warrants are exactly what it says they are used for trading they are similar to option and have calls and puts as cameron says they differ from exchange traded options in that they are issued by the financial companies whereas options are generally written by other investors instalment warrants on the other hand are usually bought and sold by investors with a longer term view there are no calls and puts and you can just go long with them they are also issued by financial companies and how they work is best explained through an example if i was to buy a stock directly say i would be paying $ 50 per share however an instalment warrant in the underlying stock may be offered for $ 27 per warrant i could buy the warrant directly from the company when it is issued or on the secondary market just like shares i would pay the $ 27 per warrant upfront and then in 2 years time when the warrant expires i have the choice to purchase the underlying stock for the strike price of say $ 28 roll over to a new issue of warrants sell it back on the secondary market or let it expire in which case i would receive any intrinsic value left in the warrant you would have noticed that the warrant purchase price plus the strike price adds up to more than the share price $ 55 compared to $ 50 this is the interest component inherent in the warrant which covers the borrowing costs until expiry when you pay the second portion the strike price and receive the underlying shares another difference between instalment warrants and trading warrants and options is that with instalment warrants you still get the full dividends just like the shares but at a higher yield than the shares

customers also have different needs and the more extreme the need the more likely they 're going to rate you so even if you completely fulfill a customer 's need unless it was an extreme need or they were in a predefined emotional state you 're not likely to get a review   as an example we used to actually fix things at our radio shack with and such in store a few people would give us feedback about that we were also allowed leeway on what we could take for returns receipt 30 day limit etc so if the customer came in and started telling me how our products sucked and they were calling the bbb it 's unlikely they would receive the queen bee treatment they also gave reviews yelp was n't around at the time   in short despite the fact we gave the vast majority of our customers way above par treatment the people most likely to give reviews were self entitled despite what people say about turning customers around from angry to nice this only happened with maybe 1 out of every 5 pissy customers another two would probably be shown to be attempting to scam the store in some manner and a fourth would likely have to be shown the door

historically the market 's average rate of return has been about 8 's 6 to 10 is essentially the same number you should be able to get into that range for long term investments with minimal risk 5 or 6 companies unless you know a heck of a lot about those companies is fairly high risk if any one of those runs into trouble a considerable amount of your net investment is riding on it of course if any of them the next big thing you could hit it big that 's the tradeoff diversification is n't sexy but it buffers you from single company disasters and if you diversify across kinds of investment that buffers you from single sector disasters index funds are n't sexy but they 're a low cost way to diversify especially if you go with a mix of funds in different categories large cap small cap bond international real estate or a fund which has that mix built into it such as a target date fund

the concept of a social contract is absolute a constitution defines the how of a state the social contract addresses the question why a state even exists and what justifies its existence and i say it again the only justification for the existence of a state is the protection of your rights and freedoms from others   capitalism is based on the exchange of goods and services based on mutual agreement and respect for each other 's property its driving force is competition   it is an invisible force that has been there since the very beginning every other system can be defined as a restriction to capitalism   we agree on that you can work because the state ensures your safety and the protection of your rights that 's the social contract again   police courts and military might be on the list of those necessary services however mandatory public healthcare is not   preventing a monopoly is not about wealth redistribution the driving force behind all the benefits of capitalism is competition once you have a monopoly the whole thing turns sideways in that area you need to introduce a few market regulations and a handful of guidelines for competition but redistribution of wealth wo n't stop its formation

to answer your first two questions according to irs pub contributions to an hsa section rollovers a rollover contribution is not included in your income is not    deductible and does not reduce your contribution limit archer msas and other hsas    you can roll over amounts from archer    msas and other hsas into an hsa you do not have to be an eligible    individual to make a rollover contribution from your existing hsa to a    new hsa rollover contributions do not need to be in cash rollovers    are not subject to the annual contribution limits    you must roll    over the amount within 60 days after the date of receipt you can make    only one rollover contribution to an hsa during a 1-year period note if you instruct the trustee of your hsa to transfer funds directly to    the trustee of another hsa the transfer is not considered a rollover    there is no limit on the number of these transfers do not include the    amount transferred in income deduct it as a contribution or include    it as a distribution on form 8889 line mine so if you transfer the money yourself you can only do it once per year but there are no limits to when or how many times you can instruct the old hsa trustee to transfer funds directly to the new trustee

what makes a standard raise depends on how well the economy is doing how well your particular industry is doing and how well your employer is doing all these things change constantly so anyone who says a good raise is 5 or whatever number is being simplistic even if true when he said it it wo n't necessarily be true next year or this year in a different industry etc the thing to do is to look for salary surveys that are reasonably current and applicable if today in your industry the average annual raise is 3 again just making up a number then that 's what you should think of as standard if you want a number okay in general as a first draft number i look for a raise that 's 2 or so above the current inflation rate yes of course i 'd like to get a 20 raise every year but that 's not going to happen in real life on the other hand if a company gives me raises that do n't keep pace with inflation than barring special circumstances i 'm going to be looking for another job but there are all sorts of special circumstances if the economy is in a depression and unemployment in my field is 50 i 'll probably figure i 'm lucky to have a job at all and not be too worried about raises if the economy is booming and all my friends are getting 10 and 20 raises then i 'll want that too as others have said in the united states at least the best way to get a pay raise is to change jobs i think most american companies are absolutely stupid about this they do n't want to give current employees big raises so they let them quit and then hire replacements at a much higher salary than they were paying the guy they just drove to quit and the replacement does n't know the company and may have a lot to learn before he is fully productive and then they congratulate themselves that they kept raises this year to only 3 even though total salaries paid went up by 10 because the new hires demanded higher salaries they actively punish employees for staying with the company reminds me of an article i read in a business magazine by an executive of a cell phone company he the fact that in the cell phone industry it is very hard to keep customers they are constantly switching to other vendors and i thought duh maybe it 's because you offer big discounts for the first year or two and after that you jack your prices up through the roof you actively punish your customers for staying with you more than 2 years and then you wonder why customers leave after 2 years oh if you do change jobs absolutely do not buy a line of we 'll start you off with this lower salary but do n't worry because you 'll get a big raise in a year when you 're looking for a job it 's very easy to turn down a poor offer once you have taken a job leaving to get another job is a big decision and a lot of work so you have way more bargaining power on starting salary than on raises and the company knows it and is trying to take advantage of it also consider not just percentage increase but what you 're making now versus what other people with similar experience are making if people comparable to you are making $ 50k and you 're making $ 30k you 're more likely to get a big raise than if you 're already making $ 80k if the company says we just do n't have the budget to give you a raise the key question is is that true if the company is on the edge of bankruptcy and trying to cut costs everywhere then even if they know you 're a good and productive employee they may really just not have the money to give you a good raise but if business is booming this could just be an excuse it might be an excuse for we 're trying to bleed employees white so the ceo can get another million dollar bonus this year or it might be a for you 're really not a very useful employee and we 're seriously thinking of firing you no way we 're going to give you a raise for the little bit of work you do when you bother to show up my final word be realistic what matters is n't what you want or think you need but what you are worth to the company and what other people with similar skills are willing to work for if you are doing work that brings in $ 20k per year for the company there is no way they are going to pay you more than $ 20k for very long you can go on and on about how expensive it is these days to pay the mortgage and pay medical bills and feed your 10 children and support your cocaine addiction but none of that is relevant to what you are worth to the company likewise if there are millions of people out there who would love to have your job for $ 20k if you demand a lot more than that they 're going to fire you and hire one of them conversely if you 're bringing in $ 100k a year for the company they 'll be willing to pay you a substantial percentage of that

broadly there 's a bunch of stuff you need to be accounting for that 's not reflected in the above which will impact the a d profile of an acquisition   consideration paid all cash on substantially the same terms is going to be more accretive than an all stock transaction because in the latter your denominator is much bigger   shares outstanding including repurchases in kind dividends and option exercise   financing interest expense   upside base downside case for all of your assumptions best to have a based on a choose function that will allow the user to easily between these   i 'm not sure what ebitda is getting you eps accretion dilution typically looks at earnings but you could also look at cash eps a d which measures shares outstanding   the point is this really depends on how back of the envelope you want the a d computation to be at a minimum you need an earnings schedule projected over the next 2 3 years and you need a schedule reflecting outstanding shares over the same time period   your earnings can have varying degrees of granularity you can project cost synergies over the forecast period which most obviously is going to affect your earnings but you can also drill down further financing transaction fees etc your and from your b s combination may result in certain deferred tax items that will affect your bottom line over the forecast period   your share schedule can also have varying degrees of complexity one way to do it is to just presume that the company will not issue any more shares and will not repurchase any shares and that there will be no options exercised over the forecast period this is a bad series of assumptions it is likely that as options vest if in the money they will be exercised resulting in dilution for existing shareholders it is also likely that certain preferred shareholders and are going to experience adjustments to the conversion prices based on provisions in their securities these may be but are not always disclosed in the 10k.   last point models are tools what are you trying to build an accretion dilution model for this will affect and determine the degree of granularity you 'll want to go into

the t+3 rule relates only to accounting and not to trading   it does not prevent you from day trading   it simply means that the postings in you cash account will not appear until three business days after you have executed a trade   when you execute a trade and the order has been filled you have all of the information you need to know the cash amounts that will hit your account three business days later in a cash account cash postings that arise from trading are treated as unsettled for three days but this does not mean that these funds are available for further trading   if you have $ 25,000 in your account on day 1 this does not mean that you will be able to trade more than $ 25,000 because your cash account has not yet been debited   most cash accounts will include an item detailing cash available for trading   this will net out any unsettled business transacted for example if you have a cash account balance of $ 25,000 on day one and on the same day you purchase $ 10,000 worth of shares then pending settlement in your cash account you will only have $ 15,000 cash available for trading similarly if you have a cash balance of $ 25,000 on day one and on the same day you day trade purchasing $ 15,000 and selling $ 10,000 worth of shares then you will have the net of $ 20,000 cash available for trading $ 20,000 = $ 25,000 $ 15,000 + $ 10,000 if by prop account you mean an account where you give discretion to a broker to trade on your behalf then i think the issues of accounting will be the least of your worries   you will need to be worried about not being fleeced out of your hard earned savings by someone far more interested in lining their own pockets than making money for you

i started storing and summing all my receipts bills etc it has the advantage of letting me separate expenses by category but it 's messy and it takes a long time   it sounds from this like you are making your summaries far too detailed do n't instead start by painting with broad strokes for example if you spent $ at the grocery store do n't bother splitting that amount into categories like toiletries hygiene products food and snacks just categorize it as grocery spending and move on to the next line on your account statement similarly unless your finances are heavily reliant on cash do n't worry about categorizing each cash expense rather just categorize the withdrawal of cash as miscellaneous and do n't spend time trying to figure out exactly where the money went after that because honestly you probably spent it on something other than savings because really when you are just starting out getting a handle on your spending you do n't need all the nitty gritty details what you need rather is an idea of where your money is going figure out half a dozen or so categories which make sense for you to categorize your spending into you probably have some idea of where your money is going these could be loans cost of living mortgage rent utilities housing home insurance groceries transportation car payments fuel vehicle taxes savings and so on whatever fits your situation add a miscellaneous category for anything that does n't neatly fit into one of the categories you thought of go back something like 3 4 months among your account statements do a quick categorization for each line on your account statements into one of these categories and then sum them up per category and per month calculate the monthly average for each category that 's your starting point the budget you 've been living by intentionally or not after that you can decide how you want to allocate the money and perhaps dig a bit more deeply into some specific category turns out you are spending a lot of money on transportation which you did n't expect look more closely at those line items and see if there 's something you can cut are you spending more money at the grocery store than you thought then look more closely at that and so on once you know where you are and where you want to be such as for example bumping the savings category by $ 200 per month you can adjust your budget to take you closer to your goals chances are you wo n't realistically be able to do an about face turn on the spot but you can try to reduce some discretionary category by say 10 each month and transfer that into savings instead that way in 6 7 months you have cut that category in half

in general a stock can open at absolutely any price with no regard for the closing price or after hours price the previous day the opening price will be determined by the best bid and offer made by people who decide to trade the next day   some of the those people may have put orders in on a prior day that are still on the books and matter but there 's a lot of time overnight for people to cancel orders and enter new ones which is especially likely to happen if there was substantive news overnight as for what you can do in your case you have the same options that you always had   sell or hold   if you 're selling you can sell after hours in the pre open hours or during the trading day   there 's nothing we can say about this case that 's really any different than we can say about any other stock on any other day

i agree that to take the money from the defined benefit plan you are saying that you can get a better return than the plan you are taking all the risk if you take the lump sum but there are two more risks that you are taking by keeping the money in the plan even though you are decades from retirement funding risk companies and state city county governments have underfunded their pension programs due to budget pressure in some cases they have skipped payments when the market was good because they felt they were ahead of their obligations they also delayed or skipped contributions when they had a budget shortfall and wanted to not end the government company fiscal year in the red the risk is that they can get so far behind that they change their promises to current and former employees this was one of the issues with the city of detroit this year bankruptcy even though their are guarantees regarding pension benefits the pension benefit guaranty corporation does set a maximum benefit if the company goes bankrupt or the plan is terminated   you might not get all the money you were expecting while the chances of taking a haircut generally impacts people who have a long career because they are entitled to a large benefit it can impact people who do n't expect it

the euro is a common currency between various countries in europe   this means that individual countries give up their traditional sovereign control of their own currency and cede that control to the eu such a system has many advantages but it also means that individual countries can not deal with their unique situations as easily   for instance if the us were a part of the eu then the fed could n't issue $ 600b the way they are to bolster the economy the danger to the euro is that countries will withdraw their participation in order to micromanage their economies more effectively   if a major country withdraws its participation it could start a domino effect where many countries withdraw so that they too can manage their economies more effectively   as more countries withdraw a shared currency becomes less and less appealing

a mutual fund makes distributions of its dividends and capital gains usually once a year or or quarterly or monthly etc it does not distribute any capital losses to its shareholders but holds them for offsetting capital gains in future years cf this answer of mine to a different question a stock pays   dividends a stock neither has nor does it   distribute capital gains you get capital gains or losses when you sell the shares of the stock but these are not called distributions of any kind similarly you incur capital gains or losses when you   redeem shares of mutual funds but these are not called distributions   either note that non etf mutual fund shares are generally not bought and sold on stock exchanges you buy shares directly from the fund and you sell shares back redeem them directly to the fund   all of the above transactions are taxable events for the year to you unless the shares are being held in a tax deferred account or are tax free for other reasons e.g. dividends from a municipal bond fund

you ca n't actually transfer shares directly unless they were obtained as part of an employee share scheme see the answers to questions 19 and 20 on this page q. can i put shares from my employee share scheme into my isa a. you can transfer any shares you get from into a stocks and shares component of an isa without having to pay    capital gains tax provided your isa manager agrees to take them the    value of the shares at the date of transfer counts towards the annual    limit this means you can transfer up to £ worth of shares in the tax    year 2013 14 assuming that you make no other subscriptions to isas    in those years you must transfer the shares within 90 days from the day they cease to    be subject to the plan or for approved share option schemes 90    days of the exercise of option date your employer should be able to    tell you more q. can i put windfall or inherited shares in my isa a. no you can only transfer shares you own into an isa if they have    come from an employee share scheme otherwise the isa manager must    purchase shares on the open market the situation is the same if you have shares that you have inherited    you are not able to transfer them into an isa

ben miller 's answer is very thorough and i up voted it i believe that the ability to rebalance without tax implications is very import but there are two aspects of the question that were not covered the 401 k in many cases comes with a company match putting enough money into the fund each year to maximize the match give you free money that is not available in the non retirement accounts the presence of that match is to encourage employees to contribute even if they are tying up their funds until retirement age and they are into a plan with only a handful of investment options and they may have higher expenses in the 401k. the question also had a concern about the annual limits for the 401 k 18,000 and the ira 5,500 the use of a retirement account does n't in any way limit your ability to invest in non retirement accounts you can choose to invest from 0 to 23,500 in the retirement accounts and from 0 to unlimited into the non retirement accounts double those amounts if you are married

there 's absolutely nothing wrong with unskilled labor   but walmart is such a large part of the us economy that an increase in their wage base would definitely have an impact on inflation so that any broad based increase they gave would likely have a marginal impact on quality of life   it would also make their items more expensive two times over one because it would cause inflation that other employers have been raising wages to keep pace with and the more direct route of increased costs     whatever you pay unskilled labor the market will simply raise prices to a level where unskilled labor still have a tough time affording a comfortable lifestyle   look at australia as an example of what happens when you raise the minimum wage too high

this is completely disgusting utterly unethical deeply objectionable and yes it is almost certainly illegal the federal trade commission has indeed filed suit halted ads etc in a number of cases but these likely only represent a tiny percentage of all cases this does n't make what the car dealer 's do ok but do n't expect the swat team to bust some heads any time soon which is kind of sad but let 's deal with the details let 's see what the federal trade commission has to say in their article are car ads taking you for a ride deceptive car ads here are some claims that may be deceptive and    why vehicles are available at a specific low price or for a specific    discount what may be missing the low price is after a downpayment often    thousands of dollars plus other fees like taxes licensing and    document fees on approved credit other pitches the discount is only    for a pricey fully loaded model or the reduced price or discount    offered might depend on qualifications like the buyer being a recent    college graduate or having an account at a particular bank only $ what may be missing the advertised payments are temporary teaser    payments payments for the rest of the loan term are much higher a    variation on this pitch you will owe a balloon payment usually    thousands of dollars at the end of the term so both of these are what the ftc explicitly says are deceptive practices has the ftc taken action in cases similar to this yes they have if auto dealers make advertising claims in headlines they ca n’t take    them away in fine print said jessica rich director of the ftc ’s    bureau of consumer protection these actions show there is a    financial cost for violating ftc orders in the case referenced above the owners of a 20 + dealership chain was hit with about $ 250,000 in fines if you think that 's a tiny portion of the unethical gains they made from those ads in the time they were running i 'd say you were absolutely correct and that 's little more than a cost of doing business for unscrupulous companies but that 's the state of the us nation at this time and so we are left with caveat emptor as a guiding principle what can you do about it competitors are technically allowed to file suit for deceptive business practices so if you know any honest dealers in the area you can tip them off about it try saying that out loud with a serious face   but even better you can contact the ftc and file a formal complaint online i would n't expect the world to change for your complaint but even if it just generates a letter it may be enough to let a company know someone is watching and if they are a big business they might actually get into a little bit of trouble

checks in the us anyway are only good for six months after they have been written after that under the us uniform code they are considered stale checks and banks need not accept them my experience is that they generally wo n't but you probably should n't count on that either when figuring out whether to try depositing an old check or figuring out how much cash you need to keep in your checking account to cover recent stale checks the check you now hold is certainly a statement of intent to pay you and thus is a useful document to supplement other evidence that they still owe you the money but since checks can be cancelled and/or a replacement check may have been issued its value for that purpose may be limited you can try depositing it and see what happens if that does n't work or you do n't want to bother trying it you can contact the retirement plan point out that this check went uncashed and ask them to send you a replacement if they have n't already done so you might want to check your own records for that there should n't be any problem with this note many business checks have a statement printed on them that they 're only good for 90 days or so if yours does you can skip trying to cash it just contact the retirement plan offices

how so if i sell short then i make a profit only if the price goes down so i can buy back at a lower price yes but if the price is going up then you would go long instead shorting a stock or any other asset allows you to profit when the price is going down going long allows you to profit when the price is going up in the opposite cases you lose money in order to make a profit in either of those situations you have to accurately assess which way the price will trade over the period of time you are dealing with if you make the wrong judgment then you lose money because you 'll either sell for a lower price than you bought if you went long or have to buy back at a higher price than you sold for if you went short in either case unless the trader can live with making a short term loss and it later one needs a good stop loss strategy

yes it is viable but uncommon as with everything to do with investment you have to know what you are doing and must have a plan i have been successful with long term trading of cfds for about 4 years now it is true that the cost of financing to hold positions long term cuts into profits but so do the spreads when you trade frequently what i have found works well for me is maintaining a portfolio that is low volatility e.g. picking a mix of positions that are negatively correlated has a good sharpe ratio sound fundamentals i.e. co integrated assets or at least fairly stable correlations then leveraging a modest amount

here 's my view as a old who grew up in auckland when you purchase a residential property whether or not you intend to live in it you 're essentially counting on the possibility that one of the following will occur this report by the nz royal society going by memory from a presentation i attended predicts ongoing population growth in nz mainly driven by immigration and mostly in auckland building of new housing is n't keeping up with population growth so my bet would be that the property values especially in auckland are going to continue to climb   other factors that might influence your decision are things only you can know such as where you might be likely to settle down how much risk you 're willing to take how much capability you have to look after a rental property and how much knowledge you have about the property market bear in mind that government schemes and world events may change the outlook for number of houses being built and immigration levels both of which heavily affect property values my personal view is that the government is n't doing nearly enough to provide affordable housing for our young adults in nz not only that the govt is essentially responsible for the problem in the first place as zoning rules for local authorities artificially inflate land prices which prevent the building of affordable houses furthermore foreign investment in rental properties is unregulated and both these problems could be resolved with appropriate legislation though central city prices are unlikely to be relieved as much as other areas simply because prices are also inflated due to the desirability to live centrally the problem is a severe one and high housing prices for even the smallest are going to make inequality and the social problems that go with it far worse i 'd like to see new cities or towns being planned and built from scratch such as and

an attempt at a simple answer for the normal investor a normal investor buys stock then later sells that stock this is known as going long as opposed to going short   for the normal investor a stop order of either kind is only used when selling a stop loss sell order or stop sell is used to sell your stock when it has fallen too much in price and you do n't want to suffer more losses   if the stock is at $ 50 you could enter a stop sell at $ 40 which means if the stock ever falls to $ 40 or lower your stock will be sold at whatever price is available e.g. $ 35 a stop loss limit sell order or stop limit sell is the same except you are also saying but do n't sell for less than my limit price   so you can enter a stop limit sell at $ 40 with a limit of $ 39 meaning that if the stock falls to $ 40 you will then have a limit order in effect to sell the stock at $ 39 or higher   thus your stock will never be sold at $ 35 or any value below $ 39 but of course if the stock falls fast from $ 40 to $ 35 your limit sell at $ 39 will not be done and you will be left still owning the stock worth at that moment $ 35 say

i 'm 39 and have been investing since my very early 20 's and the advice i 'd like to go back and give myself is the following 1 time is your friend compounding interest is a powerful force and is probably the most important factor to how much money you are going to wind up with in the end save as much as you possibly can as early as you can you have to run twice as hard to catch up if you start late and you will still probably wind up with less in the end for the extra effort 2 do n't invest 100 of your investment money it always me to let my cash sit idle in an investment account because the   notion of inflation eating up my money and i felt i was wasting opportunity cost by not being fully invested in something however not having enough investable cash around to buy into the fire sale dips in the market made me miss out on opportunities 3 diversify the bubble taught me this in a big hairy painful way i had this idea that as a i really understood the tech bubble and over invested in tech stocks i just knew that i was on top of things as an industry insider and would know when to jump yeah that did n't work out so well i lost more than 6 figures at least on paper diversification will the ups and downs somewhat and make the market a lot less scary in the long run 4 mind your expenses it took me years of paying huge full service broker fees to realize that those clowns do n't seem to do any better than anyone else at picking stocks even when they do the transaction costs are a lead weight on your returns the same holds true for mutual funds etfs shop for low expense ratios aggressively it is really hard for a fund manager to consistently beat the indexes especially when you burden the returns with expense ratios that skim an extra 1 or so off the top the expense ratio broker fees are among the very few things that you can predict reliably when it comes to investments take advantage of this knowledge 5 have an exit strategy for every investment people are emotional creatures it is hard to be logical when you have skin in the game and most people are n't disciplined enough to just admit when they have a loser and bail out while they are in the red or conversely admit when they have a winner and take profits before the party is over it helps to counteract this instinct to have an exit strategy for each investment you buy that is you will get out if it drops by x% or grows by y% in fact it is probably a good idea to just enter those sell limit orders right after you buy the investment so you do n't have to convince yourself to press the button in the heat of a big move in the price of that investment do n't try to predict tops or bottoms they are extremely hard to guess and things often turn so fast that you ca n't act on them in time anyway get out of an investment when it has met your goal or is going to far in the wrong direction if you find yourself saying it has to come back eventually slap yourself   when you are trying to decide whether to stay in the investment or bail the most important question is if i had the current cash value of the stock instead of shares would i buy it today because essentially that is what you are doing when you stick with an investment 6 do n't invest in fads when you are investing you become sensitive to everyone 's opinions on what investment is hot and what is not if everyone is talking about a particular investment avoid it the more enthusiastic people are about it even experts the more you should avoid it when everyone starts forming investment clubs at work and the stock market seems to be the preferred topic of conversation at every party you go to get out   i 'm a big fan of contrarian investing take profits when it feels like all the momentum is going into the market and buy in when everyone seems to be running for the doors

it depends on the terms of the lease but it 's hard to imagine a lease that would allow to do this unilaterally with no strings attached   that means it actually depends not on how much you like your but on how much she likes you in general by signing the lease you assume a contractual obligation to pay the rent every month for the entire term of the lease   in theory you can be sued if you do n't do that in practice a lot depends on your relationship with your landlord as well as the rental market in your area   if the landlord can easily find a replacement tenant they may be willing to allow you to leave early   if the rental market is slow they will be more likely to hold you to the agreement   obviously if you have a good relationship with the landlord they may be more inclined to go easy on you as far as telling your you want to terminate the lease early unless she 's a particularly nasty person you can just go ahead and tell her you 'd like to leave early   what you ca n't do is actually stop paying rent   if you 're on reasonably good terms with your you could just tell her your situation and say you 'd like to move out   she may be willing to work out an arrangement where she lists the apartment while you 're still living there allows prospective tenants to view it while it 's occupied and then has you move out if and when someone else wants to move in e.g. at the end of the month   again exactly how this works will probably depend on the rental market assuming you 're in the usa here is a useful page with some info on breaking a lease   as mentioned there the legal details vary by state

i 'm sorry you are going through this but what you are dealing with is exactly is how cosigning works   it is among other reasons why you should never cosign a loan for someone unless you are 100 prepared to pay the loan on their behalf unfortunately the main benefit to cosigning a loan is to the bank they do n't care who makes payments only that someone does it is not in their interest to educate purchasers who can easily get themselves into the situation you are in what your options are depends a fair bit on the type of loan it is the biggest problem is that normally as cosigner you can not force your friend to do anything if it is for a car your best bet is to convince them to sell the car and hopefully recoup more than the cost of the loan many workplaces have some sort of free service to provide counseling guidance on this sort of thing look into your employee benefits as you may have some free services there you can sue your friend in small claims court but keep in mind it also depends on how big the loan is relative to your income while it might feel good to sue your friend in small claims court if it 's for $ 500 it probably is n't worthwhile but if your friend just stopped paying off their $ 30k vehicle assuming you will pay for it even though they can pay for it themselves
# 424247
congratulations on a solid start here are my thoughts based on your situation asset classes i would recommend against a long term savings account as an investment vehicle while very safe the yields will almost always be well below inflation since you have a long time horizon most likely at least 30 years to retirement you have enough time to take on more risk as long as it 's not more than you can live with if you are looking for safer alternatives to stocks for part of your investments you can also consider investment grade bonds bond funds or even a stable value fund later when you are much closer to retirement you may also want to consider an annuity depending on the interest rate on your loan you may also be able to get a better return from paying down your loan than from putting more in a savings account i would recommend that you only keep in a savings account what you expect to need in the next few years cushion for regular expenses emergency fund etc on stocks stocks are riskier but have the best chance to outperform versus inflation over the long term i tend to favor funds over individual stocks mostly for a few practical reasons first one of the goals of investing is to diversify your risk which produces a more efficient risk reward ratio than a group of stocks that are highly correlated diversification is easier to achieve via an index fund but it is possible for a well educated investor to stay diversified via individual stocks also since most investors do n't actually want to take physical possession of their shares funds will manage the shares for you as well as offering additional services such as the automatic of dividends and tax management asset allocation it 's very important that you are comfortable with the amount of risk you take on investment salespeople will prefer to sell you stocks as they make more commission on stocks than bonds or other investments but unless you 're able to stay in the market for the long term it 's unlikely you 'll be able to get the market return over the long term make sure to take one or more risk tolerance assessments to understand how often you 're willing to accept significant losses as well as what the optimal asset allocation is for you given the level of risk you can live with generally speaking for someone with a long investment horizon and a medium risk tolerance even the most conservative allocations will have at least 60 in stocks total of us and international with the rest in bonds other and up to 80 or even 100 for a more aggressive investor owning more bonds will result in a lower expected return but will also dramatically reduce your portfolio 's risk and volatility pension with so many companies deciding that they do n't feel like keeping the promises they made to yesterday 's workers or simply ca n't afford to the pension is nice but like social security i would n't bank on all of this money being there for you in the future this is where a fee only financial planner can really be helpful they can run a bunch of scenarios in planning software that will show you different retirement scenarios based on a variety of assumptions ie what if you only get 60 of the promised pension etc   this is probably not as much of an issue if you are an equity partner or if the company fully funds the pension in a segregated account or if the pension is defined contribution but most corporate pensions are just a general promise to pay you later in the future with no real money actually set aside for that purpose so i 'd discount this in my planning somewhat fund stock selection generally speaking most investment literature agrees that you 're most likely to get the best risk adjusted returns over the long term by owning the entire market rather than betting on individual winners and losers since no one can predict the future including professional money managers as such i 'd recommend owning a low cost index fund over holding specific sectors or specific companies only remember that even if one sector is more profitable than another the stock prices already tend to reflect this concentration in it consultancy i am concerned that one third of your investable assets are currently in one company the it consultancy it 's very possible that you are right that it will continue to do well that is not my concern my concern is the risk you 're carrying that things will not go well again you are taking on risks not just over the next few years but over the next 30 or so years until you retire and even if it seems unlikely that this company will experience a downturn in the next few years it 's very possible that could change over a longer period of time please just be aware that there is a risk one way to mitigate that risk would be to work with an advisor or a fund to structure and investment plan where you invest in a variety of sector funds except for technology that way your overall portfolio including the single company will be closer to the market as a whole rather than over weighted in it tech however if this it consultancy happens to be the company that you work for i would strongly recommend yourself of those shares as soon as reasonably possible in my opinion the risk of having your salary pension and much of your investments tied up in the fortunes of one company would simply be a much larger risk than i 'd be comfortable with last make sure to keep learning so that you are making decisions that you 're comfortable with with the amount of savings you have most investment firms will consider you a high net worth client so make sure you are making decisions that are in your best financial interests not theirs again this is where a fee only financial advisor may be helpful you can find a local advisor at best of luck with your decisions

thanks for the writeup it was a really informative read i 've been aware for a while now that reagan and were in a large way the start of most of the current problems in the economic and political landscape but you filled in a few gaps that were really useful for me   so i guess ultimately a lot of conservatives see it as a kind of necessary evil in order to bring about the success story that the current economy needs right now unfortunately their strategy is totally wrong that kind of makes sense with my observation that rather than supporting the cronyism and corruption they turn a blind eye to it because they think it 's necessary   my view is not so much that labour and finance capital returns need to be balanced although that is probably a great thing to aim for but that creation of wealth capital needs to be intrinsically linked with the creation of real value the modern banking crisis was a great example of the ability to generate wealth while in fact destroying real value

i hope you 're not blaming the banks for the housing price inflation   it 's called supply and demand and is mostly caused by people possibly like you who have unreasonable expectations about the future value of real estate and thought it would keep rising unrealistically forever   the bank 's crime was to lend money recklessly to people who could not really afford it   the buyer 's crime was to buy a home they could not afford with the expectations that it would go up in price and they could either flip it or refinance   the real criminals might be the real estate agents who convinced the buyers they could afford it and helped them find an avenue to get the money   there were are a lot of unscrupulous or simply bad real estate agents out there but they too were naive enough to think houses would continue to rise   tl;dr   we are all to blame   calling owners slumlords and blaming them and the banks for your misfortune will only hurt you and make you forever the victim

you should probably talk to a professional tax adviser this does n't seem to be a common situation from the top of my head without being a lawyer or a tax professional i think of it like this the income is for year 200 and should have been taxed then you constructively received it then and not claimed it you probably had withholding from this salary that should have been reported to you then on w2 you can get a copy from the irs i 'd say you 're to amend the return for year 200 with the new income if it was n't reported then although if more than 3 years passed 6 if its 25 or more of your gross income for that year its beyond statute however as i said i 'm not a lawyer and not a professional tax adviser so you can not in any way rely on my opinion for anything that would result in not paying any taxes or penalties you should have you should talk to a licensed tax professional ea cpa lawyer licensed in your state

my entrepreneurship prof said that in most cases if you really believe in your product idea and it is differentiated from what exists already you can afford to have someone steal your idea and try to make a go of it because you should still be able to do a much better job of it than they can and their heart is nt in it the way yours is    i think ultimately it really depends on the product though you definitely do n't want to try going 2nd to market against someone with superior resources unless you can 100 beat their version of the product by a good margin either on price or quality and hopefully both and you can scale up quickly

i think you 're missing the fact that the trader bought the $ 40 call but wrote the $ 45 call i.e. someone else bought the $ 45 call from him   that 's why you have to subtract 600 100   at expiration the following happens so $ 600 + = $ 500 total profit note in reality he would probably use the shares he gets from the first call to satisfy the shares he owes on the second call so the math is even simpler

no credit card company would ever give a card with either no credit limit or that was not in credit for prepaid cards because they would earn no money from it the company 's income is entirely derived from fees that they charge you for balances and interest on those balances so a 0 limit card would be worthless to them getting a prepaid card and letting the balance hit 0 might be a way around this but the fees that you will be charged and will become a debt in your name when the billing system tries to take the first paid month 's cost from the card and fails will be exorbitant they may go so far as the actual cost but the one thing that they will certainly do is lower your credit rating so this is not a good idea

normally when thinking about whether it 's worth it to start a small business the biggest factor is your time there 's a big difference between spending 10 hours to make a profit of $ 50 vs spending 1 hour to make a profit of $ 50 your scenario is quite different though in that you suggest your wife is considering teaching for free instead of accepting payment in this case the time factor almost goes away since if you accept payment there is very little extra time involved for depositing checks tracking income and filling out some extra forms come tax time from a financial point of view there is no reason to turn down the money if people are willing to pay it there may be other reasons to prefer doing it for free but taxes social security payments and the small extra effort to run the business would n't normally be among those reasons i do n't know what your reasons for possibly preferring to do it for free are but an alternative option to consider is to donate all of her income to charity

it also depends on where you work if you move your home and your job then the date you establish residency in the new state is the key date all income before that date is considered income for state 1 and all income on or after that date is income for state 2   if there is a big   difference in income you will want to clearly establish residency because it impacts your wallet if they had the same rates moving would n't impact your wallet but it would impact each state so make sure when going from high tax state to low tax state that you register your vehicles register to vote get a new drivers license it becomes more complex if you move your home but not your job in that case where you work might be the deciding factor same states have agreed that where you live is the deciding factor in other cases it is not for virginia maryland and dc you pay based on where you live if the two states involved are dc md va but if you live in delaware and work in virginia virginia wants a cut of your income tax   so before you move you need to research reciprocity for the two states from massachusetts information for nonresident and part year resident income exemptions deductions and credits massachusetts gross income includes items of income derived from    sources within massachusetts this includes income a few questions later massachusetts residents and part year residents are allowed a credit    for taxes due to any other jurisdiction the credit is available only    on income reported and taxed on a massachusetts return nonresidents    may not claim the taxes paid to other jurisdiction credit on their    massachusetts form the credit is allowed for income taxes paid to the credit is not allowed for taxes paid to the u.s. government or a    foreign country other than canada city or local tax and interest and    penalty paid to another jurisdiction the computation is based on comparing the massachusetts income tax on    income reported to the other jurisdiction to the actual tax paid to    the other jurisdiction the credit is limited to the smaller of these    two numbers the other jurisdiction credit is a line item on the tax form but you    must calculate it on the worksheet in the instruction booklet and also    enter the credit information on the schedule so if you move your house to new hampshire but continue to work in massachusetts you will owe income tax to massachusetts   for that income even after you move and establish residency in new hampshire

good question it seems to me that there is no minimum order size for shares trading on the lse please note i could n't find an definite answer but according to the international order book document see from the lse page 7 question 7 would respondents support a revision of the minimum order     size of 50 units    whilst there was    limited support for a low value based    minimum order size the   majority of    respondents requested its complete    removal   this was   incorporated into    the september 2010 quarterly review as    per service   announcement    and as from 20 september 2010 the    minimum   order size in all    securities has been 1 unit even though not all trading on the lse is performed on this system it would be very if the international stocks can be traded in any size while domestic stocks will have an minimum size further consider looking to the times and sales of various stocks here you can find an example those trades also suggest that there is no minimum order size for example i just saw an executed trade with an size of 13 at last look at the interactive brokers no relationship with exchange list at here you can click on various stock names and in the window that opens look for size parameters and the size increment i could only find stocks with an size increment of 1 i.e. you can trade anything with a minimum of 1 stock and more needs to be in steps of 1 stock even though i could n't find official information on the lse site like a for beginners or such it does seem to me that you can trade any size you want on lse   please note that mutual funds and illiquid otc stocks which do n't have an continuous market can have different rules so double check with your broker

the basic theoretical reason for a company to return money to shareholders is that the company does n't need the money for its own purposes e.g. investment or working capital so instead of the company just keeping it in the bank it hands it back so that shareholders can do what they think fit e.g. investing it elsewhere in some cases particularly private equity deals you see companies actively borrowing money to payout to shareholders on the grounds that they can do so cheaply enough that it will improve overall shareholder returns the trade off with this kind of leveraging up is that it usually makes the business more risky and every so often you see it go wrong e.g. after an economic downturn it may still be a rational thing to do but i 'd look at that kind of proposal very carefully in this case i think things are quite different the company has sold a valuable asset and has spare cash it 's already going to use some of the money to reduce debt so it does n't seem like the company is becoming more risky overall if the management is recommending it i would support it as you say the share consolidation seems like just a technical measure and you might as well also support that i think they want to make their share price seem stable over time to people who are looking at it casually and wo n't be aware of the payout otherwise it 'd suddenly drop by and might give the impression the company had some bad news the plan is to essentially cancel one share worth for every payout they make on 16 shares since = payout this should leave the share price broadly unchanged

i 'm sorry i should have said i was saying that sarcastically but those are the arguments which i suspect are being made   did not answer my question where 's my advocate in the negotiations   its doubtful that they would be among the hundreds thousands of lobbyists unless you are a corporation and you have one   should i believe the negotiators have my best interests at heart   i do n't think the negotiators have your or the country 's best interests at heart i think they barely even play lip service to it any more    's the point of negotiating a treaty that does n't have the people 's interests at heart      well look at all the things that are in ttip for example here in the us by government agencies tasked with enforcement of existing laws and recommending new ones the chemical industry has succeeded for the last 25 years or so at preventing a lot of needed regulation of a lot of demonstrably dangerous substances particularly a class of chemicals called tag    meanwhile europe has put into place much more stringent regulations based on the principle which requires that chemical industry prove some chemicals are safe to get them approved while the us the key issue is overcoming lobbyists and even chemicals which are clearly dangerous have to go through a lot of hoops before they are regulated and even when its shown to be extremely likely they are dangerous it is very difficult when lobbyists are there often regulators are political from the industries they are supposed to regulate there is no denying that having different regulations is complicated but what they are promoting as a solution is not a good approach    they are pushing for what they call regulatory which is basically the forcing of all environmental and chemical laws in a bunch of countries into the same publications it would overrule a lot of state laws involving things like fracking and food safety    instead of raising our standards to the european level they want to bring theirs down and get rid of the imo quite prudent principle which i think is incredibly stupid but people are not aware of this   i think has clearly been a high level decision some kind of agreement between the 5 media corporations that control virtually all us media to never cover some issues   to not cover those issues at all but in europe they have a similar problem just not quite as bad but there people make more of an effort to find out what s really happening also there are fewer   the us is known for massive levels of astroturfing in its online world   for example in the uk there is a lot of protesting because of the implicit goal of the ftas is to privatize public services although they deny it its right there in agreements like files framing public services as bad some kind of theft from companies and any small privatization into a permanent entitlement for that company to that market so its permanent even if its unsuccessful that s been disastrous to their john on ttip and nhs they are trying to us   how did it get this way in part its due to the failure of americans to seek out facts something people really have to do because there are forces spending a lot of effort into hiding them and trying to exploit positions of trust to create a dangerous false security   its a direct result of so much money in politics the so called stakeholders spend a lot of money and energy into getting candidates into office so then they expect something in return    this is related

these cars are generally considered out of date and are less prone to be victims of car theft while being reasonably safe make sure you pick a model with a good reliability reputation see what comes up at your local junk yard the common old models have survived long enough to not end up there until now servicing your car takes some effort and some initial investments but learning how to fix simple problems by yourself will save you a lot of money in the long run start by learning how to locate some simple faults diagnosing issues is a very costly process if done professionally but some you may be able to find by yourself all cars sold in usa from 1996 are required to have this connection below the steering rack as a consequence most cars manufactured 1995 will have this connector world wide if you connect your to this port your car will be able to tell you what 's wrong through an app on your phone and you will be able to clear fault codes by yourself to make sure the problem really is solved this is what you mechanic should use when servicing your car while a new print can be expensive you can find used manuals getting thrown out of service centers or at yard sales these will include service notes and sometimes had written notes to help you out the majority of parts on cars are still in working condition and may not ever see significant wear and tear if you put some time into removing the part yourself you will have a good idea of how difficult it is to replace the part on your car and outsource the work to a professional if needed this of course assumes you bring good parts the main income should come from the work performed on your car not the markup of spare parts generally speaking specialized mechanics working with one or few brands of cars are preferable as these will not only be familiar with your car but are also more likely to get original spare parts not pirate parts made to be compatible at a cheaper price this will make sure the part works as intended and not cause wear and tear of other parts for example you 'd much rather replace a broken instead of cleaning up the aftermath of fried electronics turn off the ac when it 's not needed there should be a button labeled econ or similar which will disable the ac compressor while keeping the rest of the systems running the compressor is usually driven by a belt from the and will eat up some of the power your engine produces just remember that while it saves gas uncomfortable driving conditions may shorten your patience and reduces your attention accelerate up to speed quickly contrary to popular belief this saves more gas than accelerating slowly because the time your engine is under increased load is shorter combined with higher efficiency at medium engine speeds allow your speed to decline on you will regain that speed once the road levels out unless you 're in heavy traffic driving a bit slower should n't harm the flow do n't let go of the gas pedal just avoid compensating as much your target should be to not lose more than 20 of your speed over the entire and have a constant or you will start interfering with traffic make sure your car is healthy as obvious as it may sound worn out parts may harm your mileage increased friction in due to broken protective covers or reduced pressure from a broken exhaust are just examples if things that will ruin the efficiency of you by themselves they may not do much but they add up into both gas consumption and reliability issues really do read your owners manual nobody knows your car better than the people who built it what 's best for my car may not be best for your car and the best way to make sure your car is working as intended is to take an afternoon with your manual and a cup of your favorite beverage afterwards you will know how all the features of your car works take care of your car and it takes care of you is the principle i 'm working with a car you 're happy with will make you more calm behind the wheel and leads to higher quality of your driving decisions both you and your fellow commuters will benefit from this even if they may never take the time to thank you

that 's true about but that 's not the problem with tv advertising the problem is   if you 've ever listened to talk radio sometimes the host gets really quiet and almost and then he lights up and begins yelling and shouting   yet during this time you do n't need to adjust your radio 's volume the sound from the radio studio has been very heavily compressed so that the quiet and loud parts are all the same volume   if you the crap out of your commercial 's sound and then normalize it to 95 of the peak of the tv show 's sound which is typically not nearly as compressed then your commercial is going to be perceived as vastly louder than the tv show even though it never exceeds 95 of the tv show 's peak volume   thus a law referencing the average volume is thought to be more effective than one that simply requires   it still seems easy to work around though just have 29 seconds of silence and 1 second of horrendously loud house waking marketing slime   what they need to do is require that neither the average nor the peak db level of the commercial may exceed the average db level of the show   there might be cute little tricks that can get around that too but at some point the ad agency has to actually talk and sell their product rather than performing mathematical on the audio just to wake everyone up

it 's not necessary to convert it back for the changes to affect value     lets say you have a euro account with 1000 euro and a gbp account with gbp the accounts are equal in value given current exchange rates   you could exchange either account for usd     if you exchange the euro account for usd and say the euro gets stronger against the pound and dollar and subsequently the pound and dollar are weaker against the euro then if you would've kept the 1000 euro it would now be worth more than gbp and more than usd and you would've been better off exchanging the gbp account for usd   barring some economic event exchange rates between well established currencies do n't radically change over a few weeks trip so i would n't really worry about it one way or the other

i would say yes it makes sense to keep some money in taxable accounts   retirement accounts are for retirement and the various early withdrawal penalties are designed to enforce that   if you 're anticipating using the money before retirement e.g. for home purchase it makes sense to keep it out of retirement accounts on the other hand be aware that regardless of what kind of account it is in you face the usual risk return tradeoff   if you put your money in the s&p 500 and the s&p 500 tanks just before you were going to buy a house your down payment evaporates and you will have to wait and buy a house later   you can manage this by shifting the allocation of this money and perhaps cashing it out if a certain amount is gained i.e. it grows to the level of your target down payment and you are close enough to the house purchase time that you do n't want to risk it anymore basically if you invest money for a pre retirement use you may want to keep it in a taxable account but you also need to take account of when you 'll need it and manage the risk accordingly

number 2 can not occur you can buy the call back and sell the stock but the broker wo n't force that 2 choice to trade options you must have a margin account no matter how high the stock goes once in the money the option is n't going to rise faster so your margin is not an issue   and your example is a bit troublesome to me why would a $ 120 strike call spike to $ 22 with only a month left you 've made the full $ 20 on the stock rise and given up any gain after that that 's all the call owner may exercise at any time edit is right there are circumstances where an option price can increase faster than the stock price options pricing generally follows the black scholes model since the op gave us the current stock price option strike price and time to expiration and we know the risk free rate is < 1 you can use the calculator to change volatility the number two scenario wo n't occur however because a covered call has no risk to the broker they wo n't force you to buy the option back and the option buyer has no motive to exercise it as the entire option value is time premium

alright irs publication 463 travel entertainment gift and car expenses business and personal use if you use your    car for both business and personal purposes    you must divide your expenses between business    and personal use you can divide your expense    based on the miles driven for each purpose example you are a sales representative    for a clothing firm and drive your car 20,000    miles during the year 12,000 miles for business    and 8,000 miles for personal use you can    claim only 60 12,000 ÷ 20,000 of the cost of    operating your car as a business expense obviously nothing helpful in the code   so i would use option 1 weight the maintenance related mileage by the proportion of business use   although if you use your car for business a lot and perhaps have a spouse with a car an argument could be made for 3   so i would consider my odds of being audited even lower this year due to irs budget cuts and choose 1 or 3 and of course never throw anything away until you 're room temperature

the three basic needs are food clothing and shelter housing falls into the third category because it is basic housing takes up a large part of one 's disposable income the rule of thumb is that you should n't spend more than 25 of your income on rent or mortgages and that is income before taxes anything much more than that takes up too much of one 's budget you simply can't double housing 's share of the budget from 25 to 50 whereas it 's easy to go from 1 to 2 for say a cellphone upgrade in the long run housing prices are constrained by the size of people 's housing budgets which in turn are tied to incomes nowadays that includes foreign buyers so there may be a case where west coast housing prices are driven up by asian buyers or florida housing by buyers from latin america driving americans out of local markets

the best strategy for rsu 's specifically is to sell them as they vest usually vesting is not all in one day but rather spread over a period of time which assures that you wo n't sell in one extremely unfortunate day when the stock dipped for regular investments there are two strategies i personally would follow sell when you need if you need to cash out cash out rebalance if you need to rebalance your portfolio i.e. not cash out but reallocate investments or move investment from one company to another do it periodically on schedule for example every 13 months in the us where the long term cap gains tax rates kick in after 1 year of holding rebalance you would n't care about specific price drops on that day because they also affect the new investments speculative strategies trying to sell high buy low usually bring to the opposite results you end up selling low and buying high but if you want to try and do that you 'll have to get way more technical than just dollar cost averaging or similar strategies most people do n't have neither time nor the knowledge for that and even those who do rarely can beat the market and never can in the long run

whether it is better to buy or to rent depends on several factors   most of them are fairly uncertain but calculations can be made to see how they play out in the long term for insight into their impact the results below are made on the basis that both the buyer and the tenant spend the same amount in this case $ per month   the buyer pays his mortgage and when it 's all paid for he switches to investing $ per month at the fund deposit rate   meanwhile the tenant pays rent and invests whatever remains from $ per month at the fund deposit rate the amount $ is set by the mortgage case and used by buyer and tenant for equal comparison taking some hopefully not too unrealistic rate estimates these are the calculation all percentages are expressed as effective annual rates plot of buyer 's and tenant 's accumulated assets over time the simulation extends for twice the term of the mortgage   if the investment fund can return 7 and a $ 900 rental is comparable to a $ 300,000 house then there is n't much of a compelling case either way lowering the expected fund return shows a different picture   sticking with the fund return lowering the rent brings the tenant 's asset accumulation closer to the buyer 's   if there is a particular set of inputs you would like to see plotted i 'm sure i could add another example to this post there is also an interactive version of the calculation which you can find via this page   however unlike the examples above which include a deposit and grant it just explores the simple case of a 100 mortgage the aim is just to see how rate variations affect asset value over time

the previous answers make valid points regarding the risks and why you ca n't reasonably compare trading for profit loss to a roll of the die this answer looks at the math instead your assumption i have an equal probability to make a profit or a loss is incorrect for the reasons stated in other answers however the answer to your question can i also assume that probabilistically speaking a trader can not do worst than random is yes but only because the question is flawed consequently it 's throwing people in all directions with their answers but quite simply in a truly random environment the worst case scenario no matter how improbable is that you lose over and over again until you have nothing left this can happen in sequential rolls of the dice and in trading securities bonds whatever you could guess wrong for every roll of the die and all of your stock picks could become worthless both outcomes result in $ 0 assuming you do not gamble with credit tell me which $ 0 is worse given the infinite number of plays that random implies the chance of losing your entire bankroll exists in both scenarios and that is enough by itself to make neither option worse than the other of course the opposite is also true you could only pick winners with an unlimited upside potential but again that could happen with either dice rolls or stock picks it 's just highly improbable my chances can not be worse than random and if my trading system has an edge that is greater than the percentage of the transaction that is transaction cost then i am probabilistically likely to make a profit nope this is where it all falls apart just because your chances of losing it all are similarly improbable does not make you more likely to win with one method or the other regression to the mean when given infinite truly random outcomes makes it impossible to have an edge also probabilistically is n't a word but probably is

when i read that part of his post it reminded me more of credit companies rather than banks people default on credit all the time i have no idea what the regulations are on the amount of credit that a company can issue though   and this is sort of part of what actually happened in the beginning of the economic crunch a bunch of people began to trade for credit debt against what they thought the future value of their house or other real estate would be after a while people stopped being able to afford property at its future value so they stopped buying it when people then tried to sell their property for the future value that they had borrowed against they could n't so they could n't pay back their debt   because real estate had become a popular investment vehicle for the middle class this was able to reach a kind of critical mass and shortly afterward the effects back into the credit market which also had its own crunch a bunch of credit just disappeared overnight because so many people had assumed a level of debt that they could not actually fulfill their promises on once the future value of their home became completely imaginary

if she is a legitimate owner you ca n't force her to sell her interest in the house you can communicate indirectly with her perhaps through a lawyer and see if she is willing to sign something authorizing you to sell unless she is mentally incompetent you will likely have a very difficult time of proceeding with a legal challenge at minimum she should be paying you rent if she is the sole and if she is unwilling to let you live in the house or pay you rent as co owners you could possibly proceed with a suit along those lines this is a good example of why it 's not ideal to co own a home with someone you are n't legally married to including a relative or someone you are dating because there is no relatively simple process similar to divorce which determines the allocation of property in the case of a serious dispute if living together it may be preferable to have one party own the home and rent it to another if inherited it may be preferable for one party to buy out the others and rent it back to them or arrange for a portion of any money made through the sale or rental of the home best of luck i hope you are able to reach an agreeable outcome

i would consult a tax professional for specific help   on my own research i believe that you could   i know that when i made payments when i was in school for my undergraduate i made payments on the interest   i believe that i was even told by my financial aid office that i could deduct the interest that i paid   i made not much money so i was n't anywhere close to the magi > 75k but i believe you still could    not only that but one other thing to consider is that if you have an loan the interest still accrues when you are in school   in that case it might be better to make at least some payments   it would save you from the total loan amount ballooning so much while you are in school

yes i thought his flow charts did a nice job with a complex system   some thoughts   he makes the if your house ran a blah blah blah   that is a horrible analogy to make for an economy   he quotes the revenue to debt ratio as if it is static   we are spending much more now then we traditionally do at the same times as revenues are lower than historic levels   ratios change over time   either he chooses to ignore or does n't know that a lot of the issues with the piigs comes from the aggressive use of derivative products to clean their books for the joining of the eu   like his arm example now the rates have changed and those trades have moved against the sovereigns    his lists the outcome of current monetary policy as binary   either we inflate to infinity and the world explodes or we default and the world explodes   one outcome that comes to my mind is that we ease out of aggressive capital injection and move through this liquidity issue   we then pay back our debt and live on   i am sure there are many other outcomes   almost all the problems seemed to be supply side ideas   banks just wo n't lend   i would argue banks and even corporations have cash but lack demand for npv positive projects and thus are sitting on it   and or they are waiting for things to play out so they can invest with better certainty   i thought his discussion on current accounts was very good   we also need to remember in many of these countries you have weak and corrupt tax systems which make it hard to fund your way out of these issues    i only point these things out for others who may watch the video and want some counter points to what the speaker says

the ultimate reason to own stock is to receive cash or cash equivalents from the underlying security you can argue that you make money when stock is valued higher by the market but the valuation should though clearly not necessarily is be based on the expected payout of the underlying security there are only three ways money can be returned to the shareholder as you can see if you do n't ask for dividends you are basically asking for one of the top two too occur which happens in the future at the end of the company 's life as an independent entity if you think about the time value of money money in the hand now as dividends can be worth more than the ultimate appreciation of liquidation or acquisition value add in uncertainty as a factor for ultimate value and my feeling is that dividends are underpaid in today 's markets

it seems that you are misunderstanding how your taxes are calculated you seem to be under the impression that once you pass $ annual income all of your income will be taxed at 25 however in reality only the income you earn above that amount will be taxed at 25 you can use this chart to determine exactly how much federal tax you will pay   as you can see if you earned $ in a year you would only be charged 25 taxes on $ 50 and you will pay 15 on the amount between $ and $ and 10 on the amount from $ 0 to $ which is $ when summed together

in an efficient investment market the amount of risk premium would exactly offset the likelihood of loss such that over long time frames the expected return on investment would be equal for all investment options   in practice we usually see that riskier investments yield a higher long term return because the risk premium is larger than that efficient amount this is because many investors do n't have a long term time horizon and the pain of loss is greater than the reward of gain asymmetric preferences it 's also important to think about the risk reward interaction as being perceived risk to expected reward   if i 'm lending money to somebody who is likely not to pay me back i 'd want a better deal than if i were lending to somebody who is certain to pay i think that addresses your confusion but if i misinterpreted what 's you please let me know and i

i traded futures for a brief period in school using the platform now part of optionsxpress which is in turn now part of charles schwab they had a virtual trading platform and apparently still do and it was excellent since my main account was enabled for futures this carried over to the virtual account so i could trade a whole range of futures options stocks etc i spoke with optionsxpress and you do n't need to fund your acount to use the virtual trading platform however they will cancel your account after an arbitrary period of time if you do n't log in every few days according to their customer service there is no inactivity fee on your main account if you do n't fund it and make no trades i also used stock for a class and despite finding the occasional bug or website performance issue it provided a good experience i received a discount because i used it through an educational institution and customer service was quite good probably for the same reason but i do n't know if those same benefits would apply to an individual signing up for it   i signed up for about seven years ago when i was in secondary school and it 's completely free unfortunately you get what you pay for and the interface was poorly designed and slow furthermore at that time there were no restrictions that limited the number of shares you could buy to the number of outstanding shares so you could buy as many as you could afford even if you exceeded the number that physically existed while this is n't an issue for large companies it meant you could earn a killing trading highly illiquid pink sheet stocks because you could purchase billions of shares of companies with only a few thousand shares actually outstanding i do n't know if these issues have been corrected or not but at the time i and several other users took advantage of these to rack up hundreds of trillions of dollars in a matter of days so if you want a realistic simulation this is n't it   investopedia also has a stock simulator that i 've heard positive things about although i have n't used it personally

1 yes both of your scenarios would lead to earning $ 10 on the transaction at the strike date if you purchased both of them call it scenario 3 you would make $ 20 2 as to why this transaction may not be possible consider the following the call and put pricing you describe may not be available what you have actually created is called arbitrage 2 identical assets can be bought and sold at different prices leading to a zero risk gain for the investor in the real marketplace if an option to buy asset x in january cost $ 90 would an option to sell asset x in january provide $ 110   without adding additional complexity about the features of asset x or the features of the options buying a call option is the same as selling a put option well when selling a put option you do n't have the ability to choose whether the option is exercised meaning buying options has value that selling options does not but ignore that for a moment that means that you have arranged a marketplace where you would buy a call option for only $ 90 but the seller of that same option would somehow receive $ 110   for added clarity consider the following what if in your example the future price ended up being $ 200 then you could exercise your call option buying a share for $ 90 selling it for $ 200 making $ 110 profit you would not exercise your put option making your total profit $ 110 now consider what if in your example the future price ended up being $ 10 you would buy for $ 10 exercise your put option and sell for $ 110 making a profit of $ 100 you would not exercise your call option making your total profit $ 100 this highlights that if your initial assumptions existed you would earn money at least $ 20 and at most unlimited based on a skyrocketing price compared to your $ 90 put option regardless of the future price therefore such a scenario would not exist in the initial pricing of the options now perhaps there is an initial fee involved with the options where the buyer or seller pays extra money up front regardless of the future price that is a different scenario and gets into the actual nature of options where investors will arrange multiple simultaneous transactions in order to limit risk and retain reward within a certain band of future prices   as pointed out by r this fee would be very significant for a call option which had a price set below the current price typically options are sold out of the money initially which means that at the current share price at the time the option is purchased executing the option would lose you money if you purchase an in the money option the transaction cost initially would by higher than any apparent gain you might have by immediately executing the option for a more realistic options example assume that it costs $ 15 initially to buy either the call option or the put option in that case after buying both options as listed in your scenarios you would earn a profit if the share price exceeded $ 120 the $ 120 sale price less the $ 90 call option = $ 30 which is your total fee initially or dropped below $ 80 the $ 110 put price less the $ 80 purchase price = $ 30 this type of transaction implies that you expect the price to either swing up or swing down but not fall within the band between $ perhaps you might do this if there was an upcoming election or other known event which might be a failure or success and you think the market has not properly accounted for either scenario in advance i will leave further discussion on that topic arranging options of different prices to create specific bands of profitability loss to another answer or other questions which likely already exist on this site or in fact other resources because it gets more complicated after that point and is outside the root of your question

i suspect that the times you are referring to are those times when there is relatively low volumes of foreign exchange trading   lower volumes of trading make it possible for large orders to have a disproportionate effect on the market price   this implies that the times to avoid will be the times with the lowest relative volumes   this will occur on the cusp between the new york market winding down and the asia tokyo market up this will be in the hours preceding tokyo 's opening at tokyo time so the time to avoid is about tokyo time or about gmt if i 've worked out the time difference correctly foreign exchange is a 24 hour global market   although each of the three main trading centres london new york asia will operate 24 hours a day they will maintain only a skeleton staff outside of normal working hours   the time difference between london and new york is only 5 hours so there is no period of time when both centres are operating with a skeleton staff   the time difference between london and tokyo is 8 hours so again there is no period of time when both centres are operating with a skeleton staff   the time difference between new york and tokyo is 13 hours   this does include a period where both centres are operating with a skeleton staff as well as london operating on a skeleton staff   thus in the couple of hours immediately preceding tokyo 's opening for the regular trading day there is minimal coverage in each of the three main trading centres   as mentioned above this is the time when large orders can have a disproportionate effect on fx rates and so this is the time to avoid

coins are assets because its the actual money notes are liabilities because the federal reserve is obligated to pay money on these notes basically a federal reserve $ 1 note in your pocket is an i owe you from the federal reserve not money while a $ 1 susan b is not a i owe you but the actual $ 1 worth of currency coins are minted by the us government the only authority to mint coins and create physical currency in the us federal reserve does n't mint coins and does n't create physical currency in the strict sense it only prints its own obligations that are accepted as legal tender on par with coins printing more of the obligations does n't create more money as opposed to what many people are thinking and saying it only creates more liability for the federal reserve the fed covers this liabilities with the us treasury bonds which it can use to cover its debts and thus the fed notes are covered by the us government indirectly coins are no longer made of precious metals since the 1960 's last circulating coin made of silver was the 1969 50 cents coin 40 silver all the rest of the denominations stopped being made of silver after 1964 since then precious metals are only used for collectibles and

excellent analysis whale i agree with every single thing you have stated however i took great heed to one remark you made apple is a great company    apple is not a great company apple may be worse than amazon the only difference between apple and amazon is that apple knows its strength technology and does not away from it one    apple has been for a on the technology industry since its inception oh yea another thing that makes apple a shitty company keep in mind i am typing all of this on an apple phone the the fact that they store a majority of their revenue offshore in countries that practically have a zero tax on money which has allowed apple to dodge taxes in the u.s. for years it 's sad that a multi billion dollar company that operates in the u.s. with $ 250 billion in cash paying their fair share of taxes to the u.s. treasury just because they 'll be taxed at 35    could you imagine what would happen to average joe citizens like you or me if we avoided paying taxes hint this is n't a trick question

as i 've crunched numbers towards what my family could afford for a down payment in an area with similar housing costs do n't you hate that high cost of living i 've come up with the following numbers we may be missing some area of expenses but in general i think we are being fairly conservative   you should consider making a similar list to determine your comfort level spend some time with an interest calculator to know the serious pain of each dollar you are paying interest on to a lender also know that the bigger your down payment the more likely the seller is to accept your offer   it shows you are serious

when you want to invest in an asset denominated by a foreign currency your investment is going to have some currency risk to it you need to worry not just about what happens to your own currency but also the foreign currency lets say you want to invest $ 10000 in us stocks as a canadian today that will cost you $ since just hit you now have two ways you can make money one is if goes up two is if the stocks go up the former may not be obvious but remember you are holding us denominated assets currently with the intention of one day converting those assets back into cad essentially you are long long usd short cad since you are short cad if cad goes up it hurts you it may seem odd to think about this as a currency trade but it opens up a possibility if you want a foreign investment to be currency neutral you just make the opposite currency trade in addition to your original investment so in this case you would buy $ 10,000 in us stocks and then short ie long cad short usd $ 10,000 this is kind of savvy and may not be something you would do but its worth mentioning and there are also some currency hedged etfs out there that do this for you however most are hedged relative to usd and are meant to hedge the target countries currency not your own

i ca n't quite follow your question so i 'm proceeding under the following assumptions you paid £ 31,000 your partner paid £ you have at least one mortgage which you both pay equally if the relationship sell the property you are reimbursed £ 31,000 and your partner is reimbursed £ any remaining proceeds from the sale are split 50 50 if the result is a net loss i.e. you are underwater on your mortgage you split the debt 50 50 if you are not both paying the same toward the mortgage i 'd split the profit or loss according to how much you each pay toward the mortgage of course this is not the only possible way you can split things up you can use pretty much any way you both think is fair for example maybe you should get more benefits from a profit because you contributed more up front the key thing though is that you must both agree in writing in advance this is reasonable this is what i did for example note that if the relationship ends one or the other of you may wish to keep the property i 'd suggest including a clause in your written agreement simply this specify criteria to force a sale but i know lots of people are happy to allow this they treat that situation as a forced sale from both people to one person for example if your partner chooses to stay in the house he or she must buy the property from you at prevailing market rates

not exactly there are a few ways to manage your taxes with investments 1 for most investments you get taxed on any gain in value in the investment or dividends paid by that investment most investments with some exceptions for mutual funds you do n't take the tax hit until you sell the investment and realize the gain for bonds cds and other cash type investments you have to pay taxes in the year they pay out the interest or dividend 2 you can put money up to a certain limit in a traditional ira and can subtract that amount from your income for tax calculation for the year you invest it however you are going to pay taxes on it when you take the money out at retirement it really just delays the taxes 3 if you put the money in a roth ira you do n't get a tax break now but you do n't have to pay any taxes on the money or the gains when you take it out at retirement 4 the gains from some mutual funds can be tax exempt but that just saves you from paying tax on the increase in value   5 do n't fall for scams that try to use insurance policies as investments to avoid taxes the fees are which usually makes them a ripoff

i am in a different situation because i earn more than i spend but i have found that i need to make the money inaccessible if i want to really avoid spending it   i used to just throw my paychecks into a high yield savings account but eventually the balance was large enough that a large purchase did n't seem like that much because i would have had so much left in the account after the purchase   it was way too easy for me to spend way too much now i invest my savings automatically   the obvious benefit is my money has a much higher growth rate than a simple savings account especially with fed interest rates so low   i invest most of my savings in retirement accounts where there are severe penalties for withdrawing prior to retirement age   then i invest a significant portion to a regular brokerage account where the money is invested in stock and bond funds   this money is accessible within a few days of whenever i need it   the remainder of my savings goes into a savings account as cash i can get to at any time   all 3 accounts grow with every paycheck market fluctuations aside    this system helps me to categorize my savings as never ever touch retirement accounts touch only if i can wait 3 days and am willing to pay taxes brokerage account or touch whenever you need it with no penalties savings account   if my savings account grows too much i 'll move money from there to the brokerage account where it has more growth potential   the longer my money is invested in the brokerage accounts the less taxes i 'll need to pay when i sell withdraw the funds so that 's even more incentive for me to keep those funds where they are i have credit cards so in my opinion having to wait 3 days for funds from my investment account to become accessible is considered accessible in an emergency because my credit cards can be used to cover a large purchase for 3 days and as long as i pay it off within the grace period there 's no interest charged tl;dr investing is probably the smartest way to both grow your money and prevent the urge to spend it right away   my advice is to start with a 401(k or ira as soon as you can since the younger you are the more time until retirement that your money has to compound   investing $ 100 more a month can mean hundreds of thousands of additional dollars in your account when you 're ready to retire

the market surging after trump 's immediate election because traders anticipated regulatory reductions allowing companies to their operating expenses and business now they 're adjusting their expectations and positions since trump is simply not as efficient as doing the anticipated things as they would like he 's mired in scandals instead    of course this goes without saying the significant growth you have referenced is not derived from trump 's actual policies it 's derived from market reactions to his take over it 's fairly logical that an anticipated giveaway to the business sector would facilitate quick unsustainable growth i 'm sorry you 're having to reconcile that with your belief that donald is some kind of economic but he 's had less time to affect things than w. had before 911 and i bet you think that security failure was really attributable to clinton

it looks like fair market value when you receive your virtual currency is counted as income and you 're also subject to self employment tax on that income here 's an faq from the irs does a taxpayer who mines virtual currency for example uses    computer resources to validate bitcoin transactions and maintain the    public bitcoin transaction ledger realize gross income upon receipt    of the virtual currency resulting from those activities yes    when a taxpayer successfully mines virtual currency the fair market    value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible    in gross income see publication 525 taxable and nontaxable income    for more information on taxable income is an individual who    mines virtual currency as a trade or business subject to    self employment tax on the income derived from those activities    if a taxpayer ’s mining of virtual currency constitutes a trade or    business and the mining activity is not undertaken by the taxpayer    as an employee the net earnings from self employment generally    gross income derived from carrying on a trade or business less    allowable deductions resulting from those activities constitute    income and are subject to the self employment tax see    chapter 10 of publication 334 tax guide for small business for more    information on tax and publication 535 business    expenses for more information on determining whether expenses are    from a business activity carried on to make a profit you 'd of course be able to offset that income with the expense of mining the virtual currency depreciation of dedicated mining equipment electricity not sure what else edit here 's a good resource on filing taxes with bitcoin filling in the 1040 income from bitcoins and all crypto currencies is    declared as either capital gains income or ordinary income for    example from mining income ordinary income will be declared on either    your 1040 line 21 other income for an individual or within your    schedule c if you are self employed or have sole proprietor business    capital gains capital gains income or losses are declared on    schedule d. since there are no reported 1099 forms from bitcoin    exchanges you will need to include your totals with box c checked for    short term gains and with box f checked for long term gains interesting notes from that article your first example could actually be trickier than expected if you started mining before there was a monero to usd exchange also there can also be capital gains implications from using your virtual currency to buy goods which sounds like a pain to keep track of

i do n't see why it would be any harder to sell stocks or bonds than it is to sell a cd you may have   not to mention for large one time expenditures you can usually cover these with a credit card   this gives you about a month to move money around to pay your credit card off in a timely manner without incurring a charge i have had no problem getting a credit limit beyond 4 5 months of expenses for myself on a single card i ca n't even think of a household emergency that you ca n't pay for with a credit card job loss situations are not going to require large amounts of money immediately true catastrophic emergencies natural disasters however will need fast cash potentially however in this case the only thing that is good is having cash on hand as you ca n't count on atms or bank systems to be functional even more serious emergencies such as zombies the end of world or anything that involves total economic collapse would require things that are not cash you would need to invest in things like supplies shelter guns and maybe shiny metals that may have value

the strategy is right as pointed out by you will the volatility cause the premium on the price of the options to be too high to make this worthwhile this is subjective and depends on how the markets feels about the volatility and the trend ie if the market believes that the stock will go up the option at 45 would cost quite a bit less however if the market believes the stock would go down the option at 45 would be quite high and may not even be available    there is no generic right or wrong the strategy is right with out without putting dividend into equation it depends what options are available at what prices

do you have an adviser mentor for your thesis i 'd recommend talking to them about your goals and see if they have any insight they might have a better idea of your credentials capabilities etc they will also likely be one of the ones to write a letter of so it would be good to get them on board early   if you 're still at the same institution or area from your undergrad then you could probably talk to any of the finance profs you liked as well they could be helpful as well and would know more about your background   since you are doing a thesis anyways i 'd recommend trying to get it published this would be something you would want to hopefully get your mentor involved with the association of business schools abs journal rankings can give you an idea of where you might want to try to publish i 'd think anything at an abs 2 3 would be fantastic a 4 as a masters student is really unlikely but would open almost any door would really help your application although the timing is unlikely to work out assuming you are working on the thesis and also applying to phd school this year because the publication process takes a long time being able to mention in your application that you were targeting a journal or being able to provide an update that you received a revise and might really help with your application also if you end up waiting a year for phd school you 'd also have more time to get your thesis published    i 'd think the math stat background should be pretty solid even if you do n't have all the calc    a ton of your placement post phd will be determined by your phd school so if possible shoot high and try attend the best program you are accepted into rankings could give you a good idea of program strength you can also look at the faculty members cv seeing lots of abs 4 or 4 articles in their research is a good sign that it would be a strong program   i hope this helps i 'm not 100 what you mean by flagship state school if you are thinking top 20 maybe ohio state or comparable then my advice may not apply as much but if you are thinking in terms of a solid reputable state school then i think this might apply

as joetaxpayer says it 's a very rare circumstance where an early 401(k withdrawal actually makes any real economic sense your statements that one year 's salary for you is $ 60 k and the combination of your spouse 's income and yours puts you into the highest income tax bracket together lead to the conclusion that your spouse 's income is considerably higher than yours if this income will continue past your death e.g. you two are not in a joint venture that will collapse when you pass away because she can not do the work by herself then it is very definitely to your joint advantage to leave your money in a tax deferred account for as long as possible her income should be enough to cover the mortgage payments   also rather than take the money out and paying taxes at a high rate right now your   spouse can roll over the 401k money into an ira and withdraw only small amounts per year paying taxes spread over the years rather than in a lump sum

when i look at debt i try to think of myself as a corporation   in life you have a series of projects that you can undertake which may yield a positive net present value for simplicity let 's define positive net present value as a project that yields more benefit than its cost let 's say that one of the projects that you have is to build a factory to make clothing   the factory will cost 1 million dollars and will generate revenue of 1.5 million dollars over the next year it wears out although you have the knowledge to build this wonderful factory you do n't have a million bucks laying around so instead you go borrow it from the bank   the bank charges you 10 interest on the loan which means that at the end of the year the project has yielded a return of 400k this is an extremely simplified example of what you call good debt   it is good if you are taking the debt and purchasing something with a positive value in reality this should be how people should approach all purchases even if they are with cash   everything that you buy is an investment in yourself even entertainment and luxury items all could be seen as an investment in your happiness and   if more people approached their finances in this way people would have much more money to spend william

you ca n't currently avoid it the reason the legislation was introduced was to prevent the big name developers from setting up shop in a low vat country and selling apps to citizens of eu countries that would normally be paying a much higher vat   you need to register for vat and file quarterly nil returns so that you get that money back it 's a hassle but probably worth it just to recoup those funds   from an article in from late 2014 you see in the uk we have a rather sensible exemption on vat for    businesses that earn under £ a year this allows people to run    small businesses like making and selling games in your spare time    for instance without the administrative nightmare of registering as    a business and paying vat on sales unfortunately none of the other    eu member states had an exemption like this so when the new    legislation was being put together there was no exemption factored    in that means that if someone makes even £ 1 from selling something    digital to another person in another eu country they now have to be    vat registered in the uk and they have to pay tax on that sale at    whatever rate the buyer ’s country of residence has set that could be    25 in sweden 21 in the netherlands and so on there ’s one piece of good news even though anyone who sells digital    stuff now has to be vat registered in the uk they do n’t actually have    to pay vat on sales to people in the uk if they earn less than £    from it this concession was achieved earlier this month after    extensive lobbying but they ’ll still have to submit what ’s called a    nil return which is essentially a tax return with nothing on it    every quarter in order to use the vat moss service that ’s a lot of    paperwork obviously brexit may have a significant impact on all this so the rules might change   this is the official google link to how they 've implemented this and for which countries it affects   due to vat laws in the european union eu google is responsible for    determining charging and remitting vat for all google play store    digital content purchases by eu customers google will send vat for eu    customers digital content purchases to the appropriate authority you do n't need to calculate and send vat separately for eu customers    even if you 're not located in the eu this change in vat laws will    still apply

why use spreadsheets rather than writing your forms and formulas directly in a programming because you 've got better things to do than reinvent the wheel right same answer = = = = = clarification since the point apparently was n't clear using a spreadsheet means you 're writing and organizing and maintaining the formats and formulas yourself essentially you are writing your own accounting program using the spreadsheet program as your programming language nothing wrong with that it just means you 're doing work to produce something that you could have purchased instead it 's up to you to decide how the value of your time doing that work trades off against the cost of the commercial product   for many people especially as the bookkeeping becomes more complex that is n't a good investment of their time the otherwise billable time it would take them to maintain the spreadsheet is worth more than the cost of buying an off the shelf product and the product offers features that they would n't get around to adding to their own solution add to that the question of whether people find creating and tweaking spreadsheets rewarding or annoying the right tool is always the one that lets you focus on what you actually care about unless the cost is too high to justify it most folks care about getting the accounting task done a least cost least buying a solution is least effort if the real cost including time effort is also lower that 's the direction they 're going to go i maintained my own accounts and did my taxes in spreadsheets for quite some time these days the time to do so multiplied by what my time is worth would exceed the cost of buying tools and the commercial tools are more pleasant to use less prone to accidents and offer featured that i do n't need but appreciate i still use a for one small calculation rebalancing my but 's because i odd corner case the built in tool does n't handle well not that it makes any difference but being slightly off annoyed me   your milage obviously will vary use the tool that suits your needs others will do likewise

i do this often and have never had a problem   my broker is td ameritrade and they sent several emails and even called and left a message the week of expiry to remind me i had in the money options that would be expiring soon their policy is to automatically exercise all options that are at least $ .01 in the money   one email was vaguely worded but it implied that they could liquidate other positions to raise money to exercise the options   i would have called to clarify but i had no intention of exercising and knew i would sell them before expiry in general though much like with margin calls you should avoid being in the position where the broker needs to or can do anything with your account as a quick aside   i ca n't think of a scenario where you would n't be able to sell your options but you probably are aware of the huge spreads that exist for many illiquid options   you 'll be able to sell them but if you 're desperate you may have to sell at the bid price which can be significantly 25 lower than the ask   i 've found this to be common for options of even very liquid underlyings   so personally i find myself adjusting my limit price quite often near expiry   if the quote is say 3.00 i 'll try to sell with a limit of and hope someone takes my offer   if the price is not moving up and nobody is biting move down to 3.20 etc in general you should definitely talk to your broker like others have suggested   you may be able to request that they sell the options and not attempt to exercise them at the expense of other positions you have

the closest thing to a libertarian society to my mind the american revolution was relatively stable and amazingly prosperous for hundreds of years to my mind the shows that it is possible at least to some extent   the defining characteristic of a government is that the majority of people perceive their usage of aggressive force as legitimate without that sense of legitimacy no government could ever rule that is why i think that anarchy is stable coercion is just vastly more expensive than co operation without a body of people willing to pay for their own coercion organisations that seek to coerce will be at an incredible economic disadvantage   you want to be careful writing things off as impossible just because of history before the wright brothers all attempts at powered flight had failed as well we must always keep the goal in mind even if we are still unsure of how to attain it

i 'm sorry for adding another answer but it is too long for a comment it depends on the situation say you buy shares of the apple inc. and want to know what is the lost opportunity cost you need to find out what other opportunities are in other words what are the other possible types of investments you consider for example in theory you could try to invest in any company from s&p 500 but is it really possible i do n’t mean investing directly in index are you really capable of researching each company   so in your case you would consider only a few companies as alternative solutions also after different time period each choice may be your lost opportunity cost   to measure the risk you have to in conclusion i want to say that my goal was to picture in general how the process looks also this is just an exemplary answer all is about in what finance field you are interested for example in one field you use internal rate of return and in other value at risk opportunity cost is to vague to exactly tell how measure its risk of wrong anticipation it connects in every finance field and in every field you have different ways do deal with it if you specify your question more maybe someone will provide a better answer

it becomes a different game when you allow penny and ultra cheap stocks   people make much less plays because the price of the stock does n't change hardly ever and when it does change you can end up with people making 10x money over night and when that happens they sell everything and just camp on their cash till the deadline runs out   penny cheap stocks are fun but only when you start with very little money like $ 5,000 and everyone plays for them   they are a game breaker when you play the legit market   the rule is a default option when you setup a game it is n't something random i made up

first of all the only thing they can do to force you to pay is sue you if they do n't sue you then they ca n't force you to do anything all they have right now is just a written agreement you signed promising to pay that by itself does n't have legal power to take money from you the worst they can do without suing you is put negative information on your credit report which has probably already happened anyway if they sue you within the statute of limitations they will almost certainly win and get a judgment against you because you did agree to pay with that judgment the court can force you to reveal your income and asset information and they can take the judgment to do things like seize money from your bank accounts and/or garnish your wages and the judgment does not go away however if you have no money in the bank and/or income they ca n't take any money from you because you have none they ca n't take more from you than you have in other words if you have no money or income and wo n't have money or income soon the judgment they can get by suing you and winning is n't worth the paper it 's on since serving you and suing you takes money and effort they will make a calculation on whether it is worth suing you based on the amount of debt and what amount of money they think they can get from you based on what they know about you this is the reason why you may not be sued at all if they calculate that it is not worth it and also why they may offer you a settlement for a lesser amount because is saves the cost of suing and the risk that they wo n't be able to get you to pay the amount you mentioned several thousand dollars may be small enough for it to be not worth it another thing is the statute of limitations i mentioned earlier which varies by state and is several years long if they sue you after the statute of limitations passes then you can raise the statute of limitations and get the lawsuit dismissed so basically after this amount of time passes you are pretty much free from this debt note that the statute of limitations resets if you acknowledge the debt which includes paying any amount on the debt or agreeing that you owe them this debt so if the collection agency ever offers you benefits if you just sign a promissory note or just pay a token amount do n't fall for the trap they are trying to reset the statute of limitations even though it 's true that you owe them the debt never let them hear you acknowledging it unless it 's part of a final settlement finally if they get a judgment against you and you do n't want them to have the ability to take your money indefinitely in the future until the debt is satisfied there may be the option of bankruptcy however a few thousand dollars may not be worth the cost and negative consequences of bankruptcy since as a young man you should be able to earn that amount quickly whenever you start working

warhol and rare wine collection the yacht is listed for $ million the yacht is listed for $ million photo by aug. 10 2017 a.m. et 158 comments goldman sachs group inc. gs owns hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks bonds and commodities add to its portfolio a luxury yacht called natita   the story behind the boat begins with a 2014 loan to a prized goldman client billionaire texas william kallop it ends with goldman suing its own client and the u.s. last month down on a west palm beach marina to the yacht which boasts a movie theater and   goldman ’s is a strange but inevitable outcome of wall street ’s latest gold rush lending to wealthy clients the loans backed by everything from to wine   these loans which are growing quickly at firms such as goldman morgan stanley and ubs group ag are an exotic spin on the most basic thing banks do lending money to people they have the added benefit of building loyalty among prized clientele   related   wall street needs you to borrow against your stock july 27 like any loans though they can go bad and leave banks holding assets that are n’t easy to value or sell goldman will likely auction natita which already has been on the market for almost two years with no takers   a goldman spokesman declined to comment on the case mr. kallop did n’t respond to requests for comment a lawyer for mr. kallop declined to comment   if you do it right it ’s a great business and clients will absolutely love you for it said bruce a partner at the boston consulting group who advises private banks on wealth management strategy but there are a lot of ways to mess up   banks pushed wealth lending in recent years against a of increasing deposits and demand for traditional loans goldman ’s private bank has its overall lending balances since 2012 to $ 29 billion morgan stanley wealth loan balances are up 420 since 2012 to $ 74 billion   the largest chunk of wealth loans are mortgages and loans backed by stock portfolios a smaller but growing segment is secured by valuables such as classic cars hedge fund stakes and even rare   wealth loans are especially profitable for banks because the revenue they generate is shared less generously with brokers than trading commissions and other fees   banks say these loans are safe because they already know the borrowers their assets and their ability to repay and unlike say credit cards these loans have collateral and often a personal guarantee as well goldman said in a february filing that the value of collateral in its wealth loans generally the loan amount   morgan stanley and deutsche bank ag have lent against the art collection of hedge fund billionaire steven a. cohen who owns works by andy warhol and according to connecticut state filings top group lp executives

to property record lawsuits and people who have worked for him   and he bought yachts at least seven of them over the past eight years   in addition to natita which he bought in 2010 and named for his mother in law mr. kallop ’s fleet includes bad girl in the dominican republic and honey a used by president john f. kennedy that he bought at ’s auction in 1998 and restored   another yacht la which was once owned by trump was destroyed in a fire   a few years ago goldman came calling the wall street firm ’s private bank manages some $ 450 billion in assets for 11,500 clients and was developed in

according to the options industry council put options   the shares and therefore the options may continue trading otc but if the shares completely stop trading then if the courts cancel the shares whereby common shareholders receive nothing calls will become worthless and an investor who exercises a put would receive 100 times the strike price and deliver nothing the reason for this is that it is not the company whose shares you have the option on that you have a contract with but the counterparty who wrote the option if the counterparty goes bankrupt then you may not get paid out depending on assets available at liquidation this is counterparty risk but unless the two are the same if the company whose shares you have a put option on declares bankruptcy then you will get paid

my recommendation is to pay off your student loans as quickly as possible it sounds like you 're already doing this but do n't incur any other large debts until you have this taken care of   i 'd also recommend not buying a car especially an expensive one on credit or lease either back during the dotcom boom i and many friends bought or leased expensive cars only to lose them or struggle paying for them when the bottom dropped out a car instantly depreciates and it 's quite rare for them to ever gain value again stick with reliable older used cars that you can purchase for cash if you do borrow for a car shop around for the best deal and avoid 3 + year terms if at all possible do n't lease unless you have a business structure where this might create a clear financial advantage avoid credit cards as much as possible although if you do plan to buy a house with a mortgage you 'll need to maintain some credit history if you have the discipline to keep your balance small and paid down you can use a credit card to build credit history however these things can quickly get out of hand and you 'll wonder why you suddenly owe $ 10 k $ 20 k or even more on them so be very careful with them as for the house speaking of us markets here save up for at least a 20 down payment if you can based on what you said this would be about $ 20 25k. this will give you a lot more flexibility to take advantage of deals that might come your way even if you do n't put it all into the house stretching to buy a house that 's too expensive can quickly lead to financial ruin as for house size i recommend purchasing a 4 bedroom house even if you are n't planning on kids right away it will resell better and you 'll appreciate having the extra space for storage home office hobbies etc also life has a way of changing your plans for having kids and such

freezing your credit should be the default configuration     edit   more info on why   basically you 're adding a password to your credit report access     4 is there a low cost alternative to monitoring services   the best low cost alternative to credit monitoring services is a security freeze a security freeze locks your credit files at the three credit reporting agencies equifax experian and transunion until you unlock your file with a password or pin the freeze stops new accounts from being established by because potential creditors are not able to check your credit report or credit score the standard procedure when financial accounts are opened any potential requests for access to your credit files will be denied   however a security freeze can not stop misuse of your existing bank or credit accounts you still must check the monthly statements on your current accounts for any erroneous charges or debits   generally you will pay no more than $ 30 for a lifetime of security freeze protection in some circumstances identity theft victims and senior citizens in some states this protection may be free   with a security freeze your credit reports can not be seen by prospective creditors insurance companies landlords utilities or for employment screening however you may lift the freeze when necessary to allow a company to check your credit report this is easily done by means of a password it is important to realize that a security freeze does not prevent existing creditors from seeing your credit report    while a security freeze may be the best available deterrent to new account fraud it may not be the best solution for everyone it can be cumbersome for individuals who frequently apply for credit are contemplating a new mortgage or who plan to change jobs on the other hand a security freeze is particularly well suited for seniors who are no longer in the market for new credit and a freeze provides protection for individuals affected by data breaches involving social security numbers as well as victims of identity theft or mail theft for a more complete discussion of the pros and cons of security freezes read this report in consumer reports   brian post how i learned to stop worrying and embrace the security freeze is a primer on what you can do to avoid becoming a victim of identity theft   fees supporting documentation and procedures for placing a security freeze vary from state to state and among the three credit reporting agencies the web sites of each of the credit reporting agencies provide state specific instructions for placing a security freeze the websites of each of the credit reporting agencies provide state specific instructions for placing a security freeze   equifax experian transunion

bigco is selling new shares and receives the money from venturo if venturo is offering $ 250k for 25 of the company then the valuation that they are agreeing on is a value of $ 1 m for the company after the new investment is made   if jack is the sole owner of one million shares before the new investment then bigco sells shares to venturo for $ 250k   the new total number of shares of bigco is venturo holds 25 and jack holds 75 the amount that jack originally invested in the company is irrelevant   at the moment of the sale the venturo and jack agree that jack 's stake is worth $ 750k   the value of jack 's stake may have gone up but he owes no capital gains tax because he has n't realized any of his gains yet   jack has n't sold any of his stake   you might think that he has because he used to hold 100 and now he holds 75   however the difference is that the company is worth more than was before the sale   so the value of his stake was unchanged immediately before and after the sale jack agrees to this because the company needs this additional capital in order to meet its potential see why is stock dilution legal for further explanation and another example of this see the question if a startup receives investment money does the startup founder owner actually gain anything your other scenario where venturo purchases existing shares directly from jack is not practical in this situation   if jack sells his existing shares you are correct that the company does not gain any additional capital   an investor would not want to invest in the company this way because the company is struggling and needs new capital

i would not prepay a loan with a rate with just a tiny bit of inflation that 's nearly free money i would always seek to first max out a tax deferred savings program before making investments that are not receiving preferential tax treatment outside of emergency money which you say is already dealt with   especially since you effectively get an immediate return on the investment = to your marginal tax rate   or to look at it another way it takes a much smaller amount of money out of pocket in order to make the investment every thousand you could put into a tax deferred account now is generally equivalent to putting in several times that amount 20 years from now otoh once you 've maxed out the tax deferred savings or if you need to set aside money for large purchase with a big time horizon that is short of retirement age then making regular monthly investments in a no load index fund with a quality company is a great way to go as you will be taking advantage of dollar cost averaging and a good deal of diversity which is a great way to put money into the market   just make sure you are investing in a fairly broad index such as the s&p500 and not a little 30 stock index like the dow

no one can really answer this for you   it is a matter of personal preference and the details of your situation   there are some really smart people on here when placed in your exact situation would do completely different things   personal finance is overall personal if it was me i 'd never borrow money in retirement   if i had the cash i 'd use it to help fund the purchase   if i did n't i simply would n't   for me wealth retention in your case is surprisingly more about behavior than math even though i am a math guy   you are simply creating a great deal of risk at a season in your life with a diminished ability to recover from negative events   in my opinion you are inviting tales of woe to be part of your future if you borrow others would disagree with me   they would point to the math and show how you would be much better off on borrowing instead of pulling out of investments provided a sufficient return on your nest egg   they may even have a case as you might have to pay taxes on money pulled out magnifying the difference in net income on borrowing versus pulling out in a lump sum   here in the us the money you pulled out would be taxed at the highest marginal rate   to help with a down payment of 50 k you might have to pull out to pay the taxes and have enough for the down payment the third option is to not help with a down payment or to help them in a different way   perhaps giving them a few hundred per month for two years to help with their mortgage payment   maybe watch their kids some to reduce day care costs or help with home improvements so they can buy a lower price home   those are all viable options   perhaps the child is not ready to buy a home having said all that it really depends on your situation   say your sitting on 5 million in investments your pensions is sufficient to have some disposable income and they are asking for a relatively small amount   then pull the money out and do n't be concerned   you nest egg will quickly recover the money

as you own a company you need to know what your role is you can never just move money into or out of the company you have to identify the role in which you are doing it and do it properly   there is company and there is you in three different roles you are the sole shareholder and director of company you are the sole employee of company you are also just a private person you need to keep these three roles separate as the sole shareholder you own the company however you do n't own any assets of the company the company is yours but the money in its bank account is n't   as a private person you give a loan to your company you write on a sheet of paper that you personally give a loan to the company how much a loan is what interest is paid and when the loan will be paid back that could be whenever you demands the money paid back then you move the money from your private bank account to the company bank account and the company has the money it needs to fund its operation assume it was n't you who loaned the money but i gave the loan to the company you can imagine that i would have this loan written down and signed before i hand over the cash and you must have exactly the same papers that i would have   how do you get money from the company the company can pay back your loan that should be written down again in the same way as the loan itself was written down other than that there are three ways how you can get money out of the company the company can pay you in your role as its employee a salary which it can deduct from its profits the company can pay money into a pension of the company director that 's you in your role as company director up to £ 40,000 or so a year that money is deducted from its profits again the company pays 20 tax on its remaining profits then the company can pay you in your role as company director a dividend usually twice a year each of these payments has to be written down and given to hmrc properly   best by far to use an accountant to do all the paper work for you and advice you what to do you can lose a lot of money by just not getting the paperwork right by filing late etc which the accountant will get right the accountant will also tell you what are the optimal amounts for salary and dividend best is a small salary about £ 10,000 a year dividend of about £ 30,000 a year pension as much as the company can afford which is then all tax free to you you ca n't pay more dividend then the company can afford paying a dividend and then not being able to pay your suppliers is criminal and if you want higher dividends then you will have to pay taxes on them

investopedia has this note where you 'd want the point the interest rate commonly about by the media has a wide and    varied impact upon the economy when it is raised the general effect    is a lessening of the amount of money in circulation which works to    keep inflation low it also makes borrowing money more expensive    which affects how consumers and businesses spend their money this    increases expenses for companies lowering earnings somewhat for those    with debt to pay finally it tends to make the stock market a    slightly less attractive place to investment as for evidence i 'd question that anyone could really take out all the other possible economic influences to prove a direct co relation between the federal funds rate and the stock market returns   for example of the dozens of indices that are stock related which ones would you want that evidence total market large cap small cap value stocks growth stocks tech utilities reits etc   this is without considering other possible investment choices such as direct real estate holdings compared to reits that is precious metals and collectibles that could also be used

it 's a problem from hell because all solutions have drawbacks unintended consequences and because they are all pretty complex to implement in practice   breaking up the big banks so that no bank is enough to bring down the economy with it is the strongest move but is riddled with problems when you start looking at it practically how do you determine the maximum size a bank should have should it be based on assets systemic importance i.e. interconnectedness with other banks how do you enforce it banks will find ways to offload assets etc into special purpose corporations to get around the laws somehow how do you compensate for the fact that size does help financial efficiency in some ways   imposing higher capital requirements is the next solution but that too is not so easy to implement with full success in practice what should be classified as a low risk asset how much capital do you require against a cdo vs a mexican government bond how often do you need to revise these standards at what point does the cost of higher capital requirements start to strangle lending and financial flows   the weaker maneuvers are things like constant government imposed stress tests orderly resolution mechanisms higher standards for internal risk management practices etc but those may not be adequate and also have their implementation problems

let 's start from the premise that the mortgage is something you will have anyway because you need it to live as opposed to say getting a bigger mortgage initially in the expectation of paying it down faster than scheduled in that case i think paying down a mortgage certainly is an investment one with a well defined interest rate and maturity that depends on the precise terms of the mortgage for example i have a uk mortgage that 's fixed for the next two years at about 5 and allows overpayments of £ 500 per month which can be withdrawn at any time so i treat those overpayments as equivalent to savings with quite a nice interest rate especially since mortgage interest is n't tax deductible and so i actually get the full benefit of that interest rate

my super fund and i would say many other funds give you one free switch of strategies per year   some suggest you should change from high growth option to a more balance option once you are say about 10 to 15 years from retirement and then change to a more capital guaranteed option a few years from retirement this is a more passive approach and has benefits as well as disadvantages the benefit is that there is not much work involved you just change your investment option based on your life stage 2 to 3 times during your lifetime this allows you to take more risk when you are young to aim for higher returns take a balanced approach with moderate risk and returns during the middle part of your working life and take less risk with lower returns above inflation during the latter part of your working life a possible disadvantage of this strategy is you may be in the higher higher growth option during a market correction and then change to a more balanced option just when the market starts to pick up again so your funds will be hit with large losses whilst the market is in retreat and just when things look to be getting better you change to a more balanced portfolio and miss out on the big gains a second more active approach would be to track the market and change investment option as the market changes one approach which should n't take much time is to track the index such as the asx200 if you investment option is mainly invested in the australian stock market with a 200 day simple moving average sma the concept is that if the index crosses above the 200 day sma the market is bullish and if it crosses below it is bearish see the chart below   this strategy will work well when the market is trending up or down but not very well when the market is going sideways as you will be changing from aggressive to balanced and back too often possibly a more appropriate option would be a combination of the two use the first passive approach to change investment option from aggressive to balanced to capital guaranteed with your life stages however use the second active approach to time the change for example if you were say in your late 40s now and were looking to change from aggressive to balanced in the near future you could wait until the asx200 crosses below the 200 day sma before making the change this way you could capture the majority of the uptrend which could go on for years before changing from the high growth aggressive option to the balanced option if you where after more control over your superannuation assets another option open to you is to start a smsf however i would recommend having at least $ 300 k to $ 400 k in assets before starting a smsf or else the annual costs would be too high as a percentage of your total super assets

when you invest in an s&p500 index fund that is priced in usd the only major risk you bear is the risk associated with the equity that comprises the index since both the equities and the index fund are priced in usd the fund in your question however is priced in eur for a fund like this to match the performance of the s&p500 which is priced in usd as closely as possible it needs to hedge against fluctuations in the eur usd exchange rate if the fund simply converted eur to usd then invested in an s&p500 index fund priced in usd the eur priced fund may fail to match the usd priced fund because of exchange rate fluctuations here is a simple example demonstrating why hedging is necessary i assumed the current value of the usd priced s&p500 index fund is 1,600 usd share the exchange rate is 1.3 usd eur if you purchase one share of this index using eur you would pay eur share   if the s&p500 increases 10 to usd share and the exchange rate remains unchanged the value of the your investment in the eur fund also increases by 10 both sides of the equation are multiplied by 1.1   however the currency risk comes into play when the eur usd exchange rate changes take the 10 increase in the price of the usd index occurring in tandem with an appreciation of the eur to 1.4 usd eur   although the usd priced index gained 10 the appreciation of the eur means that the eur value of your investment is almost unchanged from the first equation for investments priced in eur that invest in securities priced in usd the presence of this additional currency risk mandates the use of a hedge if the indexes are going to track the fund you linked to uses swap contracts which i discuss in detail below to hedge against fluctuations in the eur usd exchange rate since these derivatives are n't free the cost of the hedge is included in the expenses of the fund and may result in differences between the s&p500 index and the s&p 500 euro hedged index   also it 's important to realize that any time you invest in securities that are priced in a different currency than your own you take on currency risk whether or not the investments aim to track indexes this holds true even for securities that trade on an exchange in your local currency like adr 's or gdr 's i wrote an answer that goes through a simple example in a similar fashion to the one above in that context so you can read that for more information on currency risk in that context   there are several ways to investors be they institutional or individual can hedge against currency risk ishares offers an etf that tracks the s&p500 euro hedged index and uses a over the counter currency swap contract called a month forward fx contract to hedge against the associated currency risk in these contracts two parties agree to swap some amount of one currency for another amount of another currency at some time in the future this allows both parties to effectively lock in an exchange rate for a given time period a month in the case of the ishares etf and therefore protect themselves against exchange rate fluctuations in that period   there are other forms of currency swaps equity swaps etc that could be used to hedge against currency risk in general two parties agree to swap one quantity like a eur cash flow payments of a fixed interest rate etc for another quantity like a usd cash flow payments based on a floating interest rate etc in many cases these are over the counter transactions there is n't necessarily a standardized definition   for example if the european manager of a fund that tracks the s&p500 euro hedged index is holding euros and wants to lock in an effective exchange rate of 1.4 usd eur above the current exchange rate he may find another party that is holding usd and wants to lock in the respective exchange rate of eur usd the other party could be an american fund manager that manages a usd price fund that tracks the ftse by swapping usd and eur both parties can at a price lock in their desired exchange rates   i want to clear up something else in your question too it 's not correct that the s&p 500 is completely unrelated to the euro far from it there are many cases in which the eur usd exchange rate and the level of the s&p500 index could be related for example troublesome economic news in europe could cause the euro to depreciate against the dollar as european investors flee to safety e.g. invest in treasury bills however this economic news could also cause us investors to feel that the global economy wo n't recover as soon as hoped which could affect the s&p500   if the euro appreciated against the dollar for whatever reason this could increase profits for us businesses that earn part of their profits in europe if a us company earns 1 million eur and the exchange rate is 1.3 usd eur the company earns 1.3 million usd if the euro appreciates against the dollar to 1.4 usd eur in the next quarter and the company still earns 1 million eur they now earn 1.4 million usd even without additional sales the us company earned a higher usd profit which is reflected on their financial statements and could increase their share price thus affecting the s&p500 combining examples 1 and 2 if a us company earns some of its profits in europe and a recession hits in the eu two things could happen simultaneously a the company 's sales decline as european consumers scale back their spending and b the euro depreciates against the dollar as european investors sell euros and invest in safer securities denominated in other currencies usd or not the company suffers a loss in profits both from decreased sales and the depreciation of the eur   there are many more factors that could lead to correlation between the euro and the s&p500 or more generally the european and american economies the balance of trade investor and consumer confidence exposure of banks in one region to sovereign debt in another the spread of asset mortgage backed securities from us financial firms to european banks companies municipalities etc all play a role   one example of this last point comes from this article which includes an interesting line among the victims of america ’s subprime crisis are eight municipalities in norway which lost a total of $ 125 million through subprime mortgage related investments long story short these municipalities had mortgage backed securities in their investment portfolios that were derived from far down the line subprime mortgages on us homes i do n't know the specific cities but it really demonstrates how interconnected the world 's economies are when an american family 's payment on their subprime mortgage in say chicago can end up backing a derivative investment in the investment portfolio of say norway

since we are talking about retirement accounts i would n't worry too much about what your income will be in the next 10 years or so i 'd recommend basing your contributions primarily on what your likely income tax bracket at or near retirement age will be compared to 25 today i do n't think that optimizing for the next three years will make a significant difference given the uncertainty of the tax code as well as your income in the future however it may make a difference to your planning whether you are going to grad school for an compared to an however as to what your expected income tax bracket will be

does the money lending between us need to be reported in our tax    reports no will he be taxed more because of lending the money to me yes will i be taxed more because of borrowing the money from him no how shall we report it so as to minimize our taxes you can not what is reported on your tax returns is the income a loan is not an income so nothing gets reported however when you repay the loan assuming it has interest the lender has income the interest interest income is reported on schedule b of the regular tax return or in the case of non resident for tax purposes on line 9 of 1040nr it is taxed as ordinary income and since you 're both foreigners the lender should look into the treaty provisions that might be relevant generally it is not exempt from taxable income based on treaty exemptions for students which is only for earned income but there might be other rules in the treaty regarding interest income if there 's no fair market or higher interest then there 's assumed interest at the irs mandated rates which is considered a gift if it amounts to more than the yearly gift exemption the lender may be liable for gift tax depending on the lender 's and your status and again see treaties loan without an obligation to repay and without actual repaying will also be considered a gift for tax purposes if the lender has no intentions of having the loan repaid i.e. making a gift it will be better to pay your tuition bills instead of actually giving you the money tuition is exempt from gift tax talk to a cpa ea licensed in your state for a proper tax advice on this issue

you owe taxes to the state where you earned the income and also to the state where you physically live most maybe all states have laws that let you claim credits for taxes paid to other states so that you 're not paying double taxes by living in one state while working in another most states have deals with all their neighboring states so that you only have to file taxes in one for example i live in michigan and michigan borders ohio lots of people who live near the border live in one state but work in the other so the two have a deal that anyone who lives in michigan but works in ohio just has to file a michigan tax return and pay michigan taxes and anyone who lives in ohio and works in michigan just has to pay ohio taxes oh i should note that these adjacent state deals apply only to employment income not business income if you own a business in another state you 'll still have to file taxes in that state you still should get tax credits in your residence state in general the fact that you use a server in another state does n't make you liable for taxes in that state i understand that new york says that if you work from home and the company headquarters is in new york you have to pay new york taxes maybe there are a few other states who do this but just because a server is in their state i 've never heard of this if i order business supplies that are shipped from a warehouse in arizona that does n't make me liable for arizona income taxes etc   you are legally a resident of the state where you actually live if you have a home and live in it most of the time then you are a resident of the state where that home is a home does n't have to be a house it could be an apartment an rv that you live in in a trailer park a tent etc if you do n't own any sort of fixed home and you travel around a lot this could be tricky you mentioned oklahoma oklahoma defines resident as follows   an oklahoma resident is a person domiciled in this state for the entire tax year domicile is the place established as a person ’s true fixed and permanent home it is the place you intend to return whenever you are away as on     vacation abroad business assignment educational leave or military assignment a domicile once established remains until a new one is adopted i 'm not sure that that clears things up for you you ca n't just pick a state with low taxes and claim that as your residence no way is the state where you actually live going to accept that if you are in an ambiguous situation like you spend 6 months per year in state a and 6 months in state b and you have no fixed home in either maybe you stay at or live in your minivan you might get away with picking the state with the most favorable tax laws as your residence but if you spend 7 months in state a and 5 months in state b state a will almost surely claim you are a resident and owe them taxes if you regularly wander the country never spend more than a few days in any one place and rarely come back to the same place twice then you have a complicated situation and you probably need to talk to a tax lawyer

# 506448
i believe the answer to your question boils down to a discussion of tax strategies and personal situation both now and in the future   as a result it 's pretty hard to give a concrete example to the question as asked right now for example if your tax rate now is likely to be higher than your tax rate at retirement it is for most people than putting the higher growth etf in a retirement fund makes some sense   but even then there are other considerations however if the opposite is true which could happen if your income is growing so fast that your retirement income looks like it will be higher than your current income than you might want the flexibility of holding all your etfs in your non tax advantaged brokerage account so that if you do incur capital gains they are paid at prevailing presumably lower tax rates    i assume you meant a brokerage account rather than a savings account since you usually ca n't hold etfs in a savings account i also want to mention that a holding in a corp account is n't necessarily taxed twice   it depends on the corporation type and the type of distribution   for example s corps pay no federal income tax themselves instead the owners pay taxes when money is distributed to them as personal income   which means you could trickle out the earnings from an holdings there such that it keeps you under any given federal tax bracket assuming it 's your only personal income    this might come in handy when retired for example    also distribution of the holdings as dividends would incur cap gains tax rates rather than personal income tax rates one thing i would definitely say any holdings in a roth account ira 401k will have no future taxes on earnings or distributions unless the gov't changes its mind   thus putting your highest total return etf there would always be the right move

so here 's the sad truth he might actually be making a return on his investment not because it 's right or because the system works but in all these schemes there are a range of people that actually do make money   in addition to that there is that fact that he believes that he is doing a good thing and is unwilling to discuss it   so if he is making even a tiny return and really believes that he is making a large return or that that large return is just around the bend your never going to convince him otherwise   you have two real options if he will listen go though and look at money in money out if money out is larger then money in your screwed   make sure to point out that he should look at real money in left a bank account and real money out deposited to a bank account again be prepared for the fact that he is actually making money some people in the pyramid will make money it 's just never as much or as many people as they make it out to be   do n't attack the system attack other aspects try and argue liquidity or fdic insurance again not trying to show why the system is bad but why a investment in foo instead may be better if nothing else go with diversify never put all your money in one spot even if it 's a really good spot at least in that case he will have some money left over in the end that said your friend may not go for it may just put on blinders and may just stick finger in ears move to option two respect his wishes and set boundaries ok i hear you you like system x i wo n't bring it up again do me a favor do n't you bring it up again either let 's just leave this with religion and politics if he continues to bring it up then when he does just point out you agreed not to discuss the issue and if he continues to push it rethink your friendship if you both respect one another you should be able to respect each others decisions   if you ca n't then sadly you may need to stop spending time with one another

as for income tax purposes 's answer is correct the entire amount that is converted is post tax you had to pay tax on any pre tax amounts upon conversion so you do not pay tax on it when you withdraw it in a non qualified distribution similar to with contributions however there 's another perhaps more important consideration here the early withdrawal penalty for non qualified distributions from roth ira for non qualified distributions of contributions there is never an early withdrawal penalty for non qualified distributions of rollovers and conversions there is an early withdrawal penalty if withdrawn within 5 years of the rollover or conversion but only on the part of the rollover or conversion that was taxable during the conversion so if you want to withdraw within 5 years of the conversion then it works differently from direct contributions because contributions and conversions have different treatment for the penalty the ordering between them matters too contributions are always withdrawn before rollovers and conversions a later contribution still comes before an earlier rollover or conversion but within rollovers and conversions they are ordered by year an earlier rollover or conversion comes before a later one and within a year the taxable part is ordered before the non taxable part

there is no relationship between the government appraisal and the mortgage appraisal   the loan appraisal is done by a lender to determine if the property value is in agreement with the loan amount the government appraisal is done to determine how much to charge you in taxes they use the values of residences and commercial property to get their operating budget each year they also set the rate to generate the amount of income money they need if they cut all appraisals in half they would just double the rate in some jurisdictions the government appraises every year in other places every three years some only when the property is sold in some jurisdictions the maximum increase or decrease in government appraisal is set by law but then they reset after the house is sold that being said use this time to review the appraisal from the government they may have facts wrong they may think you have a pool or more bedrooms or a garage when you do n't some jurisdictions use an automated process others do a more detailed individual process if there was a mistake ten years ago with the description it will never get caught unless you complain   check with the website for how to appeal some have windows of opportunity for an appeal

i may be missing something here but i do n't think this is a disadvantage the fact that the employer contribution will be taxed is the same as it would be if it were a match in a traditional account so the amount you lose to taxes on it is a wash the employer contribution is only smaller if you ca n't afford to contribute as much to the roth because it 's post tax and therefore your contribution is under the cap for the match if you 're contributing the maximum the employer will match or higher then i do n't think there 's any disadvantage on the match portion first the 5 cap on employer contributions is calculated on the gross even in a roth account second the taxing of the amount contributed to a roth does not reduce the dollar amount that goes into the roth account it just reduces your net pay so if your contribution is $ 100 to a traditional account your gross pay is reduced by $ 100 and your traditional account gains $ 100 in the roth your gross pay is still taxed as though that $ 100 were included but the $ 100 is put into the roth the tax portion of that after tax money does not reduce the amount of the contribution

how about opening a coffee shop section in the to generate some cash flow per month to offset some of the expenses   off course success of this venture will depend on where the location of shop is how big it is   and whether people are coffee enthusiast in that region since the rent mortgage the major expense is already taken care of all you have to do is invest in one time expenses for interior hip these days rustic expose brick walls light chalk board menu etc      seating big communal table lounge couch some regular table chairs some out door seats if weather is good and the ugly and approval throw in some social media marketing seo yelp etc if the bookstore is old i am assuming it might have the old world charm character which could attract lot of coffee enthusiast the unique and competitive edge of this coffee shop could be its historic charm which no other competitor can achieve would definitely beat the even if no one shows up only recurring additional expense will be wages the interior seating and coffee m c costs can be minimized by shopping stuff on community sites like craigslist etc i beleive if you are in us everything could be set up under later on food items like raw balls sandwich etc can be added if one has 3 key ingredients in food industry location vibe and taste then there is high probability that they will succeed at the same time one should be cognizant that 95 of business fail in first 3 years and therefore they should have an exit plan unfortunately if your business does not work then you exit cost would be just getting rid of the equipment furniture just to put in perspective some dunkin shops that i was researching in north east were clearing between 1/2 to 1 mil per year   as it is the current damage per month is 10k if this business offsets even some of the damage it would be worth while so the cost of keeping the pride of 91 yo dad can potentially reduce from 10k to 2 3 k. who knows if it takes off one day it could be a good sustainable business and might turn into a win win situation for you and your father i have made lot of assumption without knowing the facts you are located in us you have risk appetite   is not in industrial area but some prime retail area like this   etc while i am at it giving unsolicited advise that is currently the books in the are very old books that it published by itself nobody is interested in reading these books due to his previous excitement of getting editors and publishing books there are thousands of books that need to be kept in they do n’t move because people hardly buy any books from this to help the old published book sales why not convert the old books to ebooks using providers like book scanning   and publish the books on   amazon kindle itunes play store the books will be available online forever and they might get exposure to tons of book enthusiast around the world i heard at one of our client 's mds mass system project they had in house robot scanning machine like pardon me if none of the above gibberish applies to your situation but   se community might have some fun reading this for   kicks and giggles cheers and good luck source i am us person in australia operated restaurant bar in us visited 100 's of coffee shops consulting for living and a hard not to imagine from the short

the segment only briefly talked about the economic aspect of this    i feel a lot of this has to do with the fact that tech companies are ip heavy as supposed to capital heavy this makes them more flexible to enter new markets it is somewhat for a non tech company to go into a market in a different vertical e.g. amazon going into movie making    also i much rather the government tackle cable utilities monopoly first as that market is already anti consumer even on price tech is still pro consumer on price just anti consumer on choice

arguably the only reason the us can print dollar without massive repercussions on devaluing it is because of it is the world 's reserve currency backed by oil this has allowed to us to build the world 's biggest and most powerful army because they can easily borrow money to fund it everyone needs oil for their economy therefore everyone needs dollars

i 've been using for quite awhile also used associated with canadian forex probably as well has slightly better rates than i 've gotten at so i 've been using them primarily   that said i am in the process of opening an account at currencyfair because it appears that i 'll be able to exchange money at better rates there   charges me 1.5 off the rate you see at xe.com which is the fx conversion fee i believe there are no fees other than the spread charged   i think the reason currencyfair may be able to do better is because the exchange is based on the peer to peer trade so you could theoretically get a deal better than xe.com   i 'll update my answer here after i 've been using currencyfair for awhile and let you know   they theoretically guarantee no worse than 0.5 though + $ 4.00 withdrawal so i think it 'll save me quite a bit of money

i do a lot of work in gsuite but is it really a good replacement for excel i find the limiting at best in comparison and i do n't think there are good alternatives to and in gsuite there are a handful of things google sheets offers that excel does n't but overall i find it fairly limiting   if you 're referring to just basic computing than yes google sheets will get you there but i do n't think they 're comparable yet i could be 100 wrong and just not know the gsuite alternatives to these tho

i 've done this in az it 's important to know which lender is foreclosing because if it 's not the most senior one then your purchase can later be foreclosed a foreclosure all junior interests but can itself be extinguished by a more senior interest i may not have the correct terms here but you get the idea you should also check to be sure property taxes are current they are probably being paid by the original lender but it would n't hurt to check make sure you understand the requirements for participation in the auction in my case they required that i bring a $ 10 k cashier 's check made out to myself on winning the auction i endorsed the check over to the auction company and had to come up with the remaining funds in cash the property i bought had been previously sold at a sheriff 's sale to satisfy a judgment in favor of the homeowner 's association for delinquent dues the hoa bought the property at the auction and received a sheriff 's deed at this point the original owner 's interest in the property was extinguished nevertheless the original mortgage and deed of trust were still in place being senior to the hoa 's interest about a year later the lender foreclosed on the property and i bought it at auction at the courthouse this had the effect of the hoa 's interest a fact that took some explaining to the water utility to get the account in my name

you 're asking whether the shares you sold while being a us tax resident are taxable in the us the answer is yes they are how you acquired them or what were the circumstances of the sale is irrelevant when you acquired them is relevant to the determination of the tax treatment short or long term capital gains you report this transaction on your schedule d follow the instructions make sure you can substantiate the cost basis properly based on how much you paid for the shares you sold the taxable income recognized to you at vest

i assume you 've no debt if you do then pay that off i 'd be tempted to put the money into property   if you look at property prices over the past 20 years or so you can see returns can be very good   i bought a house in 1998 and sold it in 2003 for about 110 of the purchase price   disclaimer past performance is no guarantee of future returns it 's a fairly low risk option property prices appear to be rising currently and it 's always good to get your foot on the housing ladder as quickly as you can as prices can rise to the stage where even those earning quite a good salary can not afford to buy of course you do n't have to live in the house a rental income can be very handy without tying you down too much there are plenty of places in the uk where £ 60k will buy you a reasonable property with a rental income of £ it have to be near where you live currently just to put a few more figures in if you get a house for £ 50k and rent it for £ 400 a month perfectly feasible where i live then that 's very close to a 10 return year on year   plus any gains made by the price of the house the main downside is you wo n't have easy access to the money and you will have to look after a tenant if you decide to rent it out   also if you do buy a property make sure it is in a good state of repair you do n't want to have to pay for a new roof for example in a couple of years time ideally you would then sell the house around the time property prices peak and buy another when they bottom out again   not easy to judge though i 'd review the trust fund against others if you decide to keep it there as 12 over 6 years is n't great although the stock market has been depressed so it may compare keep some rainy day money spare if you can

it really depends on the type of business   you are running   if there is any chance of liability you should protect yourself with an llc   then it is much more difficult for them to sue and take personal assets   for example if you are a wedding photographer you would want to be an llc in case you lose someones pictures

they are overpriced to begin with   one reason is the fact that they are luxury cars   a second related reason is that they tend to push the technology envelope    all cars depreciate drastically the minute they are driven off the lot   this a good argument for buying a car that is 1 2 years old   the higher you are the more you can fall    repairs and maintenance are typically still expensive on these cars due to relative rarity and the lack of necessary expertise   here is where that advanced technology bites you   this is a reason that a 5 year old civic may be worth more than than a 10 year old benz   it may simply not be worth the hassle of maintaining repairing a luxury car   this is especially true for an aging luxury car   there are some people that only buy domestic precisely because of the maintenance costs   also a 10 year old car is still a 10 year old car regardless of the make   there are a few notable exceptions like the and have a great reputation for reliability and long term total cost of ownership better is a subjective issue that depends on a variety of variables   a civic is certainly not better in terms of technology comfort etc   but it is likely better in terms of maintenance reliability etc   which better you focus on is up to you

if credit scoring works in the uk like it does in the us then i think the fact that you a credit card and pay off your everyday expenses will give you perfectly good credit   just keep doing what you 're doing i have seen people in the united states with very high credit scores based solely upon owning occasionally using a credit card paid in full and on time every month

in general prices are inversely proportional to rates however accurate interest rate prediction would make one worthy of managing a large credit derivative hedge fund this is not to say that interest rates can not go up in canada since the world is currently undergoing a resource bust and the united states has begun exporting more oil even trying to recently open the market to europe both of which canada is relatively dependent upon also to say that canada currently has the most overpriced real estate is an oversight to say the least considering china currently has entire cities that are empty because prices are too high a ten to twenty percent drop in real estate prices would probably be a full blown financial crisis and since mortgage rates are currently around 2.5 a one to two hundred basis point rise could mean a nearly 50 decrease in real estate prices if interest payments are held constant   canada would either have to start growing its economy at a much higher rate to encourage the central bank to raise rates to such a height or oil would have to completely collapse suddenly to cause a possible collapse of cad to encourage the same the easiest relationship to manipulate between prices and rates is the perpetuity where p is the price i is the interest payment and r is the interest rate   in this case an increase of r from 2.5 to 4.5 would cause a decrease in p if i is held constant   however typical canadian mortgages seem to mature in ten years at a fixed rate so i can not be held constant and the relationship between r and p is less strong at earlier maturities thus the most likely way for prices to collapse is for a financial collapse as described above
