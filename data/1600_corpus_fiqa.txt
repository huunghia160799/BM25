i know that there are a lot service on the internet helping to form an llc online with a fee around $ 49 is it to pay them to have an llc or i can do that myself no you can do it yourself the $ 49 is for your convenience but there 's nothing they can do that you would n't be able to do on your own what i need to know and what i need to do before forming an llc you need to know that llc is a legal structure that is designed to provide legal protections as such it is prudent to talk to a legal adviser i.e. a virginia licensed attorney is it possible if i hire some employees who living in india is the salary for my employees a expense do i need to claim this expense this i guess is entirely unrelated to your questions about llc yes it is possible the salary you pay your employees is your expense you need to claim it otherwise you 'd be inflating your earnings which in certain circumstances may constitute fraud what i need to do to protect my company for physical protection you 'd probably hire a security guard if you 're talking about legal protections then again talk to a lawyer what can i do to reduce taxes vote for a politician that promises to reduce taxes most of them never deliver though otherwise you can do what everyone else is doing tax planning that is plan ahead your expenses time your invoices and utilize tax deferral programs etc talk to your tax adviser who should be a ea or a cpa licensed in virginia what i need to know after forming an llc you 'll need to learn what are the filing requirements in your state annual reports tax reports business taxes sales taxes payroll taxes etc most are the same for same proprietors and llcs so you probably will not be adding to much extra red tape your attorney and tax adviser will help you with this but you can also research yourself on the virginia department of corporations state department whichever deals with llcs

you can file an llc yourself in most states although it might be helpful to use a service if you 're not sure what to do to ensure it is correct   i filed my llc here in colorado online with the secretary of state 's office which provided the fill in the blank forms and made it easy in the u.s. taxation of an llc is pass through meaning the llc itself does not have any tax liability   taxes are based on what you take out of the llc as distributions to yourself so you pay personal income tax on that there are many good books on how to form and then operate an llc and i personally like nolo link to their web site because they cater to as for hiring people in india i ca n't speak to that so hopefully someone else can answer that specific topic as for what you need to know about how to run it i 'll refer back to the nolo books and web site

personally i 'd use my emergency fund first it is unlikely though possible of course that i will entirely lose my income at the same time i need to replace my roof or my furnace i 'd rather pay my emergency fund back with installment payments than pay off a heloc to my bank the lost interest on my emergency fund which after all should be in cash is much less than the cost of the loan i could even set up an amortization schedule in a spreadsheet and charge myself interest when paying back into the emergency fund that said if i did n't have the cash in my emergency fund i 'd rather borrow against the house than finance with a contractor if they 'd even do that which is unlikely i've never dealt with a roofer or heating contractor that required anything but full payment at time of service home equity borrowing is generally the cheapest kind i 'm firmly in the camp of those who look at home ownership as a consumption decision rather than an investment if the value goes up great but i just build in about 1 of the cost of building a new house excluding the land price into the housing budget each year right along with mortgage interest property taxes and basic utilities usually that 's enough to cover the major wear and tear related repairs averaged over 3 5 year periods anyway

because that s not how insurance works yes they make a profit but the only reason any single person can get a policy is because there is a pool of people large enough to spread the risk that means there needs to be healthy people too the bigger the pool the lower the cost if you 're still pissy at that point that it 's expensive it 's not the insurance company at that point its the actual costs of medical care that are expensive and require a policy as expensive as it is to cover those costs

depends on how long you 're willing to invest for broadly speaking the best by which i mean more reliably repeatable way to make money from market corrections is to accept them as a fact of life and not sell in a panic when they happen such that the money you already invested can ride back up again put another way just invest your money in one or two broad low cost index funds with dividends reinvested maybe spreading your investment over the course of six months or so and then let time do its work have you worked out how much you 've missed out on by holding your money as cash all this time i presume you 've been saving up a while instead of investing it as you went i suspect that by waiting for your correction you 've already missed out on more than you 're going to make from that correction

i see this as the reason for the country and world heading toward ever greater income inequality more and more wealth accruing to capital as opposed to labor   ah so we wo n't need as much money to live that 's hopeful   why do n't we use these solutions to solve current high unemployment    do n't believe that prices of goods will come down as quickly as people are fired from their jobs that will only happen when people are forced to stop buying things and corporate inventories climb too high recession depression this will be bad for business as well as those inventories were created using high labor expense from prior times and now must be sold at heavy discount

i will use 10 of this 20 k to pay the loan back on an annual basis agreement an annual payment of 0.8 $ 2,000 $ 250,000 is nowhere near large enough   the interest alone is going to be well over $ 10,000 and probably closer to $ 20,000 on an unsecured loan so you need to plan for at least a $ 20,000 $ 30,000 annual payment depending on the terms length and interest rate on the loan    but in general is this sustainable safe   essentially what you are doing is using leverage to increase the amount you can invest   while this is fantastic when the market rises it can go horribly wrong when the market goes down   generally it is unwise to fund a risky meaning there are large swings in return investment with a risk free meaning you 'll always make a payment loan if you want to see what could happen forecast a 20 market drop and see what you are left with obviously you 'll need to make the loan payment out of your balance since you wo n't have any gains to pull from   an average of 10 12 over a long period of time is reasonable but the variance can cause the return to be anywhere from to + 40 in one year   can you afford those losses    here 's an actual example if you were to invest $ 250,000 in the s&p 500 in january 2000 with an 8 interest only loan your next three years returns would be after three years assuming an interest only payment of $ 20,000 your balance would be just over $ 100,000 you 'd still owe $ 250,000 and you 'd still be making $ 20,000 in interest payments   if your loan interest rate was 25 which is not unreasonable for an unsecured loan you 'd be bankrupt after 3 years you 'd still owe $ 250 k but could not make the interest payment no this is not a good idea   the only time you should borrow money to invest in when you have control over the returns   so if you wanted to start your own business had a stable business plan and had much more certainty over the returns the borrowing money might be plausible    but borrowing money to do passive investment is a huge mistake

this person must pay taxes in both the overseas country and in the u.s. this is unusual generally only the u.s. demands this depending on the specific country he would likely not be taxed twice as the u.s. generally tax paid in a different country note there are some gotchas though for example although canada has a generally higher tax scheme than the u.s. you may still end up owing tax if you use the tax free savings account system in canada as that is not recognised in the u.s. as to whether or not this person should form a company that is far too broad a question it 's going to depend in large part on the tax situations of the countries involved this person needs to consult an accountant specialising in this situation that is on personal versus business tax and on tax involving u.s. citizens yes this person can and indeed must file and pay taxes in the u.s. from outside the u.s.

i am not 100 sure but i think the answer is this   you ca n't max out both   you could theoretically max out the simple ira $ 11,500 and then contribute $ 4,000 to your 401k but your total ca n't exceed the 401k limit of $ 16,500   this also means you could max out your 401k at $ 16,500 but you could n't contribute anything to the simple ira   note that no matter what you ca n't contribute more than $ 11,500 to your simple ira note that this is all independent from your traditional or roth ira which are subject to their own limits and not affected by your participation in employer sponsored plans as i understand it a 401k and a simple ira both fall under the umbrella of employer sponsored plans   just like you ca n't max out two 401k 's at two different employers you ca n't do it with the 401k and the simple ira   the only weird thing is the contribution limit differences between simple ira and 401k but i do n't think the irs could would penalize you for working two jobs enforcing the lower simple ira limit for all employer sponsored retirement accounts you should probably run the numbers factoring in the employer match and figure out which account contribution scenario makes the most financial sense for you   however i 'm not sure how the employer match helps you when you 're talking about a small business that you own run   you may also want to look at how the employer match of the simple ira affects the taxes your business pays disclaimer 1   i could n't find a definitive answer on your specific scenario at irs.gov   i the above info from a few different simple ira info sites   that 's why i 'm not 100 sure   it seems intuitively correct to me though   does your small business have an accountant   maybe you should talk to him her disclaimer 2   the $ amounts listed above are based on the irs 2010 limits

leverage is when you borrow in order to invest mind you most people are n't going to just give you money to gamble on the stock market completely unsecured rather you deposit say $ 10,000 and buy a stock and then you have $ 10k in assets which you can borrow against so you can buy another $ 10,000 of that stock now if the stock goes up you 'll make twice the gain 2x leverage however if it goes down you 'll lose twice as much as well if the value of your stock falls your line of credit will be reduced as well in this case since you used all your credit and are now over your limit your broker will issue a margin call they will demand a deposit of additional funds or they will sell some of your stock at their discretion this protects you from owing more than you invested but it 's still sometimes possible for instance if a company goes bankrupt and becomes worthless and your stock becomes worthless there are also things like leveraged index funds and commodity funds which aim to return some multiple of the market 's earnings these are designed for intraday trading though and usually end up underperforming significantly over the long term edit people who accept borrowed funds should generally accept real cash as well however if you 're trying to short sell i.e. borrow shares and sell them in the hopes you can get them back cheaper later after the stock falls you will need a margin line of credit to do so as well edit 2 clarified margin calls

the various levels of government have laws determining what a protected class is    federally wiki are the protected classes under federal law it is illegal to discriminate against someone based on their membership of any   of those demographics on the state and local level many states have additional protections for example my home state of il explicitly forbids discrimination based on someone 's sexual orientation or gender identity classes which are not explicitly forbidden on the federal level   hate speech is protected under the first amendment so long as you 're not violence that caveat is very murky and i am not qualified enough to speak on what is and is n't violence from a legal perspective i just know that the caveat exists   the key distinction that i think a lot of people misunderstand and are confused about is that while hate speech is protected under the first amendment like all other forms of speech it is not a protected class meaning i can say whatever hateful rhetoric i want but non government entities are free to discriminate against me     i can absolutely be fired if my employer finds out i am posting on facebook advocating for the death of black lives matter activists or saying stuff like terrorist immigrant go home because political speech is not a protected class i can not be fired for posting a photo of my gay wedding in il because in il sexual orientation is a protected class    does that make sense

i ’m not an expert on the visa us tax or insurance but you 're making enough mistakes in terms of all the associated costs involved in owning and renting houses apartments that this already looks potentially unwise at this stage of your investment career renting cheap properties to students involves the property constantly being trashed often being empty and requiring extremely close management which you either have to pay someone a lot to do or do yourself and lose other potential earning time if doing yourself you will also make lots of mistakes in the vetting managing marketing process etc at first as this is a complex art in itself   costs on this type of rental can often get as high as 25 a year depending exactly how lucky you get even if you do it all yourself and will typically be in the 5 15 range every year once everything you have to constantly maintain replace and is up that 's all pre what you could be earning in a job etc so if you could earn a decent clip elsewhere in the same time also have to deduct that lost potential send it all to third parties so all upkeep by hired contractors all renting by an agency you will be lucky to even break even off a year per property rents to students you ’re not seeming to price in any transaction costs which usually run at ~5 a time for both entrance and exit that s between half and one years rent gone from the ten per property on these numbers sell before ten is up its even more on point three rounding projections in house price rises to one decimal place is total gibberish no one who actually has experience investing their own money well ever makes or relies on claims like this no idea on pittsburgh market but sound projections of likely asset changes is always a ranged and figure that can not and should n’t be counted on for much even if it was it ’s also completely unattainable in property because you have to spend so much money on upkeep post costs and changes in size standard house values generally roughly track inflation have a look at this chart and play around with some reasonable yearly upkeep numbers and you will see what i mean renting property is an absolute for inexperienced investors and if you do n't know the stuff above already and it 's less than 10 of what you need to know to do this profitably vs other uses of your time you will nearly always be better off investing the money in more passive investments like diversified bonds reits and stock

you are doing great but you might want to read a couple of books and do some studying on budgeting and personal finance education yourself now and you will avoid pain in the future i learned a lot from reading dave ramsey 's total money makeover and i have found some great advice from the simple budgeting guidelines on budget in these three categories with these percentages you may find that your essentials lower than 50 because you are sharing room and utilities you want to put as much into financial as you can for the first 1 2 years to reduce or eliminate your student loan debt many folks will recommend you save six months salary expenses for emergencies and unexpected situations but understand that you are in debt now and you have a unique opportunity to pay off your debt before your living expenses creep up as they so often do since you are a contractor put aside 2 months expenses twice what i would normally advise and then attack paying off your debts with passion since you have a mix of student loans focus on paying them off by picking one at a time paying the minimum against the others while you pay off the one you picked then proceed to the next dave ramsey advises a debt snowball paying the smallest one first psychological advantage early wins while others advise paying the highest interest off first since you have over $ available to pay down debt you could plan on reducing your student loan debt substantially in a year   but avoid accumulating other debt along the way save for larger purchases your bedroom purchase may have been premature but you needed some basics but check your contract since many 0 furniture loan deals retroactively charge interest if you do n't pay them off in full you might want to make regular payments and pay the debt off a month early avoid any gotcha 's you might want to open a retirement account many folks recommend a roth account for folks your age it is after tax but you do n't pay tax when you withdraw money roth is better when you have lots of deductions think mortgage kids but some retirement account would be great to get started open a credit union account if you can that will make getting a credit card or personal loan installment easier you want to build a credit file but you do n't want credit card debt seems contradictory so opening 2 credit cards over the next year will help your credit you want a good credit mix student loans revolving installment and mortgage wait on that one

everyone always rants on how big of a problem this is   just a quick note i do n't care how much they get paid but it 's important to understand why   it is n't because they set their own salaries or that they are all super greedy   their pay is meant to solve an agency problem the ceo does n't own the company the public does because of that the ceo has little incentive to act in the best interests of the owners rather than his own interest   so their pay is structured in a way that solves this problem they are paid based on how well their company does and how much shareholder value they create this aligns their interests with the shareholders   is this the best solution probably not   is there a better one probably   do i know it no   but mindlessly complaining about the result does n't solve the issue the issue is we need a good solution for the agency problem in an economic system that is built on public ownership and private management

a bank is insolvent when it can no longer meet its short term obligations   in this example the bank is insolvent when depositors withdraw more cash than the bank can pay out in this case it 's probably something in the range of $ 600 700k because the bank can borrow money from other banks using assets as collateral in the us we manage this risk in a few ways first fdic insurance provides a level of assurance that in a worst case scenario most depositors will have access to their money guaranteed by the government this prevents bank panics and reduces the demand for cash the risk that remains is the risk that you brought up in your scenario bad debt or investments that are valued we mitigate this risk by giving the federal reserve and in some instances the us treasure the ability to provide nearly unlimited capital to get over short mid term issues brought on by the market in cases of long term structural issues with the bank balance sheets regulators like the fdic federal reserve and others have the ability to assume control of the bank and sell off its assets to other stronger institutions the current financial regime has its in the bank panics of the 1890 's when the shift from an agricultural based economy where no capital is available until the crops come in to an industrial economy revealed the weakness of the unregulated model where ad hoc groups of banks backed each other up good banks were being destroyed by panics until a trusted third party jp morgan stepped in committed capital and make personal guarantees

why do you want to improve your credit score did you want to buy something if not i do n't see the point in improving it if you want to buy something you can work towards long term solutions like others have mentioned in the short term you can dispute the accuracy of all the negative line items in your report this will give you a short boost in your credit report while the line items are being investigated as they will be taken off your credit report in the mean time if you 're looking to get a car or mortgage a home you could time your dispute with purchasing the high dollar assets this is a trick that does work but you have to make your move while your credit score is the best it can be

yes w4 determines how much your employer will withhold from your wages leaving everything at default would mean that your salary is your only taxable income and you only take default deductions your employee will calculate your tax withholding based on that but if your salary is > 200k i assume that you have other income investment capital gains interest on your bank account which you will have to pay taxes on you 're probably going to have some deductible expenses business partnership expenses mortgage interest donations college funds etc as well so it is very likely unless you 're really not smart about money that you have more to do with your taxes than just the employers withholding

generally credit card networks as opposed to debit atm cards that may or may not have visa mc logos have a rule that a merchant must accept any credit card with their logo visa rules for merchants in the us say it explicitly accept all types of valid visa cards although visa card acceptance    rules may vary based on country specific requirements or local    regulations to offer the broadest possible range of payment options    to cardholder customers most merchants choose to accept all    categories of visa debit credit and prepaid cards unfortunately the visa site for china is in chinese so i ca n't find similar reference there you can complain against a merchant who you think had violated visa rules here that said its not a law its a contract between the merchant processor and the visa international organization and merchants are known to break these rules here and there most commonly refusing to accept foreign cards including in the us also local laws may affect these contracts for example in the us it is legal to set minimum amount requirements when accepting credit cards this only affects credit card processing and merchants that do n't accept credit cards may still accept debit cards since those work in different networks under a different set of rules those who accept credit cards are also required to accept debit cards at least if used as credit

diversification tends to protect you from big losses but it also tends to protect you from big gains in any industry some companies provide good products and services and prosper while others have problems and fail or maybe the winners are just lucky or they paid off the right politicians whatever not the point here if you put all your money in one stock and they do well you could make a bundle but if you pick a loser you could lose your entire investment if you buy a little stock in each of many companies then some will go up and some will go down and your returns will be an average of how everyone in the industry is doing suppose i offered to bet you a large sum of money that if i roll a die it will come up 6 you might be reluctant to take that bet because you ca n't predict what number will come up on one roll of a die but suppose i offered to bet you a large sum of money that a die will come up 6 100 times in a row you might well take that bet because the chance that it will turn up 6 time after time after time is very low you reduce risk by spreading your bets anyone who 's bought stock has surely had times when he said oh man if only i 'd bought x ten years ago i 'd be a millionaire now but quite a few have also said if only i 'd sold x ten years ago i would n't have lost all this money   i recently bought a stock a stock that within a few months rose to 10 times what i paid for it and then a few months later the company went bankrupt and the stock was worth nothing i knew the company was on a roller coaster when i bought the stock i was gambling that they 'd pull through and i 'd make money i guessed wrong fortunately i gambled an amount that i was willing to lose

some of this may depend on how your employer chose to deal with your notice period   most employers employ you for the duration which means you 'd be covered for march on your insurance   they could send you home but pay you in which case you 're an employee for the duration still or they could terminate you on your notice day and give you effectively a severance equal to two weeks pay   that is what it sounds like they did they should have made this clear to you when you left on   assuming you work in an at will state there 's nothing wrong legally with them doing it this way although it is not something i believe is right morally   basically they 're trying to avoid some costs for your last two weeks if they employ you through they pay for another month of insurance and some other things   in exchange you lose some insurance benefits and fsa benefits your fsa the day you terminate employment see this pdf for a good explanation of these issues   this means that the fsa administrator is correct to reject expenses incurred after   the fsa is in no way tied to your insurance plan you can have one or the other or both   you still can submit claims for expenses prior to during your period which is often 60 or 90 days in the future you will want to think ahead when leaving employment and you may want to time when you give notice carefully to maximize your benefits in the event something like this happens again   it 's a shady business practice in my mind to terminate you when you give notice but it 's not unknown as far as the hsa fsa you are n't eligible to contribute to an hsa in a year you 're also in an fsa except that they use plan year in the language so if your benefits period is that 's the relevant year   i 'd be cautious about opening a hsa without advice from a tax professional or at least a more knowledgeable person here

if you have a business web site using would be the best choice using an address should be a second choice   if gmail is your only option though i would strongly recommend avoiding the portion if is n't available and for most people it no longer is using something such as would be a much better option for example john smith with example enterprises would be   if you 're looking for an email address to use for purposes such as a resume cv or similar documents then i would suggest to try to find a variation that includes your first name and last name on gmail you can use your middle initial as well if necessary   john curtis smith could have any combination such as though that last one will imply that john prefers to be called curtis and similar   also and i say this as honest advice from someone who has been in charge of hiring people in the past if you 're concerned about professionalism you 'll want to ensure your grammar and spelling are a quick glance at your posting history makes me think you 're a brit or are currently living in england so working on your english skills will be important people will find it difficult to take someone seriously otherwise and a poor first impression via text or email can easily cost you whatever it is you 're trying to establish especially if you are n't the only person attempting to establish yourself for that position   you have several errors in your post i just a question buisness and a lack of sentence structure and in general   it may seem silly to concern yourself with typing properly in a post on reddit but think of it as practice in a medium text and typing where is key if you 're used to typing poorly it 'll take a lot more effort to type well when it counts and you 're more likely to miss an error that could cost you a job or client   good luck to you

to summarize the money never existed the best example i can give is the housing bubble houses were being bought on credit worthiness and this pushed the house prices and values up as if the houses had been bought with real money when people could n't make their payments the house prices crashed   the boom and bust cycle is simply credit being overextended boom and when there is not enough money in the system for everyone to repay all their debts it crashes bust   the real question that people should be asking is not where did all the money go but why is money issued by private banks   money is a social invention to facilitate trade should it not be like a public water utility counterfeiting is illegal except when a private bank does it money should not be variable in value and economics will never be a science if the measurement of value is not standardized all natural sciences have standards of measurement like meters degrees etc money must decrease in value constantly because all money is issued at interest we essentially pay rent on all money that and the interest can only be repaid if more money is created once again at interest this is why economists generally say some inflation is good finance has told them interest is a given on the issue of money when in reality money is just an iou that requires no such interest payment for it 's issue   interest should be made if a loan is issued against savings but not for the simple issuance of money there should be public banks that issue the money and private banks for investment you can read more about this from reading about arthur in this way the public controls the value of it 's money not private bankers that use the issue of money to transfer wealth to an idle financial class   if you want to get into the differences between wealth and debt read the work of it 's off topic from this thread but really interesting to see how he relates real science to economics and how our current economic system is not scientific in the least wealth is subject to the laws of while debt is an invention of the human will debt never rots or with time and can expand exponentially through compound interest nothing in the natural world does this

the issue is should you get one large policy or several smaller policies multiple polices have flexibility becasue if the need goes away you can drop the policy the problem with multiple small policies is that there is overhead that you pay for multiple times assume that you want 100 k coverage and are age x. that policy will cost you a certain amount based on a base amount plus a percentage of the coverage the percentage is based on age sex smoking health if you double the coverage the price does n't double becasue the base amount is constant this base amount covers the cost of setting up your policy and maintaining the records and billing   keep in mind that the coverage you are asking about is not the mortgage insurance the lender makes you purchase when you have a small down payment you are asking about a policy to cover your debts and still provide money for survivors go with your current agent company and ask them to run the numbers new additional policy increasing amount of current policy go with what meets your needs buying a house is one of those life events where you should review your insurance and retirement needs and adjust accordingly

as others have pointed out they do in fact exist   but it may be worth pointing out a possible reason that they are not as popular as commodities futures if i want exposure to the oil market for example buying oil futures has a big advantage over buying oil namely i do n't actually need to store the oil i can roll over my position rather than taking delivery on the other hand buying single stock futures does not have such a compelling advantage over buying the stock itself so most people would simply do the latter   although stock futures might provide some other advantages in some very specialized situations

the reason california is suffering for housing is that they refuse to build up and tear down older suburbs they want to keep the smaller city vibe and do n't care about the long term effects or costs if sf had the density of nyc which itself is far less dense than most major european or asian cities then housing would nt be an issue    think about it this way housing in sf and metro area is more expensive than tokyo even tokyo houses way more people combine the area of la metro plus and you about the size of tokyo metro but it houses 10x as many people    its density to the past and poor planning problem not an industry is evil problem

i read the post   i read what they said about it    yet that part makes no   they keep talking about only to members of the florida bar but stop and think about how that does n't make sense   are they in a florida court or in a federal court   or an ip administrative setting     some things they wrote suggests they 're in a federal court   but others things suggest they 're in an administrative court related to ip   for example they talk about needing an attorney who can represent them in the trademark ip courts   that sounds like patent prosecution but that 's typically just about getting the patent ip stuff in the first place and not so much after the fact stuff   but then again i 'm not at all familiar with the area so i could be way off base   the problem is i should n't have to be speculating so much because their story sucked   but patent litigation for infringement for example as far as i was aware occurs in traditional district courts and so far as i am aware you do n't need a special trademark ip exam to sue on it   by contrast patent prosecution which is getting a patent through the offices requires that the attorney take the exam to become a patent attorney   wiki   federal courts if that 's where they are typically use cm case management web portal   which i 'll have to assume is the system they are referring to     that 's where anyone can fucking sign up for it   then they can look at and all that jazz   maybe there 's another system i 'm not familiar with or another system that i ca n't discern from the way they wrote the story   but so far   more bs or just confusing or wrong information   this is why they should have hired a lawyer

typically businesses always charge their home currency so if the shop is in canada you will pay canadian dollars normally you do n't have any choices either your credit card company will convert it to your currency using the current international currency exchange rate pretty good plus a potential fee between 0 and 5 depending on your credit card not so good if it is a significant amount or you plan to do that more than once and if you have multiple credit cards check first to see which one has the lowest international fee 0 is not uncommon but neither is 3 or 4 if it 's a 10 $ it 's probably not worth the time but 4 of 1000 is already 40 $ as of right now the currency exchange rate is 1.33 so you would pay usd plus the potential fee 0 $ understand that this exchange rate is floating continuously it probably wo n't change much but it will change

the answer is the next sentence from the wikipedia article the precise manner in which interest is charged is usually detailed in a cardholder agreement which may be summarized on the back of the monthly statement   your previous question on credit card interest rates quotes the sentence after this you have to review what the agreement for your card says also keep in mind the bank wants to make money from you the more interest and fees they collect they better they like you if enough card holders adjust their behavior to minimize interest and fees the bank will then adjust the credit card agreement to get money a different way   yes you are right it would seem fair to only charge interest on the smaller amount but that does n't allow the credit card issuer to maximize profits

electric does make a difference when considering whether to lease or buy the make model is something to consider the state you live in also makes a difference if you are purchasing a small electric compliance car like the fiat leasing is almost always a better deal these cars are often only available in certain states california and oregon and the lease deals available are very enticing for example the fiat is often available at well under $ 100/mo in a three year lease with $ 0 down while purchasing it would cost far more $ 30k minus credits rebates = $ 20k even when considering the residual value if you want to own a tesla model s i recommend purchasing a used car the market is somewhat flooded with used teslas because some owners like to upgrade to the latest and greatest features and take a pretty big loss on their old tesla you can save a lot of money on a pre owned model s with relatively low miles and the battery packs have been holding up well if you have your heart set on a new model s i would treat it like any other vehicle and do the comparison of lease vs buy one thing to keep in mind that buying a model s before the end of 2016 will grandfather you into the free for life which makes the car more valuable in the future right now there is a $ 7500 federal tax credit when buying an electric vehicle if you lease the leasing company gets the credit not you the cost of the lease should indirectly reflect this credit however some states have additional incentives california has a $ 2500 rebate for example that you can receive even if you lease the vehicle to summarize a small compliance car often has very good reasons to lease an expensive luxury car like the tesla can be looked at like any other lease vs buy decision and buying a used model s may save the most money

forex vs day trading these can be one and the same as most people who trade forex do it as day trading forex is the instrument you are trading and day trading is the time frame you are doing it in if your meaning from your question was comparing trading forex vs stocks then it depends on a number of things forex is more liquid so most professional traders prefer it as it can be easier to get in and out without being gapped however if you are not trading large amounts of money and you stay away from more volatile stocks this should not matter too much it may also depend on what you understand more and prefer to trade you need to be comfortable with what you are trading if on the other hand you are referring to day trading vs longer term trading and/or investing then this can depend largely on the instrument you are trading and the time frame you are more comfortable with forex is used more for shorter term trading from day trading to having a position open for a couple of days stocks on the other hand can be day traded to traded over days weeks months or years it is much more common to have positions open for longer periods with stocks other instruments like commodities can also be traded over different time frames the shorter the time frame you trade the higher risk involved as you have to make quick decisions and be happy with making a lot of smaller gains with the potential to make a large loss if things go wrong it is best once again to chose a time frame you are comfortable with i tend to trade australian stocks as i know them well and am comfortable with them i usually trade in the medium to long term however i let the market decide how long i am in a position and when i get out of it i try to follow the trend and stay in a position as long as the trend continues i put automatic stop losses on all my positions so if the market turns against me i am automatically taken out i can be in a position for as little as a day can happen if i buy one day and the next day the stock falls by 15 or more to over a year as long as the trend continues by doing this i avoid the daily market noise and let my profits run and keep my losses small no matter what instrument you end up trading and the time frame you choose to trade in you should always have a tested trading plan and a risk management strategy in place these are the areas you should first gain knowledge in to further your pursuits in trading

guaranteed annual return sounds too good to be true am i    right are there likely high fees etc you 're right guaranteed annual return is impossible especially when you 're talking about investments for such a long period of time ponzi and madoff their investors using promises of guaranteed return see this note in wikipedia in some cases returns were allegedly determined before the account was even her financial advisor does n't charge by the hour he takes a    commission so there 's obviously some incentive to sell her things    even if she may not need them definitely not a good sign if the advisor gets a commission from the sale then he 's obviously not an advisor but a sales person the problem with this kind of investment is that it is very complex and it is very hard to track the commission to the broker makes it hard to evaluate returns you pay 10 upfront and it takes awhile to just get that money back before even getting any profits and since you 're only able to withdraw in 20 years or so there 's no real way to know if something wrong until you get there and discover that no money also many annuity funds if not all limit withdrawals to a long period i.e. you can not touch money for like 10 years from investment regardless of the tax issues the tax deferred investment can be rolled over to another tax deferred account but in this case you ca n't i suggest you getting your own financial advisor that will work for you to look over the details and talk to your mother if it is really a scam

let me run some simplistic numbers ignoring inflation you have the opportunity to borrow up to what matters and varies is your salary case 1 you make 22 k after graduation you pay back 90 a year for 30 years paying off at most 2700 of the loan in this case whether you borrow or 28,000 makes no difference to the paying off you would do best to borrow as much as you possibly can treating it as a grant case 2 you make 100 k after graduation you pay back over 7 k a year if you borrowed the full 51 after 7 or 8 years it would be paid off yeah yeah inflation interest but maybe that might make it 9 years in this case the more you borrow the more you have to pay back but you can easily pay it back so you do n't care invest your and savings into something long term since you know you wo n't be needing to draw on them case 3 you make 30 k after graduation here the payments you have to make actually impact how much disposable income you have you pay back a year and over 30 years that 's about 25 k of principal it will be less if you account for some even most of the payment going to interest not principal anything you borrow above 25 k or the lower more accurate amount is free if you borrow substantially less than that by using your sponsorship savings and summer job you may be able to stop paying sooner than 30 years but even if you borrow only 12 k or half the more accurate number it will still be 15 years of payments running slightly more realistic versions of these calculations where your salary goes up and you take interest into account i think you will discover for each possible salary path a number that represents how much of your loan is really loan everything above that is actually a grant you do not pay back the less you are likely to make the more of it is really grant on top of that it seems to me that no matter the loan grant ratio   borrow as much as you can from this rather bizarre source appears to be the correct answer in the cases where it 's all loan you have a lot of income and do n't care much about this loan payment borrowing the whole 51 k lets you invest all the money you get while you 're a student and you can use the returns on those investments to make the loan payments

it 's a good question we ca n't know for sure but here are some things to think about paypal advertises a discounted transaction rate for non profit organizations   in the u.s. at least the rate they advertise is 2.2 + 0.30 usd   there are lots of things that can come into play here such as international rates or any special deal that has struck with paypal but it seems reasonable to guess that of your 2 € donation wikipedia sees perhaps   note that most of the fee is a flat rate of the next 2 € in your donation wikipedia gets direct debit probably has lower fees   paypal has to account for some credit card transaction fees in their fee structure and direct debit does not   therefore i would guess that to maximize your gift direct debit might result a little better than paypal    charities in general do n't want to tell you the best way to donate because they want it to be as easy for you as possible and do n't want to discourage any type of donation at all   they are very happy to get any donation even if one method over another results in slightly higher fees   in particular offers many different options for donating

you may look into covered calls   in short selling the option instead of buying it playing the house    one can do this on the buying side too e.g. let 's say you like company xyz   if you sell the put and it goes up you make money   if xyz goes down by expiration you still made the money on the put and now own the stock the one you like at a lower price   now you can immediately sell calls on xyz   if it does n't go up you make money   if it does goes up you get called out and you make even more money probably selling the call a little above current price or where it was put to you at the greatest risk is very large declines and so one needs to do some research on the company to see if they are decent e.g. have good earnings not over valued p e etc   for larger declines one has to sell the call further out   note there are now stocks that have weekly options as well as monthly options   you just have to calculate the rate of return you will get realizing that underneath the first put you need enough money available should the stock be put to you    an additional associated strategy is starting by selling the put at a higher than current market limit price   then over a couple days generally lowering the limit if it is n't reached in the stock 's fluctuation   i.e. if the stock drops in the next few days you might sell the put on a dip    same deal if the stock finally is put to you   then you can start by selling the call at a higher limit price gradually bringing it down if you are n't successful i.e. the stock does n't reach it on an upswing my friend is highly successful with this strategy good luck

presumably the existing house has some value if you the existing house you are destroying that value if the value of the new house is significantly more than the value of the old house like if you 're talking about replacing a small run down old house worth $ 50,000 with a big new mansion worth $ 10,000,000 then the value of the old house that is destroyed might just get lost in the rounding errors for all practical purposes but otherwise i do n't see how you would do this without bringing cash to the table basically equal to what you still owe on the old house presumably the new house is worth more than the old so the value of the property when you 're done will be more than it was before but will the value of the property be more than the old mortgage plus the new mortgage unless the old mortgage was almost paid off or you bring a bunch of cash the answer is almost certainly no note that from the lienholder 's point of view you are not temporarily reducing the value of the property you are permanently reducing it the bank that makes the new loan will have a lien on the new house i do n't know what the law says about this but you would have to either a deliberately destroy property that someone else has a lien on while giving them no compensation or b give two banks a lien on the same property i would n't think either option would be legal   normally when people tear down a building to put up a new building it 's because the value of the old building is so low as to be negligible compared to the value of the new building either the old building is run down and getting it into decent shape would cost more than tearing it down and putting up a new building or at least there is some benefit real or perceived to the new building that makes this worth it

putting debt out long means to borrow a sum of money paid back over a longer period of time than you could reasonably pay it back it should be important to note that this advice only applies for fixed rate loans meaning your rate ca n't change for the life of the loan without you explicitly changing it   the logic is that if you can borrow money when interest rates are really low there is a good chance you can find an investment that has a return higher than the interest rate on the loan it also means that when if interest rates go up in the future a simple savings account may even have a greater return than your loans interest the advice suggests to borrow over a long period so you are paying less interest per payment and gives you time to find a proper investment without having to pay too much interest during that time

similar to what adam f says above except instead of just transfering the amount you spend on the credit card into the high interest account why not keep the majority of your funds apart from a small amount say a couple of hundred for emergencies in the high interest account until the credit card needs to be paid off even better if you have a mortgage with an 100 offset account keep all your funds in this and pay off your credit card in full from it on or before the due date being a 100 offset to your mortgage interest rate you will be saving at a higher rate than a high interest rate savings account and you will be able to do all your normal banking from it unlike a high interest account which you usually have to link to an additional account to deposit and withdrawl money to and from if you are to use a credit card keep these simple rules in mind hope this has helped regards victor

llc is as far as i know just a us thing so i 'm assuming that you are in the usa update for clarification other countries do have similar concepts but i 'm not aware of any country that uses the term llc nor any other country that uses the single member llc that is disregarded for income tax purposes that i 'm referring to here and that i assume the recruiter also was talking about further llcs vary by state i only have experience with california so some things may not apply the same way elsewhere also if you are located in one state but the client is elsewhere things can get more complex first let 's get one thing out of the way do you want to be a contractor or an employee both have advantage and especially in the higher income areas contractor can be more beneficial for you make sure that if you are a contractor your rate must be considerably higher than as employee to make up for the benefits you give up as well as the fica taxes and your expense of maintaining an llc in california it costs at least $ plus legal advice accounting and various other fees etc on the other hand oftentimes the benefits as an employee are n't actually worth all that much when you are in high income brackets do pay attention to health insurance that may be a valuable benefit or it may have such high deductibles that you would be better off getting your own or paying the penalty for going uninsured instead of a 401(k you can set up an ira update or various other options and you can also replace all the other benefits if you decide that being an employee is the way to go stop here if you decide that being a contractor is a better deal for you then it is indeed a good idea to set up an llc you actually have three fundamental options work as an individual the legal term is sole proprietorship form a single member llc disregarded for income tax purposes or various other forms of incorporation of these i would argue that the single member llc combines the best of both worlds taxation is almost the same as for sole proprietorship the paperwork is minimal a lot less than any other form of incorporation but it provides many of the main benefits of incorporating there are several advantages first as others have already pointed out the irs and department of labor scrutinize contractor relationships carefully because of companies that abused this status on a massive scale uber and now defunct for instance but also fedex and other old economy companies one of the 20 criteria they use is whether you are incorporated or not basically it adds to your legal credibility as a contractor another benefit is legal protection if your client or somebody else sues you they can usually only sue the legal entity they are doing business with which is the llc your personal assets are safe from judgments that 's why donald trump is still a billionaire despite his famous four bankruptcies which i believe were corporate not personal update for clarification some people argue that you are still liable for your personal actions you should consult with a lawyer about the details but most business liabilities do n't arise from such acts another commenter suggested an policy a very good idea but not a substitute for an llc an llc does require some minimal paperwork you need to set up a separate bank account and you will need a professional accounting system not an excel spreadsheet but if you are a single member llc the paperwork is really not a huge deal you do n't need to file a separate federal tax return your income will be treated as if it was personal income the technical term is that the llc is disregarded for irs tax purposes california still does require a separate tax return but that 's only two pages or so and unless you make a large amount the tax is always $ 800 that small amount of paperwork is probably why your recruiter recommended the llc rather than other forms of incorporation so if you want to be a contractor then it sounds like your recruiter gave you good advice if you want to be an employee do n't do it a couple more points not directly related to the question but hopefully generally helpful if you are a contractor whether as sole proprietor or through an llc in most cities you need a business license not only that but you may even need a separate business license in every city you do business for instance in the city where your client is located even if you do n't live there business licenses can range from not needed to a few dollars to a few hundred dollars in some cities the business license fee may also depend on your income and finally one interesting drawback of a disregarded llc vs. sole proprietorship as a contractor has to do with the w-9 form and your social security number generally when you work for somebody and receive more than $ they need to ask you for your social security number using form w-9 that is always a bit of a concern because of identity theft the irs also recognizes a second number the ein employer identification number this is basically like an ssn for corporations you can also apply for one if you are a sole proprietor this is a huge benefit because you can use the ein in place of your ssn on the w-9 instant identity theft protection however if you have a disregarded llc the irs says that you must use your ssn you can not use your ein update the source for that information is the w-9 instructions it specifically only excludes llcs

i hope you 're not blaming the banks for the housing price inflation   it 's called supply and demand and is mostly caused by people possibly like you who have unreasonable expectations about the future value of real estate and thought it would keep rising unrealistically forever   the bank 's crime was to lend money recklessly to people who could not really afford it   the buyer 's crime was to buy a home they could not afford with the expectations that it would go up in price and they could either flip it or refinance   the real criminals might be the real estate agents who convinced the buyers they could afford it and helped them find an avenue to get the money   there were are a lot of unscrupulous or simply bad real estate agents out there but they too were naive enough to think houses would continue to rise   tl;dr   we are all to blame   calling owners slumlords and blaming them and the banks for your misfortune will only hurt you and make you forever the victim

note   this is my opinion so please have i am not trying to insult or put down anyone   i merely want to play the devils advocate and contribute to the dialogue in a constructive manner   thanks    you 're better trying to short magazines or the publishing industry   the reason why the music industry fell was because they were disorganized even before itunes came around   the internet has a fantastic distribution system i agree   but many of these streaming websites are trying to eat tv and cable 's lunch    many of the people who under estimate tv do not realize the amount of money talent research staff and infrastructure needed to produce top level high quality shows and programming   it is easy to stream a tv show or movie after it 's been already produced and broadcast but do you really think the internet will give us a mad men lost walking dead game of thrones   i highly doubt it and that 's a big reason why tv is here to stay   yes there is talk of netflix trying to buy the rights to some shows but it 's only in the initial phase and you can be damn sure that tv cable is testing the waters on their part too   if they decide that the relationship with netflix is n't working then they are not obligated to work with netflix   in this case netflix needs tv more than tv needs the netflix or hulu   what makes netflix hulu any more right than a viacom or comcast   you seem to think a future of netflix and itunes is utopia when in reality it would be an oppressive dystopian closed system with no competition   at least with tv and cable you have networks actively competing with each they are literally tripping over themselves working as hard as they can to please you- the audience   you talk about how a future without tv is a good thing but you fail to realize that it would actually be a bad thing for american culture     people seem to think that sitting in front of the computer monitors at a table for one is preferable to a 50 inch lcd screen with surround in the den   i am not surprised because the internet is comprised of people who mainly dwell on the internet where people who watch tv are probably watching tv right now     on top of that many people would lose their jobs   just because apple or netflix can distribute shows and movies cheap does not mean that many thousands of people should lose their jobs especially if the majority of america still prefers to watch programming on their tv 's and not locked in their room on a small computer screen with the sounding computer speakers   this is one of the reasons why we 're having an unemployment problem because these jobs are disappearing by the cold mechanical algorithms of a computer program   think of the many thousands of jobs that have been lost in the music industry do n't you think college kids would have loved to start their careers at a record label promoting music and encouraging growth   instead we have mp3 's and instant gratification music is arguably dead read 90 's music   and if we think a future without tv is utopia then i have some bad news for you it is n't   tv is american we do it best and we should not be turning our backs on it   once we do that we lose our culture    who do you think will own the internet in 50 years   i can tell you it wo n't be the us of a.   think very carefully and be careful what you wish for

some other suggestions index tracking mutual funds these have the same exposure as etfs but may have different costs for example my investment manager in the uk charges a transaction fee on etfs but not funds but caps platform fees on etfs and not funds target date funds if you are saving for a particular date often retirement but could also be buying a house kids going to college mid life crisis motorbike purchase a luxury cruise to see an eclipse etc these will automatically rebalance the investment from risk tolerant ie equities to risk averse ie fixed income as the date approaches you can get reasonably low fees from vanguard and i imagine others income funds etfs focusing on stocks which are expected to pay a good dividend the idea is that a consistent dividend helps smooth out volatility in prices giving you a more consistent return historically that worked pretty well but given fees and the current low yields it might not be smart right now that said vanguard equity income costs 0.17 and i think yields which is n't bad

do not do investing with a bank   do investing with a low cost investment company like vanguard fidelity or charles schwab   the lower the expenses of the fund the better the additional money your account earns because of lower overhead expenses is so dramatic over the course of your investing it is mind boggling to me    the lower the expenses the more of your money you keep which feeds the power of compound interest

you will almost certainly be able to sell 10,000 shares at once the question is a matter of price if you sell at market then you may get a lower price for each batch of the stock sold one person buys 50 another buys 200 another buys 1000 etc at varying prices will you be able to execute a single order to sell them all at the same price at the same time nobody can say and it 's not really a function of the company size the exchange has what 's called open interest which roughly correlates to how many people have active orders in at a given price this number is constantly changing alongside the bid and ask particularly for active stocks so let 's say you have 10,000 shares and you want to sell them for $ 100 each what you need is at least 10,000 in open interest at $ 100 bid to execute by contrast let 's say you issue a limit order at $ 100 for 10,000 shares your ask will stay outstanding at that price and you 'll be filled at that price if there are enough buyers i you have a limit sell order at $ 100 for 10,000 shares the strike price of the stock can not go to $ 100.01 until all of your sell orders are filled

the best approach depends on how much of an emergency fund you have if you have no emergency fund calculate how much you need in order to pay your expenses for 1 month and put at least that amount in a savings account   3 6 months worth of expenses is better   put the remainder towards one credit card if you have less than 3 months worth of expenses in your emergency fund deposit 1 additional month 's worth of expenses into your savings account and apply the rest to one card if you have an emergency fund that you 're completely comfortable with pay $ 8000 towards one card and $ 2000 towards the other one   paying off one card fully gets rid of a bill that you have to think about each month even if the two cards are otherwise identical

the first rule i follow is pretty simple get paid for what you do earn a return on what you own if you are running your company prudently you should earn a salary for the position and responsibilities you hold within the business this salary should be competitive you should be able to replace yourself in the business at this salary if your title is president or ceo look for market rate salaries for others in that position within your industry and company size if you wear multiple hats in a small business you will likely have to blend this salary based on those various positions   based on how you run your business the money left over at the end of the year after you and your team takes a competitive wage is your profit if there is n't any profit then you might want to do some work on your business model but if their is a profit then it 's a clear return on what you own and not just a payment for work completed the idea would be that you could exit the business as an operator pay someone else to do exactly what you do and you would continue to get that profit return at the end of the year this is when a business acts like a true asset   whether you take your money in salary or profit distributions or dividends depending on your structure taxes are about the same salaries get normal employee contributed taxes but then of course the company matches these it is identical if you take a guaranteed payment or distribution that gets hit with self employment taxes profits are also going to get hit with the same taxes   follow ups 1 a fair salary would be a competitive market wage for the position you hold within the business what is left over would be considered true profits and not just fabricated profits by taking a lower than market wage to boost the appearance of profitability 2 shareholders requesting salary information would be covered in your operating agreement or shareholder agreement this might be terms you set with your investors or you might simply set a term that you only need approval if a single salary exceeds a cap like $ 250,000 which would mean you would need to present why you deserve a higher salary and have your board approve if you are governed by said board via your investors profitability is a different ballpark your investors most likely have a right to see a monthly quarterly and/or annual profit loss statement which should clearly state profitability i ca n't imagine running a completely closed book company to my investors actually i ca n't really imagine ever investing in a company where i am not permitted to see the financials   something to also consider here is the threat of trying to keep your profit numbers low in order to not pay taxes or to pay yourself a higher salary if you ever plan to sell or exit the company most widely accepted valuations of a business are done from profits or you might think you are saving yourself a couple points on taxes by avoiding profits in the short term but if you exit the business and get a 3 5x or even up to in some cases multiplier on your annual profits you might be kicking yourself for trying to hide them through your accounting practices buyers will often sniff out an owner who created false profits by not paying themselves but what 's harder to do is figure out how much profits should have been when there were none on the books by saving yourself $ 100,000 in taxes this year could add up to close to $ 1,000,000 in an acquisition   good luck

this is actually a very good point any money that is spent on an employee in excess of the bare minimum required for them to perform their job should be viewed as a component of total rewards you can directly extend op 's logic to any other form of compensation or benefits why let public employees take pto except for when mandated by federal or state law why not target the 10th percentile of the market for all federal jobs why provide employees with retirement benefits the answer to all of the above is that all elements of a total rewards package are necessary to attract retain and develop good employees       i 've done consulting in the sphere of organizational structure design and development i 've seen the type of employees that a bare bones total rewards philosophy attracts and i 'm not sure that i want them working for the public

this paper by a columbia business school professor says the standard strategy outperforms a 100 bond or 100 stock strategy over the 1926 1940 period figure 5 and over the 1990 2011 period figure 6 this is based on actual market data from those periods   you can see the figures in the pdf   these are periods of 14 and 21 years which is perhaps shorter than the amount of time money would sit in your ira but still a fairly long time   the author goes on with a lot of additional discussion and claims that under certain conditions rebalancing will always outperform a buy and hold portfolio given sufficient time of course there are also many periods over which a given asset mix would underperform so there are no guarantees here   i read your question as asking is there any data suggesting that rebalancing a diversified portfolio can outperform an all in one asset class portfolio   there is some such data   however if you 're asking which investing strategy you should actually choose you 'd want to look at a lot of data on both sides   you 're unlikely to find data that proves anything either way it should also be noted that the rebalancing advantage described here and in your question is not specific to bonds   for instance in theory rebalancing between us and international stocks could show a similar advantage over an all us or all non us portfolio the paper contains a lot of additional discussion about rebalancing   it seems that your question is really about whether rebalancing a diverse portfolio is better than going all in with one asset class and this question is touched on throughout the paper   the author mentions that diversification and rebalancing strategies should be chosen not solely for their effect on mathematically calculated returns but for their match with your psychological makeup and tolerance for risk

as anonymous already mentioned i think the correct answer is to go see an accountant that said if you are already have to fill in a tax return anyway ie you 're already a high rate taxpayer then i do n't see why it should be an issue if you just told hmrc of your additional profit via your tax return i never was in the situation of being employed with a side business in the uk only either or but my understanding is that registering as self employed is probably more suitable for someone who does n't paye already i might be wrong on this as i have n't lived in the uk for a couple of years but an accountant would know the answer of course in either case make sure that you keep each an every scrap of paper to do with your side business

one year is short term short enough that trying to predict returns is a crap shoot frankly if you will need the money in one year i would n't touch anything riskier than a money market account $ 5000 also is n't enough to give you much flexibility in achieving a balanced portfolio since the minimal initial purchase for mutual funds is often around $ 2500 i 'm not sure whether etfs would give you any more flexibility so on grounds of both size and time horizon i have to recommend against this plan the risk of losing money with insufficient time for gains to balance that risk is simply too high others may feel differently of course but that 's the best advice i can offer

the new mortgage qualification rules were introduced to cool a hot canadian housing real estate market the rules are a pre measure intended to avoid a bubble and later crash in real estate the government wants to make sure anybody buying a house can handle higher interest rates those rates currently at record lows are expected to go up later this year and into the future the tighter mortgage rules include borrowers will need to qualify against a minimum standard 5-year fixed rate mortgage even if they 'll contract their mortgage at a lower or variable rate   previously the 3-year fixed rate mortgage was used as the minimum qualification standard the amount a homeowner can borrow in a refinanced mortgage drops to 90 of the home value down from 95 of the home value   a home is not meant to be an atm machine anybody wanting to borrow to buy an investment property i.e. a property that wo n't be their principal residence will need a 20 downpayment instead of a 5 downpayment the new rules go into effect april 19th 2010   however according to the see below exceptions would be allowed after    april 19 where they are needed to    satisfy a binding purchase and sale    financing or refinancing agreement    entered into before april 19 2010 definitive information about the new rules can be found at the department of finance of canada   specifically refer to some additional news media sources

you need a cosigner someone prepared to repay the if you should fail to needless to say this is going to have to be someone who knows you and trusts you very much one way is to find someone prepared to share a house with you buy a bigger house than you would otherwise need you would own half each and the sharing agreement would specify that if one of you defaulted on their payments the other would get a larger share according to how much extra they end up paying the other way is to find a silent partner who does n't live there they put up no money unless you actually default they would almost certainly have to be part owners but you can structure the agreement so that you end up with the whole house if you succeed in paying off the mortgage or miss no payments until you sell parents sometimes do this for their kids

i 'd question whether a guaranteed savings instrument underperforming the stock market really is a risk or not   rather you reap what you there 's a trade off and one makes a choice   if one chooses to invest in a highly conservative low risk asset class then one should expect lower returns from it   that does n't necessarily mean the return will be lower stock markets could tank and a cd could look brilliant in hindsight but one should expect lower returns   this is what we learn from the risk return spectrum and modern portfolio theory you 've mentioned and discounted inflation risk already and that would've been one i 'd mention with respect to guaranteed savings yet one still accepts inflation risk in choosing the 3 cd because inflation is n't known in advance   if inflation happened to be 2 after the fact that just means the risk did n't materialize   but inflation could have been say 4 nevertheless i 'll try and describe the phenomenon of significantly underperforming a portfolio with more higher risk assets   i 'd suggest one of perhaps we can sum those up as the risk of investing alternatively if one were actually fully aware of the risk reward spectrum and mpt and still chose an excessive amount of low risk investments such that one would n't be able to attain reasonable investing goals then i 'd probably file the risk under psychological risk e.g. overly cautious excessive risk aversion yet the term psychological risk with respect to investing encompasses other situations as well e.g. chasing high returns fwiw the risk of also came to mind but i think that 's mostly used to describe the risk of choosing say an actively managed fund or individual stocks over a passive benchmark index investment more likely to match market returns

until they 're old enough to be legally responsible for their own credit the only thing you can really do is show them by example how to manage money and credit in your own finances   teach them budgeting them in understanding how credit and financing work and teach them smart ways to make their money work for them when they 're teenagers you could potentially approach small banks or credit unions about ways to perhaps co sign loans for them and let them make payments to learn good habits for managing their responsibilities but that 's not always easy either   it wo n't do anything for their credit but having the responsibility of coming in to make payments might instill good habits and help their self esteem at the same time you have great intentions but as has been pointed out here already from a legal standpoint there 's not much you can do   all you can do is prepare them for the day when they are on their own and can enter into credit agreements   kids going to college get into real trouble with credit because cards are handed out like candy to them by the banks so teaching them money management skills is invaluable and something you can do now

the price for securities is negotiable   you totally have a right to make a lower offer when buying or ask for a higher price when selling     securities do n't trade at a fixed price the price goes up and down throughout the day based on the price offers made by buyers and sellers and where they find agreement if a stock last traded for $ 10 someone can put out an offer to buy the stock at $ 9.50 if they find someone who wants to sell and will accept that price then a deal is made unless something is falling rapidly in price however an offer that far below the last price is not terribly likely to be accepted now if you want to be assured of making a sale or purchase you generally trade at the market and for small time players that is very much encouraged as it makes it easier for everyone

if you make $ 10 in salary $ 5 in interest on savings and $ 10 in dividends your income is $ 25 not $ 10 if you have a billion dollars in well invested assets you can take a loan against those assets and the interest payment on the loan will be smaller than the interest you earn on the assets that means your investment will grow faster than your debt and you have a net positive gain it makes no sense to do this if the value of your asset is static in that case you would be better off just to withdraw from the asset and spend it directly since a loan against that static asset will result in you spending your asset plus interest charges if you have a good enough rate of return on your investment you may actually be able to do this in perpetuity taking out loan after loan making the loan payments from the loan proceeds while the value of your original asset pool continues to grow at any given time though a severe downturn in the market could potentially leave you with large debts and insufficient value in your assets to back the debt if that happens you wo n't be getting another loan and the merry go round will stop spinning it 's a bit of a ponzi scheme in a way the u.s. government has done exactly this for a long time and has gotten away with it because the dollar has been the world 's reserve currency you could always get a loan against the value of the u.s. currency in the past those days may be dwindling with more countries choosing alternative currencies to conduct business with and the dollar becoming comparatively weaker into the foreseeable future if you have savings you can spend more than you make which will put you into debt then you can draw down your savings to pay that debt and at the end of the month you will be out of debt but have less in savings you can not do this forever eventually you run out of savings if you have no savings you immediately go into debt and stay there when you spend more than you make this is simple arithmetic if you have no savings but you own assets real estate securities a collection of never opened beatles vinyl records a bicycle then you could spend more than you make and be in debt but have the potential to liquidate assets to pay off all or part of the debt this depends on finding a buyer and negotiating a price that helps you enough to make a real difference if you have a car and you owe $ 10 on it but you can only find a buyer willing to pay $ 8 for the car that does n't help you unless you can refinance the $ 2 and your new payment amount is lower than the old payment amount but then you 're still $ 2 in debt on the car even though you no longer possess it and you 've still increased your debt by spending more than you made if you stay on this path sooner or later you will not have any assets left and you will be in debt plain and simple as a wrinkle in the concrete example let 's say you have stock options with your employer this is a form of a call you could also purchase a call through a broker in the stock market or for a commodity in the futures market that means you pay up front for the right to buy a specific amount of an asset at a fixed price usually with an expiration date you do n't own the stock you just have the right to buy it at the call price regardless of the current market value when you buy it in the case of employee stock options your upfront cost is in the form of a vesting schedule you have to remain employed for a set time before a specific number of stocks become eligible for you to purchase at your option price the stocks vest on a certain date remain employed longer and more stocks may vest depending on your contract if you quit or are terminated before that date you forfeit your options if you stick around through your vesting schedule you pay real money to buy the stock at your option price it only makes sense to do this if the market value of the stock is higher than your option price if the current market value is lower than your option price you 're better off just buying the asset at the current market value or waiting and   hoping that the value increases before your contract expires you could drive yourself into debt by spending more than you make but still have a chance to eliminate your debt by exercising your call option and then re selling the asset if it is worth more than what you pay for it but you may have to wait for a vesting period to before you can exercise your option depending on the nature of your contract during this waiting period you are in debt and if you ca n't service your debt i.e. make payments acceptable to your creditors your things could get repossessed oh do n't forget that you 'll also pay a brokerage fee to sell the asset after you exercise your option further if you have exhausted your savings and nobody will give you a loan to exercise your stock or futures options then in the end you would be even further in debt because you already paid for the call but you are unable to capitalize it and you 'll lose what you already paid if you can get a loan to exercise your option but you 're a bad credit risk chances are good that the lender will draft a contract requiring you to immediately pay back the loan proceeds plus a fee out of the proceeds of re selling the stock or other asset in fact the lender might even draft a contract assigning ownership of your options to them and stipulating that they 'll pay you what 's left after they subtract their fee even if you can get a traditional loan you will pay interest over time the end result is that your debt has still cost you very real money beyond the face value of the debt finally if the asset for which you have a call has decreased in value lower than the current market value you would be better off buying it directly in the market instead of exercising your option but you 'll pay transaction fees to do that and the entire action would be pure speculation or investment but not an immediate means to pay off your debt unless you have reliable insider trading information but then you risk running afoul of the law frankly it might be better to get a loan to pay off your debt than to buy an investment hoping the value will increase unless you could guarantee that the return on your investment would be bigger than the cumulative interest and late fees on your debt or the risk of repossession of your belongings remember that nothing you owe a debt on is actually yours not your house not your car not your bicycle not your smartphone most of the time your best course of action is to make minimum payments on your lowest interest debts and make extra payments on your highest interest debt up to the highest total payment you can tolerate set something aside in a rainy day fund just in case as you pay off the highest interest debt shift the amount you were paying on that debt to make extra payments on your next highest interest debt until that one is paid off and repeat on down the line until you 're out of debt then live within your means so that you do n't find yourself working at mcdonald 's because you do n't have a choice when you 're in your 80 's

the actual increase in the cost of living for one month over the previous month can not be calculated from the annualized increase in cost over the entire previous year consider the hypothetical case of a very stable economy where prices stay constant for decades   nevertheless the authorities issue monthly statements reporting that the change in the cost of living for the last month year over year is 0.00   then they go back to sleep for another month then something happens say in august 2001   it causes a permanent large increase in the cost of many parts of the cost of living components so in september the authorities announce that the cost of living for the end of august 2001 compared to august a year ago was up 10 great results   politicians pontificate unions on behalf of their members etc the economy returns to its customary behavior except for that one time permanent increase from august 2001   so for the next eleven months each month the authorities compare the previous months prices to the prices from exactly a year ago and announce that inflation year over year is still 10    finally we reach september 2002   the authorities look at prices for the end of august 2002 and compare them to the prices from the end of august 2001 post event   wonder of wonders the inflation rate is back to 0.00   absolutely nothing happened in august 2002 yet the rate of inflation dropped from 10 to 0

for insight on what will happen i suggest looking at the situation from the lender 's perspective if your setbacks are temporary and you are likely to get back on your feet again they will protect their investment by making accommodations and probably charging you extra fees along the way if your financial hardship seems they probably try to squeeze you for as much as possible and then eventually take your house protecting their investment as best they can if they are going to foreclose they may be reluctant to do it quickly as foreclosure is expensive takes man power and looks bad on their books   so it may get pushed off for a quarter or a fiscal year but if you are asking if they 'll help you out from the goodness of their heart well a bank has no heart and creditors are interested in roi   they 'll take the easiest path to profit or failing that the path to minimum financial losses    the personal consequences to you are not their concern once you realize this it may change your thinking about your own situation    if you think you have a path to financial recovery then you need to make that clear to them in writing with details   make a business case that working with you is in their own best interests if you can not make such a case recognize that they 'll likely squeeze you for as much as possible in penalties fees interest payments etc before eventually foreclosing on you anyway   do n't play that game if your home is a lost cause financially plan how to get out from it with the smallest losses possible   do n't pay more than you need to and do n't throw good money after bad

you are in the perfect window for making an ira contribution the irs allows you to make ira contributions for last year until tax day so you know that for 2014 you did n't have access to a 401 k at work you want to avoid making a deductible ira contribution for this year 2015 until you are sure that you wo nt have a 401 k at work this year take your time and decide if the ira or the roth works best for your situation having a ira now will be good becasue you have many years for it to grow keep in mind that it is not unusual to have multiple retirement accounts current 401 k rolled over into a ira   roth ira each has different rules limits and benefits there is no reason to pick one way of investing for retirement becasue you never know if the next employer will have the type of plan you like i am assuming that your spouse if you are married does n't have access to a 401 k otherwise you would have to consider the applicable limits

note that long term you need to plan for possible inflation so a little bit of return   generally wants to be at least high enough to offset that plus a little bit which is why just shoving it in a bank while extremely safe is n't usually the best choice    you need to make some decisions about how you trade off risk versus return whether you will comfortable riding out a downturn while waiting for recovery and so on my standard advice as someone else who knows how little he knows it 's worth spending a few hundred of those dollars to talk to a real financial planner not someone who has any interest in selling you particular products like a broker or agent they can help you ask yourself the right questions about comfort and goals and timeframe to pick a strategy which suits your needs it wo n't be exciting but it sounds luke you agree with me that this should n't be exciting and market rate of return about 8 annually long term is generally good enough with more conservative positions as you approach the point of needing that money

the vendor needs to do this using apportionment according to the vat rules for mixed supplies if you make mixed supplies and the individual supplies are not liable to vat    at the same rate then you need to work out the tax value of    each supply in order to calculate how much tax is due if the tax    value is based on the total price you charge see paragraph 7.3 you    do this by splitting that price between the supplies this is called    an apportionment there is no special method of apportionment however your calculations must be fair and you must be able to justify them it is usually best to use one of the methods shown in section 32 the section 32 referred to really relates to use between business and non business purposes but it implies that splitting up the total price in proportion to the original prices would probably be fair so in your example the vendor might split the £ 5 discount equally between the spoon and the as they had the same gross cost and pay vat as if each had cost £ 7.50 gross the vendor could also do it in proportion to their net pre vat prices and thus a bit more of the discount to the than the spoon but as this would lead to them paying slightly more tax overall they probably would n't choose to however none of this is likely to be too relevant to a consumer since in the uk prices must be presented as the gross vat inclusive amounts and so the discounts will also apply to those amounts it will of course affect how much of the purchase price the vendor ends up paying on to the government and thus might indirectly affect what discounts the vendor is willing to offer

if you have enough money to buy a car in full that probably means you have good credit if you have good credit car dealerships will often offer 0 loans for either a small period of time like 12 months or the entire loan taking a 0 loan is obviously more optimal than paying the entire lump sum up front you can take the money and invest in other things that earn you more than 0 however most dealerships offer a rebate or a 0 loan some commenters below claim that the rebate is usually larger than the saved interest so definitely do the math if you have that option

this depends on what the alternative is your loan of .99 is very favorable rate if you have the 15,000 right now but only hold it in your checking account or cash then you might as well just pay it all you have an adequate emergency fund paying the debt off sooner will save you on interest currently if you pay the minimum you will pay a total of $ by the end of the loan a $ 230 premium to $ 15,000 math credit goes to   joe if you have an investment vehicle you feel can successfully yield more then .99 you might want to consider investing that money instead while paying the minimum on your car loan also be sure to check the .99 is not an introductory rate which increases later on it comes down to whether you can get a better return then .99 investing that money or whether you rather just pay off the debt and not worry about it if you do n't want to bother investing the money than just pay it off i also assumed you have no other revolving debt with a higher apr if you do first pay off the higher apr debt

you have to be the owner of record before the ex dividend date which is not the same day as the date the dividend is paid this also implies that if you sell on or after the ex dividend date you 'll still get the dividend even if you no longer own the stock   keep in mind also that the quoted price of the stock and on any open orders that are not specifically marked as do not reduce on its ex dividend date is dropped by the amount of the dividend first thing in the morning before trading starts if you happen to be the first order of the day before market forces cause the price to move you 'll end up with zero gain since the dividend is built into the price and you got the same value out of it the dividend in cash and the remaining value in stock as pointed out in the comments thanks you 'll still get a market price for your trade but the price reduction will have had some impact on the first trade of the day source nyse rule also remember that the dividend yield is expressed in annualized terms so a 3 yield can only be fully realized by receiving all of the dividend payments made by the company for the year you can of course forget about individual companies and just look for dividends to create your own effective yield over time but see the final point finally if you keep buying and selling just to play games with the dividends you 're going to pay far more in transaction fees than you will earn in dividends and depending on your individual circumstances you may end up paying more in capital gains taxes

great response thanks i 'll do my best to answer your questions   1 i 'm a genuine believer that everything from calculus to charisma can be taught to most people some people do n't have the intelligence to ever learn calculus for example and some people will only ever be average at it but most people can at least improve in most areas through education    the messed up part is that professors are never formally taught to teach some of the things i listed i implicitly learned in grad school e.g. when doing research i learned how to filter out inaccurate information when writing research papers i learned how to organize information i learned theories of motivation because i was in an org program but i never learned how to apply them especially in a classroom setting i had to figure that out myself but yes i do believe it 's something that can be learned    2 i think the vast majority of work related skills that people develop are learned on the job as you mentioned there are some generic skills students learn in college that can be applied to their work however i 'm thinking of communication and social skills although i 'm probably biased since those are the two topics i teach college it seems to me is more about learning how to follow directions figure things out for yourself and work effectively in groups than any particular subject matter and i think those skills do transfer well to the workplace    3 i 100 agree with this we 're pressured to pass students and inflate grades character issues including being disorganized being dishonest or just being rude are diagnosed as psychological disorders and we have to accommodate students with these disabilities to be clear i 100 believe in psychological disorders and i 100 support accommodating students with these i just think they are these days     totally agree with your last paragraph

this is lan investment analyst at betterment to answer your question american investors are drawn to use the s&p 500 spy as a benchmark to measure the performance of betterment portfolios particularly because it ’s familiar and it ’s the index always reported in the news however going all in to invest in spy is not a good investment strategy and even using it to compare your own diversified investments is misleading we outline some of the pitfalls of this approach in this article why the s&p 500 is a bad benchmark an algo advisor service like betterment is a preferable approach and provides a number of advantages over simply investing in etfs spy or others like voo or ivv that track the s&p 500   so why invest with betterment rather than in the s&p 500 let ’s first look at the issue of diversification spy only exposes investors to stocks in the u.s. large cap market this may feel acceptable because of home bias which is the tendency to invest disproportionately in domestic equities relative to foreign equities regardless of their home country   however investing in one geography and one asset class is riskier than global diversification because inflation risk exchange rate risk and interest rate risk will likely affect all u.s. stocks to a similar degree in the event of a u.s. downturn in contrast a well diversified portfolio invests in a balance between bonds and stocks and the ratio of bonds to stocks is dependent upon the investment horizon as well as the individual 's goals   by constructing a portfolio from stock and bond etfs across the world betterment reduces your portfolio ’s sensitivity to swings and the diversification goes beyond mere asset class and geography for example betterment ’s basket of bond etfs have varying durations e.g. short term treasuries have an effective duration of less than six months vs. u.s. corporate bonds which have an effective duration of just more than 8 years and credit quality the level of diversification further helps you manage risk   dan betterment ’s director of behavioral finance and investing examined the increase in returns by moving from a u.s only portfolio to a globally diversified portfolio on a risk adjusted basis the betterment portfolio has historically outperformed a simple diy investor portfolio by as much as 1.8 per year attributed solely to diversification    now let ’s assume that the investor at hand investor a is a sophisticated investor who understands the importance of diversification additionally let ’s assume that he understands the optimal allocation for his age risk appetite and investment horizon investor a will still benefit from investing with betterment   automating his portfolio management with betterment helps to insulate investor a from the or the tendency for investors to sacrifice returns due to bad timing studies show that individual investors lose on average anywhere between 1.2 to 4.3 due to the behavior gap and this gap can be as high as 6.5 for the most active investors compared to the average investor betterment customers have a behavior gap that is 1.25 lower how betterment has implemented smart design to discourage market timing and short sighted decision making   for example betterment ’s tax impact preview feature allows users to view the tax hit of a withdrawal or allocation change before a decision is made currently betterment is the only automated investment service to offer this capability this function allows you to see a detailed estimate of the expected gains or losses broken down by short- and long term making it possible for investors to make better decisions about whether short term gains should be deferred to the long term now for the sake of comparison let ’s assume that we have an even more sophisticated investor investor b who understands the pitfalls of the behavior gap and is somehow able to avoid it betterment is still a better tool for investor b because it offers a suite of tax efficient features including tax loss harvesting smarter cost basis accounting municipal bonds smart dividend reinvesting and more each of these strategies can be automatically deployed inside the portfolio investor b need not do a thing each of these strategies can boost returns by lowering tax exposure to return to your initial question why not simply invest in the s&p 500 investing is a long term proposition particularly when saving for retirement or other goals with a time horizon of several decades to be a successful long term investor means employing the core principles of diversification tax management and behavior management while the s&p might look like a investment one year there are always reversals of fortune the goal with long term passive investing the kind of investing that betterment offers is to help you reach your investing goals as efficiently as possible    lastly betterment offers best in industry advice about where to save and how much to save for no fee

does this make sense i 'm concerned that by buying shares with post tax income i 'll have ended up being taxed twice or have increased my taxable income the company will then re reimburse me for the difference in stock price between the vesting and the purchase share price sure   assuming you received a rsu for shares worth $ 10 and your marginal tax rate is 30 all made up numbers either or so you 're in the same spot either way   you paid $ 300 to get $ 1,000 worth of stock taxes are the same as well   the full value of the rsu will count as income either way and you 'll either pay tax on the gains of the 100 shares in your rsu our you 'll pay tax on gains on the 70 shares in your rsu and the 30 shares you bought   since they 're reimbursing you for any difference the cost basis will be the same although you might get taxed on the reimbursement but that should be a relatively small amount this first year i wanted to keep all of the shares due to tax reasons and because believe the share price will go up i do n't see how this would make a difference from a tax standpoint you 're going to pay tax on the rsu either way either in shares or in cash   how does the value of the shares going up make a difference in tax additionally i 'm concerned that by doing this i 'm going to be hit by my bank for exchange fees foreign money transfer charges broker purchase fees etc   that might be true if that 's the case then you need to decide whether to keep fighting or decide if it 's worth the transaction costs

gt;you are starting from false premises built on politically driven economic theories the reality does not square with anything that you just wrote    i like to see the historical evidence statistical not anecdotal for that    i 'll provide a good starting point for you list of recessions in the united wiki a quote the national bureau of economic research dates recessions on a monthly basis back to according to their from to there were 16 cycles the average recession lasted 22 months and the average expansion 27 from to 1945 there were six cycles recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35 from 1945 to 2001 and 10 cycles recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months this has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe factors that may have contributed to this moderation include the creation of a central bank and lender of last resort like the federal reserve system in 1913 the establishment of deposit insurance in the form of the federal deposit insurance corporation in 1933 increased regulation of the banking sector the adoption of keynesian economics and the increase in automatic in the form of government programs unemployment insurance social security and later medicare and medicaid   in fact the us at the time wanted to get away from the destructive boom and bust cycles that were destroying the economy so went to europe to find out how come they had significantly less disruptive cycles and learned that the notion of a central bank was very useful to smooth out cycles   also read about the great wiki one of the causes is listed as greater central bank independence in which the fed balanced money supply more closely with demand how do you propose that the money supply in an economy should be matched with economic growth and contractions letting be independent is a proven recipe for more harm than trying to match them    all sourced with ample data   now you can try and argue that the fed is not necessary but then you 'll have to explain the vast difference in boom bust cycles seen in virtually every economy that has adopted an independent central bank that has followed monetary policy that means covering hundreds of examples good luck   this is not driven by economic theories this is historical fact ignoring it and similar evidence from hundreds of years over dozens of countries and economies is ignorant   money and fractional reserve banking guarantee monetary collapse   more non fiat economies crashed than fiat economies like pretty much every historical economy up to modern times the majority of economies that have not crashed are fiat so it seems you have not actually tried listing all the various economies and counted them   gt;the idea that economics is hard science is ridiculous   no one claimed that you 're arguing against a strawman and repeating whatever phrases you think go here   gt;in a smallish closed or partially closed system formulas and equations can determine probable outcomes in the infinitely complex economy of the modern world the very idea that you can predict anything beyond general directions is absurd   no one claimed that either however the entire universe is a pretty complex system and plenty of long term predictions are probably very accurate   gt;and the general directions are not understandable without considering the human motivations that drive each of the billions of sentient actors involved    also irrelevant since no one is claiming we need that

you can not get your investment out and leave only the capital gains until they become taxable at the long term rate when you sell some shares after holding them for less than a year you have capital gains on which you will have to pay taxes at the short term capital gains rate that is at the same rate as ordinary income   as an example if you bought 100 shares at $ 70 for a net investment of $ 7000 and sell 70 of them at $ 100 after five months to get your initial investment back you will have short term capital gains of $ 30 per share on the 70 shares that you sold and so you have to pay tax on that $ the other $ 4900 = $ is tax free since it is just your purchase price of the 70 shares being returned to you   so after paying the tax on your short term capital gains you really do n't have your   initial investment back you have something less the capital gains on   the 30 shares that you continue to hold will become long term capital gains income to you only when you sell the shares after having held them for a full year or more the gains on the shares sold after five months are taxable income in the year of sale

options are generally viewed as having two types of value intrinsic value and time value   the intrinsic value is based on the difference between the strike price on the option and the spot price of the underlying   the time value is based on the volatility of the underlying and the amount of time left until expiration   as the days pass toward expiration the time value generally decreases and the intrinsic value may move up or down depending on the spot price of the underlying in theory time value could increase at some points if the volatility is also rising in your case it looks like the time value is decreasing faster than the intrinsic value is increasing this may happen because the volatility is also going down as suggested in the answer by cqm or may just happen because the time to expiration is getting shorter at equal volatility as noted by dumbcoder in a comment to the original question the black scholes formula will give you more analytical insight into this if you 're interested

degree of operating leverage dol measures the percent change in ebit given a 1 change in revenue in other words if dol is 1.5 then increasing revenue by 1 will increase ebit by 1.5   degree of financial leverage measures the percent change in ni given a 1 change in ebit   degree of total leverage cuts ebit out and measures the percent change in ni given a 1 change in revenue    what all three of these numbers measure is elasticity the elasticity between two variables is always the percentage change effect on one due to a 1 change in the other    before we talk about why you would multiply let ’s first just look at absolute changes between a change of three variables x y and z. lets say x impacts y and y impacts z to make it even more concrete let ’s imagine a classroom where every student is required to have 2 books and every book has 100 pages so x = students y = of books and z = of pages if we add one student to the class we need to add 2 books if we add 1 book to the class we have added 100 pages with absolute changes like this it is obvious that we do n’t add we multiply in other words to directly see the impact of a new student on the number of pages x -&gt z we would say 1 student -&gt 2 books -&gt 200 pages to say 102 pages would obviously be silly    for percent changes this looks pretty similar to make it easy say the class has 100 students so adding 1 student is a 1 change then we go from 200 books to 202 books a 1 change so the degree of student to book leverage is 1 which make sense there are no fixed pages we go from 20,000 pages to pages also a 1 change so the degree of book to page leverage is also 1 thus the student to page leverage is also just a flat 1    let ’s add fixed amounts the teacher has a single 2,000 page book on how to teach we ’ll assume the class has 20 students so we start with 20 2 + 1 = 41 books and 40 100 + 2,000 = 6,000 pages let ’s add a student we have a -1 = 4 increase in students -1 = increase in books 1 = 3.33 increase in pages so the degree of student to book leverage is = and the degree of book to page leverage is = and the direct student to page leverage is = 1.20 again note that here it would be silly to add the degrees of leverage and when we do multiply them we get = 1.2 the right answer    from here the application to ebit = sales fixed cost variable cost = gross margin sales fixed cost and the application to eps = ebit interest taxes = 1 tax interest should be obvious i can supply the full proof mathematically however if you would like

i like c. ross and mrchrister 's advice to not be heavily weighted in one stock over the long run especially the stock of your employer   i 'll add this one thing you really ought to find out and this is where your tax advisor is likely able to help is whether your company 's stock options plan use qualified incentive stock options iso or non qualified stock options or   see wikipedia incentive stock option for details from my understanding only if your plan is a qualified or statutory iso and you hold the shares for at least 1 year of the date of exercise and 2 years from the date of the option grant could your gain be considered a long term capital gain as opposed to if your options are non qualified then your gain may be considered ordinary income no matter how long you wait in which case there 's no tax benefit to waiting to cash out in terms of hedging the risk if you do choose to hold long here are some ideas sell just enough stock at exercise i.e. taking some tax hit up front to at least recover your principal so your original money is no longer at risk or if your company has publicly listed options which is unlikely if they are very small then you could purchase put options to insure against losses in your stock   try a symbol lookup at the cboe note hedging with put options is an advanced strategy and i suggest you learn more and seek advice from a pro if you want to consider this route   you 'll also need to find out if there are restrictions on trading your employer 's public stock or options many companies have restrictions or black out periods on employee trading especially for people who have inside knowledge

a call gives you the right but not the obligation to buy a stock at a particular price the price called the strike price is fixed when you buy the option let 's run through an example aapl trades $ you think it 's going up over the next year and you decide to buy the $ 280 call for $ 12   here are the details of this trade your cost is $ 1200 as options are traded on 100 shares each you start to have the potential to make money only as apple rises above $ 280 and the option trades in the money it would take a move to $ for you to break even but after that you are making $ 100 for each dollar it goes higher at $ 300 your $ 1200 would be worth $ 2000 for example a 16 move on the stock and a 67 increase on your money on the other hand if the stock does n't rise enough by january 2011 you lose it all   a couple points here american options are traded at any time if the stock goes up next week your $ 1200 may be worth $ 1500 and you can sell if the option is not in the money its value is pure time value there have been claims made that most options expire worthless this of course is nonsense you can see there will always be options with a strike below the price of the stock at expiration and those options are in the money of course we do n't know what those options were traded at   on the other end of this trade is the option seller if he owns apple the sale is called a covered call and he is basically saying he 's ok if the stock goes up enough that the buyer will get his shares for that price for him he knows that he 'll get $ the $ 280 plus the option sale of $ 12 for a stock that is only $ today if the stock stays under $ 280 he just pocketed $ 12 4.6 of the stock value in just 3 months this is why call writing can be a decent strategy for some investors especially if the market goes down you can think of it as the investor lowering his cost by that $ 12 this particular strategy works best in a flat to down market of course in a fast rising market the seller misses out on potentially high gains   i 'll call it quits here just to say a put is the mirror image you have the right to sell a stock at a given price it 's the difference similar to shorting a stock as opposed to buying it if you have a follow up question happy to help edit apple closed on jan 21 2011 at $ the $ 280 call would have been worth $ vs the purchase price of $ 12 nearly 4x return a gain in just over 4 months for a stock move of 26 this is the leverage you can have with options any stock could just as easily trade flat to down and the entire option premium lost

a $ 10,000 life insurance policy on a child only makes sense for a family that thus it could make sense many families are in this financial situation   a family in the combination of this financial situation and this emotional situation might be well served to seek religious counsel   if they find ways to remember loved ones without expensive funerals they could save money on insurance ironically a much larger life insurance policy for a child might make more sense   look at it this way   what is the replacement cost of a child a family that has only one son and any number of daughters or a family that has only one daughter and any number of sons stands to lose an obvious part of their genetic and cultural legacy if they lose that son or daughter it is expensive to bear and raise a child to a particular age   this cost increases as the child ages   the number of years of child raising cost obviously increases   also the cost of another child can go from very small to very large especially if fertility treatment or reversal surgery is required unfortunately most life insurance companies do not think of things this way   i am not aware of any 100,000 250,000 dollar children 's life insurance policies on the market

you ca n't run a business without making $ $ $    good will and good intentions only go so far and they do not always equate to positive results capitalism rewards the positive results of proper decision making in the market place as businesses generate enough profit to allow them to stay afloat and expand while those businesses that do not follow through with proper decision making reap negative results fail and eventually go out of business these are facts which govern how capitalism works i.e. success is rewarded failure is punished and both of these results serve as lessons for all others in the marketplace who dare to heed these lessons based offered up by success and failure which are to be found in a capitalist economy    so if the current market conditions dictate that allowing workers more free time increased perks etc will increase productivity and lead to success then it is only rational and reasonable for businesses to attend to the needs of their employees    however if the costs of these perks begin to spiral out of control and/or are no longer relevant or favorable in the marketplace then cost cutting measures are needed to ensure that businesses are able to secure their profits and stay afloat those who do not rein in or alleviate these cost issues in their businesses will quickly go under as these costs eat out their bottom line and competitors move in to under cut them in the market place nevertheless attempting to place some sort of emotional or political reasoning and judgment as to how and why businesses act in regards to cost cutting measures without first taking into account the reality of the circumstances in which they must operate in i.e. having to make a profit in order to survive is unreasonable and flat out childish

generally if you are using fifo first in first out accounting you will need to match the transactions based on the number of shares in your example at the beginning of day 6 you had two lots of shares 100 50 and 10 52   on that day you sold 50 shares and using fifo you sold 50 shares of the first lot   this leaves you with 50 50 and 10 52 and a taxable capital gain on the 50 shares you sold note that commissions incurred buying the shares increase your basis and commissions incurred selling the shares decrease your proceeds   so if you spent $ 10 per trade your basis on the 100 50 lot was $ and the proceeds on your 50 60 sale were $   in this example you sold half of the lot so your basis for the sale was half of $ or $ so your capital gain is $ = $ the sales you describe are also wash sales in that you sold stock and bought back an equivalent stock within 30 days   generally this is only relevant if one of the sales was at a loss but you will need to account for this in your code   you can look up the definition of wash sale it starts to get complex if you are writing code to handle this in any generic situation you will also have to handle stock splits spin offs mergers etc which change the number of shares you own and their cost basis   i have implemented this myself and i have written about 25 30 custom routines one for each kind of transaction that i 've encountered   the structure of these deals is limited only by the imagination of investment bankers so i think it is impossible to write a single generic algorithm that handles them all instead i have a framework that i update each quarter as new transactions occur

the range is fine it 's ~ 1 2x your annual income   first and foremost your comment on the 401(k not knowing the fees is a red flag to me the difference between low cost options say sub .25 and the high fees over .75 has a huge impact to your long term savings and on the advice i 'd give regarding maximizing the deposits   at 26 you and your wife have about 20 of your income as savings this is on the low side in my opinion but others suggest a year 's salary by age 35 which implies you 're not too far behind   given your income you are most likely in the 25 federal bracket i 'd like you to research your 401(k expenses and if they are reasonable maximise the deposit if your wife has no 401(k at work she can deposit to an ira pre tax   it 's wise to keep 6 months of expenses as liquid cash or short term cds as an emergency fund in case of such things as a job layoff they say to expect a month of job hunting for each $ 10 k you make so having even a year to find a new job is n't unheard of   one thing to consider is to simply kill the mortgage before suggesting this i 'd ask what your risk tolerance is if you took $ 100 k and put it right into the s&p would you worry every time you heard the market was down today or would you happily leave it there for the next 40 years if you prefer safety or at least less risk paying off the mortgage will free up the monthly payment and let you dollar cost average into the new investments over time you 'll have the experience of seeing your money grow and learn to withstand the volatility   the car loan is a low rate if you prefer to keep the mortgage for now paying the car loan is still a guaranteed 3 vs the near 0 the bank will give you

margin trades let you post a margin of a certain proportion of the value of the trade as collateral against the price of a trade and pay off the difference between the current price and the price that you bought at any losses incurred are taken from the margin so the margin has to be maintained as prices change in practice this means that when the price moves significantly from the buying price a margin call is triggered and the buyer has to increase their posted margin the vast majority of the foreign exchange trades done every day are margin trades as effectively are all spread bets margins get reset overnight whether or not a call has occurred

dividends are declared by the board of directors of a corporation on date a to stock holders of record on date b a later date these stockholders then receive the declared dividend on date c the so called payment date all of these dates are announced on the first declaration date if there is no announcement no dividend will be paid the stock typically goes down in price by approximately the amount of the dividend on the   date it goes ex   but then moves in price to reflect other developments including the possibility of another declaration payment three months hence dividends are important to some investors especially those who live on the income they are less important to investors who are out for capital gains and who may prefer that the company reinvest its money to seek such gains instead of paying dividends in actual fact dividends are one component of total or overall return the other component is capital gains and the sum of the two represents your return

certainly reading the recommended answers about initial investing is a great place to start and i highly recommend reading though that page for sure but i also believe your situation is a little different than the one described as that person has already started their long term career while you are still a couple years away   now tax advantaged accounts like iras are amazingly good places to start building up retirement funds but they also lock up the money and have a number of rules about withdrawals you have fifteen thousand which is a great starting pot of money but college is likely to be done soon and there will likely be a number of expenses with the transition to full time employment   moving expenses first month 's rent nursing exams job search costs maybe a car   all of this can be quite a lot especially if you are in a larger city   it sounds like your parents are very helpful though which is great make sure you have enough money for that transition and emergency expenses first and if there is a significant pool beyond that then start looking at investments   if you determine now is the best time to start than then above question is has great advice but even if not it is still well worth taking some time to understand investing through that question my favorite introduction book on the subject and maybe even a college course   so when you land that first solid nursing job and get situated you can start taking full advantage of the 401 k and iras

there is no penalty for foreigners but rather a 30 mandatory income tax withholding from distributions from 401(k plans you will get it back when you file the income tax return for the year and calculate your actual tax liability including any penalties for a   premature distribution from the 401(k plan you are of course a us citizen and not a foreigner and thus are what the irs calls a us person which includes not just us citizens but permanent immigrants to the us as well as some temporary visa holders but it is entirely possible that your 401(k plan does not know this explicitly this irs web page tells 401(k plan administrators who can i presume is a us person    a retirement plan distribution is presumed to be made to a u.s. person only if the withholding agent a payment that does not meet these rules is presumed to be made to a foreign person   your ssn is presumably on file with the 401(k plan administrator but perhaps you are retired into a country that does not have an income tax treaty with the us and that 's the mailing address that is on file with your 401(k plan administrator if so the 401(k administrator is merely following the rules and not presuming that you are a us person so how can you get around this non presumption the irs document cited above and the links therein say that if the 401(k plan has on file a w-9 form that you submitted to them and the w-9 form includes your ssn then the 401(k plan has valid documentation to associate the distribution as being made to a us person that is the 401(k plan does not need to make any that you are a us person has been proved beyond reasonable doubt so to answer your question will i be penalized when i later start a regular monthly withdrawal from my 401(k yes you will likely have mandatory 30 income tax withholding on your regular 401(k distributions unless you have established that you are    a us person to your 401(k plan by submitting a w-9 form to them

following up on 's answer if you can find a less expensive loan you can refinance the car and reduce the total interest you pay that way or if your loan permits it not all do talk to the bank which holds the loan read the paperwork you did n't look at you may be able to make additional payments to reduce the principal of the loan which will reduce the amount and duration of the loan and could significantly reduce the total interest paid at the cost of requiring you pay more each month or pay an additional sum up front returning the car is not an option a new car loses a large portion of its value the moment you drive it off the dealer 's lot and it ceases to be a new car you ca n't return it you can sell it as a recent model used car but you will lose money on the deal so even if you use that to pay down the loan you will still owe the bank money given the pain involved that way you might as well keep the car and just try to refinance or pay it off next time read and understand all the paperwork before signing   if you had decided this was a mistake within 3 days of buying you might have been able to take advantage of cooling down period laws to cancel the contract if such laws exist in your area a month later is much too late

there really can not be a straightforward answer to this question it all depends on what lengths you take to make the situation advantageous   if you manage to have a constant flow of people living at the place during all of the times you are not living there and manage to find a cleaning service for a reasonable price then yes there is a chance that this could be advantageous for you   if you are simply looking for a way to offset some of the costs of the place you are n't living at full time then you need to draw a comparison between upkeep and how often you will actually have customers   it is likely you will have down time in which there will be no one staying at the house hiring a cleaning service will cut some of your profit and depending on how much that profit is it could be a pretty big cut now not being an expert on taxes i can not say how this will impact those but it is likely that you will have to pay taxes on money earned   all this in mind its a decision you will need to make taking all of the factors into consideration maybe give it a trial run see if after one tenant you make any kind of reasonable profit in the end and decide from there

rather than thinking of becoming a landlord as a passive investment like a bank account or mutual fund it may be useful to think of it as starting a small part time business while certainly many people can and do start their own businesses and there are many success stories there are many cases where things do n't work out quite as they hoped i would n't call starting any new business low risk even one that is n't expected to be one 's main full time job though some may be acceptable risk for your particular circumstances but if you 're going to start a part time business is there any particular reason you 'd do so in real estate as opposed to some other activity it sounds like you 'd be completely new to real estate so perhaps for your first business you 're starting you 'd want it to be something you 're more familiar with or if you do want to enter the real estate world or any other new business be sure to do a lot of research come up with a business plan and be prepared for the possibility of losing money as with any investment or new business

in a word budgeting in order to have money left over at the end of the month you need to be intentional about how you spend it that is all a budget is a plan for spending your money   few people have the discipline and abundance of income necessary to just wing it and not overspend by making a plan at home ahead of time you can decide how much you will spend on food entertainment etc and ensure you have enough money left over for things like rent mortgage and utility bills and still have enough for longer term savings goals like a car purchase or retirement   if you do n't have a plan it 's simply not reasonable to expect yourself to know if you have enough money for a cup as you drive past the starbucks a good plan will allow you to spend on things that are important to you while ensuring that you have enough to meet your obligations and long term goals   another thing a budget will do for you is highlight where your problem is if your problem is that you are spending too much money on luxuries the budget will show you that it might also reveal to you that your rent is too high or your energy consumption is too great on the other hand you might realize after budgeting that your spending is reasonable but your income is too low in that case you should focus on spending more of your time working or looking for a better paying job

well like a lot of stuff on there is not a simple answer but generally it is not a good thing take a look at the wikipedia entry on net operating loss basically the company is commenting that when they do make money they will receive preferential tax treatment on that income     so whether or not this is a positive or a negative depends on a couple of things nol does n't directly impact book value other than how the actual assets of the company changed over the previous quarter i believe there is a 1:1 correspondence to how the assets change and nol but i am sure someone could clarify that for me in another answer or as a comment

nobody has a crash proof portfolio you can make it crash resistant you protect against a crash by diversifying and not reacting out of fear when the markets are down be careful about focusing on the worst possible scenario us default vs. the more likely scenarios right now many people think that inflation and interest rates are heading up so you should be making sure that your bond portfolio is mostly in short duration bonds that are less sensitive to rate risk another risk is opportunity cost many people sold all of their equities in and are sitting on lots of money in cash accounts that money is safe but those investors lost the opportunity to recoup investments or grow to the tune of 25 40

is this an employee stock purchase plan espp if so and there is no required holding period selling right away is essentially a guaranteed bonus with minimal risk one caveat is that sometimes it takes a while to actually receive the shares at your brokerage and in the meantime your company may have an earnings report that could cause the share price to drop if your discount is only 5 for example a bad earnings report could easily wipe that out the only other cons i can think of is espp contributions being withheld from you for months albeit for a virtually guaranteed return and it complicates your taxes a bit on the flip side another pro is that after you sell the shares you are more likely to invest that money rather than spend it

the study of technical analysis is generally used sometimes successfully to time the markets there are many aspects to technical analysis but the simplest form is to look for and in the charts   generally higher highs and higher lows is considered an uptrend   and lower lows and lower highs is considered a downtrend   a trend follower would go with the trend for example see a dip to the trend line and buy on the rebound a simple strategy for this is shown in the chart below   i would be buying this stock when the price hits or gets very close to the trendline and then it bounces back above it i would then have sold this stock once it has broken through below the trendline this may also be an appropriate time if you were looking to short this stock other indicators could also be used in combination for additional confirmation of what is happening to the price another type of trader is called a bottom fisher a bottom fisher would wait until a break above the downtrend line second chart and buy after confirmation of a higher high and possibly a higher low as this could be the start of a new uptrend there are many more strategies dealing with the study of technical analysis and if you are interested you would need to find and learn about ones that suit your investment styles whether you prefer short term trading or longer term investing and your appetite for risk you can develop strategies using various indicators and then paper trade or backtest these strategies you can also manually backtest a strategy in most charting packages you can go back in time on the chart so that the right side of the chart shows a date in the past say one year ago or 10 years ago then you can click forward one day at a time or one week at a time if using weekly charts with your indicators on the chart you can do virtual trades to buy or sell whenever a signal is given as you move forward in time this way you may be able to check years of data in a day to see if your strategy works whatever you do you need to document your strategies in writing in a written trading or investment plan together with a risk management strategy you should always follow the rules in your written plan to avoid you making decisions based on emotions by backtesting or paper trading your strategies it will give you confidence that they will work over the long term   there is a lot of work involved at the start but once you have developed a documented strategy that has been thoroughly backtested it will take you minimal time to successfully manage your investments in my shorter term trading positions held from a couple of days to a few weeks i spend about half an hour per night to manage my trades and am up about 50 over the last 7 months for my longer term investing positions held from months to years i spend about an hour per week and have been averaging over 25 over the last 4 years technical analysis does work for those who have a documented plan have approached it in a systematic way and use risk management to protect their existing and future capital most people who say that is does n't work either have not used it themselves or have used it ad without putting in the initial time and work to develop a documented and systematic approach to their trading or investing

i 'm just trying to visualize the costs of trading say i set up an account to trade something forex stock even bitcoin and i was going to let a random generator determine when i should buy or sell it if i do this i would assume i have an equal probability to make a profit or a loss your question is what a would call an ill posed problem   it makes it a challenge to answer   the short answer is no   we will have to consider three broad cases for types of assets and two time intervals let us start with a very short time interval   the bid ask spread covers the anticipated cost to the market maker of holding an asset bought in the market equal to the opportunity costs over the half life of the holding period   a consequence of this is that you are nearly guaranteed to lose money if your time interval between trades is less than the half life of the actual portfolio of the market maker   to use a dice analogy imagine having to pay a fee per roll before you can gamble   you can win but it will be biased toward losing now let us go to the extreme opposite time period which is that you will buy now and sell one minute before you die   for stocks you would have received the dividends plus any stocks you sold from mergers   conversely you would have had to pay the dividends on your short sales and received a gain on every short stock that went bankrupt   because you have to pay interest on short sales and dividends passed you will lose money on a net basis to the market maker   maybe you are seeing a pattern here   the phrase market maker will come up a lot now let us look at currencies   in the long run if the current fiat money policy regime holds you will lose a lot of money   deflation is not a big deal under a commodity money regime but it is a problem under fiat money so central banks avoid it   so your long currency holdings will depreciate   your short would appreciate except you have to pay interest on them at a rate greater than the rate of inflation to the market maker finally for commodities no one will allow perpetual holding of short positions in commodities because people want them delivered   because insider knowledge is presumed under the commodities trading laws a random investor would be at a giant disadvantage similar to what a chess player who played randomly would face against a grand master chess player   there is a very strong information asymmetry in commodity contracts   there are people who actually do know how much cotton there is in the world how much is planted in the ground and what the demand will be and that knowledge is not shared with the world at large   you would be fleeced can i also assume that probabilistically speaking a trader can not do    worst than random say if i had to guess the roll of a dice my    chance of being correct ca n't be less than a physicist a con man a and a statistician would tell you that dice rolls and coin are not random   while we teach fair coins and fair dice in introductory college classes to simplify many complex ideas they also do not exist   if you want to see a funny version of the dice roll game watch the 1962 japanese movie   it is an action movie but it begins with a dice game    consider adopting a bayesian perspective on probability as it would be a healthier perspective based on how you are thinking about this problem   a frequency approach always assumes the null model is true which is what you are doing   had you tried this will real money your model would have been falsified but you still would n't know the true model yes you can do much worse than of the time   even if you are trying to be fair you have not accounted for the variance extending that logic then for an inexperienced trader is it right to    say then that it 's equally difficult to purposely make a loss then it    is to purposely make a profit because if i can purposely make a loss    i would purposely just do the opposite of what i 'm doing to make a    profit so in the dice example if i can somehow lower my chances of    winning below it means i would simply need to bet on the    other 5 numbers to give myself a better than 83 chance of winning if the game were fair but for things like forex the rules of the game are purposefully changed by the market maker to maximize long run profitability   under us law forex is not regulated by anything other than common law   as a result the market maker can state any price including prices far from the market with the intent to make a system used by actors losing systems such as to trigger margin calls   the prices quoted by forex dealers in the us move loosely with the global rates but vary enough that only the dealer should make money systematically   a fixed strategy would promote loss you are assuming that only you know the odds and they would let you profit from your percentage chance of winning so then is the costs of trading from a purely probabilistic point of    view simply the transaction costs no matter what my chances can not    be worse than random and if my trading system has an edge that is    greater than the percentage of the transaction that is transaction    cost then i am probabilistically likely to make a profit no the cost of trading is the opportunity cost of the money   the transaction costs are explicit costs but you have ignored the implicit costs of foregone interest and foregone happiness using the money for other things you will want to be careful here in understanding probability because the distribution of returns for all of these assets lack a first moment and so there can not be a mean return   a modal return would be an intellectually more consistent perspective implying you should use an all or nothing cost function to evaluate your methodology

because this question seems like it will stick around i will flesh out my comments into an actual answer i apologize if this does not answer your question as asked but i believe these are the real issues at stake for the actual questions you have asked i have paraphrased and below firstly do n't do a real estate transaction without talking to a lawyer at some stage note a real estate broker is not a lawyer secondly as with all transactions with family get everything in writing feelings get hurt when someone mis remembers a deal and wants the terms to change in the future being cold and calculated now by detailing all money in and out will save you from losing a brother in the future should my brother give me money as a down payment and i finance the remainder with the bank if the bank is not aware that this is what is happening this is fraud calling something a gift when really it 's a payment for part ownership of your house is fraud there does not seem to be any debate here though i am not a lawyer if the bank is aware that this is what is happening then you might be able to do this however it is unlikely that the bank will allow you to take out a mortgage on a house which you will not fully own by given your brother a share in the future value in the house the bank might not be able to foreclose on the whole house without fighting the brother on it therefore they would want him on the mortgage the fact that he ca n't get another mortgage means a the banks may be unwilling to allow him to be involved at all and b it becomes even more critical to not commit fraud you are effectively tricking the bank into thinking that you have the money for a down payment and also that your brother is not involved now to the actual question at hand which i answer only for use on other transactions that do not meet the pitfalls listed above this is an incredibly difficult question what happens to your relationship with your brother when the value of the house goes down and he wants to sell but you want to stay living there what about when the market changes and one of you feels that you 're getting a raw deal   you do n't know where the housing market will go as an investment that 's maybe acceptable because risk forms some of the basis of returns but with you getting to live there and with him taking only the risk that risk is maybe unfairly on him he may not think so today while he 's optimistic but what about tomorrow if the market crashes whatever the terms of the agreement are get them in writing and preferably get them looked at by a lawyer consider all scenarios like what if one of you wants to sell does the other have the right to delay or buy you out or what if one if you wants to buy the other out etc etc etc there are too many clauses to here which is why you need to get a lawyer

reading and analyzing financial statements is one of the most important tasks of equity analysts which look at a company from a fundamental perspective   however analyzing a company and its financial statements is much more than just reading the absolute dollar figures provided in financial statements you need to calculate financial ratios which can be compared over multiple periods and companies to be able to gauge the development of a company over time and compare it to its competitors for instance for an equity analyst the absolute dollar figures of a company 's operating profit is less important than the ratio of the operating profit to revenue which is called the operating margin   another very important figure is free cash flow which can be set in relation to sales (= free cash flow sales   the following working capital related metrics can be used as a health check for a company and give you early warning signs when they deviate too much you can either calculate those metrics yourself using a spreadsheet e.g. excel or use a professional solution e.g. bloomberg professional reuters or worldcap

first of all you should absolutely put money into savings until you have at least a 6 month cushion and preferably longer   it does n't matter if you get 0 interest in your savings and have a high interest rate mortgage the cushion is still more important once you have a nice emergency fund you can then consider the question of whether to pay more towards the mortgage if the numbers make sense   however in my opinion it 's not just a straight comparison of interest rates   in other words if your savings account gives you 1 and your mortgage is 5 that 's still not an automatic win for the mortgage the reason is that by putting the money into your mortgage you 're locking it up and ca n't access it   to me money in the hand is worth a lot more than money that 's yours on paper but not easily accessible i do n't know the math well enough but you do n't really need the math   just keep in mind that you have to weight the present value of putting that money into savings vs the future value of putting it into your mortgage and paying less interest at some point in the future   do the math and see how much you will save by paying the mortgage down faster but also keep in mind that future money is worth less than present money   a lot less if you suddenly have an emergency or decide on a major purchase and need the money but then have to jump through hoops to get to it    to me you need to save a considerable amount by paying down the mortgage and also understand that your money is getting locked away for it to make sense

wtf   look at that image   its supposed to show a horrible disgusting greedy rich old unfairly hoarding money   but check it out the mattresses are old and cheap bare like in a and the bills are $ 1 and $ 5     statistically i think being scared and hiding your fixed income under a crappy mattress is a more accurate of old age nowadays than being a and in champagne   i realize this will be an unpopular thought   its very satisfying to have a group to blame for everything   its scary the extent to which we 're being led to hate each other in groups   =

i 'd recommend hitting the loan the hardest but getting something invested as well it 's tempting to see these decisions as binary so it 's good to see you wondering if a mix is best   i admit to being a spreadsheet junky but i think this is a good candidate for working up various scenarios to see where the pain pleasure point is and once you 've identified it move forward with it e.g. let 's say it 's a 10 k lump sum you 're dealing with what does 5k on the loan and 5k invested look like over the next 6 months 12 months 24 months requires assumptions on investment performance what about 6 k loan 4 k invested 7 k loan 3 k invested etc
