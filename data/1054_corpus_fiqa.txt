when calculating the npv is there anything i need to do in between the project start date outlay nov 2017 and the first cash inflow july 2019 do i need to discount the cashflow to the present and if so how yes you need to discount every cash flow to the present time not just the first one    when discounting cash flows the appropriate discount rate needs to represent the opportunity cost of the initial cash outlay   meaning if you were to use that money for something else what rate of return would you expect you could be safe and assume only a risk free return like 2 3 or use the average rate of return of other investments e.g. 10 15 another common approach is to use your cost of capital if you 're raising funds for the project or would instead have use the funds to pay off existing debt once you find a relevant discount rate then just discount each cash flow by dividing them by where r is the annualized discount rate e.g. 0.10 for 10 and t is the decimal number of years between now and the cash flow e.g. 1.5 for 18 months

this paper by a columbia business school professor says the standard strategy outperforms a 100 bond or 100 stock strategy over the 1926 1940 period figure 5 and over the 1990 2011 period figure 6 this is based on actual market data from those periods   you can see the figures in the pdf   these are periods of 14 and 21 years which is perhaps shorter than the amount of time money would sit in your ira but still a fairly long time   the author goes on with a lot of additional discussion and claims that under certain conditions rebalancing will always outperform a buy and hold portfolio given sufficient time of course there are also many periods over which a given asset mix would underperform so there are no guarantees here   i read your question as asking is there any data suggesting that rebalancing a diversified portfolio can outperform an all in one asset class portfolio   there is some such data   however if you 're asking which investing strategy you should actually choose you 'd want to look at a lot of data on both sides   you 're unlikely to find data that proves anything either way it should also be noted that the rebalancing advantage described here and in your question is not specific to bonds   for instance in theory rebalancing between us and international stocks could show a similar advantage over an all us or all non us portfolio the paper contains a lot of additional discussion about rebalancing   it seems that your question is really about whether rebalancing a diverse portfolio is better than going all in with one asset class and this question is touched on throughout the paper   the author mentions that diversification and rebalancing strategies should be chosen not solely for their effect on mathematically calculated returns but for their match with your psychological makeup and tolerance for risk

there 's really not a simple yes no answer   it depends on whether you 're doing short term trading or long term investing   in the short term it 's not much different from sports betting and would be almost an exact match if the also got a percentage of the team 's ticket sales in the long term though your profit mostly comes from the growth of the company   as a company apple say or tesla increases sales of iphones or electric cars it either pays out some of the income as dividends or invests them in growing the company so it becomes more valuable   if you bought shares cheaply way back when you profit from this increase when you sell them   the person buying it does n't lose as s he buys at today 's market value in anticipation of continued growth   of course there 's a risk that the value will go down in the future instead of up of course there are also psychological factors say when people buy apple or tesla because they 're popular instead of at a rational valuation   or when people start panic selling as in the 08 crash   so then their loss is your gain assuming you did n't panic of course

as others have noted your definition of market price is a bit loose   really whatever price you get becomes the current market price   what you usually get quoted are the current best bid and ask with the last transaction price   for stocks that do n't trade much the last transaction price may not be representative of the current market value your question included regulation standards bureau and i do n't think the current answers are addressing that   in the us the securities and exchange commission sec provides some regulation regarding execution price   it goes by the designation regulation and very roughly it says that each transaction has to take the best available price at the time that it is executed   there are some but that 's the gist of it no regulation ensures that there will be a counterparty to any transaction that you want to make   it could happen for example that you have shares of some company that you 're never able to sell because no one wants them bitcoin is the same in this regard   there is a currently a market for bitcoin but there 's no regulation that ensures there will be a market for it tomorrow outside of the us i do n't know what regulation if any exists

start the process by contacting the company that services the mortgage they can answer all your questions they should have a form that needs to be submitted you will want to get from them the most up to date payoff amount x days from now the amount changes each day they will be sending you a document that the debt has been met they will also be filing paperwork with the county city releasing the property from the mortgage obligation   because all my mortgage payoffs have either been or refinancing or i have sold the property the balance due was significant and the lender required a cashiers check contact them to ask if it only a few thousand left they might take a regular check sending the checks via overnight delivery speeds up the process and cuts down on the uncertainty of the delivery date ask for a return receipt so that you have proof of the date it was received overpay by a couple of days they will refund the overage if you let the mortgage run its course you will still get a document back from them they will still file the documents with the local government and they will refund any overage if you look at the coupon book or the paperwork they gave you at settlement the last payment is usually a different amount due to rounding of the monthly payments   of course if you have been making extra payments or larger than required payments the numbers on the original coupon book are moot so contact the company for the last payment amount

h1b visas are not terrible and i am not against all h1b visas however it is a bald faced lie to suggest the number 1 if not only reason companies use them is to cut labor costs these companies are not advertising they could have hired local talent but chose to provide the job to someone from a poorer region   i think whatever city everybody in the world wants to work or go to school like tokyo or london or paris or boston that is going to have the world 's best talent also if those people go back to their they do n't bring with them the ideas from the city they worked or but rather the best ideas from all over the world   that is n't at all what is happening in technology there are plenty of computer science and electrical engineer majors in the usa out of work and some making six figures with a bs degree and 3 years experience but so many are out of work many of those jobs were outsourced but the talent used was so poor the cost to upkeep or update was so expensive that many companies brought back the jobs to the usa those companies still want to hire the same low cost workers but want them working in the usa for reasons i will spare here the usa talent pool is so full and jobs so scarce it drives down wages not actually because what really happens in the company is toxic to work for and demands 16 hour days 7 days a week for the same great salary that may have once been 40 hours a week with fun and entertainment and space and a gym on site etc   stopping h1b visas would force companies to bring back their on site gyms large break rooms increase work life balance etc   stopping h1b visas mean a lot of billion dollar tech companies would have to pay their shareholders and executives less this year than last year which is outrageous in the race to the bottom

ok you 're looking at this in a very confusing way first as said by the dividend yield is the dividends paid in the year as a percent of the stock price given this fact then if the stock price moves down and the dividend stays the same then the yield increases company 's do n't usually pay out on a yield basis that 's mostly just a calculation to measure how strong a dividend is this could mean either a. the stock is underpriced and will rise which will lower the yield to a more normal level or b. the company is not doing as well and eventually the dividends will decrease to a point where the yield again looks more normal    second off let 's look at it in a more realistic way that still takes into account your assumptions   year 1 1 instead of assuming buying 35 let 's put this into a share amount let 's say there are 1,000,000 shares so you just bought 350k shares for $ 700k you paid a price of $ 2/share let 's assume the market decides that 's a fair price and it stays that way through the end of year 1 this gives us a market capitalization of $ 2 million   2 the dividend paid out at year 1 is $ 60k so you could calculate on a per share basis which would be a dividend of $ 60k 1 million shares or a $ 0.06 dividend per share our stock price is still at $ 2.00 so our yield comes out to $ 0.06 $ 2.00 or 3.0   year 2 assuming no additional shares issued there are still a total of 1 million shares outstanding you owned 350k and now want to purchase another 50k 5 of outstanding share float the market price you are able to purchase the 50k shares at has now changed which means that share price is now valued at $ 1.50 share we have a dividend paid out at $ 100k which comes out to a dividend per share of $ 0.10 we have a share value of $ 1.50 and the $ 0.10 dividend per share giving us a new yield of    conclusion there are many factors that can cause a company 's stock price to fluctuate some of it is hype based but some of it is a result of material changes in your case the stock went down 25 in most scenarios where a stock would have that much decline it would likely either not have been paying a dividend in the first place or would maybe not be paying one for much longer most companies that pay dividends are larger and more mature companies with a steady healthy and predictable cash flow also most companies that are that size would not trade a stock under $ 3.00 i know this is just an example but the scenario is definitely a bit extreme in terms of the price drop and dividend increase again the yield is just a calculation that depends on the dividend that is usually planned in advance and the stock price that can fluctuate for many reasons i hope this made everything more clear and let me know if you have any other questions

your question is missing too much to be answered directly instead here are some points to consider short term gains taxed at your marginal rates whereas long term gains have preferable capital gains rates up to 20 tax rate instead of your marginal rate so if you 're selling at gain you might want to consider to sell fifo and pay lower capital gains tax rate instead of the short term marginal rate if you 're selling at loss and have other short term gains you would probably be better selling lifo so that the loss could offset other short term gains that you might have   if you 're selling at loss and do n't have short term gains to offset you can still offset your long term gains with short term losses but the tax benefit will be lower in this case fifo might be a better choice again if you 're selling at loss beware of the wash sale rules as you might not be able to deduct the loss if you buy sell within too short a window

dividends are paid based on who owns the security on a designated day   if a particular security pays once per year you hold days and sell on the day before the critical day you get no dividend   this is not special to 401(k or to drip   it 's just how the system works the critical day is the day before the posted ex dividend date for the security if you own at the end of that day you get the dividend   if you sell on that day or before you do not your company changing providers is not in itself relevant   the important factor is whether you can still hold your same investments in the new plan   if not you will not get the dividend on anything that you currently hold but sell due to the change in providers   if you can then you potentially get the dividend so long as there 's no glitch in the transition incidentally it works the other way too   you might end up getting a dividend through the new plan for something that you did not hold the full year

it might not be for first time payers but they do have programs some federal some local that help the poor and elderly complete their tax forms there are also programs that allow the poor to file electronically for free for most people the first time they file their taxes they are using the ez form which is rather easy to do even without the use of either web based or pc based software the software tools all ask enough questions on the ez forms to allow the user to know with confidence when their life choices have made it advantageous to use the more complex forms the web versions of the software allow the taxpayer to start for free thus reducing their initial investment for the software to zero because the first time filer is frequently a teenager the parents are generally responsible for proving that initial guidance   the biggest risk for a young taxpayer might be that the first year that itemizing deductions might be advantageous they might never consider it so they over pay or they discover in april that if they had only kept a receipt from a charity six months ago they could deduct the donation so they are tempted to   claim the donation without proof regarding and assistance there is an interesting tax credit the earned income tax credit it gives a tax credit to the working poor they alert people that they need to check your eligibility for the earned income tax credit they know that significant numbers of taxpayers fail to claim it eitc can be a boost for workers who earned $ or less in 2012    yet the irs estimates that one out of five eligible taxpayers fails to    claim their eitc each year the irs wants everyone who is eligible for    the credit to get the credit that they ’ve earned the rules for getting the credit are simple all the information needed to claim it is already on the basic tax forms but you have to know that you need a separate form to get the credit but instead of making the credit automatic they say if you use irs e file to prepare and file your tax return the    software will guide you and not let you forget this important step    e file does the work and figures your eitc for you and then   with irs free file you can claim eitc by using brand name tax    preparation software to prepare and e file your tax return for free    it 's available exclusively at irs.gov free help preparing    your return to claim your eitc is also available at one of thousands    of volunteer income tax assistance sites around the country to find    the volunteer site nearest to you use the locator tool on    irs.gov but if you do n't use free file you might never know about the form apparently it escapes 20 of the people who could claim it

stock market is like poker you do n't take the same risks when it is fake money and thus you do n't learn the same lessons from your mistakes i would recommend instead to play with real market and real money rule 0 use only money that you do n't need start with safe products and go to the bath progressively it took me about ten years and i am still learning

theta is a variable in options pricing theta aka time decay decreases over time the reason of this is that you have to think of the option as insurance it is a hedge against actual holdings in an asset would you pay more or less for insurance that covers you for a year 's time would you pay more or less for insurance that covers you for a week the answer is that the market will pay less for insurance that covers them for a lower period of time this is one of several ways of thinking about it there is also the probability that the option will be profitable at all the further out in the future the more likely it will be profitable and people will pay a premium for it there are other variables in the black scholes formula and it is the most widely used options pricing formula but keep in mind the geniuses that made up the formula blew up their hedge fund thinking they could sell the options at an inflated premium from their own formula to everyone ironic really

systemic and well know patterns in sales are priced in to the security   typically companies with very cyclical earnings like this will issue guidance of earnings per share within a range   these expected earnings are priced in before the earnings are actually booked   if a company meets these expectations the stock will likely stay relatively flat   if the company misses this expectation the stock generally will get slammed    this kind of wall street behavior typically media outlets when a company 's stock declines after reporting a record high level of whatever metric   the record high is irrelevant if it misses the expectation there is no crystal ball but if something is both well known and expected it 's already been priced in   if the well known expected event does n't occur maybe it 's a new normal

the reason to put more money down or accept a shorter maximum term is because the bank the deal or fails to sour it in some fashion   for example typically if there is less than 20 down you have to pay an premium called private mortgage insurance which makes it bad deal but i see banks offering the same rate for a mortgage as for a 30-year one and i think fools and their money   take the 30-year and if you feel like it pay more every month   although why you would feel like it i do n't know since it 's very difficult to get that money back if you need it

yeshiva university amp all the high schools connected to them my boys former yeshiva yeshiva yeshiva yeshiva berlin and plenty of girls schools i mean there are many many many more jewish schools that teach what you are calling modern concepts   you are right that there are many that have an elitist attitude there are many who are absolutely not like that i also find the elitist attitude is more about the fact that many jews do nt have to have any interaction outside of the jewish community they can go to jewish universities work at jewish companies live in predominantly jewish neighborhood and mostly do n't need to interact with anything outside of the jewish community   i do find it wrong because while you can live a life of values we are supposed to be a light upon other nations and that requires some form of interaction   also this is fucking america we need to be a part of this nation does n't mean we need to not be but jews need to show that they are invested in the communities in politics and the like   but then again you gets what s happening with that school board which i 'm on the side that the state is really screwing with that school district with funding from what i have read up on the case so it is a catch 22   as as for not embracing modern ways there is much about political correctness and progressive attitudes that are going far over the top i find that orthodox judaism viewpoint on men amp women are actually pretty slanted towards women and always have been that jewish religious law only applies to jews and not non jews so all that stuff that the christians keep saying oh the old testament says this and blah blah blah according to jews it does n't apply to non jews only the 7 laws of noah apply to the of the world according to judaism   also by following the sorry but that does n't mean we are a part of the modern civilization if one does n't like following orthodox judaism then do n't do so no one is forcing you with a gun to your head most orthodox jews i know are respectful of conservative amp reform jews i know where we live it is very much like that two of my kids are best friends with kids whose parents belong to a conservative orthodox jews are a part of every type of career that is out there they do n't force their ideology onto others do n't try to convince people to convert do n't tell you that you are going to hell if you do n't follow their and the biggest things that set jews apart are dietary laws following the and all of our holidays and how does that hurt anyone or make us not modern   yes there are many who are not like what i wrote above but the majority are not like what you wrote

your first step should be to visit with the financial aid office of the university that you are considering attending perhaps even before filling out the fafsa you may be eligible for grants scholarships and subsidized loans as well as unsubsidized loans you should pursue the first two options first and then when you know how much remains to be financed we can evaluate which of your investments you might liquidate if further financing is needed there are a range of views on debt on this board i take a very cautious approach to going in to debt i worked full time and took night classes to finish my degree without debt but depending on your program that might not be an option it seems that you also have a healthy relationship with debt considering the shape of your savings and finances as outlined above apart from the above information about how much money could be obtained and at what interest rates the other missing information is your current salary and your expected salary range after completing the program with all of that information i could make specific recommendations but at this point my only recommendation is to avoid liquidating any retirement accounts in your effort to invest in yourself if at all possible

i would say the most challenging fact for this assertion is that hft firms operate with extremely limited capital bases for a stock with say 10 m shares adv even a very large and successful hft strategy might use a position limit of no more than 5000 shares   that is to say if you sum up and net the buys and sells for a stock across the day the hft firm will never exceed 10,000 shares 2x position limits assuming it completely flipped on a stock that trades 10,000,000 shares on a given day the high volumes are attained through high turnover the strategy might trade up to 500,000 shares or 5 of the volume attaining a 50x turnover   but that brings me back to the original point in the market literature market impact generally has been found to scale linearly or even sub linearly for net volume executed    if i alternate between thousands of 1 lot buy and sell orders it would be very difficult for me to move the market because the market impact of every one of my buy orders roughly cancels the market impact of my almost exactly equal number of sell orders    there might be a higher order mechanism at work but i 'm genuinely curious what you think it might be how could strategies that attain such small net positions have such out sized impact on market direction

inflation will hurt your landlord but it wo n't hurt you in either case you have to pay 7200 regardless of how much inflation has increased over two years   however they are not equivalent to you if you take the monthly payment then you can potentially come out ahead if you were to take the 7200 and put it in a savings account and just pay monthly then you 'll be earning interest that you would n't get if you paid up front   there 's a whole lot of other investment options you could go with too but that 's another question the risk here is that if you go through financial hardship you may be tempted to draw on that 7200 early and come up short for rent one month

unless you need extremely large sums of money i suggest you use an atm or look for a credit card that has no foreign transaction fees rare afaik it 's not possible for a retail buyer to purchase currency at the current exchange rate quoted online   you are always going to be paying some spread above that and the atm gets you the closest you could also try to use a bank that has branches in your country and japan like hsbc and do your banking there   then you likely would n't have to pay as much in fees and possibly could draw on your account in japan

lets look at possible use cases if you ever converted your cryptocurrency to cash on a foreign exchange then yes you had to report that means if you ever and the us dollar or other fiat amount was $ 10,000 or greater when you went out of crypto then you need to report because the regulations stipulate you need to report over $ 10,000 at any point in the year if you did not convert your cryptocurrency to cash and only had them on an exchange 's servers perhaps traded for other cryptocurrency pairs then no this did not fall under the regulations example in 2013 i wanted to cash out of a cryptocurrency that did n't have a usd market in the united states but i did n't want to go to cash on a foreign exchange specifically for this reason amongst others so i sold my litecoin on btc e slovakia for bitcoin and then i sold the bitcoin on coinbase usa   even though btc e had a litecoin usd market and then i could day trade the swings easily to make more capital gains but i wanted cash in my bank account and did n't want the reporting overhead read the regulations yourself financial instruments that are reportable cash fiat securities futures and options also whether it is just in the blockchain or on a server irs and fincen said bitcoin is not reportable on fbar when they update their guidance it 'll be in the news the director of fincen is very active in cryptocurrency developments and guidance bitcoin has been around for six years it is n't that esoteric and the government is n't that confused on what it is irs and fincen 's hands are tied by congress in how to more realistically categorize cryptocurrency although at this point in time there are several very liquid exchanges within the united states such as the one nyse ice hosts coinbase

suppose you 're writing a put with a strike price of 80 say the asset price goes down to 70 so the holder of the put will exercise the option ie he has a right to sell a share worth 70 for rs 80 whereas a put option writer has an obligation to buy at rs 80 a share trading at rs 70 always think from the perspective of the holder if the holder exercises the option the writer will suffer a loss maximum loss he suffers will be the break even which is strike price reduced by the premium paid if he does n't exercise the option the writer will make a profit which can maximum be the put premium received

reporting costs on a fully loaded basis means that the business should report costs directly and indirectly associated with its product and the relevant indirect costs e.g. overhead indirect charges etc if you 're looking at a company in general the fully loaded cost basis of the firm is essentially all costs related to the it offers in economics accounting 101 terms reporting costs on a fully loaded basis means reporting both the fixed and variable costs associated with production fixed costs are costs that remain constant regardless of how much the firm produces e.g. general overhead like rent managers salaries etc while variable costs are per unit costs that may change as the firm increases or decreases production e.g. the cost of materials hourly wages etc

specifically on the subject of maxing out your 401k there are several downsides the employer match usually only applies to the first 6 some employers offer no match at all you listed the match as a pro but i think it should be pointed out that you can usually get this benefit without maxing out your plan the investment options are limited usually there is at least one fund available from all the common investment classes but these may not be your preferred funds if you were able to choose for yourself fees can be very high if you are working for a small to medium size company the fees for each fund will often be higher than for the same funds in a plan offered by a large company fees are usually related to the dollar amount of assets under management each person has a different tax situation so if you are single and making 6 figures you might still be in the 25 bracket even after maxing out your 401k but the same person filing jointly with a spouse that makes less could get down to the 15 bracket with a smaller contribution i meet my retirement savings goals without maxing out the 401k as long as the amount is above the employer match amount my second priority is to funnel as much money as possible in to my ira because i get lower fees and better investment options from vanguard

so what 's the point of a charge back if they simply take the word of the merchant tl;dr they do n't as both a merchant and a consumer i have been on both ends of credit card chargebacks and have received what i consider to be mostly fair outcomes in all cases here are some examples takeaways from this i strongly urge all consumers who are considering doing a chargeback to try to work with the merchant first and use the cc dispute as a last resort in general you can think of the credit card dispute department like a judge they hear the arguments presented by both sides and consider them to the best of their ability they do n't always get it right but they make their best attempt given the limited information they are provided

jeez you want me to come over and read the articles to you as well    operates the national health insurance scheme to provide citizens with health insurance the level of premiums citizens must pay varies according to their level of income most medical facilities are run directly by the ministry of health or health   operates a system of universal health insurance through the ministry of health called de mutual health a system of community based insurance where people pay premiums based on their income level into local health insurance funds with the wealthiest paying the highest premiums and required to cover a small percentage of their medical expenses while those at the lowest income levels are exempt from paying premiums and can still utilize the services of their local health fund in 2012 this system insured all but 4 of the   has a system of universal healthcare as set out by the 1995 national health insurance law the state is responsible for providing health services to all residents of the country who can register with one of the four national health service funds to be eligible a citizen must pay a health insurance tax   now if you want to be about whether income based taxes levied on an individual for nation wide healthcare counts as requiring a person to purchase insurance you can but i think we both know that level of semantics is reserved for people who 've said something stupid and now have to retreat into word games

# 523521
you have several questions in your post so i 'll deal with them individually is taking small sums from your ira really that detrimental i mean as far as tax is concerned percentage wise you pay the tax on the amount plus a 10 penalty plus the opportunity cost of the gains that the money would have gotten   at 6 growth annually in 5 years that 's more than a 34 loss   there are much cheaper ways to get funds than tapping your ira is n't the 10 penalty really to cover ss and the medicare tax that you did not pay before putting money into your retirement no you still pay ss and medicare on your gross income 401(k contributions just reduce how much you pay in income tax   the 10 penalty is to dissuade you from using retirement money before you retire if i contributed that to my ira before taxes including ss and medicare tax that money would gain 6 interest again you would still pay ss and medicare and like you say there 's no guarantee that you 'll earn 6 on your money   i do n't think you can pay taxes up front when making an early withdrawal from an ira can you   this one you got right   when you file your taxes your ira contributions for the year are totaled up and are deducted from your gross income for tax purposes there 's no tax effect when you make the contribution would it not be better to contribute that $ 5500 to my ira and if i did n't need it great let it grow but if i did need it toward the end of the year do an early withdrawal so what do you plan your tax withholdings against   do you plan on keeping it there reducing your withholdings and pay a big tax bill plus possibly penalties if you need it   or do you plan to take it out and have a big refund when you file your taxes you might be better off saving that up in a savings account during the year and if at the end of the year you did n't use it then make an ira contribution which will lower the taxes you pay   do n't use your ira as a hopeful savings account so if i needed to withdrawal $ 5500 and i am in the 25 tax bracket i would owe the government $ 1925 in 10 penalty so if i withdrew $ to cover the tax and penalty i would then be taxed $ 2600 an additional $ 675 sounds like a cat chasing it 's tail trying to cover the tax yes if you take a withdrawal to pay the taxes if you pay the tax with non retirement money then the cycle stops how can i make a withdrawal from an ira without having to pay tax on tax pay cash for the tax and penalty rather then taking another withdrawal to pay the tax   if you ca n't afford the tax and penalty in cash then do n't withdraw at all based on this year 's w-2 form i had an accountant do my taxes and the $ 27 k loan was added as earned income then in another block there was the $ 2700 amount for the penalty so you paid 25 in income tax for the earned income and an additional 10 penalty   so in your case it was a 35 overall tax instead of the 40 rule of thumb since many people are in 28 and 35 tax brackets the bottom line is it sounds like you are completely unorganized and have absolutely no margin to cover any unexpected expenses   i would stop contributing to retirement today until you can get control of your spending get on a budget and stop trying to use your ira as a piggy bank   if you do n't plan on using the money for retirement then do n't put it in an ira   stop borrowing from it and getting into further binds that force you to make bad financial decisions you do n't go into detail about any other aspects mortgage car loans consumer debt to even begin to know where the real problem is   so you need to write everything down that you own and you owe write out your monthly expenses and income and figure out what you can cut if needed in order to build up some cash savings until then you 're driving across country in a car with no tires worrying about which highway will give you the best gas mileage

lots of questions in general no market capitalization and equity represent 2 different things   equity first the equity of a firm is the value of the assets what it owns less its liabilities what it owes and consists broadly of two components share capital what the firm gets when it sells to investors as part of an ipo or subsequent share issue and retained earnings what the firm has as a result of making profits and not paying them out as dividends this is the theoretical liquidation value of the firm what it is worth if it stops trading sells all its assets and pays all its debts market capitalization is the current value of the future cash flow of the firm as perceived by the market the value today of all the dividends that the firm will pay in the future for as long as it exists this is the theoretical going concern value of the firm what it is worth as a functioning business in general market capitalization is bigger than equity if it is n't the firm is worth more as scrap than as an operating business um no if you do n't have any shares then you are by definition not an owner having shares is what makes you an owner what i think you mean is is it possible for the owner(s of a private company to sell all of its shares when it goes public the answer is yes it is uncommon for a start up owner to do this but it is standard practice for corporate raiders who buy failing companies take them private restructure them and then take them public again they have done their job and they are not interested in maintaining an ownership stake nope see above and below not at all equity is an accounting construct and market capitalization is about market sentiment consider the following hypothetical firm it has $ 1 m in equity it makes $ 4 m in profit and will do for the foreseeable future it pays all of that $ 4 m out as dividends if we work on a simple roi of 10 then this firm is worth $ 40 m dollars way more than its equity

lotteries are like the inverse of insurance policies instead of paying money to mitigate the impact of an unlikely event which is extremely negative you are paying money to obtain a chance of experiencing an unlikely event which is extremely positive one thing to keep in mind regarding lotteries is the diminishing marginal utility of money if you know you 'll never use more than say $ 100 million in your entire life no matter how much money you might acquire then buying tickets for lotteries where the grand prize is over $ 100 million stops being increasingly worth the price of entry personally i 'd rather play a lottery where the grand prize is million and where there are no prizes which are million because i do not believe that any other amounts of winnings are going to be life changing for me in a way that i am likely to fully appreciate

during the hyperinflation of the republic corporate stocks and convertible bonds were thought second only to the species gold silver etc as the only secure currencies   as milton friedman proved inflation is caused solely by the monetary token supply increasing faster than productivity   in the past days of species of currency it was caused by governments the currency e.g. the same amount of silver in 50 coins to 100 coins sudden increases in the supply of precious metals can also trigger it the various gold rushes in 19th century and later improvements in extraction methods caused of inflation most famously the huge amounts of silver the spanish extracted from the new world mines devastated the european economy with high inflation governments use inflation as a form of stealth flat tax money functions as an abstract universal trade good and it all the rules of supply and demand if the supply of money goes up suddenly then its value drops in relation to real goods and service but that drop in value does n't occur instantly the increased quality of tokens has to through the market before the value changes   so the first institution to spend the debased currency can get the full current value from trade the second gets slightly less the third even less and so on in 2008 the federal reserve began printing money and loaning at 0 to insolvent backs who then used that money to buy t bill this had the effect of giving the banks an arbitrary a1 rated asset for their fractional reserve while the federal government got full pre inflation value of the money paid for the t bills as the government spent that money the number of tokens increased fast than the economy   in times of inflation the value of money per unit drops as its supply increases and increases the best hedges against inflation are real assets e.g. land equipment stocks ownership of real assets and convertible bonds which are convertible to stock   it 's important to remember that money is of itself worthless it 's just a technology that and trading which at the base is still a barter system during inflation the barter value of money plunges owing to increased supply but the direct barter value between any two real assets remain the same because their supplies have not changed   the value of stocks and convertible bonds is maintained by the economic activity of the company whose ownership they represent dividends stock prices and bond equity as measured in the inflated currency continue to rise in sync with inflation thus they preserve the original value of the money paid for them not sure why you expect more inflation the only institution that can create inflation in the us is the federal reserve which trump has no direct control off deregulation of banks wo n't cause inflation in and of itself as the private banks can not alter the money supply if banks fail owing to deregulation unlikely i think given the dismal nearly century long record of regulation to date then the federal reserve might fix the problem with another inflation tax but otherwise not

i suppose this could really depend on the part of the world you 're in but there are still many instances of emergencies that need cash you have to decide how much cash is the right amount but i still recommend having $ 1,000 or so in liquid cash it can really make a huge difference let me give a few examples   bad weather i live in florida and after a hurricane if you want gas food or water you 're going to need cash atm networks are the last to get repaired same for internet cell services are not at the top of the list you could be 4 5 days without access to your accounts if you need anything in that time frame it 's cash or the red cross children as a foster parent we keep some cash on hand because as kids come in to our care we want to get them in school right away how are they going to eat you ca n't give them your plastic you have n't had time to setup lunch accounts or the like cash always works along those same lines are bus tickets clothes supplies and what not not everywhere will take an atm card and if your money is tied up in a stock then what are you supposed to do for 3 days tell your new kid that he ca n't eat big emergency problems like your car breaks down on the interstate sure it can get to the dealership and yes they will add the tow to your bill and sure you have a few days to pay it while your car gets fixed but how are you going to get around not all taxis take plastic around here   almost none of the busses take plastic even though they are supposed to lost wallet or id theft lose your wallet good luck getting into your bank accounts it can take weeks to establish your id after you lose it in some cases you want your id but you need your birth certificate you have to go to the state of birth and request it oh but wait to travel you need an id no problem send away for it but wait you need to send them money to mail it to bad all your money is tied up   running or so you need to for some reason no big deal but all your money is in a place you ca n't get to it how do you put gas in your car lets stick with it and say you get to cash out an account of some kind guess what they 're not going to mail it to some random address now you 're stuck fighting support centers to get them to understand that you need your funds delivered to new york even though you live in florida   in short you do n't need $ 100,000 in liquid funds but there are a few cases that you need something liquid you also make a lot of assumptions for example not every one will have health insurance or a heath problem that is covered by their insurance some serious home repairs are down payment upfront car problems like an accident that means you need a rental can totally be up front especially if credit cards ca n't be used

keeping a receipt does allow you to verify that the expected amount was charged debited it also can help when you need to return an item   regarding double charging the credit card companies look for that if the same card is used at the same vendor for the same exact amount in a short period of time the credit card company will flag the transaction they assume either a mistake was made or fraud is being attempted the most likely result is that the transaction is denied   a dishonest vendor can write down the card number expiration date and cvv number then after you leave make up a new transaction for any amount they want you of course would n't have a paper receipt for this fraudulent transaction the key is reviewing your transaction history every few days looking for unexpected amounts locations or number of transactions

disclaimer i am not canadian and have no experience with their laws and regulations there really are n't any safe short term investment options at the moment with interest rates being close to zero so just put the money aside you will need for the car and the computer maybe on a callable savings account to make at least a few dollars do not take out any loans it is very unlikely you will earn more than the cost of the loan you did n't say how much will be left but unfortunately it really is not much to go on anyway considering that you seem to have enough income to cover your expenses you could transfer the rest to your rrsp invest and just forget about it i suggest to follow this rule of thumb the growth portion of your portfolio which for you means equities should be directly related to the number of years you wo n't need to touch these funds 1 year 0 equity 2 years 10 3 years 20 and so on what 's not in equities you could put in short term bonds meaning an average duration of about 3 years needless to say single stocks bonds are out of question ideally you can find 2 etfs one for stocks and one for bonds respectively however if there is any possibility you did not mention that you could suddenly depend on this money you have to keep your equity exposure and thus your potential earnings low just a humble thought i really do n't know your specific situation my apologies if i 'm out of line often disability means that you are not capable of doing one particular thing anymore i.e. work physically just maybe you would still be capable to do some other type of work maybe even from the comfort of your home that would allow you to generate a certain income and also keep you busy   i hope this helps good luck

gold is not debt money is debt whatever it is made of   in the example above everything could have been exactly the same except using certificates written on sharks instead of on paper    now sharks have value paper has value and gold has value when you print money the stuff you make it out of has some utility separate from its use as currency but when you are using it as currency regardless of what it is made from it is a marker for debt    you go to work for an hour your boss gives you a marker that you can trade for a cheeseburger or some gasoline or a or or whatever you want that marker is an iou for the work you did you give it to the store and it becomes an iou for the value of one they give it to the store employees or the grower or whatever and so on    it does n't matter what that marker is made out of its function is the same if it were gold you could melt it down and make a ring out of it if it 's paper you could use it as a bookmark or a shopping list or to blow your nose if it 's a shark you scare people with it in the pool   this is totally separate from the question of whether we should be using gold as a currency which has to do with the fact that the gold supply is a lot more stable than the paper supply and whether being able to easily print more money on demand is a good thing or a bad thing

at the time of the auction android was just but many companies were restricting the phones that they allowed on their networks so that they could control what the phones were being used for   the big guys at&t and sprint feared that being forced to allow phones that could do things they did not have control over would cost them since they charged for every little feature they added they also wanted to prevent their phones which they subsidize to their customers in to reap long term profits from being taken to other networks    saw the potential for the largest chunk of bandwidth available to the 's to be restricted to services of one company and their strangle hold over the phones and services that were allowed to use it   they the bidding to ensure that this did not happen   there are many who believe that bought the spectrum more to prevent anyone from with them than because they actually wanted to use it   but at least they are forced to allow other parties in to compete even if it is on their playground

it 's hard to answer without knowing all of the details i.e. what was your salary for each of the options but i think you probably made a good choice 1099 would have required you to pay self employment tax but also would have allowed you to deduct business expenses w2 with benefits likely would have been beneficial if you needed healthcare since group plans can be cheaper than individual plans and healthcare payments are n't taxed but if you do n't use the healthcare that would have been a waste w2 no benefits assuming your salary here falls between the 1099 and the w2 with benefits it seems like a good compromise for your situation

asset = equity + income expense + liability everything could be cancelled out in double entry accounting   by your logic if the owner contributes capital as asset equity is very similar to asset   you will end up cancelling everything i.e. 0 = 0   you do not understate liability by cancelling them with asset   say you have $ 10000 debtors and $ 10000 creditors you do not say net debtors = $ 0 on the balance sheet   you are challenging the fundamental concepts of accounting   certain accounts are contra accounts for example accumulated depreciation is contra asset retained loss and unrealized revaluation loss is contra equity

i am a bit unsure of why the interest rate is relevant   are you intending on borrowing the money to go to school   if you can not pay cash then it is very likely a bad idea   many people are overcome by events when seeking higher education and such a loan on a such a salary could devastate you financially    so i find the cost of the program as a total of k counting a loss in salary during the program and the first year grant   that is a lot of money do you intend to borrow that much   especially when you consider that your salary after you graduate will be about equal to where you are now   for that reason i am leaning toward a no even if you had the cash in hand to do so    there is nothing to say that you will enjoy teaching   furthermore teaching in low income school is more challenging    all that said is there a way you can raise your income without going back to school   washington state can be a very expensive place to live and is one of the reason why i left   i am a alumni go   could you cash flow a part time program instead i would give this a sound no ymmv

really the question you need to ask yourself is how much risk you want to take in order to save a little on interest for 5 years rates are pretty close to a historic low and if you have good credit you should shop around a bit to get a good ideal of what a 15 or 30 year fixed loan would go for for people that are sure they will be selling a property in a few years a balloon or arm might not be a bad thing   otoh if their plans change or if you plan to stay in the property for longer e.g. 10 15 years then they have the potential to turn into a huge trap and could have the effect of forcing you to sell your house    the most likely people to fall into such a trap are those who are trying to buy more house than they can really afford and max out what they can pay using a lower rate and then later can not afford the payments if anything happens that makes the rate go up   over the last three years we 've seen a large number of foreclosures and short sales taking place are because of people who fell into just this kind of trap   i strongly advise you learn from their mistakes and do not follow in their   you need to consider what could happen in 5 years time    or if the economy takes off and/or the fed is not careful with interest rates and money supply we could see high inflation and high interest rates to go along with it    the odds of rates being any lower in 5 years time is probably pretty low   the odds of it being higher depends on who 's crystal ball you look at   i think most people would say that rates are likely to increase and the disagreement is over just how much and how soon   if you are forced to refinance in 5 years time and the rates are higher will you be able to make the payments or will you potentially be forced out of the house perhaps into something much smaller   what happens if the rates at that time are 9 and even an arm is only 6 could you make the payments or would you be forced to sell    potentially you could end up paying out more in interest than if you had just gotten a simple fixed loan myself i 'd not take the risk   for much of the last 40 years people would have sold off their children or body parts to get rates like we have today on a standard fixed loan   i 'd go for a standard fixed loan between 15 and 30 years duration   if you want to pay extra principle to get it paid off earlier in order to feel more secure or just get out from under the debt then do so personally i would n't bother not at today 's rates

yes they are and you 've experienced why generally speaking stocks that pay dividends will be better investments than stocks that do n't   here 's why 1 they 're actually making money they can balance sheets and news releases but cash is cash it tells no lies they ca n't fake it    2 there 's less good they can do with that money than they say when a business you own is making money they can do two things with it reinvest it into the company or hand it over to you all companies must reinvest to some degree but only a few companies worth owning can find profitable ways of reinvesting all of it having to hand you the owner some of the earnings helps keep that money from leaking away on such necessities like corporate jets expensive printer paper or ill conceived corporate buyouts       3 it helps you not freak out markets go up and markets go down if you own a good company that 's giving you a nice check every three months it 's a lot easier to not panic sell in a downturn after all they 're handing you a nice check every three months and checks are cash and cash tells no lies you know they 're still a good company and you can ride it out     4 it helps others not freak out see 3 that applies to everyone that in turn means market downturns weigh less heavily on companies paying solid dividends than on those that do not   5 it gives you some of the reward of investing in good companies without having to sell those companies if you 've got a piece of a good solid profitable growing company why on earth would you want to sell it   but you 'd like to see some rewards from making that wise investment would n't you      6 dividends can grow solid growing companies produce more and more earnings which means they can hand you more and more cash via the dividend which means that if say they reliably raise dividends that measly 3 dividend turns into a 6 dividend seven years later on your initial investment at year 14 it 's 12 year 21 24 see where this is going companies like that do exist google dividend   7 dividends make growth less important if you owned a company that paid you a 10 dividend every year but never grew an inch would you care how about 5 and it grows only slowly   you invest in companies not dividends you invest in companies to make money dividends are a useful tool when you invest to gauge company value to smooth your ride and to give you some of the profit of the business you own they are however only part of the total return from investing as you found out

anything can be insured for the right price this product is offered for devices at higher risk which would be logical purpose of owner needing coverage for a specific length of time typically this would be a type of adverse selection but targets customers that typically would not require insurance on their device but as you said they may be traveling and putting their devices at added risk like all insurance companies their loss ratio losses premiums will depend on the law of large numbers and spread of risk as we know the majority of the time trips are taken electronics make it back home safely like many tech companies their advantage over conventional insurers is likely low overhead costs being on a mobile platform they likely have a fraction of the claims handling cost of a conventional insurer payments are likely automated by linking bank accounts so there is little transaction cost burden on this company in short their operation is likely highly automated with few staff and low expenses allowing them to take on a higher loss ratio than conventional insurers and still leave room for profit without having ever used this service i can tell you they likely price in anticipated fraud the same way walmart prices in inventory loss into their prices i personally would share your concern that it 'd be difficult to combat fraud on such a platform especially with no claims whom are typically the first line of defense again i answer this never having used their service but i work as an analyst at a large insurer and these would be my assumptions based on what i know of

gt so i asked this question in /r and got some interesting answers mostly about how banks exist to make money out of nowhere and to fool people what do y all have to say   that is n't what they said nobody mentioned fooling people from what i can see from a cursory glance and if they did they 're being facetious   also they did n't mean make money from thin air in the sense of it being a magical trick they make money from a sort of market inefficiency they broker between people who want to invest money and those who want to borrow it   the top two answers are about right a bank borrows money from investors who deposit money in checking and savings accounts and lends it to borrowers in the form of loans or mortgages the difference between the interest rates is their profit   you deposit $ 1000 with me at 2 for 20 years i give you $ at the end of that term where did i get the extra five hundred books well i lent it out in mortgages over the same terms at 6 and received $ over the same period of time your $ 1000 made you $ and made me $ which i keep for the purposes of providing you with atms dealing with bad debts and staffing the place simple eh   of course they also provide other services in addition to this and the way in which they do it is regulated but that 's all a bank is at its core   a central bank is slightly different they issue money i.e. print it and supply it at a headline interest rate to the commercial banks and of course banks borrow amongst themselves but then we get ourselves down the rabbit hole of grown up economics and libor and the like there are whole textbooks used to explain exactly how that mechanism works and what 's going on there   but if you want to get rich find a way to start a bank seriously doing it to the old school way is seriously profitable if you can be trusted

for various reasons real estate prices exhibit far more memory than stock prices   the primary reason for this is that real estate is much less liquid   transaction costs for stock trading are on the order of 10 basis points 0.1 whereas a real estate transaction will typically have total costs including title lawyers brokers engineers etc of around 5 of the amount of the transaction   a stock transaction can be executed in milliseconds whereas real estate transactions typically take months   thus today 's behavior is a much better indicator of future price behavior for real estate than for stocks

first keep about six months expenses in immediately available form savings account or similar second determine how long you expect to hold on to the rest of it   what 's your timeframe for buying a house or starting a family   this determines what you should do with the rest of it if you 're buying a house next year then a cd certificate of deposit is a reasonable option low ish interest but something probably roughly inflation level and quite safe and you can plan things so it 's available when you need it for the down payment if you 've got 3 5 years before you want to touch this money then invest it in something reasonably safe   you can find reasonable funds that have a fairly low risk profile usually a combination of stock and bonds with a few percent higher rate of return on average   still could lose money but wo n't be all that risky if you 've got over five years then you should probably invest them in an etf that tracks a large market sector in the us i 'd suggest voo or similar vanguard 's s&p 500 fund i 'm sure australia has something similar which tracks the larger market   risky but over 5 + years unlikely to lose money and will likely have a better rate of return than anything else 6 or higher is reasonable to expect   five years is long enough that it 's vanishingly unlikely to lose money over the time period and fairly likely to make a good return accept the higher risk here for the greater return and do n't cringe when the market falls as it will go up again   then when you get close to your target date start pulling money out of it and into cds or safer investments during up periods

first off with startups forget that you know about common structures of debt and equity just try to think of this money as a generic investment that meets the investors risk and return objectives   startups are unique in that they are high risk but generally have almost no assets or security for an investor investors generically want two things 1 return and 2 limited risk    without speculating too much consider that the investor might be viewing the return component as the 30 equity and the 8 dividend and he views the risk management component as the additional 30 equity until repaid   a different way of looking at this might be that the investor would require an equity stake greater than 30 with greater than a 8 dividend if he did not get the initial investment back in return for the reduced stake   in other words this structure is debt and equity because that is what the investor can demand   maybe you can get around this by offering a higher equity stake or offering something else although this structure is common because it aligns interests of the investor and the startup

remember that balance transfers are rarely fee free as you state there is a fee associated with the balance transfer if your 0 rate is for 18 months and the fee is 3 you are really paying 2 per year on the amount you transferred the advantage is that you can redirect the debt you transferred is interest free and you can attack other debt with high interest on it this can save you in interest fees and allow you to direct more of your money towards debt the disadvantage is that your 0 interest will expire and become a much higher interest rate unless you pay off the transfer before the expiration you will have to pay off the debt at the higher interest how you decide to attack your debt reduction may need to factor in how long you expect to have debt and what other debt you have often times though the savings in interest is less important than simplifying the number of debt accounts you have the inspiration you receive from reducing your debt accounts is much more powerful you realize reducing debt accounts allows you to actually see an end in sight and provides the recurring positive feedback that you are making progressing this is why the advice to pay off your lowest balance credit cards first

since you are considering dumping your savings into your student loans when they are equal you should go ahead and do it now   you will immediately reap the benefit of paying less interest per month   also your minimum monthly payments will decrease so if you had unexpected expenses pop up you could shrink your payments for a limited time   if you do n't have emergency expenses more of your regular monthly payment will go toward the principle of your loan and pay it off faster make a goal to get your savings back up as soon as you can after your loans are paid off   in the mean time see what other things you can cut back on like eating less expensive food or switching to a less expensive phone plan   if you have stuff you do n't need anymore try selling it on or ebay   or just focus on doing more at work so you can get a raise   these things are not necessary but it 's a good feeling to be able to shave another month or two off paying a debt

the thing to recall here is that auto pay is a convenience not a guarantee auto pay withdrawals notices that a bill is due all of these are niceties that the lender uses to try to make sure you consistently pay your bill on time as all businesses enjoy steady cash flows now what all of these quality of life features do n't do is mitigate your responsibility as outlined when you first took out the loan to pay it back in a timely manner and according to the terms and conditions of the loan if your original contract for the loan states you shall make a payment of $ each calendar month then you are required to make that payment one way or another if auto pay fails you are still obligated to monitor that and correct the payment to ensure you meet your contractual obligation it 's less than pleasant that they did n't notify you but you were already aware you had an obligation to pay back the loan and knew what the terms of the loan were any forgiveness of interest or penalties for late fees is entirely up to the csr and the company 's internal policies not the law

i doubt you 're going to find anywhere that will give you free outgoing wires unless you 're depositing a huge amount of money like $ 500 k or more an alternative would be to find a bank that offers everything else you want and use for very low cost online wires i 've used them in the past and can recommend their services most banks wo n't charge for incoming wires i have accounts at e*trade bank that do n't charge any fees and i can do everything online you might want to check them out e*trade also offers global trading accounts which allow you to have accounts denominated in a few foreign currencies eur jpy gbp cad and hkd i think i do n't think there is a fee for moving money between the different currencies if your goal is simply to diversify your money into different currencies you could deposit money there instead of wiring it to other banks

i agree with joetaxpayer 's answer   the question you should be asking is not how do i spend more but how do i become happier   from what you say it may be that you could increase your happiness simply by cutting back on these aggressive attempts to save a few bucks here and there at the same time if you do this on some level your personality is probably not the type that would allow to simply forget it   i think many frugal people are somewhat as you describe they do n't like wasting money   in such cases often what matters is not so much the actual saving money as the feeling of saving money   therefore i 'd suggest that you take a look at which of the money losing activities you mention are really worth it the easiest ones to drop would be things like the home improvement project which even you acknowledge does not save you money   if you like saving money give yourself a pat on the back when you hire the contractor   if you want run the numbers so you can prove to yourself how much money you are saving by not doing the work for some of the other things it may be that spending time to save a small amount can an everyday experience and make it more interesting   for instance comparing products to save a few bucks is not necessarily bad unless you actually do n't like doing it   if spending a few hours comparing two toaster on amazon or whatever makes you feel good go for it it 's no worse than spending a few hours watching tv   by acknowledging that you get something out of it the feeling of getting a bargain and that you can feel better about and also potentially get it out of your system so that you wo n't feel the need to do it for every little thing   we all have our little pet and it 's possible to acknowledge that they 're irrational while still accepting them as part of your personality and finding a way to satisfy them in a controlled manner that does n't stress you out too much

it would be the sales revenue less everything else when he says reinvest that is to say they keep all of the post tax earnings and place it in retained earnings this means that it is still the companies money to invest and use to fulfill their goals if they did n't have any worthy investing opportunities they could issue dividends so say your cost of capital is 15 and the best investment you can make will earn you 12 that 's a loss of value so the company acting in the investors best interests will give those funds back so that the investors can allocate that money to more efficient areas dividends are one mechanism a company has to control their rate of growth

the first loan looks like it did not have its interest subsidized while you were in school so interest was accruing you did n't have to start making payments on it yet with the $ 73 payment you made the bank is allocating the funds in a pre determined split that is in their best interest not yours while you do need to pay them down and eventually off at the current rate it will take months with no more interest accruing to do so most likely with interest continuing to accrue you 're looking more in the neighborhood of 17 years rather than 14 these are back of the envelope numbers the payoff balance listed is the current principle plus interest that will accrue before the next processing date so it is usually a little higher than the actual balance because the interest is accruing daily albeit in very small percentages of the loan 's percentage

to address the issue in the title of your question many expenses strike at what for all practical purposes are random intervals roof starts leaking car needs repair etc do n't have a fixed cost every month medical expenses can certainly be more extreme than many other expenses but their nature is the same and so the way to budget for them is the same you figure out what your average expenses are over a long period of time then you start putting away a little more than this amount every month keep putting away until you have a reserve larger than any expense you are likely to get hit with all at once   i have no idea what your particular expenses are so let me use myself for an example my medical bills last year were unusually large about $ 6,000 i have lousy insurance and a couple of chronic conditions so my bills are usually maybe $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 per year so i plan on about $ 150 per month for medical bills most insurance policies have an out of pocket maximum this should be the most you 'd ever have to lay out in a year mine is $ 13,000 i told   you my insurance sucks so i have an account that i have now built up to $ 13,000 worst case i wipe out that account in any case if my bills are that large the doctors or hospital will normally agree to a payment plan i still owe a few hundred on my bills from last year and the hospital is letting me pay it off at $ 120 per month your question brings up a lot of issues about difficulties of working with insurance and the u.s. medical system in general i 'm not sure if your intent was to get advice on the rest of it all simple not pleasant but simple answer if you 're insurance is provided by your employer you 're pretty much stuck with the policy that the employer negotiates i do n't know how much you 're contributing to premiums usually the company pays the bulk of it you could investigate getting a policy on your own but odds are that any policy you could get for what you 're contributing now would be way worse than what you can get through the company you could always investigate but i doubt you 'll do better you can talk to hr if it 's a big company they may have some muscle with the insurance company and could help you out failing that it becomes a political question of how the laws affecting medical care and insurance in the u.s. are set up and while i have many ideas for how it could be improved sadly i 'm not in a position to do much about it and i doubt you are either unless you have the resources to run for president

what if everyone decided to sell all the shares at a given moment let 's say when the stock is trading at $ 40 it would fall to the lowest bid price which could be $ 0.01 if someone had that bid in place here is an example which i happened to find online   notice there are orders to buy at half the market price and lower probably all the way down to pennies   if there were enough selling activity to fill all of those bids you see then the market price would be the lowest bid on the screen   alternatively the bid orders could be pulled cancelled which would also let the price free fall to the lowest bid even if there were few actual sellers bid stuffing is what hft high frequency trading algorithms sometimes do which some say caused the flash crash of may 2010   the computers stuff bids into the order book making it look like there is demand in order to trigger a market reaction then they pull the bids to make the market fall   this sort of thing happens all the time and nanex documents it quote stuffing defined i remember the day of the flash crash very well   i found this video on youtube of cnbc at that time   watch from the min mark on the video as jim talks about pg easily not being worth the price of the market at that time   he said who cares its not a real price $ bid for 50,000 shares if i were at my hedge fund   you can value a stock how you want but its only actually worth what someone will give you for it more examples petroleum which as we noted in today 's eod post lost $ 45 billion in market cap in 45 milliseconds a collapse rate of $ 1 billion per millisecond flash crashing from $ 90 all the way to an allegedly illegal stub quote of $ 0.01 how 10,000 contracts crashed the market a visual of last night 's e mini flash crash symantec flash crash destroys over $ 1.5 billion in less than a second this sort of thing happens so often i do n't pay much attention anymore

americans are snapping like crazy and not only americans i know a lot of people from out of country are snapping as well similarly to your australian friend the market is crazy hot i 'm not familiar with cleveland but i am familiar with phoenix the prices are up at least 20 30 from what they were a couple of years ago and the trend is not changing however these are not something everyone can buy it is very hard to get these properties financed i found it impossible as mentioned i bought in phoenix that means you have to pay cash not everyone has tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash available for a real estate investment for many americans 30 60 k needed to buy a property in these markets is an amount they can not afford to invest even if they have it at hand also keep in mind that investing in rental property requires being able to support it pay taxes and expenses even if it is not rented pay to property managers utility bills gardeners and plumbers insurance and property taxes all these can amount to quite a lot so its not just the initial investment many times advertised rents are not the actual rents paid if he indeed has it rented at $ 900 then its good but if he was told hey buy it and you 'll be able to rent it out at $ 900 would n't count on that i know many foreigners who fell in these traps do your market research and see what the costs are at these neighborhoods keep in mind that these are distressed neighborhoods with a lot of foreclosed houses and a lot of unemployment it is likely that there are houses empty as people are moving out being out of job it may be tough to find a renter and the renters you find may not be able to pay the rent but all that said yes those who can are snapping

i 'm impressed   she must have a substantial income to agree to a $ 500/month car payment   i imagine her income is about 20 k per month for that to make sense   what kind of work does she do   to answer your question typical lease do not work the way you describe   paying an extra $ 2000 will allow you to skip 4 payments provided the payments were exactly $ 500 any time in the future   it does not modify the terms of the lease which would include the payment amount   also one does not receive a fiance charge reduction benefit as with a loan   essentially you are providing a loan to the leasing company for free to be explicit you can not tell the mortgage company anything as she is applying for the loan not you   she can tell the mortgage company the new payment is $ 400 but she would be falsifying the application which is not advisable perhaps the mortgage company is doing her a favor   they are indicating her life is out of control financially   either she is attempting to purchase way to much home or her consumer debt is out of control   it could be a combination of both    my first paragraph was written to be tongue in check in order to demonstrate absurdity   without a substantial income and an substantial net worth a 500/month car payment is simply ridiculous   while it is someone average when you compare it to the average income year you understand why 78 of us households live paycheck to paycheck are broke and have no retirement savings for your and her sake please stop giving all your hard earned money to banks

in general you do not want to show a taxable gain on rental properties if you can avoid it   one of the more beneficial advantages of owning cash flowing rental properties is that the income is tax deferred because of the depreciation   i say deferred because depreciation affects the cost basis of your property    also since you are considering financing it sounds like you do n't need the cash flow currently   you usually can get better returns by financing and buying more rental properties especially with investment mortgages at historical lows win via inflation over time

most of the recommendations are just total market allocations   within domestic stocks the performance sometimes large cap outperform sometimes small cap outperform you can see the chart here examine year by year   conventional wisdom is to buy the entire market if large cap currently make up 80 of the market you would allocate 80 of domestic stocks to large cap   same case with international stocks developed if japan and uk make up the largest market internationally then so be it   similar case with domestic bonds it is usually total bond market allocation in the beginning   then there is the question of when you want to withdraw the money if you are withdrawing in a couple years you do not want to expose too much to currency risks thus you would allocate less to international markets if you are investing for retirement you will get the total world market   then there is the question of risk tolerance bonds are somewhat negatively correlated with stocks when stock dips by 5 in a month bonds might go up by 2 under normal circumstances they both go upward bond stock allocation ratio is by age i ’m sure you knew that already   then there is the case of modern portfolio theory there will be slight adjustments to the etf weights if it is found that adjusting them would give a smaller portfolio variance while sacrificing small gains you can try it yourself using excel solver   there is a strategy called sector rotation google it and you will find examples of the winners periodically it is difficult to time the rotation but healthcare has somehow consistently outperformed nonetheless those recommendations you mentioned are likely to be market allocations again   the robo advisors list out every asset allocation in detail to make you feel overwhelmed and resort to using their service in extreme cases they can even break down the holdings to digit standard industrial classification codes or break down the bond duration etc   some robo advisors would suggest you as many etf as possible to increase trade commissions if it is n’t commission free for example suggesting you to buy vb instead a vti

i look for buying a call option only at the money but first understand the background above let 's suppose x stock is being traded by $ 10.00 and it 's january the call option is being traded by $ 0.20 with strike $ for february i always look for 2 prize or more i buy 100 stocks by $ 10.00 each and sell the option earning $ 0.20 for each x stock i will have to deliver my stocks by $ strike value agreed no problem for me here i took the prize plus the gain of $ 1.00 continuing from item 3 i still can sell the option for the next month with strike equal or higher than that i bought for instance i can sell a call option of strike $ 10.00 and it might be worth to deliver stocks by $ 10.00 and take the prize continuing from item 3 probably it wo n't be possible to sell a call option with strike at the price that i paid for the stock but that 's not a problem at the end of the option life in february the strike was $ but the stock 's price is $ 8.00 i got the $ 0.20 as prize and my stocks are free for trade again i 'll sell the call option for march with strike $ 9.00 taking around 2 of prize well i do n't want to sell my stocks by $ 9.00 and make loss right but i 'm selling the call option anyway then i wait till the price of the stock gets near the strike value almost atm and i re buy the option sold example where c means month = march and sell again the call option with higher strike to april example where d means month = april ps at item 9 there should be no loss between the action of re buy and sell to roll out to the next month when re buying it with the stock 's price near the strike option value for march will be lower than when selling it to april this is n't any rule to be followed this is just a conservative i think they call it hedge way to handle options and stocks few free to make money according to your goals and your style the perfect rule is the one that meet your expectation do n't take the generalized rules too serious

from the way you frame the question it sounds like you more or less know the answer already yes you can make a non deductable contribution to a traditional ira and convert it to a roth ira here is wikipedia 's explanation regardless of income but subject to contribution limits contributions can be made to a traditional ira and then converted to a roth this allows for backdoor contributions where individuals are able to avoid the income limitations of the roth ira there is no limit to the frequency with which conversions can occur so this process can be repeated indefinitely one major caveat to the entire backdoor roth ira contribution process however is that it only works for people who do not have any pre tax contributed money in ira accounts at the time of the backdoor conversion to roth conversions made when other ira money exists are subject to pro rata calculations and may lead to tax liabilities on the part of the converter 9 do note the caveat in the second paragraph this article explains it more thoroughly the irs does not allow to specify which dollars are being converted as they can with shares of stock being sold for the purposes of determining taxes on conversions the irs considers a person ’s non roth ira money to be a single co sum hence if a person has any funds in any non roth ira accounts it is impossible to contribute to a traditional ira and then convert that account to a roth ira as suggested by various pundits and the wikipedia piece referenced above conversions must be performed on a pro rata basis of all ira money not on specific dollars or accounts say you have $ 20k of pre tax assets in a traditional ira and make a non deductable contribution of $ 5k the account is now 80 pre tax assets and 20 post tax assets so if you move $ 5k into a roth ira $ 4k of it would be taxed in the conversion the traditional ira would be left with $ 16k of pre tax assets and $ 4k of post tax assets

thanks for the link to the financial consumer agency of canada it explained in clear terms that i can withdraw money from and transfer money to the line of credit any time i want the only monthly payment needed is the minimum payment and yes it may have a term after which all remaining principal + interest must be paid back in full similar to a credit card as you pay off your line of credit you can    draw on it again up to the limit you are allowed however a key    difference between a line of credit and a credit card is that with a    line of credit there is no interest free grace period you will have    to pay interest on the amount you borrow from the day you take the    money out you will receive a monthly statement that shows the amount that you    owe on your line of credit you must make at least a minimum payment    on that balance every month specific terms and conditions for lines of credit vary from institution to institution

in the netherlands its cheaper in some cases to have a mortgage then to own a house    example if you own a house you pay more taxes because you own something expensive you have to pay < owners tax so if you instead of owning the house   keep the mortgage low and only pay the mortgage interest the interest will be much lower then the tax you would have to pay the sweet spot for lowest interest and not having to pay the owners tax is different for any mortgage but by grandparents use this method and they pay a really small amount for a rather large house

you 're confusing between individual 401k they 're called and are intended for self employed and individual retirement account ira you ca n't open a without being self employed you can open an ira and roll over money from your old 401k to it you can not get a loan from ira you can ask the 401k plan manager to reissue the checks to the new trust should n't be a problem make sure the checks are issued to the trust not to you to avoid withholding and tax complications this is what is called a direct rollover you might be able to roll the money over to the 401k of your new employer it is not always allowed and you should check you can probably then take a loan from that 401k however it diminishes the value of your retirement savings and you should only do it if you have no other choice being evicted from your home your children are starving ca n't pay for your etc this kind of disasters otherwise i 'd suggest rolling over to ira investing in funds with significantly lower fees vanguard target retirements funds for example or index funds etf 's and your spending and budgeting habits so that you wo n't need loans from your 401k re companies etrade is nice consider also scottrade tdameritrade vanguard fidelity sharebuilder and may be others these are all discount brokers with relatively low fees but each has its own set of no fee funds

you can perfectly well manage their wealth without transferring their money into your account first just make them open their own account on their name then ask them for credentials and then manage their money from within their own account that way everyone will be taxed according to their wealth which is probably advantageous but you probably have to help them with the paperwork and it is clear at every time what belongs to whom and your relatives can at every time access their wealth these are big advantages for them this keeps you at the role of an adviser a very active one though which should have almost zero legal ramifications for you unless you try to deceive your relatives you may want to shift wealth between accounts to minimize tax burdens but that comes at the risk that should the family relations get worse this might result in anger you could open up a registered society all members getting shares and voting rights making you the ceo but that should be a lot of paperwork and maybe only a good idea for large amounts of money if you decide to transfer money between accounts of different persons this is like a gift it might invoke a gift tax in your area all in all i strongly advise you to make them all open up their own accounts and then just operate the accounts and manage their wealth in their name sell it to them as the solution that retains them maximum ownership

it is unlikely that the plan is worth doing given the numbers you have used however your thinking is correct that given enough of a rate differential it could be worth doing consider that for each $ 100k of your mortgage and i assume your limit for an unsecured personal loan is likely far less than 100k you would save only $ by taking out a personal unsecured loan of 3 and paying off your mortgage instead such low unsecured rates may be a signal that it would be worthwhile for you to renegotiate your mortgage you will likely need to pay a fee but the savings could be significant   for each $ 100k of mortgage a 1 rate change from your current rate saves you 1k per year so if you can get a mortgage rate of 2 which may be possible if an unsecured loan costs you 3 compare the initial administrative fee against those savings over the course of the term of the ie $ 300k saves you 9k over 3 years so would be well worth even an initial $ 3k admin fee

your question is based on a false premise   there is no standard for raises   some jobs in some years see huge raises other years those same jobs may see average pay rates drop if you want a benchmark you would be better off looking at typical pay rates for people in your job in your city with your experience sites like glassdoor can provide that type of information if you are at the low end of that range you can probably push for a raise if you are at the high end you may find it more difficult typically your employer will pay you just enough to keep you from leaving so they will offer you as little as they think you will accept   you can either accept it or find another job that pays more if you work in software then you can probably make more by switching jobs if you work in food service you might have more trouble finding higher pay elsewhere if you do find another employer you might be able to a counter offer from your current employer in fact even suggesting that you will look for another employer may prompt your current employer to be more generous   that said if your employer thinks you are on your way out they might cut your bonus or lay you off

etfs are legally required to publicly disclose their positions at every point in time the reason for this is that for an etf to issue shares of etf they do not take cash in exchange but underlying securities this is called a creation unit so people need to know which shares to deliver to the fund to get a share of etf in exchange this is never done by retail clients however but by nominated market makers retail persons will normally trade shares only in the secondary market ie on a stock exchange which does not require new shares of the etf to be issued however they do not normally make it easy to find this information in a digestible way and each etf does it their own way so typically services that offer this information are payable as somebody has to scrape the information from a variety of sources or etf providers to send it to them if you have access to a bloomberg terminal this information is available from there otherwise there are paid for services that offer it searching on google for etf constituent data i found two companies that offer it see if you can find what you need there good luck even has a stock exposure tool freely available that allows you to see which etfs have large exposure to a stock of your choosing see here since this data is in a table format you could easily download it automatically using table parsing tools for your chosen programming language ps do n't bother with underlying index constituents they are not required to be made public and index providers will normally charge handsomely for this so normally only institutional investors will have this information

the problem above is actually a pretty good list of the concerns around life insurance   while there is no correct answer to the question as posed this will vary among different there is a simpler way to think about insurance in general that may make finding what is right answer for you easier buying life insurance like almost all insurance is on average a money losing purchase   this is simply because the companies selling would n't offer it if they could n't expect to make money on it   think about buying insurance a warranty on a new cell phone maybe if you are particularly prone to damaging cell phones it can be in your favor but for most of the people that buy it will lose money on average people of course still buy insurance anyway to protect themselves from unlikely but very bad consequences   the big reason to make this trade off is if the loss will have big lasting consequences   to stay with our cell phone example having to replace a cell phone at least for me would be annoying but not a catastrophic event   for myself the protection is not worth the warranty cost but that is not true for everyone life insurance is a pretty extreme case of this but i find the best question to ask is if you you and your spouse were to die will your dependents lives become so much worse that you really dislike the idea of not being insured for some working seniors they already have enough saved to bridge their kids spouse to adulthood old age that insurance makes no sense   for some their children husband wife would be destitute and insurance is an obvious choice and an easy price to pay even if it is very high   the example you suggest seems on the border and good questions to ask are thinking about those questions may help you understand if the protection offers is worth the cost

a derivative is a financial instrument of a special kind the kind whose price depends on or is derived from another asset   this definition is from john hull options futures and other derivatives a book definitely worth to own if you are curious about this you can easily find old copies for a few dollars the first point is that a derivative is a financial instrument like credits or insurances the second point is that its price depends closely from the price of something else the mentioned asset in most cases derivatives can be understood as financial insurances against some risk bound to the asset in the i give a small list of derivatives and highlight the assets and the risk they can be bound to   and first let me point out that the definition is marginally wrong because some derivatives depend on things which are not assets nor do they have a price like temperature sunlight or even your own life in the case of mortgages   but before going in this list let me go through the remaining points of your question what is the basic idea and concept behind a derivative as already noted in most cases a derivative can be understood as a financial insurance compensating from a risk of some sort   in a classical insurance contract one party of the contract is an insurance company but in the broader case of a derivative that counterparty can be pretty anything an insurance a bank a government a large company and most probably market makers how is it really used and how does this deviate from the first point briefly how does is it affecting people and how is it causing problems an important point with derivatives is that it can be arbitrarily complicated to compute their prices   actually what is hidden in the attempt of giving a definition for derivatives is that they are products whose price y is a measurable function of one or several random variables on which we can use the theory of arbitrage pricing to get hints on the actual price y of the asset this is what the depends on means in technical terms   in the most favorable case we obtain an easy formula linking y to the which tells us what is the price of our financial instrument but in practice it can be very difficult if at all possible to determine a price for derivatives this has two implications persons possessing sophisticated techniques to compute the price of derivatives have a strategic advantage on derivatives market in comparison to less advanced actors on the market organisation owning assets they can not price can not compute their anymore so that they can not know for sure their financial situation they are somehow playing roulette but wait if derivatives are insurances they should help to mitigate some financial risk which precisely means that they should help their owners to more accurately see their financial situation how is this not a contradiction some persons with sophisticated techniques to compute the price of derivatives are actually selling complicated derivatives to less knowledgeable persons   for instance many in france and germany have contracted credits whose reimbursements have a fixed interest part like in a classical credit and a variable interest part whose rate is computed against a complicated formula involving the value of the swiss frank at each quarter starting from the inception of the credit   so for a 25 years running credit of type the price y of the credit at its inception depends on 100 which are the uncertain prices for the swiss frank each quarter of the 25 next years   some of these can be quite small with inhabitants and needless to say do not have the required expertise to analyse the risks bound to such instruments which in that special case led the court call the credit a and to cancel the credit   but what chain of events leads a inhabitants city in france to own a credit whose reimbursements depends on the swiss frank   after the credit crunch in 2007 and the fall of lehman brothers in 2008 it has begun to be very hard to organise funding which basically means to conclude credits running long in time on large amounts of money   so the municipality needs a 25 years credit of euros and goes to its communal bank   the communal bank has hundreds or thousands of municipalities looking for credits and needs itself a financing   so the communal bank goes to one of the five largest financial institutions in the world which insists on selling a huge credit whose reimbursements have a variable part depending on hundred of values the swiss frank will have in the 25 next years since the the big bank has better computation techniques than the small bank it makes a big profit   since the small bank has no idea how to compute the correct price of the credit it bought it cuts this in pieces and sell it in the same form to the various it works with   if we were to attribute this kind of intentions to the largest five banks we could ask about the possibility that they designed the credit to take advantage of the primitive evaluation methods of the small bank we could also ask if they organised a cartel to force communal banks to buy their and we could also ask if they are so that they eventually can manipulate the swiss frank to secure an even higher profit   but i will not go into this   to the best of my understanding the subprime crisis is a play along the same plot with different actors but i know this latter subject only by what i could read in french newspapers so much for the how is it causing problems part what is some of the terminology in relation to derivatives and    there meanings of course answering this question is basically the purpose of the 7 first chapters of the book by hull along with deriving some important mathematical principles   and i will not copy these seven chapters here how would someone get started dealing in derivatives i 'm playing a      realistic stock market simulation so it does n't matter if your      answer to this costs me money if you ask the question i understand that you are not a professional so that your are actually trying to become the one that has money and zero knowledge in the play i outlined above i would not doing this   that said if you have a good mathematical background and can program well once you are with the books of hull and you can have fun implementing various market models and implementing trading strategies once you are confident with this you can also read the articles on quantitative finance on and once you are done with this you can decide for yourself if you want to play the same market as the guys writing these articles and yes even for the simplest options they have better models than you have and will systematically outperform you in the long run even if some random successes will give you the feeling that you do well and could do better indeed i 've made it a personal goal to somehow lose every last cent of my money you know your weapons two parties agree today on a price for one to deliver a commodity to the other at some future instant   this is a classical future contract it can be modified in every imaginable way usually by options   for instance one party could have the option to choose between different delivery points or delivery days two parties write today a contract allowing the one party to buy at some future time a commodity to the the second party   the price is written today as part of the contract   there is the corresponding option entitling the owner to sell something   unlike the future contract only one party can be obliged to do something the other a right but no obligation if you buy and option your are buying some sort of insurance against a change of price on some asset this is the most familiar to anybody   credits can come in many different especially the formula to compute interests or also embed options   common options are early settlement options or options while this is not completely the credit works like an insurance   this is most easily understood from the side of the organisation lending the money that speculates that the ratio of going bankrupt will be low enough for her to make profit just like a fire insurance company speculates that the ratio of fire accidents will be low enough for her to make a profit this is like a mortgage on a financial institution   two parties agree that one will an upfront today and give a compensation to the second one if some third party defaults here this is an explicit insurance against the event where a goes bankrupt one finds here more or less standard options on electricity but electricity have delicious as it can practically not be stored and fallout is also usually avoided as for classical options these are insurances against price moves a swap is like two complementary credits on the same amount of money so that it ends up in the two parties not actually exchanging the credit nominal and only paying interest one to the other which makes only sense if these interests are computed with different formulas typical example are fixed rate vs. on some given maturity which we interpret as an insurance against fluctuations of the or a fixed rate vs. the exchange ratio between two currencies which we interpret as an insurance against the two currencies swaps are the richest and the most generic category of financial derivatives   the off the counter market features very very insurance products the most basic form is the insurance against drought but you can image different dangers and once you have it you can put it in options in a swap etc   for instance a restaurant with a could enter in a weather insurance paying each year a fixed amount of money and becoming in return an amount of money based on the amount of rainy day in a year actually this list is virtually without limits

two typical responses to articles surveys making such claims   1 people use other forms of asset for emergency savings because interest rates are low clearly false   2 people use other forms of saving than a saving account therefore such surveys as the x% ca n't handle a $ 500 emergency are wrong on their face this is false the vast majority use a savings account   i 've chosen a topic that absolutely annoys the shit out of me every time it comes up how people save their money every time this topic comes up about x% of americans ca n't come up with $ y dollars in an emergency or have less than $ z in savings someone inevitably in with the linked response i have never seen anyone attempt to source their hand waving response beyond their own anecdote which is usually a thinly veiled brag about how financially savvy they are with their wealth perhaps people who have no assets or crippling debt do n't go out of their way to brag about it   i could link multiple reddit posts making a similar response which i address with my own stock response about once every 1 2 months instead i 've decided to expand with data from several other sources this is the good bad research problem if you 're asserting something but qualify your statement with sure we 'd find if we looked into then you 're doing it wrong a good researcher or journalist does n't put bullshit like that in their work because it 's their job to actually look for sources of data data which should exist with multiple government and independent groups so let 's get started all data as recent as i could find oldest source is for 2010   most americans do n't invest in the stock pubs   about of americans owned publicly traded stock directly or indirectly with a much smaller percent owning stock directly   pages 18 and 16 respectively it 's important to note the of indirect ownership which suggests this is mostly retirement accounts it 's entirely possible people are irresponsible with their emergency savings but i think it safe to say we should not expect people to dip into their retirement accounts for relatively minor emergency expenses the reason is obvious even if it covers the expense they now have

percent of households saved for unexpected   expenses or emergencies in the past 12 months page 37 pdf page 43 of 88   furthermore   7.2 shows that among all households that saved for   unexpected

10.5 percent   households that saved maintained savings in the home or   with family or friends    emphasis added   why do n't people have wealth in different asset classes well they do n't save wp

in general taking money out of a 401k to repay a loan is a bad idea for a number of reasons   taxes and penalties if you are under 59 and 1/2 you will pay a 10 penalty on withdrawals from a traditional 401k plan then you are going add the amount you withdraw to your income in determining your current tax bill if you make a large withdrawal you will likely push yourself into a higher tax bracket and will end up paying additional taxes than if you made several smaller withdrawals or waited until retirement when your income would presumably be lower taxes and penalties will mean you will need to withdraw in order to pay taxes and penalties while still having 150k to pay toward the mortgage this assumes you are single and have no other income you miss out on the growth your 401k could have had   lack of diversification the average person has the majority of their net worth tied up in their home and by paying off your mortgage you are putting even more of your money into residential real estate by moving money from a 401k to your personal residence you could also lose some protection from creditors and lawsuits retirement accounts are generally off limits to creditors where as your house is limited by the homestead exemption varies greatly from state to state there are a few times when it might makes sense to use 401k money to pay off a mortgage if you are older than 59.5 and have little tolerance for risk it might make sense to take the amount of money between your current income and the next higher tax bracket and invest the money in your mortgage each year you would still want to avoid taking out a large chunk at one time though to avoid pushing yourself into a much higher tax bracket

the answer from littleadv perfectly explains that the mere exchange ratio does n't say anything still it might be worth adding why some currencies are weak and some strong here 's the reason to buy goods of a certain country you have to exchange your money for currency of that country especially when you want to buy treasuries of stocks from that country so if you feel that for example japanese stocks are going to pick up soon you will exchange dollars for yen so you can buy japanese stocks by the laws of supply and demand this drives up the price in contrast if investors lose faith in a country and withdraw their funds they will seek their luck elsewhere and thus they increase the supply of that currency this happened most dramatically in recent time with the icelandic

the technical term of a recession is 2 successive quarters of negative gdp growth as is the natural cycle the curve will at some point in the future maybe it 's tomorrow or 5 years from now but nobody knows for certain one also should n't take any single indicator as the end all be all of indicators for example there are other spreads that indicate the health of credit in the global economy such as the ted spread and the libor spread if you take a peek at the ted spread it tells a much different story the ted spread measures the health of the global banking system by tracking the rate at which banks lend to each other a lower ted rate equals more trust and perceived creditworthiness of the borrower which would be another bank   lastly you really ca n't rely on a single article or single indicator to come to the conclusion that the sky is falling even if we are on the of a recession here in the us nobody can tell the impact and depth of the recession in my opinion we are nearing the top of the credit cycle and should be expecting a bit of a cooling off in the near term 1 3 years outside of that your guess is as good as mine

probably the most important thing in evaluating a dividend yield is to compare it to itself in the past if the dividend yield is higher than it has been in the past the stock may be cheap if it is lower the stock may be expensive just about every stock has a normal yield for itself it 's zero for non dividend paying stocks this is based on the stock 's perceived quality growth potential and other factors so a utility that normally yields 5 and is now paying 3 is probably expensive the price in the denominator is too high while a growth stock that normally yields 2 and is now yielding 3 e.g. intel or may be cheap

the answer depends on the specific instrument to which you are referring it is possible to make straight bets that are cash settled and in which the underlying commodity or instrument will never be bought or sold   it is also possible to have such a contract be settled in the underlying if the cash value is appropriate then the cash settlement can be used to purchase the underlying directly if necessary   physical delivery was predominant until the last few decades   most traders as opposed to or are going to prefer cash settled contracts as opposed to physical delivery it is possible to make trades with a brokerage firm such that the firm pays if the trader wins the bet   the firm will typically find parties on the other side to even out this bet and leave itself neutral as to the outcome plus a small premium it charges each side for the cost of making the market   the cost charged to one contracting party should be set by the dealer in relation to prices being charged to parties making the opposite matching bet in this way brokers are following market price while traders are setting it financially options and contracts can be settled for cash or for the underlying and they can be made directly with the opposite or with a neutral dealer

the process of borrowing shares and selling them is called shorting a stock or going short   when you use money to buy shares it is called going long in general your strategy of going long and short in the same stock in the same amounts does not gain you anything   let 's look at your two scenarios to see why when you start loot is trading at $ 20 per share   you purchased 100 shares for $ 2000 and you borrowed and sold 100 shares for $ 2000   you are both long and short in the stock for $ 2000   at this point you have invested $ 2000 and you got your $ 2000 back from the short proceeds   you own and owe 100 shares under scenario a the price goes up to $ 30 per share   your long shares have gone up in value by $ 1000   however you have lost $ 1000 on your short shares   your short is called and you return your 100 shares and have to pay interest   under this scenario after it is all done you have lost whatever the interest charges are under scenario b the prices goes down to $ 10 per share   your long shares have lost $ 1000 in value   however your short has gained $ 1000 in value because you can buy the 100 shares for only $ 1000 and return them and you are left with the $ 1000 out of the $ 2000 you got when you first sold the shorted shares   however because your long shares have lost $ 1000 you still have n't gained anything   here again you have lost whatever the interest charges are as explained in the traders exclusive article that posted in the comments there are investors that go long and short on the same stock at the same time   however this might be done if the investor believes that the stock will go down in a short term time frame but up in the long term time frame   the investor might buy and hold for the long term but go short for a brief time while holding the long position however that is not what you are suggesting   your proposal makes no prediction on what the stock might do in different periods of time   you are only attempting to hedge your bets   and it does n't work   a long position and a short position are opposites to each other and no matter which way the stock moves you 'll lose the same amount with one position that you have gained in the other position   and you 'll be out the interest charges from the borrowed shares every time with your comment you have stated that your scenario is that you believe that the stock will go up long term but you also believe that the stock is at a short term peak and will drop in the near future   this however does n't really change things much   let 's look again at your possible scenarios you believe that the stock is a long term buy but for some reason you are guessing that the stock will drop in the short term   under scenario a you were incorrect about your short term guess   and although you might have been correct about the long term prospects you have missed this gain   you are out the interest charges and if you still think the stock is headed up over the long term you 'll need to buy back in at a higher price under scenario b it turns out that you were correct about the short term drop   you pocket some cash but there is no guarantee that the stock will rise anytime soon   your investment has lost value and the gain that you made with your short is still tied up in stocks that are currently down your strategy does prevent the possibility of the unlimited loss inherent in the short   however it also prevents the possibility of the unlimited gain inherent in the long position     and this is a shame since you fundamentally believe that the stock is undervalued and is headed up   you are your long term gains for a chance at a small short term gain

would make sense that the higher liquidation cost and transaction costs are driving the share price down    higher and transaction means higher investors would require higher return driving down the share price the other possibilities i can think of off the top of my head based on looking at the firm for five minutes   1 in transaction costs did you include tax disclaimer math below done on the back of the envelope in between meetings   so nav says they are at liquidating that entire portfolio means about 22 capital gains tax rate which means after tax value is about $ add in any fees you 'd incur from trying to sell this stuff and it 's not unreasonable to assume you 'll only get about $ 55 m once all is said and done which is pretty close to the actual market cap    if you have accounted for the above consider   2 bulk of their investments seem to be in private assets which implies that they have some discretion in how they mark the value of those investments and there is the chance that the market does n't have confidence in these guys what 's their performance been like in recent years especially with a private asset portfolio i 'd be weary    if i was to invest in them i 'd want a higher return for the opaque portfolio

the answer to the question can i exercise the option right away depends on the exercise style of the particular option contract you are talking about if it 's an american style exercise you can exercise at any moment until the expiration date if it 's an european style exercise you can only exercise at the expiration date according to the cme group website on the on gold futures it 's an american style exercise always make sure to double check this especially in the options on futures world there are quite a few that are european style so if you wanted to the answer is yes you can exercise those contracts before expiration but a very important question you should ask is should you option prices are composed of 2 parts intrinsic value and extrinsic value intrinsic value is defined as by how much the option is in the money that is for calls it 's how much the strike is below the current underlying price and for puts it 's how much the strike is above the current underlying price extrinsic value is whatever amount you have to add to the intrinsic value to get the actual price the option is trading at the market note that there 's no negative intrinsic value it 's either a positive number or 0 when the intrinsic value is 0 all the value of the option is extrinsic value the reason why options have extrinsic value is because they give the buyer a right and the seller an obligation ie the seller is assuming risk traders are only willing to assume obligations risks and give others a right if they get paid for that the amount they get paid for that is the extrinsic value in the scenario you described underlying price is call strike is whatever amount you have paid for that option is extrinsic value because the strike of the call is above the underlying price so intrinsic = 0 intrinsic + extrinsic = value of the option by definition now in your scenario gold prices went up to now your call option is in the money that is the strike of your call option is below the gold price that necessarily means that your call option has intrinsic value you can easily calculate how much it has exactly $ 5 intrinsic value price strike but that contract still has some risk associated to it for the seller so it necessarily still have some extrinsic value as well so the option that you bought for let 's say $ 2.30 could now be worth something like $ $ 5 + a hypothetical $ 1.90 in extrinsic value in your question you mentioned exercising the option and then making a profit there well if you do that you exercise your options get some gold futures immediately paying $ for them your strike and then you can sell them in the market for $ so you make $ 5 there multiplied by the contract multiplier but your profit is not $ 5 here 's why remember that you had to buy that option you paid some money for that in this hypothetical example you payed $ 2.30 to buy the option so you actually made only $ 5 $ 2.30 = $ profit on the other hand you could just have sold the option you 'd then make money by selling something that you bought for $ 2.30 that 's now worth $ this will give you a higher profit in this case if those numbers were real you 'd make $ $ 2.30 = $ profit more than $ profit here 's the interesting part did you notice exactly how much more profit you 'd have by selling the option back to the market instead of exercising it and selling the gold contracts exactly $ 1.90 do you remember this number that 's the extrinsic value and it 's not a coincidence by exercising an option you immediately give up all the extrinsic value it has you are going to convert all the extrinsic value into $ 0 so that 's why it 's not optimal to exercise the contract also many brokers usually charge you much more commissions and fees to exercise an option than to buy sell options so there 's that as well always remember when you exercise an option contract you immediately give up all the extrinsic value it has so it 's never optimal to do an early exercise of option contracts and individual retail investors institutional investors doing hft might be able to spot price discrepancies and make money doing arbitrage but retail investors do n't have the low commissions and the technology required to make money out of that might also be interesting to think about the other side of this have you noticed how in the example above the option started with $ 2.30 of extrinsic value and then it had less $ 1.90 only that 's really how options work as the market changes extrinsic value changes and as time goes by extrinsic value usually decreases other factors might increase it like more fear in the market usually bring the option prices up but the passage of time alone will decrease it so options that you buy will naturally decrease some value over time the closer you are to expiration the faster it 's going to lose value which kind of makes intuitive sense for instance compare an option with 90 days to expiration to another with 10 one day later the first option still has 89 almost the same as 90 but the other has 9 it relatively much closer to the expiration than the day before so it will decay faster option buyers can protect their investment from time decay by buying longer dated options which decay slower edit just thought about adding one final thought here probabilities the strategy that you describe in your question is basically going long an otm call this is an extremely bullish position with low probability of making money basically for you to make money you need two things you need to be right on direction and you need to be right on time in this example you need the underlying to go up by a considerable amount and you need this to happen quickly before the passage of time will remove too much of the extrinsic value of your call and obviously before the call expires benefit of the strategy is in the highly unlikely event of an extreme unanticipated move of the underlying to the upside you can make a lot of money so it 's a low probability limited risk unlimited profit extremely bullish strategy

i think the idea here is that because of the way mortgages are amortized you can drop additional principal payments in the early years of the mortgage and significantly lower the overall interest expense over the life of the loan a heloc accrues interest like a credit card so if you make a large principal payment using a heloc you will be able to retire those chunks of debt quicker than if you made normal mortgage payments i have n't worked out the numbers but i suspect that you could achieve similar results by simply paying ahead making even one extra payment per year will take 7 9 years off of a 30 year loan i think that the advantage of the heloc approach is that if you borrow enough you may be able to recalculate lower the payment of the mortgage

how is it possible for the average investor to underperform the market the average investor probably makes some bad decisions you also might need to take transaction costs into play including borrowing on margin so that there 's a natural erosion of returns across the market   meaning if transaction borrowing costs are 1 and the market return is 5 the average investor   alternatively if by average they mean the average of the population not weighted by amount it 's plausible that the mass of smaller investors perform slightly worse than the smaller number of large investors and have larger relative transaction costs thus having a lower average on a per capita basis does n't the fact that investors can consistently underperform the market by making poor decisions imply that an investor could consistently outperform the market by making the opposite decisions no   if my investment decisions cause me to earn only a 10 return compared to the average 12 return then making the opposite decision will cause me to lose 10 not to make 14

many people who do transfer a balance from one credit card to another have no clue as to what is going on and how credit cards work if you transfer a balance from one credit card to another you are charged a fee of anywhere from 3 upwards subject to a minimum of $ 10 or so up front if credit card a has balance $ 1000 and you transfer it to credit card b which is offering no interest for a year on the transferred balance you owe credit card b $ 1050 say in most cases that $ 50 has to be paid off as part of the following month 's bill if you are carrying a revolving balance on credit card b that $ 50 will typically be charged interest from the day of the transfer your monthly bill will not necessarily include that $ 1000   you owe for one year or six months or whatever the transfer agreement you accepted says if you tend to pay anything less even a penny than   full payment of each month 's bill on credit card b your partial payment will be applied to that $ 1000 first and anything left over will be applied to the monthly balance in short if you do n't pay in full each month that $ 1000 will not be yours for a year you may end up paying $ 50 interest for   borrowing $ 1000 for just one or two months and the rest of your balance is the gift that keeps on giving as the credit card company likes to say update this has changed slightly in the united states any amount paid over the minimum amount due is charged to the higher interest balances so in this case if you had $ 1000 at a 0 promotional rate and a regular balance of $ 500 and the minimum payment was $ 100 and you paid $ 150 $ 100 would pay down the promotional balance and the extra $ 50 would pay down the regular balance   about the only way to make the deal work in your favor is to transfer money only if you have paid the full amount due    on the last two statements before the date of the transfer and are    not carrying a revolving balance check your monthly statements    to make sure they show finance charge of 0.00   many people have    never seen such a sight and are unaware that this can be observed    in nature make sure that you pay each month 's bill in full not    the minimum monthly payment due each month for a whole year    after that make sure that the bill containing that $ 1000 coming out a    year after the transfer date is also paid in full very many credit card users do not have the financial discipline to go through with this program   that is why credit card companies love to push transfer balances on consumers the whole thing is a cash cow for them where they in effect get to charge usurious rates of interest without running afoul of the law $ 50 interest for a one year loan of $ 1000 is pretty high at current rates $ 50 interest for a two or three month loan where the customer does not even notice the screwing he is getting is called laughing all the way to the bank see also the answers to   this question

if you do n't think you 're necessarily going to stay in this area for five years consider another option renting five years is often quoted as the minimum length of time for buying over renting as the costs of the house purchase and the mortgage are significant and if you 're buying a new house every 5 years you 're putting several thousand dollars of fees up front each time   if you do n't assume that house prices will increase as they wo n't necessarily then you can consider these costs say $ for a $ 500k house an extra 1 or so of interest that first year   if you are there 5 years then you 're paying 0.2 extra more or less that 's reasonable but if you 're there only 2 years you 're adding 0.5 to your rate which is pretty significant you wo n't necessarily come out ahead here versus renting renting for a year or two gives you enough time to find out if you do like the area and if you do you buy then with more knowledge of the area and a chance to make a purchase at the right time for you you pay off your loans or at least a chunk of them now save some of the rest and then rethink in a couple of years   if you then do n't qualify for a doctor 's mortgage anymore you just save up the rest of the 20 before making the purchase

options are contractual instruments most options you 'll run into are contracts which allow you to buy or sell stock at a given price at some time in the future if you feel like it it gives you the option these are call and put options respectively for buying the stock and selling the stock if you have a lot of money in an index fund etf you may be able to protect your portfolio against a market decline by e.g. buying put options against the etf for a substantially lower price than the index fund currently trades at if the market crashes and your fund falls in value significantly you can exercise the options selling the fund at the price that your option has specified to the counter party of your contract this is the risk that the option mitigates against even if you do n't have one particular fund with your investments you could still buy a put option on a similar fund and resell it to another person in lieu of exercise they would be capable of buying the stock and performing the exercise themselves for profit if necessary in general if you are buying an option for safety it should be an option either on something you own or something whose price behavior will mimic something you own you will note that options are linked to the price of stocks futures are contracts whose values are linked to the price of other things typically commodities such as oil gold or orange juice their behaviors may diverge with an option you can have a contractual guarantee on the exact investment you 're trying to protect additionally many commodities value may fall at the same time that stock investments fall during economic contractions which reduce industrial activity resulting in lower profits for firms and less demand for commodities you may also note that there are other structures that options may have put options on index funds or similar instruments are probably most specifically relevant to your interests the downside of protecting yourself with options is that it costs money to buy this option and the option eventually expires so you may lose money essentially you are buying safety and risk tolerance from the option contract 's counterparty and safety is not free i can not inform you what level of safety is appropriate for your portfolio 's needs but more safety is more expensive

the best option would be to have the dental office allow you pay in installments that would be probably the cheapest and most convenient way when high amounts are involved many medical offices are flexible with payments and allow spreading over long period of time so you should check it out otherwise credit cards would probably be the most expensive loan but you should shop around and compare the rates offered to you it is hard to guess would you may get

you need to run awareness campaign on facebook even something like $ can have a huge impact on letting people know you exist then post frequently at least 1 daily picture of something for sale in the shop    second collect emails at the counter a simple pen and paper list works surprisingly well get a free email account and email coupons once a week in the beginning you 'll want strong offers as you are building the list do n't waste peoples time with lame or no offers come hard with a huge coupon or they will after the first email this might cost you some money but do n't think of it as selling something for a loss think of it as a marketing expense   try groupon you are desperate this is where desperate local businesses go make a smart offer limit how they can spend it i would suggest focusing it on the cold brew as that has enough margin   partner with local coffee cup cake shops pretty much any one who will have you and give them free shelf space and get them to market to their facebook ig twitter followers about your location and that they can buy stuff there also this is huge and you can capitalize your local market   finally get over the attitude of no one supports local people do n't owe your mom their business just because she 's local she has to compete on price service and selection just like anyone else even amazon so reevaluate your prices your profit margins and start talking to the customers to see what they want in the store

$ 900 seems like a fair cost of minor repair as a landlord i repaint and the walls if there are any holes labor is also expensive now a days especially here in the west coast    however this is why there is a security deposit to make sure things like this is covered after move out now you could ask the landlord for an itemized invoice of the cost of repairs which then you could rationalize the costs of repairs i usually take the security deposit then deduct any costs that were need during repair and give the remaining difference back to the tenant

i have found a good explanation here financing is calculated by taking the overall position size and multiplying it by libor + say 2 and then dividing by 365 x the amount of days the position is open for instance the interest rate applicable for overnight long positions may be 6 or 0.06 to calculate how much it would cost you to hold a long position for x number of days you would need to make this pro rata meaning that you would need to divide the 0.06 by 365 and multiply it by x days and then multiply this by the trade size so for example for a trade size of $ 20,000 held for 30 days the interest cost would be about $ it is important to note that due to financing long positions held for extended periods can reduce returns

there are two fundamentally different reasons merchants will give cash discounts one is that they will not have to pay interchange fees on cash or pay much lower fees on no reward debit cards   gas stations in my home state of nj already universally offer different cash and credit prices   costco will not even take visa and mastercard credit cards debit only for this reason the second reason not often talked about but widely known amongst smaller merchants is that they can fail to declare the sale or claim a smaller portion of the sale to the authorities in order to reduce their tax liability   obviously the larger stores will not risk their jobs for this but smaller owner operated mom and pop stores often will   this applies to both reduced sales tax liability and income tax liability   this used to be more limited per sale but more widespread overall since tax authorities would look closely for a mismatch between declared income and spending but with an ever larger proportion of customers paying by credit card merchants can take a bigger chunk of their cash sales off the books without drawing too much suspicion both of the above are more applicable to tvs than cars since 1 car salesmen make substantial money from offering financing and 2 all cars must be registered with the state so alternative records of sales abound   also car prices tend to be at or near the credit limit of most cards so it is not as common to pay for them in this way

standard markowitz 's portfolio optimization takes trend into account not mean reversion otherwise since a portfolio is a linear combination of your individual assets you could 1st model them separately and than establish a second layer criteria for weighting for the 1st layer mean reversion as well as trend of returns can be captured with a model and for the 2nd layer you could use the kelly criterion for instance a more direct approach to mean reversion portfolio selection is working with pairs trading i 'm not linking any materials as those topics are plentiful on the web if that 's still not the answer you 're looking for the problem with predicting economic cycles is that they are long and we hardly have a sufficient measured history to forecast anything reliable in order to predict the mean reversion of a stock or bond market cycle you 've got to measure their long term mean first and there you 'll have disagreements right on the start some researchers see jeremy siegel have tried to measure the long term mean of returns for various asset classes some argue that stocks are the long run winners and that capm explains that but others say that 's just questionable since measurements go just as far as the western countries us uk etc have thrived other countries have much more recent economic records

tl dr   yes the david popularized the debt snowball the method of paying low balance first   it 's purely psychological the reward or sense of accomplishment is a motivator to keep pushing to the next card   there 's also the good feeling of following one you believe to be wise the david is very charismatic and speaks in a no nonsense my way or the highway voice history is riddled with religious leaders who offer advice which is followed without question   the good feeling in theory leads to a greater success rate and really it 's easier to follow a plan that comes at a cost than to follow one that your guru takes issue with   in the end when i produce a spreadsheet showing the cost difference say $ 1000 over a 3 year period the response is that it 's worth the $ 1000 to actually succeed my sole purpose is to simply point out the cost difference between the two methods $ 100 go with the one that makes you feel good $ 2000 just think about it first   if it 's not clear my issue is less with the fact that the low balance method is inferior and more with its proponents wishing to obfuscate the fact that the high interest method is not only valid but has some savings built in when a woman called into the david 's radio show and said her friend recommended the high rate first method he dismissed it and told her that low balance was the only way to go   the rest of this answer is tangent to the real issue answered above   the battle reminds me of how people brag about getting a tax refund with all due respect to the tax software people the goal should be minimizing one 's tax bill getting a high refund means you all year and lent uncle sam money at zero and yet you feel good about getting $ 3000 back in april disclosure when my father in law passed away i took over my mother in law 's finances her ira rmd and taxes first year i converted some money to roth and we had a $ 100 tax bill face on mom since then i have schwab hold too much federal tax and we always get about $ 100 back this makes her happy and i 'll ignore the 27 cents lost interest   1 i need to acknowledge that there are cases where the taxpayer has had zero dollars withheld yet receives a tax refund the earned income tax credit eitc produces a refundable benefit i.e. a payment that 's not conditional on tax due obviously those who benefit from this are not whom i am talking about   also in response to a comment below the opportunity cost is not the rate the bank would have paid you on the money had you held on to it it 's the 18 card you should be paying off that $ 3000 refund likely cost over $ 400 in the interest paid over the prior year

interest rates do generally affect house prices but other factors do too especially the unemployment rate however everything else being equal when interest rates drop it makes the borrowing of money cheaper so tends to stimulate the economy and the housing market increasing the demand for houses and generally causes house prices to increase especially if the supply of new housing does n't increase with the demand when interest rates go up the opposite happens usually interest rates go down in order to stimulate   a slowing economy and interest rates go up to slow down an overheated economy regarding your situation you are able to get a 30 year fixed rate at today ’s interest rates in australia the longest fixed rate you can get is for 10 years and the rate is usually 1 or 2 percent higher than the standard variable rate most people here go for the variable rate or a fixed rate of between 1 to 3 years this means that even if rates do go up in the future you wo n't be paying a higher rate which is a positive for you you are buying the house to live in so as long as you can keep making the repayments you should not be too worried if the price of the house drops sometime in the future because if your house has dropped and you want to sell to buy another house to live in then that house would have also dropped relative to yours give or take so your main worry is that rates will go up causing both house prices to fall and unemployment to rise and you yourself losing your job and eventually your house it is a risk but what you need to consider is if you can manage that risk firstly i believe rates wo n't be going up in the us for a number of years and if and when they do start going up they will most probably start going up slowly so you have some time on your side secondly what can you do between now and when interest rates do start going up in a few years try to put more saving away to increase your safety net from 6 months to 12 months or more or make extra repayments into your home loan so that you are ahead if things do go wrong if you are worried that you could lose your job what can you do to reduce your chances of losing your job or increasing your chances of getting a new job quickly if you do lose it improve your current skills get new skills become an invaluable employee or look at possible opportunities to start your own business do your own research on the types of houses you are looking at buying the more houses you look at the better prepared you will be when the right house at the right price comes along and the less chance that you will be rushed into buying what might be an overpriced house so to sum it up do as much research as you can have an understanding of what your risks are and how you are going to manage those risks

this may vary some by the state but the general facts are consistent broadly the elements of check fraud typically are this means that not only do you have to have presented a check that is returned for insufficient funds but you must have known at the time that it would n't be honored    it must typically also be given for present consideration which is why the comments to the other answer correctly note that the post dated check scam cooked up by the payday loan folks should n't generally be relevant under these laws on the same site they note the cases that are clearly not present consideration so if i give you a check for $ 50 and it 's returned for nsf because i screwed up my bank accounts and had all my money in savings that 's probably not fraud   but if i decide i really want a tesla x and give tesla motors a check for $ 95,000 knowing i do n't have $ 95,000 that 's fraud how the prosecutor proves knowledge is probably beyond the scope of personal finance and money stack exchange though i imagine it tends to commonly be done so by showing the person does n't normally have that much money in their account

does n't allocate capital to build cities for which there are no residents    so you have n't seen pictures of the suburbs of las vegas   gt;it does n't pick winners by deciding who is best at bribing government officials    so you 've never heard of or crony capitalism

i like it maybe a little fixed gambling via those new slot machines that are a cross between video games and just keep quarters   mandatory line dance on the bar every hour by the servers   hot but not so hot you ca n't park grandma for the evening     i 'm all for a true celebration of and local roots and the whole idea in the abstract is not bad at all but i will be surprised if they can pull together the right talent while politics at the same time   more than likely it will end up as applebees the hotel

just sat the level 3 exam here   i know a few folks who have passed their exams coming in from an eng background   you 're certainly at a disadvantage not knowing some finance but do n't let it discourage you   passing is more about working hard and self discipline than prior finance knowledge

well underwater means their property has lost value so by definition its not their fault    blame people who sign up for payments they ca nt afford which really is their own fault if they just did n't take into account the full term of their loan and just paid attention to the first months payment

if it was me i would sell the house and use the proceeds to work on pay off the second    you do n't speak to your income but it must be pretty darn healthy to convince someone to lend you k on two homes   given this situation i am not sure what income i would have to have to feel comfortable   i am thinking around 500k year would start to make me feel okay but i would probably want it higher than that think i can rent out the 1st house for $ 1500 and after property management fees take home about $ 435 per month that is not including any additional taxes on that income or deductions based on repair work etc so this is why   given that your income is probably pretty high would something less than $ 435 really move your net worth needle   no   it is worth the reduction in risk to give up that amount of passive income   keeping the home opens you up to all kinds of risk   your $ 435 per month could easily evaporate into something negative given taxes likely rise in insurance rates and repairs   you have a great shovel to build wealth there is no reason to assume this kind of exposure   you will become wealthy if you invest and work to reduce your debt

years ago when buying checks through one 's bank was the sole option if you got a business account with a bank you had to buy business checks   one difference between a business account and a personal account was that on the business account the incorporated or unincorporated company say simply wonderful apps had the option of changing from john doe to richard roe as the treasurer of simply wonderful apps and the person signing the checks whereas a personal account in john doe 's name could not be changed to allow richard roe signature authority over the account   for a self employed person doing business as simply wonderful apps a personal checking account would do just as well   since the need to change the person responsible for signing checks might never arise it was of course important to have a separate checking account for the business because it made book keeping simpler and also separated business expenses deductible on schedule c from personal expenses but it was not necessary to have a business account or business checks to run a small business in addition to the various advantages described in other answers one advantage that i found for larger checks is that various money management programs could do things like print an address below the name on computer checks so that after folding   the check could be put into a window envelope and mailed directly for the one check to a page format the programs could print additional information on the blank area below the check e.g. explanations about the check company logo etc so it was convenient if one had to write several checks each month but if   outgoing checks are infrequent and extra security is not much of an issue there   is less reason to spend a lot extra on business style checks rather than the personal style checks

no it 's not   you need a bs and a masters to achieve a   you need a bachelors to achieve a masters   when i was halfway through my bachelors no one came and gave me an associates   when i graduated college no one gave me a bs and an associates   an associates whole purpose is to show someone has achieved some college   you do n't get two degrees for graduating college in its entirety     further if you achieve an associates and then come back some time later and finish and get your bachelors you do n't need to say you have both   it is horribly retarded

this would be exactly the sort of product that a thief would want if they had got ahold of some account numbers and wanted to steal the money from those accounts in a way that would let them spend it as conveniently as possible that should explain why i think it 's unlikely that any such product exists

you and your husband are fronting all the money upfront i 'm guessing this will cost you around once closing costs and fees are included so obviously you would be hundred percent owners at the beginning you 'll then pay 31 of the mortgage and have your sister pay the remaining 69 this puts your total investment at the end at + + 31 of interest accrued and your sisters total investment at of interest accrued if you hold the full length of the mortgage your sister will have invested much more than you assuming 30 year fixed rate and 3.75 she 'd pay in interest as opposed to your she will have spent and y' all will have spent however if you sell early your percentage could be much higher   these calculations do n't take into account the opportunity cost of fronting all the cash it could be earning you more in the stock market or in a different investment property liability also could be an issue in the case of her not being able to pay the bank can still come after you for the whole amount lastly and most importantly this also does n't include the fact that she will be living there and y' all will not what kind of rent would she be paying to live in a similar home if it is more than 1400 you will basically be subsidizing her living as well as tying up funds and increasing your risk exposure if it is more than 1400 she should n't be any percent owner

that 's a lot of manual checking in to see if everything is performing the way you want not to insult your intelligence but that is not your job and doing that on a monthly basis is going to eat a lot of time plus most 401(k programs have lockout periods wherein changes ca n't be made without incurring additional fees related to distributions etc and if you 're checking that often you are likely losing the benefits of investing in mutual funds to start with if you have the stomach to handle the risk go for the high risk investment vehicles early in your career you can afford a 30 drop this year if you then make 105 15 or 50 back each of the next 5 if on the other hand you 're in your mid career switch to more conservative management tactics

learn is one of my favorite resources it walks you through the model top to bottom and best of all it 's free    when you get closer to understanding what you want to do long term your firm will probably recommend pay for a more comprehensive program like training the street or wall street prep    it 's really hard to master this without working in the field but if you can demonstrate that you have a strong grasp of the finance accounting and modeling mainly excel concepts you will be a in your interviews
