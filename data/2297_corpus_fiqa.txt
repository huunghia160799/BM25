buffet is in a different league from other value investors he looks for stable companies with no debt and good management then he looks to deeply understand the industries of candidate companies and looks for companies that are not in commodity businesses or sell commodities that can be bought for 25 of the valuation that he believes reflects the true value of the company deeply understanding the market is really the key   consider the northern santa fe railroad which buffet purchased last year railroads benefit from higher oil prices as they can transport cargo much cheaper than trucks they also tend to have natural monopolies in the regions they operate in buffet bought the railroad just as production of oil and natural gas in north dakota started picking up since pipeline capacity between north dakota and refineries in texas oklahoma is very limited the railroad is making alot of money transporting crude

look at the left column   if you are disabled at age 62 or older and have worked for at least 10 years they you qualify for full disability benefits which are generally less than retirement benefits    outside of disability one is only eligible for social security benefits at age 67 unless you were born before 1960 in which case different rules apply but you must have worked for at least 10 years to get full retirement benefits

banks are businesses and as such should have the right to refuse service so they should probably be able to choose one customer over another at will    i say should because business owners protecting themselves against litigation related to discrimination could restrict their freedom as business owners however banks are businesses and if the customers are identical both will be approved or not according to credit records   does not make sense to approve one person with a given credit record and refuse someone with a similar record   unless they barely qualify   since no two credit histories are identical there are surely edge cases finally if a customer is a long term customer with large deposits and/or significant amounts of business with the bank the bankers will likely be inclined to do more business

modern portfolio theory   modern portfolio theory mpt or mean variance analysis is a mathematical framework for assembling a portfolio of assets such that the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk defined as variance its key insight is that an asset 's risk and return should not be assessed by itself but by how it contributes to a portfolio 's overall risk and return   economist harry markowitz introduced mpt in a essay for which he was later awarded a nobel prize in economics     option finance   in finance an option is a contract which gives the buyer the owner or holder of the option the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset or instrument at a specific strike price on a specified date depending on the form of the option the strike price may be set by reference to the spot price market price of the underlying security or commodity on the day an option is taken out or it may be fixed at a discount in a premium the seller has the corresponding obligation to fulfill the transaction to sell or buy if the buyer owner exercises the option an option that conveys to the owner the right to buy at a specific price is referred to as a call an option that conveys the right of the owner to sell at a specific price is referred to as a put     ^ ^pm](https://www.reddit.com message compose?to = kittens_from_space ^| ^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com message compose?to = wikitextbot&amp;message = excludeme&amp;subject = excludeme ^| ^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com r finance about banned ^| ^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com r wikitextbot wiki index ^| ^source](https://github.com kittenswolf wikitextbot    ^ ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27

if you made a contribution to a traditional ira for year x whether made during year x or made in year x+1 before the due date of your tax return for year x then you can withdraw the contribution and any gains on that contribution   by the due date of your tax return if the contribution was deductible then of course you must not take a deduction for it in on your tax return for year x or any other year for that matter as for the gains if any that were withdrawn they are taxable income to you for year x not x+1 even if the withdrawal occurred in year x+1 publication says you generally can make a tax free withdrawal of contributions if you do it before the due date for filing your tax return for the year in which you made them this means that even if you are under age 59 1/2 the 10 additional tax may not apply and later in the same publication if you have an extension of time to file your return you can withdraw them tax free by the extended due date you can do this if for each contribution you withdraw both of the following conditions apply      you did not take a deduction for the contribution    you withdraw any interest or other income earned on the contribution you can take into account any loss on the contribution while it was in the ira when calculating the amount that must be withdrawn     if there was a loss the net income earned on the contribution may be a negative amount later the document says you must include in income any earnings on the contributions you withdraw include the earnings in income for the year in which you made the contributions not the year in which you withdraw them and the 10 additional tax on distributions made before you reach age 59 1/2 does not apply to these tax free withdrawals of your contributions however the distribution of interest or other income must be reported on form 5329 and unless the distribution qualifies as an exception to the age 59 1/2 rule it will be subject to this tax since you have a loss on the contributions that you are withdrawing there is no interest or other income that needs to be reported

usually backtests for long term strategies are evaluated on a end of day basis where you only consider close prices if your strategy performs well in these backtests hopes are that if you use a market on close moc order your performance will not diverge too much from the backtest the fact that it wo n't diverge much is important if you keep backtesting the strategy along with the real trading to see regime changes or similar   if you used end of day prices for the backtests but some arbitrary intraday market order you 'd have some difficulties to explain deviations between the two what it is   moc orders can be submitted during the day but they wo n't be executed until shortly before the market or more precise the current session closes

my equities portfolio breaks down like this i 'm 26 years old so it is quite aggressive additionally i have a portfolio of direct real estate investments i have made over the past 4 years   i invested very aggressively into real estate due to the financial crisis as a result of my aggressive investing strong growth in real estate my overall asset breakdown is quite out of balance real estate ~20 equities i will be bringing this into a more sensible balance over the next few years as i unwind some of my real estate investments reinvest the proceeds into other asset classes as for the alternative asset groups you mentioned i looked quite seriously at peer to peer lending a few years back lending club however interest rates were quite low i felt that real estate was a better asset class to be in at the time    furthermore i was borrowing heavily to fund real estate purchases at the time and i felt it did n't make much sense to be lending cash borrowing at the same time   i needed every dime i could get a hold of     i will give it another look once rates come back up i 've away from investing in things like actively managed mutual funds hedge funds etc not because i do n't think good managers can get superior returns rather in my humble opinion if they do get above average returns then they simply charge higher management fees to reflect their good performance hope this helps

if you know that you want that advanced degree and there is a way to have your employer pay for some of it or all of it and you are reasonably certain that you will not be quitting for x years after completing the degree then it is financially sound to consider having the company pay for it if you are interested in finding out if an advanced degree in that field is possible feasible for you but you are n't 100 sure and it is possible for your company to pay for the first few classes then it is financially sound to consider having them pay for the first semesters worth of classes the key is to determine if the company has a requirement that you must complete the degree or you will owe them the money in many cases you are not committed to having them pay for all semesters i have known employees who used the company to pay for the early classes then paid for the last few on their own   keep in mind that most employers only pay you for the classes that you have good grades they require you to submit paperwork before the semester but do n't pay you back until after the semester because of a rolling time frame you can protect yourself by keeping in reserve the maximum amount that you would have to repay the employer if you quit for the companies i have worked for you only had to stay an extra year you would only have owed them for that last year if you quit keeping a years tuition in reserve allows you to mitigate the risk of having to quit if the question is about risk then hedging make sense

there are two types of 529 programs   one where you put money aside each month the one offered by your state may give you a tax break on you deposits you can pick the one from any state if you like their options better during the next 18 years the focus the investment changes from risky to less risky to no risk this happens automatically the money can be used for tuition room board books fees the 2nd type of 529 is also offered by a state but it is geared for a big lump sum payment when the child is young this will cover full tuition and fees not room and board or books at a state school the deal is not as great if they child wants to go out of state or you move or they want to go to a private school you do n't lose everything but you will have to make up the shortfall at the last minute there are provisions for scholarship money if you kid goes to west point you have n't wasted the money in the 529 the money in either plan is ignored while calculating financial aid other options such as the coverdell education savings account also exist but they do n't have the options and state tax breaks accounts in the child 's name can impact the amount of financial aid offered plus they could decide to spend the money on a car the automatic investment shift for most of the state 529 plans does cover your question of how much risk to take there are also ways to transfer the money to other siblings if one decides not to go to college keep in mind that the funds do n't have to be spent as soon as they turn 18 they can wait a few years before enrolling in college

stock market indexes are generally based on market capitalization which is not the same as gdp   gdp includes the value of all goods and services produced in a country this includes a large amount of small scale production which may not be reflected in stock market   thus the ratio between countries may not be the same as the ratio of their total market capitalization   for instance us gdp is approximately 3.8 times as much as japan 's see here but us total market cap is about 5.5 as much as japan 's see here the discrepancy can be even more severe when comparing developed economies like the us to developing or less developed economies in which there is less participation in large scale financial systems like stock markets   for instance us gdp is roughly 10 times that of brazil but us total market cap is roughly 36 times that of brazil   switzerland has a total market cap nearly double that of brazil despite its total gdp being less than half of brazil 's   since the all world index includes all investable economies it will include many economies whose share of market cap is disproportionately lower than their share of gdp in addition according to the fact sheet you linked to that index tracks only and mid cap stocks   this will further skew the weighting to developed economies and to the us in particular since the us has a disproportionate share of the largest companies obviously one would need to take a more detailed look at all the weights to determine if these factors account precisely for the level of discrepancy you see in this particular index   but hopefully that explanation gives an idea of why the us might be weighted more heavily in a stock index than it is in raw gdp

first the obvious business school rankings are flawed    i have no doubt that asian business schools are improving rapidly and many are already on par with western universities many of the best teachers at us european schools are also teaching in asia i have never had an asian teacher but i expect that they are as great as their western counterparts also academic journals accept more and more asian submissions    but we also have to put the numbers in perspective an american student who did an mba in china will have a hard time getting a job in the us even those who go to european universities are met by recruiters with so these the high ranking of asian schools is really only relevant for asian students    in short what the ranking says is if you 're chinese you do n't need to go to the us or europe for your business degree personally i suggest you still do if you can afford it because the experience abroad and the exposure to students with a different attitude will be an enrichment

in us public stock markets there is no difference between the actions individual retail traders are permitted to take and the actions institutional corporate traders are permitted to take   the only difference is the cost of those actions   for example if you become a registered market maker on say the bats stock exchange you 'll get some amazing rebates and reduced transaction prices however in order to qualify for registered market maker status you have to maintain constant orders in the book for hundreds of equities at significant volumes   an individual retail trader is certainly permitted to do that but it 's probably too expensive algorithmic trading is not the same as automated trading algorithmic trading can be non automated and automated trading can be non algorithmic and both can be anywhere from low- to high frequency   a low frequency automated strategy is essentially indistinguishable from a person clicking their mouse several times per day so no from a legal or regulatory perspective there is no special procedure an individual retail trader has to follow before s he can automate a trading strategy   your broker on the other hand may have all sorts of hoops for you to jump through in order to use their automation platform last but certainly not least you will almost certainly lose money hand over fist attempting bid ask scalping as an individual retail trader whether your approach is algorithmic or not automated or not   why   because the only way to succeed at bid ask scalping is to a always be at near the front of the queue when a price change occurs in your favor and b always cancel your resting orders before they are executed when a price change occurs against you   unless your algorithms are smarter than every other algorithm in the industry an individual retail trader operating through a broker 's trading platform can not react quickly enough to succeed at either of those   you would have to eschew the broker and buy direct market access to even have a chance and that 's the point at which you 're no longer a retail trader good luck

summary it 's because you are effectively contributing more money in the second case so you have more money at the end   the effect of being covered by an employer retirement plan in the case of a 401(k that means either you or your employer contributed to it during the year is that it prevents you from deducting traditional ira contributions unless your income is below a very low level for single filing status it phases out at an magi of between $ and $ since you are unable to deduct the traditional ira contribution but you entered that you are still making the full $ 5500 contribution every year that means you are making a non deductible contribution of $ 5500 every year instead of a deductible contribution nondeductible contributions are after tax whereas deductible contributions are pre tax because your taxable income is reduced by the amount of the contribution so you effectively do n't pay income tax on the income you used to contribute $ 1 of pre tax money is not the same as $ 1 of after tax money if your marginal tax rate is 25 then $ 1 of pre tax money is equivalent to $ 0.75 of after tax money however since in both cases you are putting in the same nominal amount of contribution $ 5500 but one is pre tax and one is after tax in the after tax case you are effectively contributing more money i.e. more money is taken out from your bank account that year the $ 5500 pre tax contribution is equivalent to only $ 5500 0.75 = $ after tax i.e. you are only short $ from your bank account at the end of the year after making a $ 5500 deductible contribution whereas you are short $ 5500 after making a $ 5500 non deductible contribution so it 's not a fair comparison the non deductible traditional ira contributions are not taxed when withdrawn though the earnings earned from those contributions are still taxed so that 's why you are left with a greater amount this is a similar situation to what happens when you try to compare a $ 5500 deductible traditional ira contribution to a $ 5500 roth ira contribution it will look like the roth ira case leaves you with much more money but that 's again because you are effectively contributing more money because the roth ira contribution is after tax so it 's not a fair comparison the roth ira case will produce a much greater advantage than the non deductible traditional ira contribution case because for a roth ira both the contributions and earnings will not be taxed at withdrawal

it very much comes down to question of semantics and your particular situation some people do not view a house and most upgrades as an investment but rather an expense   i certainly agree that this is probably the case if you pay someone else to make the repairs and upgrades   however if you are a serious that may not be the case   of course if the house is a money pit and/or you were unfortunate to buy when prices where ridiculously high you 'll have a hard time making any money on this investment   to continue this game of semantics you may also consider the value you extract from your home while you are living in it on to the mortgage itself   chances are that it is a long term relatively low rate loan and that the interest is deductible   so there are some disadvantages to paying it down early even without early payment penalties   paying down early on the principal is a disadvantage from a tax perspective   how much of a disadvantage hinges on the rate now a debt is a liability on your personal balance sheet   it drags down any returns you may have from investing   however a home lone is not generally subject to the rule of paying off your high interest debt before investing   it should not be relatively high and it pays for something necessary   it may be that any credit card debt you have may have paid for something considered necessary   however with the relatively high interest rates you have to question just how necessary any credit card debt really is   not to mention that there is no tax advantage so it comes down to the fact that a home loan should be relatively low interest paying for something you must have and that you hopefully have some tax advantage from the interest you pay on it

a re financing or re fi is when a debtor takes out a new loan for the express purpose of paying off an old one this can be done for several reasons usually the primary reason is that the terms of the new loan will result in a lower monthly payment debt consolidation taking out one big loan at a relatively low interest rate to pay off the smaller higher interest loans that rack up like credit card debt medical bills etc is a form of refinancing but you most commonly hear the term when referring to refinancing a home mortgage as in your example to answer your questions most of the money comes from a new bank that bank understands up front that this is a re fi and not new debt the homeowner is n't asking for any additional money but instead the money they get will pay off outstanding debt therefore the net amount of outstanding debt remains roughly equal even then a re fi can be difficult for a homeowner to get at least on terms he 'd be willing to take first off if the homeowner owes more than the home 's worth a re fi may not cover the full principal of the existing loan the bank may reject the homeowner outright as not creditworthy a new house is a huge ding on your credit score trust me or the market and the homeowner 's credit may prevent the bank offering loan terms that are worth it to the homeowner the homeowner must often pony up cash up front for the closing costs of this new mortgage which is money the homeowner hopes to recoup in reduced interest however the homeowner may not recover all the closing costs for many years or ever to answer the question of why a bank would do this there are several reasons the bank offering the re fi is usually not the bank getting payments for the current mortgage this new bank wants to take your business away from your current bank and receive the substantial amount of interest involved over the remaining life of the loan if you 've ever seen a mortgage summary statement the interest paid over the life of a 30-year loan can easily equal the principal and often it 's more like twice or three times the original amount borrowed that 's attractive to rival banks   it 's in your current bank 's best interest to try to keep your business if they know you are shopping for a re fi even if that means offering you better terms on your existing loan often the bank is itself on the hook to its own investors for the money they lent you and if you pay off early without any penalty they no longer have your interest payments to cover their own and they usually ca n't pay off early bonds which are shares of corporate debt do n't really work that way the better option is to keep those scheduled payments coming to them even if they lose a little off the top often if a homeowner is working with their current bank for a lower payment no new loan is created but the terms of the current loan are this is called a loan modification especially when the government is requiring the bank to sit down at the bargaining table or in some cases a streamlining if the bank and borrower are meeting in more circumstances without the government forcing either one to be there historically the idea of giving a homeowner a break on their contractual obligations would be comical to the bank in recent times though the threat of foreclosure the bank 's primary weapon does n't have the same teeth it used to someone facing 30 years of budget busting payments on a house that will never again be worth what he paid for it would look at foreclosure and even bankruptcy as the better option as it 's theoretically all over and done with in only 7 10 years with the government having a vested interest in keeping people in their homes making whatever payments they can to keep some measure of confidence in the entire financial system loan modifications have become much more common and the banks are usually as they 've found very quickly that they 're not getting anywhere near the purchase price for these toxic assets sometimes a re fi actually results in a higher apr but it 's still a better deal for the homeowner because the loan does n't have other associated costs lumped in such as mortgage insurance money the guarantor wants in return for underwriting the loan which is in turn required by the fdic to protect the bank in case you default the homeowner pays less the bank gets more everyone 's happy including the guarantor they do n't really want to be underwriting a loan that requires pmi in the first place as it 's a significant risk the u.s. government is spending a lot of money and putting a lot of pressure on fdic insured institutions including virtually all mortgage lenders to cut the average joe a break banks get tax breaks when they do loan modifications the fed 's buying at risk bond packages backed by distressed mortgages and where the homeowner has n't walked away completely they 're negotiating mortgage mods directly all of this can result in the homeowner facing a lienholder that is willing to work with them if they 've held up their end of the contract to date

with new cars it 's usually the other way around finance at a low apr or get cash back when you buy it outright with used cars you usually do n't know how much they have invested in the car so it 's more difficult to know how low they 're willing to go regardless i do think it 's odd that they would knock 2 k off the price if you finance with them but not if you pay cash the only reason they would do that is if they intend to make at least 2 k in interest over the life of the loan but they have no way of guaranteeing you wo n't refi therefore i suspect they are and would probably close the deal if you wrote them a check or put the cash on the table for 2 k less however if they wo n't budge and will only knock off 2 k if you finance you could finance and pay it off in full a week later just make sure they do n't have any hidden origination fees or pay off early fees

first of all congratulations on admitting your problem and on your determination to be debt free   recognizing your mistakes is a huge first step and getting rid of your debt is a very worthwhile goal when considering debt consolidation there are really only two reasons to do so reason 1 to lower your monthly payment   if you are having trouble coming up with enough money to meet your monthly obligations debt consolidation can lower your monthly payment by extending the time frame of the debt   the problem with this one is that it does n't help you get out of debt faster   it actually makes it longer before you are out of debt and will increase the total amount of interest that you will pay to the banks before you are done   so i would not recommend debt consolidation for this reason unless you are truly struggling with your cashflow because your minimum monthly payments are too high   in your situation it does not sound like you need to consolidate for this reason reason 2 to lower your interest rate   if your debt is at a very high rate debt consolidation can lower your interest rate which can reduce the time it will take to eliminate your debt the consolidation loan you are considering is at a high interest rate on its own   now it is true that some of your debt is higher than that but it looks like the majority of your debt is less than that rate   it does n't sound to me that you will save a significant amount of money by consolidating in this loan   if you can obtain a better consolidation loan in the future it might be worth considering from your question it looks like your reasoning for the consolidation loan is to close the credit card accounts as quickly as possible   i agree that you need to quit using the cards but this can also be accomplished by destroying the cards   the consolidation loan is not needed for this you also mentioned that you are considering adding $ 3,000 to your debt   i have to say that it does n't make sense at all to me to add to your debt especially at when your goal is to eliminate your debt   to answer your question explicitly yes the cash buffer from the loan is a very bad idea here is what i recommend this is based on this answer but customized for you cut up destroy your credit cards   today   you 've already recognized that they are a problem for you   cash checks and debit cards are what you need to use from now on start working from a monthly budget assigning a job for every dollar that you have   this will allow you to decide what to spend your money on rather than arriving at the end of the month with no idea where your money was lost   budgeting software can make this task easier   see this question for more information your first goal should be to put a small amount of money in a savings account perhaps $ 1000 $ 1500 total   this is the start of your emergency fund   this money will ensure that if something unexpected and urgent comes up you wo n't be so cash poor that you need to borrow money again   note this money should only be touched in an actual emergency and if spent should be replenished as soon as possible   at the rate you are talking about it should take you less than a month to do this after you 've got your small emergency fund in place attack the debt as quickly and aggressively as possible   the order that you pay off your debts is not significant the optimal method is up for debate   at the rate you suggested $ 2,000 2,500 per month you can be completely debt free in maybe 18 months as you pay off those credit cards completely close the accounts   ignore the conventional wisdom that tells you to leave the unused credit card accounts open to try to preserve a few points on your credit score   just close them after you are completely debt free take the money that you were throwing at your debt and use it to build up your emergency fund until it is 3 6 months worth of your expenses   that way you 'll be able to handle a small crisis without borrowing anything if you need more help motivation on becoming debt free and budgeting i recommend the book the total money makeover by dave ramsey

if something is tax deductible in the us it means that in the eyes of the internal revenue service you effectively did n't earn that money   within restrictions your adjusted gross income which is the income that your tax is calculated on is reduced by the amount of your tax deductions   in the case of the they 've jumped through the appropriate hoops to become a 501(c)(3 organization which among other things means that donations to them are tax deductible by the donor a if they itemize and b if they have n't reached a donation cap   that 's the carrot that encourages donations to these organizations   there are restrictions meaning that there can be only certain types of privileges or exchange between the donor and the organization   essentially it has to be a donation and not a purchase of substantial goods or services   your donation to these kinds of organizations does n't hurt their funding elsewhere or should n't as mentioned above if you do n't itemize your deductions you wo n't gain any extra tax savings from the donation   you should n't itemize if you 're better off taking the standard deduction   having said that though please give whatever you 're led to give after considering all of the ramifications financial and spiritual   the tax deduction is only a subsidy the irs does n't pick up the whole tab but only refunds a fraction to you in the form of tax savings through itemized deductions   if you do n't feel you have the money then donate your time   it might be more needed anyway

the interest in your account is usually calculated based on the average monthly balance what the bank will do is try to figure out how much money did you have on average over the month and give you interest on that amount for example if you had 10k on deposit and took it out half way through the month you will still receive interest on about 5k based on a monthly rate what i would do is read in detail your agreement with the bank to figure out if your interest is based on an average annual balance and is paid at the end of the year or if it is based on a different measurement also i would be very careful if this is a cd account since they will have early withdrawal fees hope this helps

great response thanks i 'll do my best to answer your questions   1 i 'm a genuine believer that everything from calculus to charisma can be taught to most people some people do n't have the intelligence to ever learn calculus for example and some people will only ever be average at it but most people can at least improve in most areas through education    the messed up part is that professors are never formally taught to teach some of the things i listed i implicitly learned in grad school e.g. when doing research i learned how to filter out inaccurate information when writing research papers i learned how to organize information i learned theories of motivation because i was in an org program but i never learned how to apply them especially in a classroom setting i had to figure that out myself but yes i do believe it 's something that can be learned    2 i think the vast majority of work related skills that people develop are learned on the job as you mentioned there are some generic skills students learn in college that can be applied to their work however i 'm thinking of communication and social skills although i 'm probably biased since those are the two topics i teach college it seems to me is more about learning how to follow directions figure things out for yourself and work effectively in groups than any particular subject matter and i think those skills do transfer well to the workplace    3 i 100 agree with this we 're pressured to pass students and inflate grades character issues including being disorganized being dishonest or just being rude are diagnosed as psychological disorders and we have to accommodate students with these disabilities to be clear i 100 believe in psychological disorders and i 100 support accommodating students with these i just think they are these days     totally agree with your last paragraph

yes but it 's a matter of paper trail and lifestyle your $ 600 k guy may get questioned when he makes the deposit but would show the record of having that money elsewhere people buy cars with cash a check all the time the guy filing a tax return claiming little to no income or no return at all is more likely to get flagged than the $ 100k+ earning couple who happened to be able to save to buy their $ 25 k car every 10 years with cash   on reading the article the bank had its own concerns the guy who was trying to withdraw the money was elderly and the bank seemed pretty concerned to make sure he was n't about to be scammed it may not be spelled out as such but a custodian of one 's money does have an obligation to not be party to a potential scam and the very request for such a huge sum of money in cash is a red flag

something you might want to consider instead of going out bargain hunting in hopes of picking something up on the cheap is to start doing you research now for a stock you would like to have in your portfolio and watch it for news that might cause it to go down before picking it up when it is down for a bit as you pointed out with the bp stock prior to the incident it was a solid stock that was being held in a number of funds by identifying solid stocks now you can also make the decision on the basis of the news to if the fundamentals under the stock are severely impacted or if it just a temporary dip in prices also you might want to index funds such as vti that are tied to the overall market and also pay dividends when the market tends down for awhile you can buy some shares that you can either hold for dollar cost averaging or sell off again once the market picks up

for some people it 's easier to stick to a budget if they have separate checking and savings accounts because they can deposit funds directly into their savings account and not have those funds accessible by debit credit card checks etc this allows people to pay themselves first and accumulate savings while making it slightly more difficult to spend those savings on a whim one a more technical legal note one key difference in the united states comes from regulation d. of the law limits you to six withdrawals from savings and money market accounts no such limit exists for checking accounts regulation d also forbids banks from paying interest on business checking accounts   in the simplest case checking accounts and savings accounts are a tradeoff between liquidity and return checking accounts are much more liquid but wo n't necessarily earn interest while savings accounts are less liquid because of the withdrawal limits but earn interest nowadays however sweep accounts blur this line somewhat because they function like checking accounts in that you can write an unlimited number of checks make an unlimited number of withdrawals etc but you can also earn interest on your account balance because some or all of the funds are swept into an investment account when not in use the definition of in use can vary from business to business and bank to bank

note the op does not state whether the employer sponsored retirement savings are pre tax or post tax such as a roth 401(k the following answer assumes the more common case of a pre tax plan this is a bad idea imho irs pub 970 lists exceptions to the 10 early withdrawal penalty for educational expenses this does n't include as far as i can tell student loan payments so withdrawing from your retirement account would incur both income tax and penalties even if there were an exception you 'd still have to pay income taxes which depending on the amount and your income could be at a higher marginal rate than you are currently paying   if you really want the debt gone as soon as possible why not reduce the amount you contribute to the retirement plan but not below the amount that gets you the maximum employer match and use that money to increase your monthly payments to the student loan note that if you do this you will pay taxes on income that would have been tax deferred in order to save money on interest so there 's still a trade off one more thing rather than rolling over to your new company 's plan you could roll over to a self directed traditional ira

i went to the bank with my friends and told them that i saw the money in my account that it 's not mine and that they should investigate and send it back to wherever it came from right thing to do did you give this in writing do you have a stamped copy of the letter from bank that they accepted your complaint he has been calling with different phone number threatening me saying that he will kill me he will make sure i do n't return to my country alive and all lodge a formal police complaint and also i have not heard from the bank at all what should i do ensure that all your communication and follow up is in writing even email is fine but periodically send this via certified post with tracking number even when you call up the bank keep a track of calls after a day or two send a email saying further to calls 1 calls 2 calls 3 etc you are still a response from bank even after face to face visits record all your follow up and periodically send via email and after few email take a print of everything even if its 10 pages and send via certified mail the reason it is very important to have a written trail is if things go wrong law enforcement can accuse you to be part of fraud scam it will be difficult to establish you were the one who complained about it if not too difficult change you phone numbers yes definitely open the new bank account and do n't give this to a random stranger on internet

in my opinion the risk is about the lost opportunity cost you can find a lot of articles about it on the net in big shortcut opportunity cost takes place each time you have to choose between two or more options and the tradeoff effect have its price it is defined as value of best alternative solution quite good definition from wikipedia is as follows in theory the opportunity cost of a choice is the value of the best alternative forgone in a situation in which a choice needs to be made between several mutually exclusive alternatives given limited resources assuming the best choice is made it is the cost incurred by not enjoying the benefit that would be had by taking the second best choice available note that opportunity cost is not the sum of the available alternatives when those alternatives are in turn mutually exclusive to each other it is the value of the next best use   as you think this situation often happens in financial world where investors always seek best from their point of view way to invest capital

investopedia states while early exercise is generally not advisable because the time    value inherent in the option premium is lost upon doing so there are    certain circumstances under which early exercise may be advantageous    for example an investor may choose to exercise a call option that is    deeply in the money such an option will have negligible time value    just before the ex dividend date of the underlying stock this will    enable the investor to capture the dividend paid by the underlying    stock which should more than offset the marginal time value lost due    to early exercise so the question is how well do you see the time value factor here

since you seem determined to consider this i 'd like to break down for you why i believe it is an incredibly risky proposition 1 in general picking individual stocks is risky individual stocks are by their nature not diversified assets and a single company wide calamity a la volkswagen emissions etc can create huge distress to your investments the way to mitigate this risk is of course to diversify invest in other types of assets such as other stocks index funds bonds etc however you must accept that this first step does have risks   2 picking stocks on the basis of financial information called fundamental analysis requires a very large amount of research and time dedication it is one of the two main schools of thought in equity investing as opposed to technical analysis which pulls information directly from stock markets such as price volatility this is something that professional investors do for a living and that means that they have an edge you do not have unless you dedicate similar resources to this task that information imbalance between you and professional traders creates additional risk where you make against the grain   3 any specific piece of public information and this is public information regardless of how esoteric it is may be considered to be already factored into public stock prices i am a believer in market efficiency first and foremost that means i believe that anything publically known related to a corporation opec just lowered their oil production exxon will be able to increase their prices has already been considered by the professional traders currently buying and selling in the market for your new information to be valuable it would need to have the ability to forecast earnings in a way not already considered by others 4 i doubt you will be able to find the true nature of the commercial impact of a particular event simply by knowing ship locations so what if you know is shipping aluminium to cuba is this one of 5 shipments already known to the public is this replacement supplies that are covering a loss due to damaged goods previously sent is the boat only 1/3 full where this information gets valuable is when it gets to the level of corporate espionage yes if you had ship manifests showing tons of aluminum being sold and if this was a massive secret shipment about to be announced at the next shareholders meeting you could illegally profit from that information 5 the more massive the company the less important any single transaction is that means the super you may see transporting raw commodities could have dozens of such ships out at any given time not to mention news of new mine openings and closures price changes volume reports etc etc so the most valuable information would be smaller companies where a single shipment might cover a month of revenue but such a small company is a less likely to be public meaning you could n't buy shares in the company and profit off of the information and b less likely to be found by you in the giant sea of ship information in summary while you may have found some information that provides insight into a company 's operations you have not shown that this information is significant and also unknown to the market not to mention the risks associated with picking individual stocks in the first place in this case it is my opinion that you are taking on additional risk not adequately compensated by additional reward

yes you can indeed become rich by investing even small amounts over time let 's say that you begin with nothing invested and you start investing $ 100 per week suppose you choose to put your money in an s&p 500 index mutual fund the cagr compound annual growth rate of the s&p 500 over the last 35 years has been about 11 that 35 years includes at least two fairly serious crashes you may get more or less than that number in the future but let 's guess that you 'll average 9 35 years from now you would be a millionaire $ 1.2 million actually this math works out for anyone no matter who your parents are where you are from where you went to school etc yes you have a better chance of becoming wealthy the more you invest the longer you have to stay invested and the better choices you make in your investments   by starting early you will maximize your time invested which allows you the flexibility to be more conservative in your investments and to invest smaller amounts   but for those with a shorter time to invest it is still doable for most people   get your financial life under control by eliminating your debt setting a household budget and investing for the future

since the pos machines are tied into the register it would be rather difficult to overcharge with an attentive patron   they would have to add an additional item onto the purchase in order to increase the total before running the card very few system allow cashback to be requested from the teller side and most machines have cues every time an item is added   if you are paying attention to the teller and not talking playing on your phone or other distracting things then i would say the feasibility is probably very low except for rare exceptions while traveling i only shop at locations where i can see the total on the register and make sure it looks correct before handing my card over

the tax savings of being 1099 can be significant   it depends on your salary and what you can deduct   you may want to consult with an accountant    the social security tax for the self employed is 12.4 of profit not on revenue   if you can write off more than half of the income as expenses then you could be paying less than a w-2 employee also you might make a higher salary as a 1099 it is rare the offer the same compensation for a w-2 as a 1099 as the former has higher expenses for the employer it is hard to know without actual numbers actual expected expense deductions and so forth   which is why i would suggest consulting with an accountant   you may want to talk to one in the state where he will be working rather than where you live now

gt because something is legal does n't make it the ethical choice   gt gt you fail to demonstrate what is unethical about minimizing tax burdens   operating in a country that allows you to make profit in my opinion establishes a duty to pay one 's fair share of taxes   paying legislators to make laws enabling tax avoidance is in my mind unethical   clearly we have a different idea of what is ethical and not gt corporations making huge profits using the infrastructure of the region   gt the corporations have an option to refuse using that infrastructure and instead provide their own or work with others to develop a competing infrastructure   yes    gt keep in mind that these favorable tax laws were lobbied by   corporations with the intent to avoid taxes in mind   have failed to support any argument that there is anything wrong with minimizing tax burden   that 's like your opinion man   i do n't think minimizing taxes by paying off legislators is equitable call me crazy   gt;if i 'm walking behind someone and they happen to drop a $ 100 bill without noticing i can certainly pick it up and put it in my pocket legally but its hardly the moral thing to do   more relevant example is if i order a pizza have it sent to your house then show up later with a bill for the pizza and my costs to send it to you demanding you pay it you never asked for the pizza maybe you did n't want the pizza maybe you did n't eat the pizza maybe you do n't like pizza or do n't like that kind of pizza that i choose to send you a pizza does not you to pay for that pizza   lost me on this one bro i thought we were talking ethics not surprise pizzas   how about this one    i go to your house use your kitchen and ingredients to make a pizza sell the pizza for a profit and give you nothing even though we had an agreement that if i could make a profit i would give you some   however i decide to talk to your roommate and give him a measly dollar to say forget about it bro i said it 's cool

would make sense that the higher liquidation cost and transaction costs are driving the share price down    higher and transaction means higher investors would require higher return driving down the share price the other possibilities i can think of off the top of my head based on looking at the firm for five minutes   1 in transaction costs did you include tax disclaimer math below done on the back of the envelope in between meetings   so nav says they are at liquidating that entire portfolio means about 22 capital gains tax rate which means after tax value is about $ add in any fees you 'd incur from trying to sell this stuff and it 's not unreasonable to assume you 'll only get about $ 55 m once all is said and done which is pretty close to the actual market cap    if you have accounted for the above consider   2 bulk of their investments seem to be in private assets which implies that they have some discretion in how they mark the value of those investments and there is the chance that the market does n't have confidence in these guys what 's their performance been like in recent years especially with a private asset portfolio i 'd be weary    if i was to invest in them i 'd want a higher return for the opaque portfolio

you mention only two debts mortgage and student loan but you mention $ 19 k in savings which suggests that you are a saver and likely do not have other debts you did not mention your net income and expenses income statement but since you have substantial savings you likely live within your means income > expenses   since you mention $ 38 k in retirement we might conclude you are regularly saving for retirement are you saving 10 toward retirement you did not mention any medical condition or other debts that might require a large savings so i would suggest having 6 months savings $ 2.5 k x 6 = $ 15 k but should your net expenses be less you might reduce this $ 2 k x 6 = $ 12 k you do not mention any investment you might want to make but since you did not mention any candidate investments we can assume you have no specific investments you find particularly attractive   you did not mention anything you were saving to purchase that you might want to purchase you have combined $ 19 k + $ 50 k = $ 69 k savings and $ 15 k would be a comfortable emergency savings leaving $ 54 k you could use to reduce mortgage or student loan debt the mortgage debt interest is higher so paying that debt off would be like earning 4.5 guaranteed return on your money tax free   at your income your marginal tax rate is low enough that the mortgage interest deduction if you do itemize would not reduce this return much 15 if you itemize the student loan debt interest would be like earning 2.8 guaranteed return on your money tax free clearly the higher return on your investment in paying off debt would be reducing your mortgage balance over 50 higher return on investment compared to the student loan debt you did not mention any circumstance that might cause the student loan rate to increase the mortgage rate to increase nor did you mention any difficulty making both the mortgage and student loan payments the amounts of either payment nor the number of years remaining to pay on either should you need or desire to reduce your payments you could choose to payoff the student loan to eliminate one payment and thus decrease your expenses   or you could choose to pay down the mortgage and refinance or the mortgage to obtain a smaller payment   another strategy assuming you have had your house for 5 7 years might be to pay the mortgage down enough to refinance into a 15 year loan and assuming you have a good credit score obtain a lower 3 rate but i am going to suggest you consider a blended approach   combine the dave ramsey debt snowball approach with the reduce the interest rate approach   take the $ 54 k $ 57 k available after reserving 6 months emergency fund and split between both   you pay your mortgage down by $ 27 k and your student loan debt down by $   your blended return on investment is 2.8 + = and you have the following balance sheet assets debts the next steps would be to there are two great reasons for paying off the student loan debt one is the dave ramsey debt snowball approach which is that this is the smaller debt and thus represents a psychological win and the other is that student loan debt has special treatment even in bankruptcy

your total debt is equal to your total non credit debt student loans car loans + your total available credit    this is the truth of the low balance fear from lenders that you had heard about your credit utilization is across all of your cards    so if you have two cards both with 15 k limits and one is maxed out and one is empty that is 50 utilization    if you have both cards with 7.5 k balances that is also 50 utilization for the 8 cards that are paid off and still open after you buy a house i 'd close any cards you are n't using   not everyone will agree with this if possible i would close the 8 cards now and pay off the 15 k balance before buying a house   if it 's hard to pay it off now it will be harder when you have a mortgage and home maintenance costs if you want to buy the house before you pay off all of your credit card debt i 'd still close the 8 cards that are already paid off and pay down your last card to 4 k or less to get under 25 utilization the credit rating bureaus do not publish exactly how a different utilization rate of credit will affect your score but it is known that lower utilization will improve your score   fico calls this proportion of credit lines used proportion of balances to total credit limits on certain types of revolving accounts also the longevity of your credit history is based on type of account credit cards car loans etc so if you keep one credit card open you still keep your long history with credit cards on your credit report   fico calls this time since accounts opened by specific type of account

you can make a rough calculation of the annual turnover rate of stocks by calculating the institutional investors holding of that stock institutional investors are the only firms that are required to provide such data the good this is they usually make the lion share of trading activity on the other hand this task might proof    a different ratio that could be used as a substitute share turnover which is calculated as   share turnover gives the number of shares traded as a fraction of the number of shares outstanding for example if you compare the results of stock turnover for three companies and the results came as follows   company a share turnover 1.5 times company b share turnover 3 times company c share turnover 0.3 times from the results we can conclude that for a particular period company c had the least activity and the number of shares traded for that period was only a small fraction of the shares outstanding while other traders of company c hold most shares and never trade them if you make a cross analysis of a list of businesses you intend to invest in you could figure which one has the least number of in the shares traded

the big difference for me under the high deductible plan has been that instead of paying the co pay now i am now responsible for the negotiated rate until i reach the deductible limit the hsa is only a way to funnel medical payments through a tax free account the insurance company and the doctor do n't care about the hsa if we go out of network then i am responsible for the full rate but they only count the negotiated rate as a credit against the out of pocket deductible this big difference makes it very important to pick a doctor in network for your example i would have paid $ 50 under the ppo but $ 200 under the high plan if i go out of network i would have to pay whatever the doctor want me to pay but the insurance company would only credit me $ 200 against my deductible i can pull the extra $ 350 from the hsa it is hard to get good pricing information from some doctors but the price difference for me has been so large that in network is the only way to go for prescriptions the high deductible plan has been worse because we pay the full price with no discounts for the medicine until we reach the plan deductible that makes the cost of the prescriptions as much as 10x 's more expensive in fact the annual cost of our prescriptions all but guarantees that we hit the deductible each year

gold has no intrinsic value none whatsoever   this is because value is a subjective term intrinsic value makes just as much sense as a cat dog animal dog and cat are referring to two mutually exclusive animals therefore a cat dog is a nonsensical term intrinsic value   the actual value of a company or an asset based on an underlying perception of its true value   intrinsic value is perceived which means it is worth whatever you or a group of people think it is intrinsic value has nothing i repeat absolutely nothing to do with anything that exists in reality   the most obvious example of this is the purchase of a copy right you are assigning an intrinsic value to a copy right by purchasing it however when you purchase a copy right you are not buying ink on a page you are purchasing an idea someone 's that for all intensive purposes does n't even exist in reality by definition things that do not exist do not have intrinsic properties because things that do n't exist do n't have any natural properties at all intrinsic according to dictionary   belonging to the essential nature or constitution of a thing the intrinsic of a star   an intrinsic property of an object is something we know that exists because it is a natural property of that object emit light we know this because we can measure the light coming from it it is not subjective intrinsic value is the opposite of intrinsic

yeah so in other words democracy is a sham because voters are stupid enough that the amount spent on a campaign actually can change voter opinion sufficient to sway elections   the alternative is to end political democracy and replace it with an entirely voluntary funded democracy where you vote with your money this system already exists the arch to politics and its leaders are elected by their ability to provide customers with better value leaders like bill gates sam walton steve jobs warren buffet elon musk tesla brin and larry page google jeff bezos amazon   in political democracy everyone can be forced to fund the choices that only 25 of adults actually supported obama for instance won just 25 of adult votes in most elections it 's similar low of actual support in the economic democracy you buy what you want and that does n't hamper someone else 's ability to buy what they want multiple service providers can exist together all we need to do is privatize and distribute ownership of roads to property owners who have paid for them all of this time privatize schools so kids learn actual skills that others will pay them for private police and let each property owner establish their own rules to be enforced on their own property let others then and avoid those with stupid rules   the move to a completely voluntary society is a worthwhile goal though nothing can possibly end wealth inequality since every time something new is invented the inventor becomes wealthy through voluntary trade at no loss to others

the best ask is the lowest ask and the best bid is the highest bid   if the ask was lower than the bid then they crossed and that would be a crossed market and quickly resolved so the bid will almost always be cheaper than the ask a heuristic is that a bid is the revenue of the stock at any given time while the ask is the cost so the market will only ever offer a profit to itself not to the liquidity seeker if examining the book vertically all orders are usually sorted descending since the best ask is the lowest ask it is on the bottom of the asks and vice versa for the best bid the best bid best ask will be those closest since that 's the spread and price time priority will promise that a bid that crosses the asks will hit the lowest ask the best possible price for the bidder and vice versa for an ask that crosses the best bid

if you only have to pay 23k federal taxes on 100k that means you are in the long term capital gains tax rate which is the lower of the tax rates available first you get your federal income tax marginal tax rate and then find the matching long term capital gains tax rate for example if your marginal federal income tax rate is 28 your capital gains tax rate would be 15 or rather if the amount of the gain would put you in the 28 rate then your long term capital gains tax rate is 15 you can reduce that by having more losses if you have anything else invested anywhere that is taking a loss then you can sell that this year and it will offset the other gains you have realized the only note is that your losses have to be long term capital losses too tax loss harvesting takes this to an extreme where you sell something at a loss to lock in the tax loss but you did n't really want to get rid of that investment so then you buy a nearly identical investment ie if you owned shares of tech sector etf and it was at a loss you would sell that and then immediately buy tech sector etf the competing product that does the exact same thing then there is charity this still requires spending money and you not having it any longer if you feel that a cause can use the money more directly than the us government you can donate an appreciated asset to the charity not report a gain and also take a charitable deduction

because they track an index edited the definition of the word in this case meaning something used or serving to point out a sign token or indication from meaning   3 i presume therefore you are asking what an index is there are many variations of what makes up an index but in short it is a representation of some part of a market an extremely simplistic calculation would be to take a basket of stocks and sum their prices   if one stock moves up a dollar and one moves down a dollar the index has effectively not changed as it is presumed that the loss in one is offset by the gain in the other

i would write them a check or give them cash money there are payment receipt forms available online you can print one of have them fill it out and sign it just google private party receipt   money transfer via bank account or paypal is also an option but in my opinion it 's more convenient to meet up and handle it in person if you want you can have them meet you at a notary public 's office your local bank branch should have one and have the receipt notarized i do n't think it 's a scam but make sure you are paying the right person

looks like you do n't want to participate in the consumerist rush but feel that you just have to do that too first of all you do n't have to do what you do n't want then there 're researches showing that joy from a compulsive purchase only lasts for a short period of time and then you are left with a relatively useless item in your house so it 's one thing if you really wanted that cool full electronic sewing machine or whatever diy item you might want to be able to repair all the stuff and craft all the nice things you wanted but it 's another thing if you look at the item and ca n't decide whether you really need it the latter scenario is you struggling with the consumerism rush if you feel really happy and can save half of what you earn just save the difference it wo n't hurt having a good sum of money saved is really helpful in many scenarios

comparing retirement savings to ordinary investment is not an apples to apples comparison retirement savings are savings for retirement if you want to invest in things now and live off of or reinvest those earnings then retirement accounts are not the right vehicle    that said here are some benefits of the main types of retirement accounts benefits of a 401(k benefits of a ira benefits of a roth 401(k benefits of a roth ira the benefits above are not exhaustive there are other benefits such as using a roth ira for higher ed expenses etc but those are the highlights if you have a plan for how you hope to use the money now rather than later does it make sense to hold onto it if your plan is meant to provide income at retirement and earns returns higher than the returns plus matches and tax benefits you get from retirement accounts then yes it may make more sense but those benefits are generally very hard to beat   plus having the money locked away in an account that is painful to tap can be a good thing you 're less tempted to use that money for foolish decisions which everyone makes at some point

yup it 's totally legit and it is not a money market account though interest rates are so low across the board this is about as high as savings accounts get and so it is called a high yield savings account a number of banks offer these there are different offerings nation wide versus local state i would use this compare tool at to find them and the blog is very good with updates and trends here are some well advertised accounts if you do n't already have a rewards checking account get one of those first will direct you to these as well a reasonable interest rate on rewards checking is 2.5 and up so much better the only catches are reasonable online statements direct deposit or autopay and use your debit card 10 or 12 times a month for any transaction amount groceries coffee gas easy the other major thing i would consider when opening any account is where you live and the current accounts you have if you have an amex card already just use their savings account that way you have unified accounts faster transfers your personal information is n't spread thinly around all different banks you have more leverage with the company as a long standing customer etc as far as using a bank in the state where you live it simplifies taxes two more things i would always choose a credit union over a bank and many have excellent rewards checking accounts if you use mint yodlee or other financial software make sure the potential new bank with that service

first let me mention that the reasons mentioned this far for renting are excellent ones but i disagree second i would like to mention that i 'm just a regular joe not an accountant or a realtor that said i was in a similar situation not that long ago i ended up renting but i wish i had n't you should check out the offers in your area you seem like you 're willing to compromise on a more standard or older home if that is the case and you are willing to settle for an older town home or something similar it might be in your best interest to do so   in my area for instance the urban areas are becoming a bit crowded this is good news for the people who already own homes in those urban areas but bad news for people who are looking to rent an apartment which tend to be located in urban areas or buy a house in these urban areas the reason i say that is simple there is only one thing there will never be more of land if people are moving into these areas and there is limited room to build structures the demand is going up while the supply is unable to keep up this means an increase in prices but this can also be used to your advantage   as the demand for those urban areas goes up the rural areas around the urban areas are likely to be subsidized for instance near me if you 're willing to be 20 minutes from the nearest walmart and you have a 550 + credit score and a stable income you 're able to acquire a government subsidized loan with 0 down i would recommend dropping at least something however if possible apartments of the size your family is going to require are going to be expensive people who own apartment buildings are looking to make the most money per square foot this means most apartment complexes are going to be filled with 1 2 bedroom apartments but have very few if any 3 + bedroom apartments again this is my general experience but it may be different where you 're living   i suspect the apartment your family is going to need is going to end up being very expensive especially if people are moving into your town you might consider trying to get a lower quality house as to a rare and large apartment for a few pretty obvious reasons do n't misunderstand me though a lot of people get with the idea of being a home owner and end up getting into something they will never be able to maintain and if that happens it 's something that 's going to follow you for the rest of your life   as for your student loans if you need to and you qualify you can apply for hardship this would mean that you do n't have to pay anything or pay a reduced rate for some arbitrary approved amount of time or until some arbitrary circumstance is met however do not take this lightly while doing this might not necessarily accrue interest depending on whether or not your loans were subsidized or unsubsidized and a host of other factors it might actually halt interest these loans will follow you even into bankruptcy meaning if you get your student loans postponed and end up losing the house anyway you have to make a fresh start with a bankruptcy and student loans on your back   furthermore you ca n't count your chickens before they and neither will the banks a big part of qualifying for a loan is your proof of income if you have n't had that steady job for 6 months to a year or more you 're going to have a tough time getting a loan suppose your wife to be does start making that income it 's still not going to make a difference to the banks until they can say that it 's not just a month long   last after reading all this i want to tell you that i am bias i happened to miss the opportunity i 'm explaining to you now and that affects what i think you should do in this situation weigh the options carefully and objectively talk to your fiance talk to your friends parents anyone who is close with you come to an educated decision rather than the decision that might be more exciting or the one you wish you could take   good luck

so far we have a case for yes and no   i believe the correct answer is maybe you mention that most of your expenses are in dollars which is definitely correct but there is an important complication that i will try to simplify greatly here   many of the goods you buy are priced on the international market a good example is oil or are made from combinations of these goods   when the dollar is strong the price of oil is low but when the dollar is weak the price of oil is high however when you buy stuff like services think a back massage then you pay the person in dollars and the person you are paying just wants dollars so the strength of the dollar does n't really matter most people 's expenses are a mix of things that are priced internationally and locally with a bias toward local expenses   if they also have a mix of investments some of which are international and depend on the strength of the dollar and some are domestic and do not then they do n't have to worry much about the strength weakness of the dollar later when they sell their investments and buy what they want   if the dollar is weak than the international goods will be more expensive but at the same time international part of their portfolio will be worth more if you plan on retiring in a different country or have 100 of your investments in emerging market stocks than it is worth thinking about either currency hedging or changing your investment mix   however for many people a good mix of domestic and international investments covers much of the risk that their currency will weaken while offering the benefits of diversification   the best part is you do n't need to guess if the dollar will get stronger or weaker tl;dr if you want your portfolio to not depend on currency moves then hedge   if you want your retirement to not depend on currency moves then have a good mix of local and unhedged international investments

the advice above is generally good but the one catch i have n't seen addressed is which specific laws apply   you said that you are in arkansas but the dealer is in texas   this means that the laws of at least two different states are in play possibly three if the contract contains a clause stating that disputes will be handled in a certain jurisdiction and you are going to have to do some research to figure out what actually applies    one thing that may significantly impact this issue is whether you were in tx or ar when you signed the contracts   if you borrowed the money in tx and the lender is in tx then it is almost certain that the laws of texas will govern   however if you were living in ar at the time you acquired the loan particularly if you were in ar when you signed the papers you have a decent case for claiming that the laws of arkansas govern   i do n't know enough about either state to know if one is more favorable to the consumer than the other but it is a question you really want to have answered   that said i would be shocked if any state did not have provisions requiring the lender to provide a copy of the terms and a detailed statement of the account and transaction history upon request   spend some time on the web site of the texas attorney general and/or because that is where the lender is they are more likely to respect texas law to see if you can track down any specific laws or codes that you can reference   you might also look into the federal consumer protection laws though i ca n't think of one off hand that would apply in the scenario you have described    then work on putting together a letter asking them to provide a copy of the contract and a full history of the account   as others noted make sure you send it certified return receipt or better yet use a private carrier such as fedex and check the box about requiring a signature above all you need to get the dialog transferred to a written form   i can not stress this point enough   everything you tell them or ask for from here out needs to be done in a written format   if they call you about anything tell them you want to see their issue offer in writing before you will consider it you do not necessarily need a lawyer to do any of this but you do need to know the applicable laws   do the research to know what your legal standing is   involve a lawyer if you feel you need to but i have successfully several large utility companies and collection agencies into behaving without needing one

the moment that you start to rent your car to strangers you are talking about using your car as a business will it be financially advantageous if you can convince somebody to rent your vehicle for more than your required monthly payments then it might be of course you have to determine what would be the true cost of ownership for you it could include your auto loan and insurance but you would be saving on the garage costs of course if you do n't have it rented 100 of the time you will still have some costs your insurance company will need to know about your plan they charge based on the risk if you are n't honest about the situation they wo n't cover you if something goes wrong the local government may want to know they charge different car registration fees for businesses if there are business taxes they will want that   taxes you are running a business so everybody from the federal to the local government may want a cut plus you will have to depreciate the value of the item turning the item from a personal use item to a business item can have tax issues if you do n't own it 100 the lender may also have concerns about making sure their collateral survives is it safe and from the comments to the question   should i do a contract or something that would protect me nope it is n't safe unless you do have a contract of course that contract will have to be drawn up by a lawyer to make sure it protects you from theft negligence breach of contract you will have to be able to not just charge rent but be able to repossess the car if they do n't return it on time you will have to be able to evaluate if the renter is trustworthy or you may find your car is in far worse shape if you can even get it back

the interesting thing about an fsa is that you have access to your total annual election immediately   after electing to put $ 200 per month toward your fsa you can go have a $ 1,500 surgery on january 3rd and pay with your fsa funds   then you can leave the company on february 1st and not owe the company anything i understand that you do n't like that this is the answer but it is   the employer is on the hook for the full elected liability of an fsa plan as of the first day of the plan year   the employer is also paying admin costs that are n't passed to the employees   you contest that this arrangement could leave current employees picking up the bag for employees but there is no employee liability   fsa plans run at a net cost the the employer i 'm sure there are outlier exceptions however i disagree with your premise that   employees generally dislike that fsa plans are use it or lose it and also that there appears to be an obvious alternative that would be preferable the employees that dislike the rules of fsa accounts do n't fully understand the nuances and surely assume that fsa is a synonym for hsa   tons of employers offer their employees fsa plans and they are very well received   you can fill full prescriptions off of a debit card on the third day of the year before you 've even contributed anything hsas are great i have one but they require enrollment in a hdhp and you can only spend the funds currently available in your account   these are two huge limitations addressed by fsa plans   you can have a $ 0 deductible platinum plan with a $ 2,000 out of pocket max and an fsa debit card for virtually tax free healthcare   the caveat being if you do n't use your full fsa election you give it up in fact my biggest gripe with the fsa hsa discussion is that anyone feels the need to claim that hsa funds do n't expire at the end of a plan year as though it 's something other than a personal savings account   an fsa is a spending account or arrangement which is an entirely different animal   it would be like claiming that ira funds do n't expire as though they might somehow

first thing to do when you notice a credit card fraud is to call the respective banks who issues the credit card and most banks immediately as far as my experience goes twice they will cancel the credit card and issue a new card with different number your credit card account will remain the same no effect on credit score as the account is still active its just the credit card number is changed if you are more concerned about identity theft there are two further options you can pursue place a fraud alert ask 1 of the 3 credit reporting companies to put    a fraud alert on your credit report they must tell the other 2    companies an initial fraud alert can make it harder for an identity    thief to open more accounts in your name the alert lasts 90 days but    you can renew it as per federal trade commission credit freeze if you ’re concerned about identity theft those reported mega data breaches or someone gaining access to your credit    report without your permission you might consider placing a credit    freeze on your report as per federal trade commission

no money is gone   the movement of the existing currency has slowed down   currency moves through the economy through deposits or loans to banks and withdrawal from banks as proceeds from loans or return of deposits   when a bank makes a loan they provide a balance in a bank account which is n't converted to hard currency until withdrawn   so those bank loans essentially count as currency and thus effectively multiply the stock of currency available   deposits into money market funds and those funds loans into the commercial paper markets have the same effect   banks and money funds are now making fewer loans   in particular they are not funding companies that invested in securitizations of home mortgages and credit card receivables but they are also lending less to businesses and consumers   because they are lending less they are effectively multiplying the currency less    think of deposited and lent currency as spare cycles on a desktop computer   you let your computer help decipher the genome when you are n't using it yourself   if you somehow feared that you would lose those cycles slowing down your own computing you would be less likely to lend those cycles out   there would still be the same number of computing cycles in the world but the stock of those available for actual computing would appear to be diminished   the technical term for this concept is monetary velocity and it is a crucial factor in the level of overall economic activity banking stability and inflation

yes you can do that and it it wise to do so however you should make sure that the general trend of the stock is upwards and you buy during a in the uptrend so basically if the stock is making higher highs and higher lows on the daily or weekly charts then you would want to buy around one of the higher lows before the ex dividend date if the stock is making lower lows and lower highs then it is in a downtrend so never buy in this instance it is better to miss out on a dividend of $ 1 rather than to buy just for this $ 1 dividend and lose $ 5 or more when the price continues to drop further

i gather from your mention of stamp duty that you 're in britain   i 'm only familiar with us cards but for them i ca n't see that there is any reason other than a lack of self discipline not to use a credit card wherever possible especially these days 1 there are plenty of cards with no annual fee 2 you get anywhere from 1 5 discount cash back on purchases 3 many will give you sign up bonuses and a year or more of zero interest   so you put that money in your investment account and odds are you make a profit on it 4 even after the introductory 0 interest period you get on average about a month of 0 interest between purchase and due date during which period the money can be earning interest for you i 've made a good many thousands of dollars over the years doing this   again the only drawback i can see is that you may not have the self discipline to pay off the accounts before they start charging interest

of course there are many reasons why we want robots to do work currently done by humans dangerous jobs physically difficult jobs undesirable jobs e.g. cleaning etc   but also jobs that people like to do but robots will be cheaper painting walls some yard work loading unloading freight etc   no matter how you look it the sole purpose of robots is to replace humans and their jobs   gt i could argue that the new jobs being created likely as equipment operators is a higher skill job than sorting shelves and will likely pay more   do you think a robot can not operate equipment    and if less jobs are available for humans so more unemployed do you think they will get paid more

if you want a concrete investment tip precious metals e.g. gold silver are on a pretty good run these days personally i still think they have ways to go as there are just too many problems with modern monetary policy of an almost existential nature and gold and silver are better stores of value than fiat money silver is particularly hot right now but keep in mind that the increased volatility means increased risk if the fed keeps its foot on the of the dollar printing press and we get qe3 this summer that will most likely mean more people piling into the pms to hedge against inflation if the fed starts to tighten it 's policy then that 's probably bad news for both equities and bonds and so pms could be seen as a safe haven investment these are the main reasons why pms take up a good portion of my portfolio and will continue to do so i see how the global economy plays out over the next couple of years

i am a bit at a loss as to how you can read the same book that inspired warren buffet and take away that trading 600 contracts per month is a way to prosperity   as a fellow engineer i can say with assurance this speculation scheme is doomed to failure   crossing out the word gamble was a mistake    instead you should focus on two things   the first is your core business which is signal processing   work and strive to be the best you can   seek out opportunities to increase your income while keeping your costs low   as an engineer you have an opportunity to earn an above average salary with very low costs second would be to warehouse some of those earning and let others who are good at other things work for you   you may want to read the jack bogle books and seek an asset allocation model   i tend to be more aggressive then he would suggest but that is a matter of preference     you do n't really have the time when you focus on your core business to manage 6 trades a month let alone 600   put your contributions on auto pilot and a surprisingly short time you will have a pile of cash

offset against taxable gains means that the amount $ 25 million in this case can be used to reduce another sum that the company would otherwise have to pay tax on suppose the company had made a profit of $ 100 million on some other investments at some point they are likely to have to pay corporation tax on that amount before being able to distribute it as a cash dividend to shareholders however if they can offset the $ 25 million then they will only have to pay tax on $ 75 million this is quite normal as you usually only pay tax on the aggregate of your gains and losses if corporation tax is about 32 that would explain the claimed saving of approximately $ 8 million it sounds like the plaintiffs want the stock to be sold on the market to get that tax saving presumably they believe that distributing it directly would not have the same effect because of the way the tax rules work i do n't know if the plaintiffs are right or not but if they are the difference would probably come about due to the stock being treated as a realized loss in the case where they sell it but not in the case where they distribute it it 's also possible though this is all very speculative that if the loss is n't realised when they distribute it directly then the cost basis of the shareholders would be the price the company originally paid for the stock rather than the value at the time they receive it that in turn could mean a tax advantage for the shareholders

i think you 're talking about two types of machines at least in the united states the term change   machine usually refers to a machine that accepts large denominations of currency and returns an equal amount of currency in smaller bills or coins typically these machines are used to provide coins in exchange for paper currency in which case they are also often known as bill exactly what bills or coins these machines return depends on the machine read the instructions on the machine to get the details they 're usually right on the machine for example my apartment building has a machine that converts small bills like ones and to quarters since the laundry machines only took quarters the other type of machine are coin cashing machines like the coinstar machines you might see at a grocery store many banks used to have these machines as well although in my area they 're few and far between now these machines perform the opposite function of the traditional change machine and convert smaller denominations mostly coins into bill form for example if you dump all your accumulated pennies into the machine it will probably give you bills and larger coins like quarters dimes nickels in exchange after subtracting a small fee i 've heard that now some of these machines may give you a gift card of some kind instead of bills although they 'll still subtract a fee from your original amount usually once again just read the instructions and they should tell you when my bank had one of these machines they did n't charge a fee as long as you were a customer at the bank i 'm sure that varies from place to place and bank to bank though wikipedia 's article has this to say see the article for references in some sections of the u.s. regional banks have begun offering free coin counting services in the amount of a gift card refunds are often given in cash rather than in the form of a gift card in some cases it is not even necessary for the customer to have an account at the bank the free service is offered as a way to attract new business from individuals who are not current account holders td bank 's penny arcade coin counters were free and available to both customers and non customers in many branches but as of november 2010 the bank charges a 6 fee for non customers to use the machine

dollar cost averaging can be done in a retirement plan and can be done for individual stock purchases as this will increase your returns by reducing your risk especially if you are buying a particular stock for the first time    how many time have i purchased a stock bottom fishing thinking i was buying at the low only to find out there was a new low   sitting with a thousand shares that are now down $   i have a choice to sell at a loss hold what i 've got or double down   i usually add more shares if i 'm thinking i 'll recover but at that time i 'd wished i 'd eased into my investment   that way i would have owned more shares at a smaller cost basis    anything can happen in the market not knowing whether the price will increase or decrease   in the example above a $ 3,000 loss is equal to the brokerage cost of about 300 trades so trading cost should not be a factor   now i 'm not saying to slowly get into the market and miss the bull like we 're having today with trump but get into individual stocks slowly being fully invested in the market    also dca means you do not buy equal number of shares per period say monthly but that you buy with the same amount of money a different number of shares reducing your total costs   let 's say you spend $ 2000 on a stock trading at $ 10 200 shares if the stock rose to $ 20 you would spend $ 2000 and buy 100 shares and if the stock dropped to $ 5 you would spend $ 2000 and buy 400 shares by now having amassed 700 shares for $ 6,000   on the other hand and in contrast to dca had you purchased 200 shares for $ 2000 at $ 10/share then 200 shares for $ 4000 at $ 20/share and finally 200 more shares for $ 1000 at $ 5/share you would have amassed only 600 shares for $ 7000 investment

i think you came up with a worthy masters phd research project it is a great question this is in australia so it is difficult for me to have complete perspective   however i can speak about the us of a. to your first point relatively few people inherit their wealth   according to a brief web search about 38 of billionaires and 20 of millionaires inherited their wealth   the rest are self made again in the us income mobility is very common   some act like high level earners are just born that way but studies have shown that a great deal of income mobility exists   i personally know people that have grown up without indoor plumbing and extremely poor but now earn in the top 5 of wage earners    quid 's points are valid   for example a starbucks new i phone and a brake job on your car are somewhat catastrophic if your income is 50k year hurts if your income is 100 k and an inconvenience if you make 250k year   these situations are normal and happen regularly   the first person may have to take a pay day loan to pay for these items the second credit card interest the third probably has the money in the bank   all of this the effect of an emergency on one 's net worth     to me there is also a chicken and egg effect in wealth building and income   how does one build wealth   by investing wisely planning ahead budgeting delaying gratification finding opportunities etc   now if you take those same skills to your workplace is n't it likely you will receive more responsibility promotions and raises   i believe so   and this too the effect on one 's net worth   if investing helps you to earn more then you will have more to invest to me one of the untold stories of this graph is not just investing but first building a stable financial base   having a sufficient emergency fund having enough and the right kind of insurance keeping loans to a minimum   without doing those things first investments might need to be withdrawn often at an inopportune time for emergency purposes thanks for asking this

i think you need to realize that regardless of whether they are shady or not owners founders are by and large in it for themselves you as an employee as just a resource why should they divulge their finances to you you wo n't offend them if you and ask for it but they simply are not going to give you the straight up they will give you a bare minimum or some song and dance that beats around the bush without actually telling you what you need to know in regards to whether you should buy the restricted shares why not startups are a gamble anyway so simply decide how much you 're willing to gamble and spend that much buying some shares i mean you 're already taking the gamble by accepting a lower salary in exchange for equity which in all likelihood will never be worth anything anyway

yeah pretty much that 's really par for the course among underemployed twenty somethings in new york to be fair i 've also lived in cost inflated areas my whole life so i 'm used to it and know how to work around it even so with that 18k i 'm able to support a decent single habit    the only thing i may have a little is that i do a some freelance photography on the side and i use money from that to buy myself a new pair of   red wing boots and some nice raw jeans every year or so which i guess would make my income more like an even $ 20,000 sure i wish i made more so i could have some savings and a little security and i 'm certainly not saying i want to live like this when i 'm 35 but i do alright    point is people forget that this city is full of poor people and it would n't exist if they could n't survive doing menial jobs for minimum wage my neighborhood is full of rican single parents flipping burgers for less than i make an hour pulling down maybe thirty grand a year to a lot of people i know a $ 60,000 year would be a fortune there 's a huge difference between doing alright and this privileged idea of getting by most people raised in the upper middle class cling to

legally speaking when you convert that bit coin onto something else the israeli tax authority will look into the value of that something else compare it to the original value of the previous something else you used to buy bit coins usd in your example and charge you capital gain taxes for the difference according to the israeli law you 're supposed to pay taxes when selling converting the bit coin to something else and since you 're not using any formal bank or stock broker which will automatically deduct the taxes you have to pay the taxes yourself by not doing so you 're committing a tax fraud the real question you 're asking is whether they 'll come after you well that depends on the amounts they might pay attention there 's no statute of limitation for tax fraud in israel they may come after you in 50 years from now another thing to keep in mind if you used bit coins to buy something services or products of any kind you probably did n't pay the vat which is another case of tax fraud on your behalf ps i 'm not a lawyer or accountant so get a professional advice but i have been dealing with the tax authority in israel so i 've got a pretty good idea of what the rules are

the question mentions a trailing stop a trailing stop is a type of stop loss order it allows you to protect your profit on the stock while keeping you in the stock a trailing stop is specified as a percentage of market price e.g. you might want to set a trailing stop at 5 or 10 below the market price a trailing stop goes up along with the market price but if the market price drops it does n't move down too the idea is that it is there to catch your profit if the market suddenly moves quickly against you there is a nice explanation of how that works in the section titled trailing stops here the url for the page stops is misleading and a typo i suspect

hsa accounts come with various rules intended to ensure that the pre tax money you have opted to put into your hsa account is indeed used for appropriate purposes most employers do n't handle these accounts in house but contract with a company or bank who offers to take care of the details and the necessary accounting the money is simply sent to the bank and it is the bank that is responsible for ensuring that the money is indeed used appropriately now if you say that you want wells fargo to pick another bank as an example to handle your hsa account the   employer will likely need to have a   contract with wells fargo too and wells fargo will charge you fees to handle   the account also   whether you will be any happier with wells fargo 's fees for a one off hsa account versus chase 's fees where a smaller bulk rate might be charged is something that you should find out before approaching your employer with a request to have wells fargo handle your hsa account

some 401k plans allow you to make supplemental post tax contributions basically once you hit the pre tax contribution limit in 2014 you are then allowed to contribute funds on a post tax basis because of this timing they are sometimes called spillover contributions usually this option is advertised as a way of continuing to get company match even if you accidentally hit the pre tax limit   but if you actually pay attention to your finances it is instead a handy way to put away additional tax advantaged money   that said you would only want to use this option if you already maxed out your pre tax and roth options since you do n't get the traditional tax break on contributions or the roth tax break on the earnings however when you leave the company you can transfer the post tax money directly into a roth ira when you transfer the pre tax money match and earnings into a traditional ira

welcome to the what should otherwise be a simple choice turns into a huge analysis debate if the choice were actually simple we 've have one golden answer here and close others as duplicate but new questions continue to bring up different scenarios that impact the choice   4 years ago i wrote an article in which i discussed the density of your ira in that article i acknowledge that with no other tax favored savings you can pack more value into the roth   in hindsight i failed to add some key points first let 's go back to what i 'd describe as my main thesis a retired couple hits the top of the 15 bracket with an income of    $ i include just the standard deduction and exemptions the    tax on this gross sum is $ for an average rate of the tax paid or avoided upon deposit is one 's marginal rate but    at retirement the withdrawals first go through the zero bracket i.e.    the std deduction and exemptions then 10 then 15 the above is the simplest snapshot i am retired and our return this year included sch a itemized deductions property tax interest insurance donations added up fast and from a gross income ira withdrawal well into the 25 bracket the effective average rate was reported as 7.3 if we had saved in roth accounts it would have been subject to 25   i 'd suggest that it 's this phenomenon the save at marginal 25 but withdraw at average effect that account for much of the resulting tax savings that the ira provides   the way you are asking this you 've been focusing on one aspect i believe the density issue that assumes the investor has no 401(k option if i were building a spreadsheet to address this i 'd be sure to consider the fact that in a taxable account long term gains are taxed at 15 for higher earners i take the liberty to ignore   that wealthier taxpayers will pay a maximum 20 tax on long term capital gains this higher rate applies when your adjusted gross income falls into the top 39.6 tax bracket and those in the 10 or 15 bracket pay 0 with median household income at $ 56 k in 2016 and the 15 bracket top at $ 76 k this suggests that most people gov data shows $ 75 k is percentile have an effective unlimited roth so long as they invest in a way that avoids short term gains they can rebalance often enough to realize lt gains and pay zero tax   it 's likely the $ earner does have access to a 401(k or other higher deposit account if they do n't i 'd still favor pretax iras with $ 11 k for the couple still 10 or so of their earnings it would be a shame to lose that zero bracket of that first $ 20 k withdrawal at retirement again working backwards the $ 78 k withdrawal would take nearly $ 2 m in pretax savings to generate all in today 's dollars

a lot of people in this thread have provided excellent information from a public company 's perspective with respect to wacc etc but i 'll chime in from a private company 's perspective specifically a tech start up   two reasons a private company would prefer to receive financing in the form of debt as opposed to equity   1 it ca n't sell equity at a good valuation or at all in this case the company may have no choice but to raise debt financing using assets as collateral and also diverting future cash flows away from growth initiatives for the sake of servicing the debt this is obviously a bad situation for the company also because debt is senior to equity in the case of a bankruptcy owners would only be able to recover money from the sale of the company liquidation after debt owners have been paid   2 the company 's owners do n't want to further dilute their ownership stakes and are willing to have the company pay interest to avoid it sometimes private company owners will take on debt with the purpose of buying out other owners in some other cases the company 's management thinks equity in their company will increase in value disproportionately to what investors might give it credit for in these cases the math is simple projected valuation growth versus the valuation financing is available at taking into account the interest paid on the debt

several things to consider i do n't see why your friend should pay any tax it 's not his income at all and i am not sure where your income should be taxed in this scenario is he declaring it as his income somehow the bank wo n't do it for him the transfer as such should be transparent on the other hand money on his account could in principle look suspicious although € 300 is unlikely to raise alarm what i do know is that if you do pay taxes 20 is not particularly high as such there are four brackets of income tax and tax like contributions to the pension system in the netherlands between and 52 rates for personal taxes in the netherlands are simply way higher than what you might be used to in eastern europe or what has been mentioned in comments   in fact if anything 20 seems too low i am at a loss guessing what it could correspond to you could ask your friend how he came to that number there various tax discounts and deductions that apply to freelance work and some that apply to all incomes € 3000 yearly is quite low and would probably not be taxed at all if you were recently registered as freelance in the netherlands and had no other sources of income but on the other hand if your money is treated as being part of your friend 's income these would n't apply as he is probably already benefiting from them there are special rules for copyright fees not sure this is necessarily 100 kosher but i have met people who got paid that way for articles they wrote in trade publications

at this time there is one advantage of having a 30 year loan right now over a 15 year loan   the down side is you will be paying 1 higher interest rate so the question is can you beat 1 on the money you save every month so lets say instead of going with 15 year mortgage i get a 30 and put the $ 200 monthly difference in lets say the dia fund   will i make more on that money than the interest i am losing   my answer is probably yes   plus lets factor in inflation   if we have any high inflation for a few years in the middle of that 30 not only with the true value of what you owe go down but the interest you can make in the bank could be higher than the 4 you are paying for your 30 year loan    just a risk reward thing i think more people should consider

is this an employee stock purchase plan espp if so and there is no required holding period selling right away is essentially a guaranteed bonus with minimal risk one caveat is that sometimes it takes a while to actually receive the shares at your brokerage and in the meantime your company may have an earnings report that could cause the share price to drop if your discount is only 5 for example a bad earnings report could easily wipe that out the only other cons i can think of is espp contributions being withheld from you for months albeit for a virtually guaranteed return and it complicates your taxes a bit on the flip side another pro is that after you sell the shares you are more likely to invest that money rather than spend it

as i understand it us federal gift tax does n't kick in at all until one person gives more than about $ 14,000 in a single year so a couple can give someone $ 28,000 if you want to give more than that in a lump sum while avoiding gift tax one workaround is to structure it as an intra family loan basically you write and formally register a loan for the amount then gift them with up to the limit for them to pay off that loan the irs requires that you charge interest on this loan but the rates are pretty minimal and of course you can incorporate that in the gift the downside is that the interest income you 're required to take is taxable but that 's a small sum on the other hand if the loan is a mortgage against real property and properly filed as such the interest paid may be deductable for the person you 're giving the money to doing this properly requires a tax accountant or lawyer who has a clue about the right legalese to make it work however there are starting to be some services which specialize in this doing it for a fixed fee i used one of those recently which is why i 'm somewhat familiar with this process they made it about as much of a fill out the forms process as they could but it still took a few weeks for me to figure out which options were best for my needs

typically you can only claim as business deductions those expenses which strictly relate to your business in some cases if you have a dedicated home office in your house you can specify that expenses related to this space furniture etc are business expenses because it is a dedicated space for example i know of someone in sports broadcasting who claimed several tvs as a business expense but these are for a room in his house that he uses only for watching games related to his work responsibilities and never for entertaining having friends over etc i think it will be difficult for you to count any portion of this type of installation as a business expense as it would relate to both your business as well as your residence if you intend to try to get this deducted i would strongly recommend consulting a cpa or tax attorney first i think it will be difficult to prove that the only benefit is to your llc if your electricity bills credits are co with those for your residence best of luck

on my recent visit to the bank i was told that money coming into the nre account can only be foreign currency and for nro accounts the money can come in local currency but has to be a valid source of income e.g. rent or investments in india yes this is correct as per regulation in india now if we use 3rd party remittances like or transferwise etc they usually covert the foreign currency into local currency like inr and then deposit it the remittance services are better suited for transferring funds to normal savings accounts of your loved ones most remittance services would transfer funds using a domestic clearing network and hence the trace that funds originated outside of india is lost there could be some generic remittance that may have direct tie up with some banks to do direct transfers how can we achieve this in either nre nro accounts if not what are the other options you can do a wire transfer swift from us to indian nre account you can also use the remittance services if available from banks where you hold nre account for example from hdfc for an nre account in hdfc or from icici for an nre account in icici or from sbi etc these would preserve the history that funds originated from outside india similarly you can also deposit a foreign currency check into indian bank account the funds would take around month or so to get credited all other funds can be deposited in nro account

i 'm from canada so your going to have to take that into account when reading this as things are done a little differently here     i would n't go the accounting route as it 's going to require more education on top of this i d there is a program that focuses more on the management of finances that would be ideal there are many mid to entry level positions that deal with the flow of cash throughout the company from there you work your ass off and see where it can get you sometimes they go as far as hiring someone with no experience but a certificate and a some educational knowledge will go a long ways in helping you    you probably could if you went to the right sources gain similar knowledge by learning things yourself but it wo n't look nearly as appealing to potential employers hope this helps    also it blows my mind the difference in cost of tuition i spent 12k over 3 finished those kids in montreal have no idea how good they have it

this is opinion no right or wrong two schools of thought one saying you should aim to be debt free asap the other suggests that when your borrowing expense is so much lower than expected market return just keep investing   with your mortgage a variable i trust the payment is recalculated so if you pay down half the loan it will drop to half when the rate changes and new payment calculated right if not you still have a high payment due until it 's paid in full   me i like the flexibility of going with the full term and saving the money as long as rates are low even moderate inflation will make that payment fell like less over time and there are funds whose dividends are above the mortgage rate if when rates rise you can always pay down aggressively i 'm concerned that you do n't have a good sense of your saving goals you have less than a years income saved for the long term to replace 80 of your income you need about 20 times your current income or $ of course you get to subtract pension income or whatever canada 's social security system is forgive my ignorance on this

here is the way i would estimate your taxes   remember that a bi weekly paycheck means that you get 26 paychecks per year if the $ 1000 federal refund is too much for you you can decrease your withholding to bring your refund down   this can be done by increasing your exemptions claimed on your w-4   see how can i adjust tax withholding so that i do n't get a large tax refund for more details however keep in mind that your state withholding is perfect right now and if you increase your exemptions you will likely owe tax to the state unless you increase your state withholding at the same time

ben already covered most of this in his answer but i want to emphasize the most important part of getting a loan with limited credit history go into a credit union or community bank and talk to the loan officer there in person ask for recommendations on how much they would lend based on your income to get the best interest rate that they can offer sometimes shortening the length of the loan will get you a lower rate sometimes it wo n't in any case make sure you can pay it off quickly no matter the term that you sign with   each bank may have different policies talk to at least two of them even if the first one offers you terms that you like talking to a loan officer is valuable life experience and if you discuss your goals directly with them then they will be able to give you feedback about whether they think a small loan is worth their time

there are classes of traders who close their positions out every evening not just on fridays   but their are other types of businesses who trade shortly before or nearly right at market close with both buys and sells   there are lots of theories as to how the market behaves at various times of day days of the week months of the year   there are some few patterns that can emerge but in general they do n't provide a lot of lift above pure random chance enough so that if you bet on one of these your chances of being wrong are only very slightly different from being right enough so that it 's not really fair to call any of them a sure thing   and since these events are often fairly widely spaced it 's difficult to play them often enough to get the law of large numbers on your side as opposed to say card counting at a blackjack table which basically makes betting on them not much different from gambling

with the information you have given i would say never remember the banker is a salesman and the line of credit is the product if you do n't need to borrow the money for something specific then you do n't need the line of credit in the first place even if you did need something i would tell you to save up and pay cash for it on the tax advantage there is none in the us you can deduct your mortgage interest on your taxes but it 's not a tax credit it 's a tax deductions let me explain further you spend $ 10,000 on mortgage interest and you 're in the 25 tax bracket you send the bank $ 10,000 in return you get at tax savings of $ 2500 you are still in the hole $ 7500 you would have been better off not taking out the loan in the first place on the emergency fund you should have 3 6 months of expenses in cash like a money market account   this money is n't for investing it 's like insurance and you do n't make money on insurance the last thing you want to do is have to go into debt right in the middle of an emergency say you lost your job the last thing you would want to do is borrow money right at the time you have no income to pay it back the bank is under no obligation to maintain you credit limit and can without notice reduce it they can in most cases call the loan balance due in full with little or no notice as well both of those are likely scenarios if the bank were to become aware of the fact that you were unemployed

ben miller 's answer is very thorough and i up voted it i believe that the ability to rebalance without tax implications is very import but there are two aspects of the question that were not covered the 401 k in many cases comes with a company match putting enough money into the fund each year to maximize the match give you free money that is not available in the non retirement accounts the presence of that match is to encourage employees to contribute even if they are tying up their funds until retirement age and they are into a plan with only a handful of investment options and they may have higher expenses in the 401k. the question also had a concern about the annual limits for the 401 k 18,000 and the ira 5,500 the use of a retirement account does n't in any way limit your ability to invest in non retirement accounts you can choose to invest from 0 to 23,500 in the retirement accounts and from 0 to unlimited into the non retirement accounts double those amounts if you are married

banks can not just borrow from the federal reserve and use that money to make loans the first thing you need to understand is how fractional reserve banking works the banks can make loans with money that their customers have deposited in their accounts the interest and fees from those loans go to pay the salaries of those working at the banks with leftover profit to pay dividends interest on your bank accounts   the only reason that the federal reserve allows overnight lending is so that banks do n't immediately become insolvent if they have larger than usual withdrawals by their depositors the federal reserve keeps an eye on the balance sheets of the banks that are doing the borrowing and if they did n't have assets in the form of deposits they would force the banks to sell the loans that were made from those deposits what does this have to do with personal finance i think this question is only marginally on topic here this amount of money in circulation is affected specifically by the fraction of the money that can be used for making other loans but the bigger influence is the rate that the federal reserve charges for overnight lending they raise and lower the rates which affects the rates that the banks can lend at while remaining profitable

many a time even if the tax is deducted and paid by the company it does not reflect as a credit against your pan for various reasons like you not submitting it to your employer in time errors of reconciliation etc its advisable that you inform your company finance officer that you have received such a letter q1 the sure shot way of knowing that your company is depositing tax with government is to view your tax credit report this was set up in 2004 and gives the details of all credits against your pan and the tax deducted against your pan it shows if the tax was tds and which employer paid it or if this was a self assessment or etc   to view this report there are 2 options   register directly at   follow the one time registration process and keep viewing the tax credits note it normally takes 2 3 months to reflect the data   the other alternative is that quite a few leading banks citi sbi etc provide a direct access to this report from their internet banking frontend provided your pan is associated to your account q2 the only details you need to submit are the form 16 this would have all the details of when the tax was paid and the number required for reconciling q3 tds is the liability of the employer however if this has not been deducted or too little was deducted based on incorrect incomplete information give by you then its your liability for example if you change jobs in a year the tax deducted is always less and you have to pay the difference q4 if its established that the company was at fault for not deducting the tax or deducting and not paying it to government on time there are enough provisions to penalize the company including putting the top management team behind bars

the reason for these low interests is that the japanese central bank is giving away money at negative interests to banks yes negative so short of opening your own bank you 'll have to either choose less liquid investments or more risky ones get japanese government bonds not a great interest band not that liquid but for a 5 years bond you 'll do better than the bank can get japanese corporate bonds still not great and a bit more risky it 's better than nothing get a japanese mutual fund i ca n't recommend any though buy japanese stock many japanese stock have interesting kickbacks for example if you buy enough stock of book off you 'll get some free books every month it 's risky though because i believe the next nikkei index crash is imminent

yes and no   yes because realism dictates that all humans are naturally independent and pragmatically whatever works works ergo most rules are going to be broken ergo the fewer the better    but at the same time no because in many ways social creatures among whom humans especially civilized aka technology using humans are certainly one if not the most socially interactive and interdependent and all societies have social rules which while they are going to be broken will be largely to the benefit of the majority   but neither the the libertarian dogma like all other utopian ideals including the socialistic egalitarian dogma are realistic nor pragmatic they simply do n't work   now that does n't mean you might not see an occasional post from me in some libertarian thread but it probably wo n't be of the type that you are used to seeing like this one for r libertarian comments because i am capable of and looking at things from multiple perspectives including the libertarian mindset as well as the socialist ones etc     edit btw i noticed a couple of your posts in this little sequence had been downvoted to zero not only was that not me i have upvoted you hopefully taking them back to + 1 because this is a nice civil conversation and i am enjoying the back and forth regardless of whether we continue to disagree

i agree that best is subjective and will not give investment advice however the tax deductible part can be dealt with quite swiftly if you need tax deductibility right now at the expense of later put it into an rsp account if you do n't need tax deductibility right now put it into a tfsa assuming you have room in either of these vehicles i would suggest using just an rsp or tfsa cash savings account for now at ing direct three reasons you get the immediate benefit of having put it somewhere and in the case of the rsp an immediate tax deductibility you do n't have to worry about rushing into a specific investment and can give yourself time to figure out your goals and portfolio composition read about the couch potato portfolio for a starting point you can transfer your money from them for free and still keep it registered in whichever plan it is in the last point is the most important for my suggestion the ability to quickly park the cash in a registered account and to move it for free using the appropriate form at a later date most places have a sneaky transfer out fee ing may not be the only place that does n't but i have n't looked into many other places about this you might find something else that works the same way and please do n't ever use gic and high return in the same sentence

um no   easy google what makes stock prices go up      gt;this is how it works with stocks supply is the amount of shares that people want to sell and demand is the amount of shares that people want to purchase if there are a greater number of buyers than sellers more demand the buyers bid up the prices of the stocks to entice sellers to get rid of them   so sure if a company is performing well people will want to buy the stock causing it to go up   but even if a company was performing well and no one wanted to buy the stock   there would be only sellers and the price would go down

gt;and how did this cause the mbs to get wiped out was it a written clause or did they just collapse from the value dropping so hard    it was written into the debt instruments   mbs and cdos are broken down into tranches with descending priority of claims to the collateral pool   when it comes time for payment the top tranche gets paid out 100 before the one below it is entitled to a single cent and so on and so forth   here 's an example of how one might be organized     foo | bar | text tranche | size | credit rating class a | | aaa class b | | aa class c | | a class d | | bbb class e | | not rated   in this example lets say that 5 of the loans defaulted meaning that of the $ 1b only $ was available to get paid out assuming no over which most had but that 's besides the point here   the class a would get the full 750 they 're due the class b would get the full 100 and the class c would get the full 60   at this point there is only left so the class d would get 40 of the 50 due a 20 write down and class e would get nothing getting completely wiped out   gt;i do nt know what subordination level means subordination level basically just means how much debt it below it on the capital structure how much needs to get completely wiped out before any particular tranche starts sharing in the losses   gt did defaults reaching 8 meaning that 8 of loan takers defaulted    yeah more or less   technically i think it 's that 8 of the value of the mortgages defaulted but i believe they were set up to be relatively the same size within each instrument so there 's not really much distinction between 8 of the loan takers and 8 of the aggregate value

it is a bit more complicated than whether it pays more or less dividends you should make your decision based on how well the company is performing both fundamentally and technically concentrating mainly on the fundamental performance for this question most good and healthy companies make enough profits to both pay out dividends and invest back into the company to keep growing the company and profits in fact a good indication of a well performing company is when their dividend per share and earnings per share are both growing each year and the dividends per share are less than the earnings per share that way you know dividends are being paid out from new profits and not existing cash holdings this information can give you an indication of both a stable and growing company i would rather invest in a company that pays little or no dividends but is increasing profits and growing year after year than a company that pays higher dividends but its profits are decreasing year after year how long will the company continue to pay dividends for if it starts making less and less profits to pay them with you should never invest in a company solely because they pay dividends if you do you will end up losing money it is no use making $ 1 in dividends if you lose $ 2 + because the share price drops the annual returns from dividends are often between 1 and 6 and in some cases up to 10 however annual returns from capital gains can be 20 50 100 or more for a stable and growing company

there is no advantage to using one type of account or the other if you are in the same tax bracket at retirement that you are in during your working years however for tax planning reasons it is good to have some money in both a roth and a traditional ira plan   joetaxpayer has often advocated a good rule of thumb to use a roth when your tax bracket is 15 or lower and use a traditional account when in the 25 bracket or above the reason for this rule of thumb is that you are less likely to be in the higher tax bracket when you are living off retirement savings unless you put away an awful lot of money between now and then if you are making enough money to be paying a 25 marginal rate on some of the money you would be putting away for retirement then by all means put all of that money in a traditional 401k if after contributing that portion of your savings taxed at the higher rate you still have money to put away for retirement put the rest in a roth and pay the 15 taxes on it when you are younger it is likely that you are making less than you will a few years hence and it is also likely that a larger portion of your income will be paying tax deductible interest on a mortgage if those are true for you then by all means use the roth that was true of me when i was single and just getting started when you do finally retire it is possible that the tax brackets will be increased to match inflation and if so then there is no benefit to having tax free money at retirement vs. paying taxes on deferred accounts but there is also usually more flexibility in when to spend money you may find that you have a year where you have to spend a lot so it is good to be able to pull money out without it increasing your marginal rate for that year and other years where you spend relatively smaller amounts and you can withdraw taxable money and pay a lower rate on that money no one knows what the tax code will look like in 40 years but having some money in each type of account will give you flexibility to minimize your tax bill at retirement

you are not interpreting the table correctly the $ 20 k base rate that you think should have been eliminated is in fact the total tax for the whole bracket you only dipped partially into the bracket and the $ 3 k reduction accounts for that look at the table again what it means is that if you earn $ 100 k you will pay $ + 25 of 100000 = $ if you earn $ you 'll pay $ + 0.28 = $ so why the difference between $ and $ that 's exactly 25 of $ which is the difference between $ and $ the whole value of the bracket

the risk is that greece defaults on it 's debts and the rest of the eurozone chose to punish it by kicking it out of the eurozone and cutting off it 's banks from ecb funds since the greek government and banks are already in pretty dire straits this would leave greece with little choice but to convert deposits in those banks to a new drachma the exchange rate used for the forced conversions would almost certainly be unfavorable compared to market rates soon after the conversion there would likely be capital controls to prevent people pulling their money out in the to the forced conversion while i guess they could theoretically perform the forced conversion only on euro deposits this seems politically unlikely to me

publication covers this in a fairly specific manner page 11 section are you covered by an employer plan specifies the form w-2 you receive from your employer has a box    used to indicate whether you were covered for the year    the retirement plan box should be checked if you were    covered so by default if that 's checked you 're covered   590 does go into more detail though assuming you 're covered under a defined contribution plan a 401k for example defined contribution plan generally you are covered    by a defined contribution plan for a tax year if amounts are    contributed or allocated to your account for the plan year    that ends with or within that tax year   tax year tax year your tax year is the annual accounting period    you use to keep records and report income and expenses    on your income tax return for almost all people the tax    year is the calendar year further they cover issues related to an employee leaving dec. 31 very specifically a special rule applies to certain plans in which it is not    possible to determine if an amount will be contributed to    your account for a given plan year if for a plan year no    amounts have been allocated to your account that are attributable    to employer contributions employee contributions    or by the last day of the plan year and    contributions are discretionary for the plan year you are    not covered for the tax year in which the plan year ends if    after the plan year ends the employer makes a contribution    for that plan year you are covered for the tax year in    which the contribution is made example example mickey was covered by a profit sharing plan    and left the company on december 31 2014 the plan    year runs from july 1 to june 30 under the terms of the    plan employer contributions do not have to be made but    if they are made they are contributed to the plan before    the due date for filing the company 's tax return such contributions    are allocated as of the last day of the plan year    and allocations are made to the accounts of individuals    who have any service during the plan year as of june 30    2015 no contributions were made that were allocated to    the june 30 2015 plan year and no had been    allocated within the plan year in addition as of that date    the company was not obligated to make a contribution for    such plan year and it was impossible to determine    whether or not a contribution would be made for the plan    year on december 31 2015 the company decided to    contribute to the plan for the plan year ending june 30    2015 that contribution was made on february 15 2016    mickey is an active participant in the plan for his 2016 tax    year but not for his 2015 tax year mickey is in a similar but different circumstance and it 's clear from the irs 's treatment of his circumstance that you would be in the same boat just a year less off but be aware given mickey 's situation that it 's theoretically possible for them to make another contribution next year as mickey had depending on when their plan year etc ends so from the irs 's point of view everything you said the company did is correct   they paid you in january contributed to your 401k as a result of that paycheck and thus you were officially considered covered for 2015

assuming you are referring to macro corrections and crashes as opposed to technical crashes like the flash crash it is certainly possible to sell stocks during a market drop by definition the market is dropping not only because there are a larger number of sellers but more importantly because there are a large number of transactions that are driving prices down in fact volumes are strongly correlated with volatility so volumes are actually higher when the market is going down dramatically you can verify this on yahoo or google finance pick a liquid stock like spy and look at 2008 vs recent years that does n't say anything about the kind of selling that occurs though with respect to your question what s the best strategy for selling stocks during a drop it really depends on your objective you can generally always sell at some price that price will be worse during market crashes beyond the obvious fact that prices are declining spreads in the market will be wider due to heightened volatility many people are forced to sell during crashes due to external and or psychological pressures and sometimes selling is the right thing to do but the best strategy for long term investors is often to just hold on

there are 2 and 3 family houses that have an owner occupied clause for certain financing of course one would rent out the extra apartments without question   the key thing is that owner occupied means just that occupancy for tax purposes just using a small area like an office wo n't satisfy the requirement so no this is n't legal

i disagree with the previous answer based upon your particular situation    if the column states something like amount due to you and is a negative number then you owe that amount much like the previous poster states that a balance would be money you owe and if it was negative then the school owes you the same can be said for the column in question if the number was positive the school would owe you that amount if negative then you owe them    keep in mind you could always post a pic of the document out personal information

yes   in the us these are called certificates of deposit or savings accounts   every run of the mill bank offers them   you give the bank money and in return they pay you an interest rate that is some fraction of or negative offset from the returns they expect to make from your money since most investments that a bank makes say loaning money to a local business are themselves based on some multiple of or positive offset from the prime rate in return the interest rate that they offer you is also mathematically based on the prime rate you can find lists of banks offering the best returns on cds or savings accounts at sites like bankrate

i do n't hate apple i own an iphone and i 'm looking to buy a mac mini because they are great products i do hate maps though because it was poorly designed and executed   firing the guy responsible is a knee jerk reaction to poor product design upper management should have demanded that maps should be as good if not better than what was in place google maps before release it seemed like the development of maps was rushed and not well thought out and now iphone owners are paying the price for that apple still had a year left with their contract with google maybe they could have used that year for testing and design modifications before releasing maps with ios 6

does n't most of the time either in this job market losing a job over 40 is a pretty big deal   even bigger when there 's a real danger of being out of work for an extended period honesty as a young person you have no idea how rough it is on older people to a career on top of losing more than half of your wealth and having way fewer years to recover      there 's a lot f kids right out of college that ca n't get jobs and that 's true but when the economy recovers there 'll be a lot of you in the same boat meaning the hiring pools wo n't be able to be as about no experience just like when the economy recovers and banks want to start lending to homebuyers in bulk again so many people ha e bad credit from the collapse that they wo n't be able to set über high standards across the board in lending or the simply wo n't have a big pool of eligible applicants      at some point millenials will be hired en masse as the economy recovers the same is not nearly true for a forty something with a big unemployment gap over 50 forget about it almost entirely

one of the main tax loopholes more readily available to the wealthy in the u.s. is the fact that long term capital gains are taxed at a much lower rate certainly people making less than $ can take advantage of this as well but the fact is that people making say $ likely have a much smaller proportion of their income available to invest in say indexed mutual funds or etfs you may wish to read wikipedia 's article on capital gains tax in the united states you can certainly make the argument that the preferential tax rate on capital gains is appropriate and the wikipedia article points out a number of these nevertheless this is one of the main mechanisms whereby people with higher wealth in the u.s. typically leverage the tax code to their advantage

are you trying to figure out if a project would increase the market value of equity      i think your issue is that the market value of equity will not be updated with the npv of 40 m assuming it is truly + not sure if it 's true with 50 m of debt       ev = market value of equity + debt cash and ce    ev debt + cash and ce = market equity value      so i think you would have to update the market value of equity up with this would then lead to ev = equity value + future income stream discounted + debt cash and cash equivalents

respectfully i am of the opinion that you are mixing issues   paying a mortgage off early vs investing is a question that 's been well discussed at money se if you project a higher tax adjusted return on the investments than your current mortgage rate invest else pay the mortgage down   if the rent covers the mortgage you can maintain the investing it does n't matter for this discussion if the rent produces a profit so long as all expenses are covered   renting aside in the us now my mortgage is 3.5 2.6 after taxes so long as i expect a return well above this level long term i 'll stay investing and let the mortgage die its slow death another decade or so   i 'm sorry i can offer a formula it 's less about the same or more the mortgage is fixed right but the market return is unknown

obviously there 's some due diligence and quantitative analysis however it 's mostly just what they can secure for how much and how quickly for instance if you had a bakery that was netting and needed 750,000 to open a new location the bank will give you the loan over 10 years at 1.1 well it 's probably a good idea to take on debt that 's a month i think   edit or issue debt yourself   however let 's say you 're merging with someone in the same industry they have a market cap of 10 billion your company has a market cap of 62 billion and revenue of billion a year it 's probably a good idea to secure with equity especially because you believe the merger will help you expand

given the current low interest rates let 's assume 4 this might be a viable option for a lot of people   let 's also assume that your actual interest rate after figuring in tax considerations ends up at around 3   i think i am being pretty fair with the numbers now every dollar that you save each month based on the savings and invest with a higher net return of greater than 3 will in fact be free money   you are basically betting on your ability to invest over the 3   even if using a conservative historical rate of return on the market you should net far better than 3   this money would be significant after 10 years    let 's say you earn an average of 8 on your money over the 10 years   well you would have an extra $ 77 k by doing interest only if you were paying on average of $ 500 a month towards interest on a conventional loan   that is a pretty average house in the us   who does n't want $ 77 k more than you would have compared to just principal   so after 10 years you have the same amount in principal plus $ given that you take all of the saved money and invest it at the constraints above i would suggest that people take interest only if they are willing to put away the money as they had a conventional loan   another scenario would be a wealthier home owner that may be able to pay off house at any time to reap the tax breaks and cheap money to invest pros cons   if people ask how viable is this   well i have done this for 8 years   i have earned an extra   i have smaller than $ 500 i put away each month since my house is about 30 owned but have earned almost 14 on average over the last 8 years   my money gets put into an e trade account automatically each month from there i funnel it into different funds diversified by sector and region   i literally spend a few minutes a month on this and i truly act like the money is n't there   what is also nice is that the bank will account for about half of this as being a liquid asset when i have to renegotiate another loan

i would add only and you alluded in this direction but to clarify that barter economies rarely ever exist if you ask an economist about the origin of money they usually offer thus barter to credit story because adam smith this line of development it subsequently became true even though there was no evidence for it    anthropology has come a long way since smith lived and we now know that early societies were communal as in from each according to their means etc the term of art is gift economy where there are no or of who owes exactly what but rather a general sense of mutual obligation   accounting credit and debt as we think of them were a result of dealing with people you did not trust money being a debt arose from this mistrust and was typically only used to settle the most serious matters stolen wives murder etc in a way that could prevent deadly conflict by protecting the honor of the money was intended to replace the lost person    money debt and the rest have come in and out of fashion over the ages the efficiency argument is really null if you consider a gift economy and there have been prolonged periods since the first use of metallic money in which money has gone away for most of the middle ages for example europe reverted to credit and gift economies believe in fact that the use of money comes to typically prevail in societies that are rife with mistrust and lost persons that is societies plagued by war and slavery slaves being historically one of the primary products of war the rise of money usually brings the rise of a creditor class a debtor class who approximate slaves even though not losers in war per se and a terrific amount of social strife and that leads often to collapse if not addressed by periodic debt

suppose that the etf is currently at a price of $ 100   suppose that the next day it moves up 10 to a price of $ 110 and the following day it moves down 5 to a price of $   over these two days the etf has had a net gain of 4.5 from its original price the inverse etf reverses the daily gains losses of the base etf   suppose for simplicity that the inverse etf also starts out at a price of $ 100   so on the first day it goes down 10 to $ 90 and on the second day it goes up 5 to $   thus over the two days the inverse etf has had a net loss of 5.5 the specific dollar amounts do not matter here   the result is that the etf winds up at = of its original price and the inverse etf is at = of its original price   a similar example is given here as suggested by your quote this is due to compounding   a gain of x% followed by a loss of y% compounded on the gain is not in general the same as a loss of x% followed by a gain of y% compounded on the loss   or more simply put if something loses 10 of its value and then gains 10 of its new value it will not return to its original value because the 10 it gained was 10 of its decreased value so it 's not enough to bring it all the way back up   likewise if it gains 10 and then loses 10 it will go slightly below its original value since it lost 10 of its newly increased value

am i thinking correctly and can i do the 2 separate withdrawals yes is there anything else i 'm missing   yes for starters instead of withdrawing 401k why do n't you take a loan out of it this can be dangerous but also can be beneficial both for the same reason the beneficial part is this you do n't pay neither the income tax nor the penalty on the amount you take out as a loan i.e. immediate saving of 35 you can also get the full loan amount up to 50 of the 401k balance at once no need to wait for the next year you 'll be saving on the difference on the apr between the credit card debt which is usually huge and the 401k loan which is usually very low and that will allow you to consolidate the debt and cover it quicker the dangerous part is also taxes in case you lose your job you have to pay off the loan immediately within 3 months if you do n't the remaining balance will be considered as a taxable distribution and you 'll owe the on them but if you do n't lose your job you win and repaying the loan will revert your 401k balances back to the full amount while with withdrawal you can not put it back after 60 days are over at least so keep that in mind check with your 401k plan provider on the loan terms and costs they 'll charge some symbolic amount for managing the loan for you

modern portfolio theory has a strong theoretical background and its conclusions on the risk return trade off have a lot of good supporting evidence   however the conclusions it draws need to be used very carefully when thinking about retirement investing   if you were really just trying to just pick the one investment that you would guess would make you the most money in the future then yes given no other information the riskiest asset would be the best one    however for most people the goal retirement investing is to be as sure as possible to retire comfortably   if you were to just invest in a single very risky asset you may have the highest expected return but the risk involved would mean there might be a good chance you money may not be there when you need it instead a broad diversified basket of riskier and safer assets leaning more toward the riskier investments when younger and the safer assets when you get closer to retirement tends to be a better fit with most people 's retirement goals   this tends to give on average more return when you are young and can better deal with the risk but back the risk later in life when your investment portfolio is a majority of your wealth and you can least afford any major swings   this combines the lessons of mpt diversity risk return trade off in a clearer way with common goals of retirement caveat   your retirement goals and risk tolerance may be very different from other peoples   it is often good to talk to fee only financial planner
