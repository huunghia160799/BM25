yes it 's a good idea to have a separate business account for your business because it makes accounting and bookkeeping that much easier you can open a business checking account and there will be various options for types of accounts and fees you may or may not want an overdraft account for example or a separate business credit card just so you can more easily separate those expenses from your personal cards when i started my business i opened a business checking account and met with my banker every year just to show them how the business was doing and to keep the relationship going eventually when i wanted to establish a business line of credit it was easier to set up because i they were already familiar with my business its revenue and needs for a line of credit you can set up a solo 401k with your bank too and they 'll be very happy to do so but i recommend shopping around for options i 've found that the dedicated investment firms schwab fidelity etc tend to have better options fees and features for investment accounts just because a specific bank handles your checking account does n't mean you need to use that bank for everything lastly i use completely different banks for my personal life and for my business maybe i 'm paranoid but i just do n't want all my finances in the same place for both privacy reasons and to avoid having all my eggs in the same basket just something to consider i do n't really have a completely sane reason for using completely different banks but it helps me sleep

from my experience i opened a business account to handle my llc which owns a rental property the account process and features were similar to shopping for a personal checking account   there would be fees for falling below a minimum balance and for wanting a paper statement in my case keeping $ 2000 avoids the fee and i pull the statements online and save the pdfs once open for a certain amount of time you might be able to get credit extended based on the money that flows through that account the online access is similar to my personal checking as is the sending of payments electronically

another factor to consider beyond the fact that growth and volatility go together is that the times when many people will need to liquidate their investments will correlate with the times that many other people need to liquidate their investments and such correlation will push down the immediate value of those investments while certificates of deposit have penalties for early withdrawal one can establish up front what the worst case penalty would be for cashing it in at the most inopportune time   by contrast stocks offer no such assurance   stocks sometimes have weird downward spikes that may be short lived but if life circumstances force one to liquidate stocks during such a downward spike the penalty can be much larger than on a cd

i have to ask at what point do people take into account their own financial responsibility when it comes to these fees do n't get me wrong i 've been in that overdraft fee loop before and it was brutal so i took my business else where what i did n't realize at the time was that i did exactly what the bank wanted me to do either pay up for the bank forwarding money on my behalf or gtfo   banks are n't obligated to do shit with our pennies by asking them to hold on to our cash they provide a service including all the attached fine print trickery is obviously foul play but so is constantly over drawing an account one or two should be red flag enough that you 're not paying attention to your money but this is n't the case for our culture we get penalized then act like victims

good question there are plenty of investors who think they can simply rely on intuition and although luck is always present it is not enough to construct a proper portfolio first of all there are two basic types of portfolio management passive and active the majority of abnormal gains are made with active portfolio management although passive managers are less likely to suffer loses   both types must be created with some kind of qualitative and quantitative research but an active portfolio requires constant adjustments market timing to preserve the desired levels of risk and return   the topic is extremely broad and every manager has his own preferred methods of quantitative analysis i will try to list here some most common in my opinion ways of stock picking and portfolio management 's criterion the best portfolio is that with the lowest probability that the return will be below a specified level   this is achieved by maximising the number of standard deviations between the return on the portfolio and minimum specified level max k = rp where rp return on portfolio rl specified minimum return sp standard deviation of portfolio return 's criterion maximise the minimum return rl subject to constraint that the chance of a return below rl is less than or equal to a specified value a maximise rl subject to prob rp < rl = < a for example assume that the specified value is 20 this will be met provided rl is at least standard deviations below rp therefore the best portfolio is the one that rl where rl = 's criterion maximise expected return subject to the constraint that the chance of a return below the specified minimum is less than or equal to some specified minimum a maximise rp subject to prob rp < rl = < a assuming same data as previously   rl = < and select the portfolio with highest expected return security selection now let 's look at some methods of security selection this is important when a manager believes some shares are mispriced the required return on security i is given by ri = where rf is a risk free rate return on the market bi security 's beta the difference between the required return and the actual return expected is known as the security 's alpha ai ai = rai ri where rai is actual return on security i stock picking one way of stock picking is to select portfolios of securities with positive alpha of a portfolio is simply the weighted average of the of the securities in the portfolio ap = where is sigma sorry for such weird typing have n't figured out yet how to type proper looking formulas n share of security in portfolio so another way of stock picking is ranking securities by their excess return to beta erb erb = ri the greater the erb the more desirable the security and the greater the proportion it will make up of the portfolio thus portfolios produced by this technique will have greater proportion of some securities than the market portfolio and lower proportions of other securities   the number of securities depends on a cut off rate c for the erb defined so that all securities with erb > c are included in portfolio while if erb   the cut off rate for a portfolio containing the first j securities is given by i 'm inserting an image cut from word below   here comes the tricky part basically what you do is first calculate erb for each security then calculate cj for each security mix gradually adding new securities one by one and cj each time then you select an optimum portfolio by comparing cj of each mix to erb 's of it 's securities let me show you a simple example say you have securities a b c and d you calculated erb 's also you calculated then you check erb(a),erb(b),erb(c are greater than c(a but c(a only contains security a so c(a is not an optimum mix erb(a),erb(b),erb(c are greater than but only contains securities a and b erb(a),erb(b),erb(c are greater than and contains a b and c so it is an optimum is lower than so is not an optimum portfolio finally the most important part below is a formula to find the share of each security in the portfolio   here you simply plug in already obtained values for each security to find it 's proportion in your portfolio i hope this somehow answers your question however there is a lot more than this to consider if you decide to manage your portfolio yourself some of the most important areas are   market timing hedging stocks vs bonds   good luck with your investments and remember the safest portfolio is the one that replicates the global market   the cut off rate for a portfolio containing the first j securities is given by i 'm

the more you put down now the less money you are borrowing   of interest adds up even paying a small amount at the beginning of the mortgage can turn into a huge savings over the life of the loan that 's why you 'll find advice to make extra mortgage payments in the beginning   the question is do you have a better use for that money    in particular do you have any higher interest debt higher apr than your mortgage that needs to be paid off   you generally want to take care of those first    beyond that can you invest the extra down payment money elsewhere eg stock market and get a better return than your mortgage rate   do n't forget about taxes on investment profits if so that money will do more good there

you 're talking about money in a savings account and avoiding the risks posed by an ongoing crisis and avoiding risk if you are risk averse and likely to need your money in the short term you should not put your money in the stock market even in safe stocks like coca cola etc even these safe stocks are at risk of wild price swings in the short- to intermediate term especially in the event of international crises such as major european debt defaults and the like these stocks are suitable for long term growth objectives but they are not as a replacement for a savings account coca cola lost a third of its value between 2007 and 2009 it 's recovered and is currently doing better than ever went from $ to $ it 's partially recovered and back at $ 63 on the other hand these stocks may indeed be suitable as long term investments to protect you against local currency inflation and yes they even pay dividends if you 're after this investment a good option is probably a sector specific exchange traded fund such as a consumer staples etf it will likely be more diversified and safer than anything you could come up with using a list of individual stocks you can also investigate recommendations that show up when you search for a defensive etf if you do not wish to buy the etf directly you can also look at listings of the etf 's holdings read the prospectus for an idea of the risks associated with these funds you can buy these funds with any brokerage that gives you access to us stock exchanges

i know some derivative markets work like this so maybe similar with futures   a futures contract commits two parties to a buy sell of the underlying securities but with a futures contract you also create leverage because generally the margin you post on your futures contract is not sufficient to pay for the collateral in the underlying contract the person buying the future is essentially borrowing money while the person selling the future is essentially lending money the future you enter into is generally a short term contract so a perfectly hedged lender of funds should expect to receive something that approaches the fed funds rate in the us today that would be essentially nothing

the expense fees are high and unfortunate i would stop short of calling it criminal however   what you are paying for with your expenses is the management of the holdings in the fund the managers of the fund are actively continuously watching the performance of the holdings buying and selling inside the fund in an attempt to beat the stock market indexes whether or not this is worth the expenses is debatable but it is indeed possible for a managed fund to beat an index   despite the relatively high expenses of these funds the 401 k is still likely your best investment vehicle for retirement the money you put in is tax deductible immediately your account grows tax deferred and anything that your employer kicks in is free money   since in the short term you have little choice do n't lose a lot of sleep over it   just pick the best option you have and occasionally suggest to your employer that you would appreciate different options in the future if things do n't change and you have the option in the future to rollover into a cheaper ira feel free to take it

it sounds like something is getting lost in translation here a business owner should not have to pay personal income tax on business expenses with the caveat that they are truly business expenses here 's an example where what you described could happen suppose a business has $ 200 k in revenue and $ 150 k in legitimate business expenses wages and owner salaries taxes services products goods etc the profit for this example business is $ 50k. depending on how the business is structured sole proprietor llc s corp etc the business owner(s may have to pay personal income tax on the $ 50 k in profit if the owner then decided to have the business purchase a new vehicle solely for personal use with say $ 25 k of that profit then the owner may think he could avoid paying income tax on $ 25 k of the $ 50k. however this would not be considered a legitimate business expense and therefore would have to be reclassified as personal income and would be taxed as if the $ 25 k was paid to the owner if the vehicle truly was used for legitimate business purposes then the business expenses would end up being $ 175 k with $ 25 k left as profit which is taxable to the owners note this is an oversimplification as it 's oftentimes the case that vehicles are partially used for business instead of all or nothing in fact large items such as vehicles are typically depreciated so the full purchase price could not be deducted in a single year if many of the purchases are depreciated items instead of deductions then this could explain why it appears that the business expenses are being taxed it 's not a tax on the expense but on the income that has n't been reduced by expenses since only a portion of the big ticket item can be treated as an expense in a single year

the calculations you suggest have some issues but i think they are not necessary to answer the question it sounds like you are buying the house either way so the question really is simply whether to pay toward your house first or your loan first   in that case the answer is simple pay whichever has the highest interest rate first   make the minimum payment on the other until the first is paid off   remember this and make it your mantra for the rest of your life   if you have any debts such as credit cards that charge a rate higher than the two options you have presented do them first now be careful as you compute the interest rates   most likely you can deduct interest on your mortgage so its effective interest rate is lower it is instead of r where t is your marginal tax rate for a while the cost of mortgage insurance will make your effective mortgage rate artificially high but it sounds like you intend to get to that 20 hurdle pretty fast so my guess is that this is not a big factor congratulations on your bonus and good luck with your new home

after reading op mark 's question and the various answers carefully and also looking over some old pay stubs of mine i am beginning to wonder if he is mis reading his pay stub or slip of paper attached to the reimbursement check for the he purchases   pay stubs whether paper documents attached to checks or things received in one 's company mailbox or available for downloading from a company web site while the money is deposited electronically into the employee 's checking account vary from company to company but a reasonably well designed stub would likely have categories such as taxable gross income for the pay period this is the amount from which payroll taxes federal and state income tax social security and medicare tax are deducted as well as other post tax deductions such as money going to purchase of us savings bonds contributions to united way via payroll   deduction contribution to roth 401k etc employer paid group life   insurance premiums are taxable income too for any portion of the policy   that exceeds $ 50k. in some cases these appear as a lump sum on the last pay stub for the year nontaxable gross income for the pay period this would be sum total of the amounts contributed to 401k plans employee 's share of group health care insurance premiums for employee   and/or employee 's family money deposited into fsa accounts etc net pay this is the amount of the attached check or money sent via ach to the employee 's bank account year to date amounts these just tell the employee what has been earned paid withheld to date in the various categories now op mark said my company does not tax the reimbursement but they do add it to my running gross earnings total for the year so the question is whether the amount of the reimbursement is included in the year to date amount of taxable income if ytd taxable income does not include the reimbursement amount   then the the op 's question and the answers and comments are moot unless the company has really messed up pat pending payroll software that does weird things the amount   on the w2 form will be whatever is shown as ytd taxable income   on the last pay stub of the year and as noted it is what will appear on the w2 form that really matters in summary it is good that op mark is taking the time to investigate the matter of the reimbursements appearing in total gross income but if the amounts are not appearing in the ytd taxable income his payroll office may just him that they have good software and that what the ytd taxable income says on the last pay stub is what will be appearing on his w2 form   i am fairly confident that this is what will be the resolution of the matter because if the amount of the reimbursement was included in taxable income during that pay period and no tax was withheld then the employer has a problem with   social security and medicare tax and nonpayment of this tax plus the employer 's share to the us treasury in timely fashion the irs takes an extremely view of such shenanigans and most employers are unlikely to take the risk

they say that banks earn 4 5 on deposits so with lower costs they can give away 2 4 they cite this articles u s banking industry annual profit hit record which says that return on equity for banks up at the highest level since 2013 but net interest bank analytical is lower and that 's in a good year   they elaborate in a blog post   fed funds rates are supposed to affect deposit rates that banks pay to their customers as after all deposit is a form of short term loan from depositor to the bank see the explanation in our recent blog however as notes in their recent report it has not actually happened recently as the report notes for traditional branch based banks savings and checking account rates are virtually unchanged you are probably getting the same 0.01 in your checking or savings account meanwhile rates on your credit card went up by since december 2015   so why are n’t deposit rates increasing one reason often cited is actually the relative decrease in the levels of competition in the u.s. market as we described in our earlier blog while there are still thousands of banks in the u.s. 4 control ~40 of the assets and close to half of the assets loans the other reason could be perhaps that after almost 10 years of getting close to zero in your bank account you will forget that it could be any different in fact bank executives are puzzled why consumers are not demanding more on their deposits you can walk to the branch and demand more money from your bank but you may end up in county jail the only other viable option is to take your deposits elsewhere or vote with your feet   beam makes money by providing value added services to our partnering bank and other financial service partners in the banking that sounds like they might be selling your data

putting debt out long means to borrow a sum of money paid back over a longer period of time than you could reasonably pay it back it should be important to note that this advice only applies for fixed rate loans meaning your rate ca n't change for the life of the loan without you explicitly changing it   the logic is that if you can borrow money when interest rates are really low there is a good chance you can find an investment that has a return higher than the interest rate on the loan it also means that when if interest rates go up in the future a simple savings account may even have a greater return than your loans interest the advice suggests to borrow over a long period so you are paying less interest per payment and gives you time to find a proper investment without having to pay too much interest during that time

gt if the black scholes formula is applied to extended time periods .it can produce absurd results   gt buffett 2008 letter to berkshire hathaway shareholders   i will give your question more thought and come back with a quantitative solution it may be most fruitful to apply a backward induction options pricing model with detailed scenario based discounted cash flow valuation models supported by pro forma financial statement and investment analysis     nonetheless my initial reaction is inline with warren buffett 's belief that in the long run an assumption of the black scholes options pricing model is invalid see = = pdf and docs e web academics business economics faculty the perceived invalid assumption is that the distribution of expected future stock prices is not log normal in the long run this non log normal view is especially true for a single company stock    this invalid assumption results in over valuation of options prices from black scholes which makes it much better to sell long term options than to buy them if market participants are using black scholes pricing models   again without having done the math yet my gut tells me if the option seller is using black pricing for long dated options you would be best to avoid buying them as the prices will be inflated compared to an economic reality fair price

there is also the very simple fact that cash is a significantly self limiting thing you are limited in amount you can spend on any give day to the cash you have on hand this along makes you either to spend it forces you to spread your purchases or forgo one in order to enable another and/or requires additional planning to spend larger amounts   conversely most debit amp credit cards while they also have some limits on them enable far more free spending   so whether the spending of cash is a negative painful reaction or really just an awareness that their available resource is being reduced would be a better question   after all similar things are seen in other things that have short term physical limits smokers tend to smoke cigarettes more quickly at the beginning of a new pack and tend to space out the intervals between them as the pack likewise with other resources food beer soda within a home if when the supply is abundant we tend to amp snack as the available supply decreases we cut back

this answer is better served as a comment but i do n't have enough rep   it is not guaranteed that they do not accrue interest while you are a full time student some student loans can capitalize the interest before pursuing leveraged investing be sure that your student loan is not capitalizing capitalized interest capitalized interest is a second reason your loan may end up costing    more than the amount you originally borrowed interest starts to accrue grow from the day your loan is disbursed    sent to you or your school at certain points in time when your    separation or grace period ends or at the end of forbearance or    deferment your unpaid interest may capitalize that means it is added    to your loan ’s current principal from that point your interest will    now be calculated on this new amount that ’s capitalized interest capitalized interest if you accrue interest while you are in school as with direct    unsubsidized unsubsidized direct and plus loans and    private loans you will have capitalized interest if it is unpaid    unpaid accrued interest is added to the principal amount of your loan    after you leave school and finish any applicable grace period simply put there will be interest to be paid on both the principal of    the loan and on the interest that has already accumulated to minimize the effects of the capitalized interest on the amount you    will pay overall you can pay the interest during college instead of    waiting until after graduation that way you start with the original    principal balance minus any fees when you begin repayment

companies in the us will take care of paying a portion of your required income tax on your behalf based on some paperwork you fill out when starting work   however it is up to you as an individual to submit an income tax return   this is used to ensure that you did not end up under or overpaying based on what your company did on your behalf and any other circumstances that may impact your actual tax owed in my experience the process is similar in europe   i think anyone who has a family a house or investments in europe would need to file an income tax return as that is when things start to get complex

what i would do in this order get your taxes in order do n't worry about fancy tricks to screw the tax man over you 've already admitted that you 're literally making more money than you know what to do with and a lot of that is supported one way or another by infrastructure that 's supported by tax money   besides your first priority is to establish basic security for yourself and your family   making sure you wo n't be subjected to stressful audits is an important part of that pay off any and all outstanding debts you may have   this establishes a certain baseline standard of living for you no matter what unexpected may come up at least you wo n't have to deal with them while also keeping the wolves at bay at the same time max out a checking account i believe the fdic maximum insured value is $ 250,000   fill er up get a debit card and just sit on it   this is a rainy day fund highly liquid and immediately usable in case you lose your income put at least half of it into an ira or other safe investments   bonds and reliable dividend paying stocks are strongly preferred having money is good but having income is much better especially in retirement quality of life   splurge a little   emphasis on a little   look around your life there are a few things that it would be nice if you just had but you 've never gotten around to getting   pick up a few of them but do n't go overboard   spending too much too quickly is a good way to end up with no money and no idea what happened to it   also note that this is n't just for you family members deserve some love too charitable giving   if you have more money than you know what to do with there are plenty of people out there who know exactly what to do try to go on living and build a basic life for themselves but have no money with which to do so   do your research   scam charities abound as do more or less legitimate ones who actually do help those in need but also end up sucking up a surprisingly high percentage of donations for administrative costs   try and avoid these and send your money where it will actually do some good in the world reinvest in yourself   you 're running a business   make sure you have the best tools and training you can afford now that you can afford more

you want to regard loans as short term last ditch desperate effort for when you get caught in a bad spot and have a good workable plan to get out of it   you do n't ever want to start a business on borrowed money unless you 're an expert in the field of your business with a lot of experience in running businesses in that sector     the best thing to do is to get a job and save all your money to start a business that will make you enough money to start the business you really want   you may need to start a business to get the money to start a business to get the money to start a business to get the money to start the business you want   whatever it takes really   just do it all yourself   do n't accept loans or favors   also the whole world except amazon is moving from brick and mortar to the internet and you 're trying to move internet sales to brick and mortar   it 's a little backward looking   it could work but there 's probably some research you could do to test the feasibility of this idea   you need to be creative in designing effective science based ways to predict your success or failure   do n't worry about licensing issues with wholesalers   that 's not something to be worried about at this point

do you guys think it 's a good idea to put that much down on the car in my opinion it depends on a lot of factors   if you have nothing to pay and are not planning to invest in something that cost a lot soon i.e an house etc then i see no problem in put that much down on the car remember that the more you pay at first the less you will pay interest on however if you are planning on buying something big soon then you might want to pay less and keep moneys for your future investment i would honestly not finance a car with the garage as i find their interest rate to high possibilities depends a lot of your bank accounts but what i would personally do is pay it cash using my credit margin with the bank which is only 2.8 interest rate garage where i live rarely finance under 7 interest rate you may not have a credit margin but maybe you could get a loan with the bank instead many bank keep an history of your loan which will get you a better credit name when trying to buy an home later on the other side having a good credit name is not really useful in a garage what interest rate is reasonable based on my credit score i do n't think it is possible to give a real answer to this as it change a lot around the world however i would recommend to simply compare with the interest rate asked when being loan by the bank

if you 're looking for ways to turn $ 1000 into more do n't just think of ways it can make money also consider whether there are any ways you can use it to save money among the advantages of this approach is that you 're not taxed for reducing your expenditures the good news is that there are a lot more ways to save a little bit of money on a $ 1000 budget than there are to make a little money on that budget the bad news is that most of them will require some additional input labor have you taken an economics course capital + labor = > output   i do n't know what you spend your money on exactly but some thoughts you may find more opportunities for things like this as you move out from college and into your own apartment and the university is n't taking care of as many of your needs just do n't confuse yourself about where the line is between actually saving money that you were going to spend anyway and just consuming more consumption is fine in and of itself and ultimately it 's what you have money for but does n't make you financially better off also when considering what to do with the money do n't just think i can spend $ 2000 on this bike and it will ultimately save me gas money unless you also know how to think i could spend $ 200 on a slightly lesser bike and still save all the gas money or maybe even spend $ 20 on a yard sale bike consider borrowing kitchen equipment from the parents instead of buying new stuff or buy it at a yard sale also make sure you actually will use the things you buy

i 'm not sure if this answer is going to win me many friends on reddit but here goes   there 's no good reason why they could n't have just told him the current balance shown on their records but   there are some good reasons why they ca n't quote a definitive payoff balance to instantly settle the account   it 's very possible to charge something today and not have it show up on chase 's records until tomorrow or monday or later there are still places that process paper credit card transactions or that deal with 3rd party payment processors who reconcile transactions m f 9 and so on    most transactions these days are authorized the instant you swipe the card and the merchant wo n't process until they get authorization back from the cc company but sometimes those authorizations come from third party processors who do n't bill chase until later some of them might not process a friday afternoon transaction until close of business monday    also there are things like fares that might be collected when you exit the cab but the record exists only in the taxi 's onboard machine until they plug it into something else at the end of the shift    there are still some situations outdoor flea markets auctions etc where the merchant takes a paper imprint and does n't actually process the payment until they physically mail it in or whatever    some small businesses have information security routines in place where only one person is allowed to process credit card payments but where multiple customer service reps are allowed to accept the cc info write it down on one piece of paper then either physically hand the paper to the person with processing rights or deposit the paper in a locked office or mail slot for later processing this is obviously not an instant update system for chase believe it or not this system is actually considered to be more secure than retaining computerized records unless the business has very rigorous end to end info security    so there are a bunch of legit reasons why a cc company ca n't necessarily tell you this instant that you only need to pay $ x and no more to close the account although there is no good reason why they should n't be able to quote your current balance    what happens when you close an account is basically that they stop accepting new charges that were made after your notification but they will still accept and bill you for legit charges that you incurred before you gave them notice so basically they turn off the credit card but they ca n't guarantee how much you owe until the next billing cycle after this one closes   you notify them to close the account they stop authorizing new charges    their merchant agreements basically give the merchant a certain window to process charges the cc company process legit charges that were made prior to closing the account    the cc company sends you the final statement after that window for any charges has expired   when that final statement is paid or if it is zero that is when the account is settled and reported to equifax etc as paid    so it 's hard to tell from your post who was being overly semantic unreasonable if the cc company refused to tell the current balance they were just being but if they refused to promise that the current balance shown is enough to instantly settle the account forever they had legit reasons   hope that helps

1 i think the phrase variable annuity is a glowing red flag a corollary to that is that any strategy that uses insurance for a purpose e.g. tax avoidance other than protecting against loss rates at least a yellow flag 2 the other really obvious indicator is a return that is completely out of whack with the level of risk they are saying the investment has for example if someone promises a 10 annual return that is completely safe or very low risk run 3 if it is advertised on tv radio or all your friends are talking about it at parties stay away example investing in gold coins or the hot tech ipo 4 the whole sales pitch relies on past returns as proof that the investment will do well without any real discussion of other reasons it will continue to to well beware the gambler 's fallacy 5 finally be very wary of anyone who has some sort of great investment plan that they will teach you if you just pay $ x or go to their seminar fee based advice is fine but people selling a get rich quick vehicle typically know the real way to get rich is to get suckers to pay for their seminars

if you are looking to go long buy you would use bid prices as this is what you will be matched against for your order to be executed and a trade to go through if you are looking to go short sell you would use the ask prices as this is what you will be matched against for your order to be executed and a trade go through in your analysis you could use either this convention or the midpoint of the two prices as fx is very liquid the bid and ask prices would be quite close to each other so the easiest way to do your analysis is to use the convention i listed above

   for example says the report solvency could be achieved by raising taxes or reducing benefits for new recipients by about one fifth if we started today however if policy makers wait until payroll taxes would have to be increased by nearly one third and it would be impossible to achieve solvency solely from reducing benefits for new beneficiaries     social security was enacted in medicare was enacted in 1965 life expectancy at those times was 61 and 70 respectively today average life expectancy is 80    pushing the receipt age for these benefits makes the most sense and results in a two fold savings 1 benefits put into the system through additional payroll deduction and 2 benefits are not taken out of the system

to optimize your return on investment you need to buy low and sell high   if you knew that one stock had hit rock bottom and the others had not buying the low stock would be the best however unless you can predict the future you do n't know if any individual stock has hit the bottom or if it will continue to drop if you decide to spend the same amount of money each month on stock purchases then when the price is low you will automatically buy more shares and when the price is high you will buy fewer shares   this strategy is sometimes called dollar cost averaging   it eliminates the need to predict the future to optimize your buying all that having been said i agree with that at the investment amount that you are talking about and the per transaction fee you listed a monthly investment in several stocks will cause you to lose quite a bit to transaction fees   it sounds like you need a different strategy

as you have n't specified country will try and answer more in general whole life insurance but it seems to be the first thing any financial adviser is trained to sell the commission structure is such that it makes more attractive for a financial adviser to sell whole life plus for most buyers its easier to sell whole life compared to term the way guarantees are worded differ from policy to policy most of them do not give any guarantee its the adviser where there is guarantee it would be similar to a interest on bank deposit debt fund plus there are various terms used in the policy the guarantee may not be on sum assured but on the policy value that would be low in essence you are right on investing the difference into any save instruments like bank deposits certain debit funds government bonds retirement funds etc that would essentially give you more returns than what s promised in the whole life policy

walmart is doing nothing illegal and every other business is playing against the same laws   nobody is forced to work there and nobody is forced to shop there   that all said anyone who actually cares about this has a solution update the laws and convince people to update their choices in where to work and where to shop   think long and hard about how you would like other people treated and how complex you would like that to be hint the us health system is complex and inefficient     realise that every law has other consequences and just because you want something to happen a particular way does n't mean it will   for example increasing minimum wages does n't magically increase average wages or provide new jobs for the unemployed   there is a lot of debate over the actual wiki but it is never simple

there 's nothing particularly special about a two million dollar cheque while they are n't commonplace the bank certainly has experience with them many atms wo n't allow a deposit of that size but the bank cashiers will certainly accept them they will typically get a supervisor to sign off on the deposit and may ask about the source of the money for fraud prevention reasons they may be held for longer than a smaller cheque if the bank manager chooses to do so if there 's nothing remotely suspicious for example it is a cheque from an insurance company for an expected payout you should expect it will clear in about a week on the other hand if it is a cheque from a bank in another country and the bank manager has any reason to suspect it may not be legitimate they may hold it for a month or more even then you are not guaranteed the cheque was legitimate this is used in a common scam

when you buy a bond you 're giving a loan to the issuer the interest rate on the bond is the interest rate on the loan usually and this is also the case with the treasury bonds the rate is fixed for the term of the loan thus if the market rate for similar loans a year later is higher the rate for the loan you gave remains the same

everyone pays their personal income tax with funds from their employer   some of it through withholding and the rest through the balance due at the time of filing all that is happening here is that the company is calculating   your personal tax return for you and fiddling retroactively with the gross salary to yield a specific after tax salary one problem is that there is a lot of information i put in my return to earn deductions that i would not care to tell my employer    the system would also appear to be contrary to public policy   governments create tax deductions to give a larger income to those with socially acceptable expenses   health care dependents   etc   the system you describe would give employees with such deductions a lower gross salary

once again i offer some sage advice do n't let the tax tail wag the investing dog michael offers an excellent method to decide what to do note he does n't base the decision on the tax implication   if you are truly indifferent to holding the stock you might consider selling just the profitable shares if that 's enough cash then sell shares at a loss each year if you have no other gains that will let you pay the long term gain rate on the shares sold this year but offset regular income in years to come but i 'm hard pressed to believe you are indifferent and i 'd use 's approach to decide   updated the new law is simply a rule requiring brokers to track basis your situation does n't change at all when you sell the shares you need to identify which shares you want to sell for older shares the tracking is your responsibility that 's all

the new payment on $ 3.5 15yr would be $ compared to $ now 26 bi weekly payments but 12 months assuming the difference is nearly all interest the savings is closer to $ than   note actual savings are different the actual savings is based on the difference in interest over the year since the term will be changing i 'm looking at cash flow which is the larger concern in my opinion     $ is 60 months this is your break even time to payoff the $ higher actually since the $ 17 k will be accruing interest   i did n't see any mention of closing costs or other expenses obviously that has to be factored in as well   i think the trade off is n't worth it as the other answers suggest the rental is too close to break even now the cost of repairs on two houses is an issue in my opinion it 's less about the expenses being huge than being random you do n't get billed $ to paint the house you wake up see too many spots showing wear and get a $ 3000 bill same for all high cost items roof hvac etc   you are permitted to borrow 50 of your 401(k balance so you have $ 64 k in the account i do n't know your age this might be great or a bit low i 'd keep saving not putting any extra toward either mortgage until i had an emergency fund that was more than sufficient the fund needs to handle the unexpected expenses as well as the months of unemployment in general 6 9 months of these expenses is recommended   to be clear there are times a 401(k loan can make sense i just do n't see that it does now   disclaimer when analyzing there are two approaches the first is to look at interest saved after all interest is the expense principal payments go right to your balance sheet the second is purely cash flow in which case one might justify a higher rate and going from 15 to 30 years but freeing up cash that can be better deployed even though the rate goes up say 1/2 the payment drops due to the term take that savings and deposit to a matched 401(k and the numbers may work out very well   i offer this to explain why the math above may not be consistent with other answers of mine

generally if you need to tap into your retirement for the house you probably should n't buy the house but that 's your call there are several things you could do sue your cpa friend for malpractice especially if there 's any actual proof of that stupid suggestion check with your 401k administrator about home purchase loan from the 401k you 'll be borrowing your own money and repaying yourself back with interest but it will be tax free and with no penalties keep in mind if you can not repay the loan or you leave your employer without repaying it in full the remaining balance will be considered withdrawal and you 'll pay income taxes + 10 penalty on it if you have an ira you can withdraw up to 10 k without penalty if this is your first house i.e. you did n't own a house in the last 3 years and is going to be your primary residence you 'll still pay taxes on the 10k. but this is not available for 401k plans you can request equal payments distribution calculated based on your life expectancy this is the infamous distribution even though many of the exceptions are in the irc this in particular is here 's the full list of exceptions note that even if you 're willing to pay the 10 penalty many 401k plans do not allow distributions as long as you 're still employed with the sponsoring employer if you take a hardship distribution from your 401k if it even allows it you 'll be prohibited from contributing for 6 months and your employer will be prohibited from contributing on your behalf as well i.e. not only you take out your savings you 'll be barred from saving back also in the same faq it tells you that the hardship distribution can only include the amounts up to the original contributions less whatever distributions already made and not earnings or match i.e. it may actually be much less than the 40 k you 're counting on

the s&p top 5 401(k usually comply with the dol 's suggestion to offer at least three distinct investment options with substantially different risk return objectives typically a short term bond fund short term is a year or less and it will rarely have a negative year a large cap fund often the s&p index a balanced fund offering a mix last the company 's stock this is a great way to put all your eggs in one basket and when the company goes under you have no job and no savings   my concern about your microsoft remark is that you might not have the choice to manage you funds with such granularity will you get out of the s&p fund because you think this one stock or even one sector of the s&p is overvalued and buy into what the bond fund if you have the skill to choose individual stocks and the 401(k does n't offer a brokerage window to trade on your own then just invest your money outside the 401(k but if they offer a matching deposit do n't ignore that

their is no arbitrage opportunity with buying dividends you 're buying a taxable event this is a largely misunderstood topic the stock always drops by the amount if the dividend on the ex date the stock opens that day trading ex excluding the dividend it then pays out later based in the shareholders on record   there is a lot of talk about price movement and value here that can happen but it 's from trading not from the dividend per se yes sometimes you do see a stock pop the day prior to ex date because people are buying the stock for the dividend but the trading aspect of a stock is determined by supply and demand from people trading the stock   the dividends are paid out from the owners equity section of the balance sheet this is a return of equity to shareholders the idea is to give owners of the company some of their investment back from when they bought the stock without having the owners sell the shares of the company after all if it 's a good company you want to keep holding it so it will appreciate   another similar way to think of it is like a bonds interest payment   people sometimes forget when trading that these are actual companies meant to be invested in your buying an ownership in the company with your cash   it really makes no difference to buy the dividend or not all other things constant though market activity can add or lose value from trading as normal

like a lot of businesses they win on the averages which means lucrative customers subsidize the money losers   this is par for the course   it 's the health club model   the people who show up everyday are subsidized by the people who never show but are too guilty to cancel when i sent 2 dvds a day to netflix they lost their shirt on me and made it up on the customers who do n't in those free to play actually 95 99 of the players never pay and are carried by the 1 5 who spend significantly   in business thinking the overall marketing cost of acquiring a new customer is pretty big $ 50 to $ 500 on the other side of the credit card they pay $ 600 bounty for new merchant customers there are salesmen who live on converting 2 3 merchants a month    that 's because as a rule customers tend to lock in   that 's why dot lose millions for years giving you a free service   eventually they figure out a revenue model and you stay with it despite the new ads because changing is inconvenient when you want to do a banking transaction they must provide the means to do that   normal banks have the staggering cost of a huge network of branch offices where you can walk in and hand a check to a teller   the whole point of an atm is to reduce the cost of that   chase has 3 staffed locations in my and 6 atms   schwab has 3 locations in my greater metro which contains over 400 if you 're in a one horse town like french lick or detroit no schwab for miles   so for schwab a $ 3 atm fee is n't expensive it 's cheap compared to the cost of serving you any other way there may also be behind the scenes agreements where the bank that charged you $ 3 refunds some of it to schwab after they refund you   it does n't really cost $ 3 to do a foreign atm transaction   most debit cards have a visa or mastercard logo   many places will let you run it as an atm card with a pin entry   however everyone who takes visa mc must take it as a credit card using a signature in that case the merchant pays 2 10 depending on several factors of this about 1.4 goes to the issuing bank   this is meant to cover the bank 's risk of credit card defaults but drawing from a bank account where they can decline if the money is n't there that risk is low so it 's mostly gravy you may find schwab is doing ok on that alone   also do n't use debit cards at any but the most trusted shops unless you fully understand how in fraud situations credit cards and debit cards compare and are comfortable with the increased risks      there are literally dozens of micro fees depending on their volume swipe vs chip atm vs credit rewards cards fixed vs online vs mobile etc home depot does ok the food vendor at the renaissance faire gets slaughtered this kind of is why small vendor services like square are becoming hugely popular they flat rate everything at around 2.7 yay

there are two questions financial institutions do not care about your nationality only your ability to pay over time for long term debt the lender will want assurances that the borrower has the ability and means to pay the debt over time a legal resident in the us should have no more difficulty obtaining financing than a citizen under similar life circumstances the lender is also under legal obligation to confirm that the borrower is who they say they are will have the ability to pay over time and have no malicious intent in the purchase persons who do not have legal status in the us and who do not have the means to pay for property outright will have difficulty obtaining financing as they will have trouble establishing the requirements of the lender this is simple math a lender will be reluctant to lend to any person who is more likely to have difficulty paying the obligation than another in your case your father would be an unlikely candidate for a mortgage because he can not establish his legal status nor can he guarantee that he will have the legal right to earn a means to pay the loan back this puts the lender at risk both of losing the money lent and losing the right to repossess the property if the borrower does n't pay   despite all of the obstacles i have indicated above it is still possible for your father to purchase property legally but the risk and the cost go way up for him as a borrower there may be sellers willing to finance property over time but your father 's status puts him at a disadvantage if the seller is not honest   there may be community which can help you work through the challenges of property ownership please see these related articles

to quote adam smith everything is worth what its purchaser will pay for it in this case that means the value of a stock is equal to the price that someone will pay for it if you buy shares in a company the number of people who want shares in that company has just gone up by 1 if you buy shares in companies profiting from the dapl you are increasing demand for those shares you are actually making those shares more valuable not less if you bought all those shares then you could simply shut the pipeline down but that means you 'd be spending billions of dollars to do so and that money would go to the people who own the company now the concept of shareholder activism that you refer to is actually more that an individual who owns a substantial number of shares usually in the 10 ballpark will become on the direction of the company and attempt to elect board members who will take action to suit their liking this is done to increase the profits of the company so that the shareholder can make more money off of their investment it is very expensive and not generally done for reasons of ethics unless those ethics align with a view to long term profit in this case you 'd need at least $ to buy enough of a stake in the dapl to make a difference what you may instead want to consider is ethical investing this refers to the concept that you should only put your investments in companies which act ethically for example you could buy shares in a solar company if you felt that was an ethical industry in this way you drive up demand for those types of companies and reward the business owners who act in that fashion

coming from someone who has worked a in the account servicing department of an actual bank in the us other answers are right this is probably a scam the phone number on the letter is probably ringing to a fraudulent call center these are very well managed and sound professional and you must independently locate and dial the true contact number to us bank now tell them what happened reporting is critical securing your money is critical every piece of information you provided the bank when you called needs to be changed or worked around account numbers passwords usernames card numbers get changed tax id numbers get de prioritized as an authentication mechanism even if the government wo n't change them the true bank probably wo n't transfer you to the branch if the front line call center says they will ask the person on the phone what the branch can do that they can not information is your friend they will probably transfer you to a special department that handles these reports apparently union bank 's call center transfers you to the branch then has the branch make this transfer maybe their front line call center team is empowered to handle it like i was either way plug your phone in if the call takes less than 5 minutes they did n't actually do everything 5 to 8 minutes per department is more likely plus hold time there 's a lot of forms they 're filling out what if that office is closed because of time differences go online and ask for an atm limit increase start doing cash advances at local banks if your card allows it just get that money out of that account before it 's in a fraudsters account keep receipts even if the machine declines the transaction either way get cash on hand while you wait for a new debit card and checks for the new account you 're going to open what if this was fraud you draw your us bank account down to zero $ 800 at a time and you do n't close it or change passwords is it over no then your account will get closed and you will owe everything that the fraudsters rack up these charges can put your account far in the negative from this point forward this is called participation in a scam in your depository agreement because you fell victim to it did n't report and the info used was voluntarily given you will also lose any of your money that they spend what if us bank really is closing your account then they owe you every penny you had in it minus any fees allowed in the depository agreement this closure can happen several days after the date on the warning so being able to withdraw does n't mean you 're safe banks usually ship an official check shipped to the last known address they had for you why would a bank within the united states close my account when it 's not below the minimum balance probably because your non resident alien registration from when you were in school has expired and federal law prohibits them from doing business with you now these need renewed at least every three years renewing federally is not enough the bank must be aware of the updated expiration date how do i find out why my account is being closed you ask the real us bank they might find that it 's not being closed good news follow the scam reporting procedure open a new account with us bank if you want or elsewhere and close the old one if it is being closed by the bank they 'll tell you why and they 'll tell you what your next options are ask what can be done other commenters are right that bitcoin activity may have flagged it that activity might actually be against your depository agreement or it set off a detection system or many other reasons the bank who services your account is the only place that knows for sure if i offer them $ 500 per year will they likely keep the account opened otherwise i got to go to singapore open another account legitimate financial institutions in the united states do n't work this way if there is a legal problem with your tax status in the us money to the bank wo n't solve it let 's call the folks you 've talked to and the real because until confirms we have no reason to believe that the letter is real   will ask for money do n't give it do n't give them any further information gather up as much information from them as possible instead where to send it for example then report that to wo n't have a way to charge $ 500/year to you only if they offer a type of account to everyone that costs $ 500 ask for the truth in savings act disclosures banks are legally required to provide these upon request then read them do n't put or keep your money anywhere you do n't understand

specific stock advice is n't permitted on these boards i 'm discussing the process of a call spread with the apple jan 13 calls as an example   in effect you have $ 10 to bet each bet you 'd construct offers a different return odds for example if you bought the $ 750 call at $ you 'd need to look to find what strike has a bid of $ 27 or higher the $ is bid $ so this particular spread is a 4 to 1 bet the stock will close in january over $ with a $ 760 break even   you can pull the number from yahoo to a spreadsheet to make your own chart of spread costs but i 'll give one more example   you think it will go over $ 850 and that strike is now ask $ the highest strike currently listed is $ and it 's bid $ so this spread cost is $ 850 and a close over $ returns $ 8000 or over 9 to 1   again this is not advice just an analysis of how spreads work note any anomalies in the pricing above is the effect of a particular strike having no trades today not every strike is active so last trade can be days old    note my answer adds to 's response in that once you used the word bet and showed a desire to make a risky move options are the answer you acknowledged you understand the basic concept but given the contract size of 100 shares these suggestions are ways to bet under your $ 1000 limit and profit from the gain in the underlying stock you hope to see

jesus christ man what is your obsession with the election you are the one who brought hillary up    since it 's apparently relevant i am not a fan of hillary at all gun to my head i would say that i believe she would have done a slightly less shitty job than trump is the fact that i do n't like one candidate does n't mean i particularly like the other a person 's opinion of both can be mutually exclusive    i do n't understand why you 're so fixated on the fact that he won the election is it maybe because you ca n't think of a single specific thing that your boy has done that has actually had a quantifiable positive impact on anything other than the vague buzz words that you trump folk are famous for parroting

the danger of overdrawing the account via the use of a debit card and the exorbitant fees that can result make me hesitant to use a debit card the ability to cover all the transactions with one payment is why i use a credit card for these debit transactions   yes there is a risk of a late payment but that can be easily avoided within the three week grace period the ability to electronically transfer the money to pay off the card makes this even easier

gt in fact i reject the notion that bitcoin is anywhere as revolutionary as the internet   bitcoin itself is rather simple it 's just a ledger that requires a proof of work hash to make entries and be rewarded for making those entries    yet the tech behind bitcoin the blockchain is where the incredible innovation is you say that you acknowledge the technical aspects which is what i assume your referring to and absolutely agree   itself as a construct is far older than most people let on   so is the problem that solved the two wiki problem has been discussed on crypto boards since the late 70s early 80s and did not have a good solution until 2009 since then there has been an explosion of new creations    solutions like decentralized asset social without central servers or censorship decentralized reputation based markets like decentralized and provable decentralized crowdfunding like mike bitcoin core decentralized cloud etc    all these technologies are able to exist because of the blockchain protocol model and can be scaled across the world without censorship or seizure plus anyone can take these technologies to learn how they work and edit improve wherever they wish because everything is open    regardless what happens to the price of bitcoin developments in this scene over the past 5 years have been beyond engaging this past year alone has been so much fun following something that constantly evolves so quickly    in this regard i definitely consider the technology behind bitcoin just as revolutionary and as the internet was     most fun experiment ever

vanguard released an analysis paper in 2013 titled dollar cost averaging just means taking risk later   this paper explores the performance between a dollar cost averaging strategy and a lump sum strategy when you already possess the funds this paper is an excellent read but the conclusion from the executive summary is we conclude that if an investor expects such trends to continue is    satisfied with his or her target asset allocation and is comfortable with    the risk return characteristics of each strategy the prudent action is investing the lump sum immediately to gain exposure to the markets    as soon as possible the caveat to the conclusion is weighing your emotions   if you are primarily concerned with minimizing the possibility of a loss then you should use a dollar cost averaging strategy with the understanding that on a purely mathematical basis the dollar cost averaging strategy is likely to under perform a lump sum investment of the funds the paper explores a 10 year holding period with either the analysis includes various portfolio and is backtested against the united states united kingdom and australian markets based on this as far as i 'm concerned the rule of thumb is invest the lump sum if you 're going to invest at all

it seems like this was a stock for stock transaction that is your company was acquired not for cash but for the stock of company x in a deal that your company 's board of directors signed off on   your company no longer exists and that 's why your stock was cancelled the acquirer will be sending you an equivalent amount of stock in their company x. you do n't need to worry about taxes only accounting because this is a non cash transaction what this means that your cost basis in the stock of company x will be what you paid for the original company 's stock not its value on the day of the merger which may be higher or lower than what you paid

if one wants to have a bound on the loss percentages that are acceptable this is would be a way to enforce that for example suppose someone wants to have a 5 stop loss but does n't want this to be worse than 10 as if the stock goes down more than 10 then the sell should n't happen thus if the stock opened in a gap down 15 one day this triggers the stop loss and would exit at too low of a price as the gap was quite high as i wonder how familiar are you with how much a stock 's price could change that makes the prices not be as continuous as one would think at least this would be my thinking on a volatile stock where one may want to try to limit losses if the stock does fall within a specific range

hmmm as far as i know wire transfers are still the best option if you make sure your us account accepts international wires for free like td bank does you 'll have eliminated most of the costs assuming your foreign bank does n't charge too much for wiring the funds in the first place also if your able to you could consider wiring 6 or so months at the same time i 'm not familiar with xe.com but it seems it 's not set up for transferring money so much as for trading currencies while you could probably use it to transfer funds if you 'd link both your accounts it seems a rather complicated way to go about things paypal could be an option if they 'd allow you to set up an account in each country or if you have a relative that could help out but it gets more expensive than wire transfers quickly as for getting the best exchange rate i 've given up on that a long time ago and have accepted that as the cost of living internationally

yes many hedge funds for example did not survive 2008 2009   but hedge funds were failing both before and after that period and other hedge funds thrived   those types of funds are particularly risky because they depend so much on leverage i.e. on money that is n't actually theirs more publically visible funds like those of the big name index fund companies tended not to close because they are not leveraged   you say that a great many companies failed during the recession but that 's not actually true   i ca n't think of more than a handful of publically traded companies that went bankrupt   so since the vast majority of publically traded companies stayed in business their stocks kept some most of their value and the funds that owned those stocks stayed afloat i personally did not see a single index fund that went out of business due to the recession

it sounds to me like you may not be defining fundamental investing very well which is why it may seem like it does n't matter   fundamental investing means valuing a stock based on your estimate of its future profitability and thus cash flows and dividends   one way to do this is to look at the multiples you have described   but multiples are inherently backward looking so for firms with good growth prospects they can be very poor estimates of future profitability when you see a firm with ratios way out of whack with other firms you can conclude that the market thinks that firm has a lot of future growth possibilities   that 's all it could be that the market is overestimating that growth but you would need more information in order to conclude that   we call warren buffet a fundamental investor because he tends to think the market has made a mistake and overvalued many firms with crazy ratios   that may be in many cases but it does n't necessarily mean those investors are not using fundamental analysis to come up with their valuations fundamental investing is still very much relevant and is probably the primary determinant of stock prices   it 's just that fundamental investing encompasses estimating things like future growth and innovation which is a lot more than just looking at the ratios you have described

there are many different reasons to buy property and it 's important to make a distinction between commercial and residential property historically owning property has been part of the american dream for multiple reasons   but to answer your questions value is not based on the age of the building however it can be in a historic district in addition the price of something and it 's value may or may not be directly related for each individual buyer owner because that becomes subjective some buildings can lose there value as time passes but the depends on multiple factors area condition of the building overall economy etc so it 's not that easy to give a specific answer to a general question   before you buy property amongst many things it 's important to determine why you want to buy this property what will be it 's principal use for you that will help you determine if you should buy an old or new property but that pales in comparison to if the property will maintain and gain in value also if your looking for an investment look into reit real estate investment trust these can be great why because you do n't actually have to carry the mortgage which makes that ideal for people who want to own property but not have to deal with the everyday ins and outs of the responsibility of ownership like rising cost it 's important to note that the cost of purchase and cost of ownership are two different things but invariably linked when buying anything in the material strata of our world you can find publicly traded reits on the major stock exchanges hope that helps

in a traditional ira or 401k or equivalent income tax is not taken on the money when it is deposited or when dividends are reinvested but money you take out after you can do do without penalty is taxed as if it were ordinary income i believe that 's true i do n't think you get to take the long term investment rate note that roth is the opposite you pay income tax up front before putting money into the retirement account but you will eventually withdraw without paying any additional   tax at that time unlike normal investments neither of these requires tracking the details to know how much tax to pay there are no taxes due on the reinvested dividends and you do n't need to track cost basis

first off you generally want to park your emergency fund somewhere that is safe meaning something that is not subject to market fluctuations   your emergency fund is something you need to be able to count on when times are tough   that rules out things like stock market investments secondly you need to think about how quickly you will need access to the money   if you have an emergency odds are you do n't want to be waiting around for weeks months years for the money to become available   this rules out most fixed term investments bonds traditional cds etc if you are concerned that you will need near instant access to your emergency money then you probably want to keep it in a savings or money market account at the same bank as your checking account   most banks will let you transfer money between local accounts instantly unfortunately your local bank probably has pitiful interest rates for the savings mma far below the inflation rate   this means your money will slowly lose value over time   be prepared to keep contributing to it for most people being able to draw the cash from your fund within a few days < 1 week is sufficient   worst case you charge something on your credit card and then pay down the card when the emergency fund withdrawal arrives if money within a few days is okay for you there are a few options money market mutual funds not to be confused with a money market account this is the traditional place to keep an emergency fund   these are investment funds you can buy with a brokerage account   an example of such a fund would be fidelity cash reserves   are not fdic insured so they are not exactly zero risk   however they are considered extremely safe   they almost never go down in value only a few times in the past few decades and when they have the fund manager or the federal govt stepped in to restore the value   they usually offer slightly better return than a local savings account and are available in taxable and non taxable varieties online high yield savings or money market account these are a relatively new invention   it 's basically a the same thing as what your local bank offers but it 's online only   no local branch means low overhead so they offer higher interest rates 2.0 vs 0.5 for your local bank   some of them used to be over 5 before the economy tanked   like your local bank it is fdic insured one bit of caution   some of these accounts have become lately   they have started to do things like promo rates for a few months only offering the high interest rate on the first few $ k deposited limiting the amount that can be withdrawn etc   be sure to read the details before you open an account no penalty cds certificates of deposit usually offer a better rate than a savings account but your money is locked up until the cd term is up e.g. 36 months   if you need to cash out before then you pay a penalty   some banks have begun to offer cds that you can cash out with no penalty at all   these can offer better rates than the savings account   make sure it really is no penalty though   also watch what your options are for slowly adding money over time   this can be an issue if you want to deposit $ 100 from every paycheck rewards checking accounts these are checking accounts that will pay a relatively high interest rate 3 or more provided you generate enough activity   most of them will have requirements like you must have direct deposit setup with them and you must do a minimum number of debit card transactions from the account per month   if you can stay on top of the requirements these can be a great deal   if you do n't stay on top of it your interest rate usually drops back to something pitiful though personally we use the online high yield savings account for our emergency fund   i 'm not going to make a specific recommendation as to which bank to use   the best deal changes almost week to week   instead i will say to check out bankrate.com for a list of savings accounts and cds that you can sort   the bank deals blog is a good place to follow rate changes

they are using a tax arbitrage a variation of hollywood accounting this is a common tactic adopted by all big companies including ge apple microsoft google and hedge funds like bain the company 's management has only one legal duty to maximize the shareholder value and this is one way of doing it   depending on your perspectives it may be unethical but it definitely is not illegal    blame the politicians and people electing them not the businessmen

i think you 're mixing up being incorporated with being public a corporation is just a financially separate organization from the owner(s there might be only one owner but the company 's assets are separated from the person 's    a public company is one entity whose ownership is on the market a shareholder can sell his or her portion easily a company that decides it no longer wants to be public just becomes a private corporation with ownership of its own assets but with a few owners not many

congrats on making it this far debt free it is rare but nice to be in the situation that you are in   the important thing here is that you want to remain debt free that 's really what the emergency fund is all about it keeps you from needing to go into debt should something unexpected happen   you 've got 1.5 months worth of expenses saved up and that 's great if you do n't have a family or other responsibilities that might be enough but think about this how are you paying for school and what would happen if those funds stopped coming in if you are paying for school out of your own income what happens if you lose your job if someone else perhaps your parents is paying for school what happens if they are suddenly no longer able to do so   while you have extra cash you want to be saving it up for situations like this   if i were you i would build up that emergency fund until it got to the point where it could pay all your expenses and tuition until graduation hopefully you wo n't need to touch it but it will be there if you need it   since you need to be able to access your money quickly it is generally recommended to park this money in a savings account where it is very safe mutual funds are a great way to invest but they are not safe in the short term   do n't stress out about not being able to start retirement investing just yet making sure you can finish school debt free is the best investment you can make right now after you graduate and land a job you can start investing aggressively

congratulations on your graduation and salary   you are in a great career field i know from experience   as a background i would feel pretty confident in your salary as demand for se is pretty high right now   during my career there were times that demand was pretty to very low   somehow i survived 2001 2002 but 2003 was a pretty rough year for me here is what i would do if i were you    paying off the smallest loans first gives you some great wind in the and encourages you to keep going   i really like this approach despite being not the most mathematically efficient    i 'd reduce my car loan payment back to $ 200/mo and put that as the last one to pay off    with the tax refund and any money left over i pay off the student loans smallest to largest   i would also consider reducing your savings to something around the range and use that to pay down debt if you use your tax refund and some of the savings you 'd have like 34 k left to pay off   could you do that in like 14 months   i think you could depending on your other expenses   no more than 18 months and if you really worked hard and picked up some work on the side maybe a year    that is what i would do

how do prices of an apartment house correlate to prices becoming more manageable in manufactured goods   i could also say that   housing is not a good proxy seeing as how prices in housing differ depending on where you live   i can also point out that more is going into buildings like double glass and better materials which would also raise prices on your home   yet a computer is much better than today than 35 years ago and the exact opposite thing happened   i can also say that there is less timber today than 35 years ago making the price of wood go up   i can also get into boring things like bid rent theory but what 's the fun in that   nearly all manufactured goods have gone down in price   thanks to more open robust trade

extrinsic value is not a factor with respect to gold   intrinsic value by definition is the natural value of a commodity set by the market extrinsic value is externally set the extrinsic value of gold in the united states is $ if the market value of gold fell below $ a us american eagle coin would be worth $ 50 in the us if you take away the attributes that make a commodity valuable the value drops substitutes of equal or better quality for most industrial or other uses of gold exist so if if the popularity of gold declines or if the hoarders of gold have to liquidate it 's value will diminish i have no idea what that value would be but it would set by the market demand for gold jewelry and other valuable industrial uses

note that we do not comment on specific stocks here and have no place doing so if your question is only about that specific stock then it is off topic i have not tried to answer that part below the key to valuation is predicting the net present value of all of a company 's cash flows i.e. of their future profits and losses through a number of methods to long to explain here investment banks and hedge funds work out what they expect the company 's cash flows to be and trade so that these future profits losses etc are priced into the stock price since future cash flows profits or whatever you want to call them are priced in the price of a stock should n't move at all on an earnings statement this begs the question why do some stock prices move violently when they announce earnings the models that the institutional investors use are not perfect and can not take into account everything an unexpected craze for a product or a supply chain agreement breaking down on not being as good as it seems will not be factored into this pricing and so the price will move based on the degree to which expectation is missed or exceeded since penny socks are speculative their value is based far more on the long term expected cash flows and less on the short run cash flows this goes a long way to explaining why some of the highest market capitalisation penny stocks are those making consistent losses this means that they can be far less susceptible to price movements after an earnings announcement even if it is well out of the consensus range higher potential future value comes with the higher risks of penny stocks which discounts current value in the end if people 's expectation of the company 's performance reflects reality then the profitability is priced in and there will be no price movement if the actuality is outside of the expected range then there will be a price movement

if you 're refinancing a conforming fannie mae or freddie mac mortgage do n't go with an fha try a harp refinance which wo n't increase your mortgage insurance even if your home has lost value harp also limits the risk based pricing adjustments that can be charged so your rate should be very competitive with an fha mortgage even once you get the loan to value ratio down to 80 percent you still have mortgage insurance for several years plus the upfront costs in your case i think it 's a bad deal

you wo n't get reported to a credit bureau for an overdraft that 's a service offered internal to the bank   the only way it would affect your credit score is if you had an overdraft fee that you did n't pay which would get reported there 's is a system that gets a notice when you overdraft though   the bank might report you to chexsystems which is an agency that tracks the mishandling of accounts   generally a fee based overdraft is an agreement with you and the bank that they will charge you a fee this is desirable to the bank so they do n't report to chexsystems unless there 's some sort of abuse   banks view overdraft like a product for revenue generation and they encourage you to continue   examples of abuse are intentional overdrawing where the bank updates the account balances by batch jobs so that you can overdraft on an account that only has $ in it   banks check chexsystems to see if you have accounts to determine if you can open up another account though they 're mostly checking to see if you are leaving accounts in bad or negative status

to me your question emphasizes something i 've heard many times before personal finance is as much or more about behavior than it is about mathematics or head knowledge   sure you know you should n't be wasting a lot of money on something you will use very infrequently but how do you make this behavior stick   here are a few tricks that might help the other aspects of your question really touch more on psychology than finance   but getting yourself into a discipline habit with money will help   and realizing the full cash price of items in relation to how much your disposable income is will help you get control of your impulses as you review your budget monthly and keep limit yourself using the envelope system   but honestly everybody wants stuff they do n't have it 's human nature   the key is finding ways to put physical limits and guards on yourself to keep you from obeying the self destructive impulses

for stock options where i 'm used to seeing these terms volume is usually reported per day whereas open interest is cumulative in addition some volume closes positions and some opens positions   for example if i am long one contract and sell it to someone who was short one contract then that adds to volume and reduces open interest   if i hold no contracts and sell creating a short position to someone who also had no contracts then i add to volume and i increase open interest edit with the clarification in your comment then i would say some people opened and closed positions in that one day   their opening and closing trades both contribute to volume but they have not net position in the open interest

following 's advice i am posting this as an answer so it stands apart from the question but all the credit goes to whose instructions i followed i was able to get this collection completely deleted removed from the 2 bureaus that were reporting it using only the online dispute process of course your mileage may vary but here 's some more details that may be helpful to others equifax success 3 weeks after disputing the collection using the online dispute process and uploading my scanned final account statement to show that i paid the apartment complex i received an email confirmation that it is deleted i had to go to a webpage to get the actual result transunion success although i never heard back from tu my creditkarma account now shows that the collection is no longer on my tu report either i am not sure if this is because equifax deleted it and tu just followed suit or if tu did their own investigation ideas comments could help others their online dispute process out and did n't accept my upload so they would have had to contact the apartment complex so i was supposed to receive something by mail i still have n't but it 's definitely gone from my report experian it did n't show up on this report so i ca n't give any feedback i suppose it 's also worth noting that i did not ever have any contact with the collections agency i did visit the apartment office in person in order to get a copy of my final statement while there i spoke with the new manager who said she would try to reach up the chain of command to figure something out i 'm not sure how much difference if any this may have made as the complex is now owned by an entirely different company in fact the new manager had no idea who the old management company was much less which collections agency they used also worth noting removing the collection made my score rise from to i know because after getting the collection removed from my report i re applied for the auto loan i had been denied 3 weeks prior and they gave me my equifax score both times

i think you will find it hard to do there are money laundering regulations which require you to provide proof of address when opening an account i do n't know for certain if they require an uk address but even if they do n't it 's very likely that individual banks etc will require that i doubt that they will view you as a profitable customer for them since you would not be using the account as your main account although having a job is n't a legal requirement in practice i think it 's the only way you can get an account without having been resident in the country for a while my company employs a significant number of people from abroad and they typically need support from the company to open an account when they first move one thing you could investigate is opening an account with some international bank with branches both in hungary and the uk and asking them to arrange the uk account for you one example of such a bank is hsbc however such banks will typically charge you a significant amount for the privilege for example with hsbc you need a premier account to get this kind of service

if it was me i would organize something along these lines   in large part because down the road when it comes time to purge stuff like small receipts utility bills etc you 'll be doing it per year at the 7 year point or something similar year first under that major categories such as mortgage utilities credit major purchases home improvement other i 'd do a monthly breakdown for other since it 's likely to have a lot of little stuff and it up by month helps to organize it   but i 'd not bother with that for the other items since there 's going to be limited items in each one if you are scanning stuff on a regular basis and using a decent naming convention for the receipts then you could easily sort by date or name within any of the larger categories to see for example all the electric bills in order you might also want to look at a cloud service such as as an alternative to storing this stuff at home they also work with a number of companies to do electronic billing etc   in terms of retention if you are a homeowner save anything related to your mortgage and anything that goes towards the house even little maintenance stuff and any improvements as all of that goes against the cost basis of the house when you sell   generally after 7 years you are unlikely to need anything in the way of small receipts utility bills etc    in any case be sure you have regular backups offsite either by storing stuff in the cloud such as or via a regular backup service such as   you do n't want to lose all your records to a house fire natural disaster or having your computer stolen etc

i think this varies considerably depending on your situation   i 've heard people say 6 month 's living expenses and i know suze orman recommended bumping that to 8 months in our current economy my husband and i have no children lots of student loan debts but we pay off our credit cards in full each month and are working to save up for a house   we 've talked through a few different what if scenarios   if one of us were to lose our job we have savings to cover the difference between our reduced income and paying the bills for 6 or 8 months while the other person regained employment   if both of us were to lose our jobs simultaneously our savings would n't hold us over for more than 3 or 4 months but if that were to happen we would likely take advantage of the opportunity to relocate closer to our families and possibly even move in to my parent 's house for a short time   with no children and no mortgage our commitments are few so i do n't feel the need to have a very large emergency cash fund especially with student loans to pay off think through a few scenarios for your life and see what you would need   take into consideration expenses to break a rental lease cell phone contract or other commitments   then start saving toward your goal also see answers to a similar question here

i think it 's important to be clear what is being studied here it 's the effect of a more dramatic increase in the min wage than we 've seen before   there are many studies which show no negative effect at all on employment in situations where gradual increases in the min wage happen just like there are several well known studies that compare similar cities with different minimum wages that show no negative affect on employment in the city with the higher wage   but in none of those situations was the wage ever increased quite like it was in seattle so that 's the new thing to study here   so again the study is clearly not trying to say that raising the minimum wage has a negative effect on employment rather it 's looking at just this particular significant increase   for me this really is an indictment on the unwillingness of congress to gradually raise the minimum wage over time using some sort of sensible inflationary benchmark    had they been gradually inflating the wage over time to coincide with normal inflation we could see a $ 12 min wage already that had no effect on employment   so is the solution a sudden correction to get to the wage up to a liveable standard in one perhaps slightly painful to employment swoop or is it to go more gradually meaning that you 'll still remain decades behind inflation growth

rent the property is that a possible solution since selling the house is not an option and living in it is n't either then perhaps renting it is the way to go since no explanation for the sister 's motives is given i 'd speculate it is a mixture of emotional and financial concerns maybe mostly emotional i imagine letting go of the one physical thing that has memories of you and your parents attached to it is very difficult i do n't think getting a lawyer or doing what 's convenient for only your boyfriend is the way to go but that 's my own personal opinion clearly he only has one close family member left alive creating permanent wounds in that relationship will cost more along the way and quite frankly if the house is owned 50 50 do n't you need both owners to sign the deed to sell the house anyways if renting is not an option then maybe refinancing the mortgage to lower payments or airbnb it only half the time or rent it out for events to help with payments or ask the sister for a little money not for half the mortgage but at least a few hundred dollars to maintain the house and heat if she is indeed concerned with the property then maintaining it to prevent serious is in her interests no matter her income

you can move money in and out of the business at will just keep track of every transaction ideally you 'd use an accounting software like quickbooks or similar create a capital contributions account and every time you put money into the business checking account record it as a capital contribution likewise if you take money out of the business it comes from your capital accounts you can create a separate capital distributions account in your accounting software or just use a single account for contributions and distributions money coming in and out of those capital accounts is not taxable because you will pay taxes based on net earnings regardless of whether or not you have distributed any profits so there 's no need to make a loan to the company which would have tax consequences to reimburse yourself for purchases already made submit an expense report to the company if the company is unfunded right now you can make a capital contribution to cover current expenses submit the expense report and wait until you have some profits before paying out the expense report or making any distributions welcome to entrepreneurship

the key to understanding where your money is going is to budget   rather than tracking your spending after the fact budgeting lets you decide up front what you want to spend your money on   this can be done with cash envelopes on paper or on excel spreadsheets however in my opinion the best most flexible and easiest way to do this is with budgeting software designed for this purpose as i explained in another answer when it comes to personal budgeting software there are two different approaches those in which you decide what to spend your money on before it is spent and those that simply show you how your money was spent after it is gone   i recommend the first approach   software designed to do this include ynab mvelopes and everydollar my personal favorite is ynab   you 'll find lots of help video tutorials and even online classes with a live teacher on ynab 's website    using one of these packages will help you manage spending whether it is done electronically or with cash   when you pay for something with a credit card you enter your purchase into the software and the software adjusts your budget as if the money is already spent even if you have n't technically paid for the purchase yet as far as strategy goes here is what i recommend   get started on one of these and set up your budget right away   assign a category to every dollar in your account   do n't worry if it is not perfect   if you find later on that you do n't have enough money in one of your categories you can move money from another category if you need to   as you work with it you 'll get better at knowing how much money you need in each category my other recommendation is this do n't wait until the end of the month to download your transactions from the bank and fit everything into categories   instead enter your spending transactions into the software manually every day as you spend   this will do two things first you 'll have the latest up to date picture of where your accounts are in your software without having to guess   second it will help you stay on top of your spending   you 'll be able to see early on if you are overspending in a particular category   ynab has a mobile app that i use quite a bit but if i do n't get a chance to enter a purchase right when i spend it i make sure to keep a receipt and enter the transaction in that evening   it only takes a couple of minutes a day and i always know how i stand financially

if you live and work in the euro zone then even after a crash all of your income and most of your expenses will still be in euros   the only portion of your worth you need to worry about protecting is the portion you intend to spend on goods from outside the euro zone i.e. imports   in that case you may want to consider parking some of your money in short term government bonds issued by other countries such as the uk switzerland and usa or wherever else your favorite goods tend to come from   if the euro actually massively devalues an extremely unlikely scenario then you can expect foreign goods to cost a lot more than they do now   inflation might also pick up so you might also want to purchase some

it sort of depends on what happens in the future if the economy eventually comes back and the old norm returns then it will certainly be gen x who lost out the most because as stated this is the time gen x'ers should be taking the period the millenials are in right now and using it to maximize their wealth that 's a 10 20 year period and so far from 2008 2012 it 's been that 's up to 1/4 of their maximization period gone and they can never really get that back millenials still have time   on the flip side if the economy doesn't return then millenials will be in a lot of trouble what with the college debt they 've incurred and no means of ever really finding a career however if that ends up being the case i think we 're going to all be in a lot of trouble anyway so probably the millenials problems will end up paling in comparison to whatever else presents itself

the contract should address this issue it will specify the types of remedies and damages that would result if either side tries to back out of the deal there can be monetary penalties and the courts can force the seller to complete the deal where i have experienced this it generally takes only a gentle reminder from the agent regarding the consequences there is also limited indirect protection via the contract between the seller and their real estate agent many times that contract will require the seller to pay the agent their commission if there is n't a valid reason to cancel the deal the contract was to find a fully qualified buyer the threat of having to pay 6 of list price to the agent and not selling the house can be enough to get them to complete the deal all this assumes there was fraud which could bring in criminal penalties

there 's a serious mistake in your analysis granted in the traditional ira you avoid paying taxes on the $ 5000 now but you 're now stuck paying taxes on $ 2.2 million dollars when you withdraw it later obviously you 'll end up paying massively more than $ 1250 in taxes on this in the end as other people have pointed out if you can afford to cut the $ 1250 elsewhere in your budget you could still end up with the $ however let 's say just for argument that you do n't the question then becomes if you 're better off taking the tax hit on the $ 5,000 now or the $ 2.2 million later it also really matters how much money you 'll be withdrawing when you retire as well as how you 'll be doing the withdraws personally my goal is to be able to withdraw as much per year as my highest salary while working so clearly the roth ira is a good deal for me an important consideration here is that most people believe that their expenses will go down when they retire but the majority of retirees in some surveys have indicated that their expenses either stayed approximately the same or actually increased also quick reality check would the fact that you know you 'd be saving $ 1250 on your taxes by contributing to the ira actually cause you to contribute an extra $ 1250 to your retirement even if you personally would i highly doubt that most people with the exception of people who post on this site actually think that way especially given how little most people actually save for retirement

have you checked to see if anything else went missing walmart says that because i was not the original purchaser of the gift    card they could not help me directly just to build on what @littleadv already gave you my personal experience on this is that none of the companies that you 'll likely be dealing with in a situation like this will be falling over themselves to help you out unless it also helps them for some reason or if they 're compelled by consumer laws   if you think you should be protected from this sort of thing happening feel free to reference the fcra to see if you might get any consumer protections   but just from what you 've said here it does n't sound like you do so if anything else went missing or even if not it might have been someone working for citi who may have had access to more of your personal information than just your card   id theft is unfortunately common as a fairly easy crime to commit a hard one to protect yourself against and a very hard one to prosecute   when did you last check your credit report

for me it would be hard to leave all forms of money at home cash credit card debit card   there are times when you simply need to have money on hand   but here 's a simple idea i have that lets you bring your cards with you yet still puts up a hurdle to curb impulse buying when you 're in a situation where you want to buy something the card that 's in your wallet purse will be wrapped in your crafted reminder envelope   you 'll see the reminder which is hopefully enough   then in order to make a purchase you 'll need to tear it open   that should get you to think twice the one problem with the above is online purchases if you have memorized your card information add this rule for yourself   no online purchases without the payment card present and visible   i.e. you also must tear open the envelope for online purchases

i feel like you could talk this one down but only if you find a way to not be dismissive of the female employee this will be difficult since your tone makes it sound like you do n't seem to believe women when they tell you it 's not always fair to be female in the tech industry    for instance most women would never want to be hired for a quota or because they are attractive that belief also undercuts women when they do get hired because they are good at their jobs the pay gap is complicated and in part do to care giver responsibilities but that does n't make anyone feel less salty    anyways i suspect that if you told this female employee x had their opinion but we as a company hear your point of view in this and affirm her experience the issue will be withdrawn she is afraid she is in a culture and out    i do agree that calling a disagreement sexual harassment the issue and this personally irritates me but you 're going to get a lot of salty women if the culture of your company is to tell them you do n't believe their experiences as for firing do n't even think about it it only ends in shelling out a lot of money to her or lawyers

yes you will need to deposit the funds into your hsa then withdraw them to reimburse yourself for the expenses the tax deduction comes when you contribute deposit to your hsa   if you do not deposit the money there you will not be able to claim the deduction   your hsa provider reports the amount of your contributions to the irs so the amount you say you contribute to your hsa on your tax return has to match what your hsa provider reports when you deposit the money to your hsa you need to explicitly tell your provider that the contribution is for tax year 2014   the reason is that you want to make sure that they report the amount of your 2014 contributions to the irs correctly after you 've deposited the amount into your hsa you can withdraw it to reimburse yourself for an eligible medical expense   in order to be eligible it needs to be an expense that was incurred while you had the hsa in place   if you had your hsa account in place before you paid the expense no problem   but if you set up the hsa account after you paid for the expense you might be out of luck the distribution withdrawal will be a part of tax year 2015 and you 'll see this amount included as part of the gross distributions on your 1099-sa form next year when i first set up my hsa i did n't have any extra money to fund the hsa so i handled it just like you are talking about   i would wait until i had a medical bill then deposit the amount i needed into my hsa and withdraw it back out to pay the bill

as per irs publication question is money received from the sale of inherited property considered taxable income answer    to determine if the sale of inherited property is taxable you must first determine your basis in the property the basis of property inherited from a decedent is generally one of the following for information on the fmv of inherited property on the date of the decedent ’s death contact the executor of the decedent ’s estate also note that in 2015 congress passed a new law that under certain circumstances requires an executor to provide a statement identifying the fmv of certain inherited property to the individual receiving that property check irs.gov for updates on final rules being to implement the new law if you or your spouse gave the property to the decedent within one year before the decedent 's death see publication 551 basis of assets report the sale on schedule d form 1040 capital gains and losses and on form 8949 sales and other of capital assets under the new law passed by congress in 2015 an accuracy related penalty may apply if an individual reporting the sale of certain inherited property uses a basis in excess of that property ’s final value for federal estate tax purposes again check irs.gov for updates on final rules being to implement the new law for estates of who died in 2010 basis is generally determined as described above however the executor of a decedent who died in 2010 may elect out of the estate tax rules for 2010 and use the modified carryover of basis rules    under this special election the basis of property inherited from a decedent who died during 2010 is generally the lesser of under this special election for estates of who died in 2010 the executor of the decedent ’s estate may increase the basis of certain property that beneficiaries acquire from a decedent by up to $ 1.3 million plus certain unused built in losses and loss if applicable but the increased basis can not exceed the fmv of the property at the date of the decedent ’s death the executor may also increase the basis of certain property that the surviving spouse acquires from a decedent by up to an additional $ 3 million but the increased basis can not exceed the fmv of the property at the date of the decedent ’s death the executor of the decedent ’s estate is required to provide a statement to all heirs listing the decedent ’s basis in the property the fmv of the property on the date of the decedent ’s death and the additional basis allocated to the property contact the executor to determine what the basis of the asset is report the sale on schedule d form 1040 and on form 8949 as described above additional information

as a resident of new york state you will in addition to the federal income tax handled by the irs be responsible for state and local income taxes for new york the state tax forms are also used to determine your new york city tax if hr was either not aware of the local tax requirement for new york or you filled out the new york state version of the w-4 incorrectly you may have had too little tax withheld for new york state the refund from the irs is not dependent on the refund owe status for state and local taxes it is possible that your state taxes are fine but that you owe taxes to the city that tax you owe to the city will reduce the refund from the state and may require you to pay money to new york of course if you do itemize what you pay to the state and city may result in deductions on your federal form if you owe back taxes to the state or local government this could result in the irs seizing a federal refund but that does n't happen right away

i think the first misconception to clear up is that you are implying the price of a stock is set by a specific person it is not the price of a stock is equal to the value that someone most recently traded at if apple last traded at $ 100/share then apple shares are worth $ 100 if good news about apple hits the market and people holding the shares ask for more money and the most recent trade becomes $ 105 then that is now what apple shares are worth remember that generally speaking the company itself does not sell you its shares instead some other investor sells you shares they already own when a company sells you shares it is called a public offering to get to your actual question saying something is priced in implies that the market that is investors who are buying and selling shares in the company has already considered the impacts of that something for example if you open up your newspaper and read an article about ibm inventing a new type of computer chip you might want to invest in ibm but the rest of the market has also heard the news so everyone else has already traded ibm assuming that this new chip would be made that means when you buy even if sales later go up because of the new chip those sales were already considered by the person who chose the price to sell you the shares at one principle of the stock market not agreed to by all is called market efficiency generally if there were perfect market efficiency then every piece of public information about a company would be perfectly integrated into its stock price in such a scenario the only way to get real value when buying a company would be to have secret information of some sort it would mean that everyone 's collective best guess about what will happen to the company has been priced in to the most recent share trade

would have some data though a bit old about open end funds vs an etf that would be one point secondly do you know that the math on your etf will always work out to whole numbers of shares or do you plan on using brokers that would allow fractional shares easily this is a factor as $ 3,000 of an open end fund will automatically go into fractional shares that is n't necessarily the case of an etf where you have to specify a number of shares when you purchase as well as consider are you doing a market or limit order these are a couple of things to keep in mind here lastly what if the broker you use charges account maintenance fees for your account in buying the mutual fund from the fund company directly there may be a lower likelihood of having such fees i do n't know of any way to buy shares in the etf directly without using a broker

you are right in saying that you can not go over limit on most credit cards however with a debit card the majority of banks will extend an overdraft to you if your account goes overdrawn less than 0 the amount of overdraft extended will depend on your credit rating and standing with the bank and may not be extended if they think that the amount is too large or that you are a credit risk the drawbacks of overdrafts are that they are very expensive usually having a fixed fee for going into overdraft and charging a high rate of interest if this overdraft has not been with the bank these costs are usually much higher

e i disagree with your logic the ipo clearly did n't go well not relative to other ipos   were it not for the stocks underwriters stepping in late in the trading day facebook would likely have closed below their opening price this story and others indicate that institution investors were given negative information by an analyst for the underwriters that other investors did n't have   this inside knowledge is certainly contributing to the drop in the stock   it 's fair to argue that many individual investors were suckered into buying the stock at the ipo price because of this incomplete disclosure it would n't surprise if what 's happens has a negative impact on future trading volume and creates reluctance to invest in the firm which would certainly be an additional negative outcome beyond the dropping stock price edit dilip mentioned a lawsuit   here 's a link to an article about it

assuming a person knows how to use and invest their money wisely would it still be a bad idea to entirely disregard a 401k plan yes a 401k like an ira is a qualified plan and as such enjoys certain legal protections   for a roth 401k the taxes are paid now and the interest accumulates tax free and withdrawals will be tax free doing it on your own means that your own savings will have interest taxed as you earn it   for a traditional 401k current savings are deducted from current earnings and the withdrawals will be taxed doing it on your own loses the deferral of tax at this time    generally 401ks and iras are highly resistant to judgements in civil lawsuits if you file for bankruptcy protection at any time in your working career the assets in these accounts are immune in most states from being used to pay off your creditors if you do it on your own that savings account will be emptied to pay off creditors in bankruptcy and also will be assets that can be taken from you in civil judgements for example you get in a car accident and they sue you you might never be sued nor file bankruptcy in your entire life but you are unnecessarily exposing yourself to risks anything might happen in the next 50 years what you will lose in such circumstances far outweighs any perceived benefits you could possibly earn by rolling your own if you are the sort of person who can max out your 401k and ira contributions each year and still have a significant sum to set aside for savings you should contact an investment advisor and attorney to see about protecting your assets

the total number of shares on april 1st is 100 + 180 + 275 = 555   the price on april 1st is required   the current price is stated as $ 2 but $ 2 555 = $ and the current fund values is stated as $ 1500   opting to take the current value as $ 1500 the price on april 1st can be calculated as $ = $ the amounts invested as number of shares x share price are note these investment amounts do not match the example scenario 's investment amounts presumably because the example numbers are just made up the monthly returns can be calculated the current values for each investor as invested amount x returns are checking the total

it can be pretty hard to compute the right number what you need to know for your actual return is called the dollar weighted return this is the internal rate of return irr computed for your actual cash flows so if you add $ 100 per month or whatever that has to be factored in if you have a separate account then hopefully your investment manager is computing this if you just have mutual funds at a brokerage or fund company computing it may be a bunch of manual labor unless the brokerage does it for you a site like morningstar will show a couple of return numbers on say an s&p500 index fund the first is time weighted and is just the raw return if you invested all money at time a and took it all out at time b. they also show investor return which is the average dollar weighted return for everyone who invested in the fund so if people sold the fund during a market crash that would lower the investor return this investor return shows actual returns for the average person which makes it more relevant in one way these were returns people actually received but less relevant in another the return is often lower because people are on average doing dumb stuff such as selling at market bottoms you could compare yourself to the time weighted return to see how you did vs. if you 'd bought and held with a big lump sum and you can compare yourself to the investor return to see how you did vs. actual irrational people .02 it is n't clear that either comparison matters so much after all the idea is to make adequate returns to meet your goals with minimum risk of not meeting your goals you ca n't spend beating the market or matching the market or anything else to the market in retirement you can only spend cash so beating a terrible market return wo n't make you feel better and beating a great market return is n't necessary i think it 's bad that many investment books and advisors frame things in terms of a market benchmark market benchmarks have their uses such as exposing index hugging active managers that are n't earning their fees but to me it 's easy to get mixed up and think the market benchmark is the point i feel the point is to achieve your financial goals

do n't over think about your choices the most important thing to start now and keep adjusting and tuning your portfolio as you move along in your life each individual 's situation is unique start with something simple and straight forward like 100 your age in total stock market index fund and the remaining total bond market index fund for your 401k at least contribute so much as to get the maximum employer match its always good if you can contribute the yearly maximum in your 401k or ira once you have built up a substantial amount of assets ~ $ 50k+ then its time to think more about asset allocation and start buying into more specific investments as needed remember to keep your investment expenses low by using index funds also remember to factor in tax implications on your investment decisions eg buying an reit fund in a tax advantaged account like 40k is more tax efficient than buying it in a normal brokerage account

damn i just looked to confirm without reinvestment but just holding dividends looks like the return through 2013 is 0 and then there have been decent returns since 2013 but holy shit it does not look good at all all of that not adjusted for inflation   i wonder how much of that shitty performance can be reasonably classified as necessary due to the spin off of ge capital which generated a lot of the profit for ge but really was a huge problem for them when liquidity became scarce in 2008

you should also examine gross costs the us per capita is paying twice what canada does and is getting worse results lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality not exactly a bargain   a significant part of the rate of increase in costs is likely due to the shifting demographics bulge of baby boomers aging if you look at these topics you 'll see that there 's a a lot more folks in their 50 's than before and nearly one third of lifetime expenditures is incurred during middle age and nearly half during the senior articles   in the report you linked the medical trend reported includes the increases in both price inflation and utilization for 2009 so it 's impossible to say how much medical inflation there actual was i.e. is the cost of a flu shot rising faster slower than inflation which makes the report a bit slimy in that it compares directly against the rate of inflation

the original poster 's concern is valid   sometimes market orders do get executed at seemingly ridiculous prices in addition to victor 's reasons for using a market order sometimes a seller does not care how low the price is   for example after a company goes broke its stock continues to trade for a while   this allows shareholders to realize their losses for tax purposes and allows short sellers to close out their positions   a shareholder who is trying to realize a 10 dollar per share loss for tax purposes probably does not care whether he gets 10 cents per share or 0.001 cents per share so a sell at market order makes sense

you were told wrong lifetime learning credit is not a refundable credit i.e. it reduces your tax liability but you can not get refund if it exceeds your tax liability see the irs pub 970 for more information a tax credit reduces the amount of income tax you may have to pay    unlike a deduction which reduces the amount of income subject to tax    a credit directly reduces the tax itself the lifetime learning credit    is a credit this means that it can reduce your tax to    zero but if the credit is more than your tax the excess will not be    refunded to you you may be able to qualify for a different benefit the american opportunity credit this one is partially refundable see here for details this credit is available until 2017

the amount of money you have should be enough for you to live a safe but somewhat restricted life if you never worked again but it could set you up for just about any sort of financial goal short of island buying if you do just about any amount of work the basic math for some financial rules of thumb to keep in mind if your money is invested in very low risk ways such as a money market fund you might earn say 3 in interest every year that 's $ 36k but if you withdraw that $ 36k every year then every year you have the same principal amount invested and a dollar tomorrow ca n't buy as much as a dollar today because of inflation if we assume for simplicity that inflation is 1 every year then you need to contribute an additional $ 12k to your principal balance every year just so that it has the same buying power next year this leaves you with a net $ 24k of interest income that you can freely spend every year for the rest of your life without ever touching your principal balance if your money is invested more broadly including equity investments stocks you might earn say 7 every year some years you might lose money on your investments and would need to draw down your principal balance to pay your bills some years you might do quite well but would need to remain conservative and not withdraw your excess earnings every year because you will need that excess to make up for the bad years this would leave you with about $ of income every year before inflation and about $ after inflation but you would be taking on more risk by doing this if you work enough to pay your daily bills and leave your investments alone to earn 7 on average annually then in just 10 years your money would have doubled to ~ $ 2.4 million dollars this assumes that you never save another penny and spend everything you make it 's a level of financial security that means you could retire at a drop of the hat and if do n't start working for 20 years which you might need to do if you spend in excess of your means and your money dries up then the same will not be true starting work at 45 with no savings would put you at a much greater disadvantage for financial security every year that you work enough to pay your bills before retirement could increase your nest egg by 7 though again there is risk here but only if you do it now while you have a nest egg to invest now in terms of what you should do with that money you need to ask yourself what are your financial goals you should think about this long and hard and renew that discussion with yourself periodically as your goals will change over time you say university is n't an option but what other ways might you want to invest in yourself would you want to go on learning trips take a trade or learn a skill start a business do you want to live in the same place for 30 years and thus maybe you should lock down your housing costs by buying a house or do you want to travel around the world never staying in the same place twice in which case you will need to figure out how to live cheaply and flexibly without signing unnecessary leases if you want to live in the middle of nowhere eating ramen noodles and watching tv you could do that without lifting a finger ever again but every other financial goal you might have should be factored into your budget and work plan and because you do have such a large degree of financial security you have a lot of options that could be very appealing every low paying but desirable hard to get job is open to you you can pursue your interests even if they barely pay minimum wage and doing so may help you ease into your new life easier than simply retiring at such a young age when most of your peers will be heavy into their careers so that is my strongest piece of advice work now while you 're young and have motivation so that you can dial back later this will be much easier than the other way around as for where you should invest your money in look on this site for investing questions and ultimately with that amount of money i suggest you hire a paid advisor who works based on an hourly consultation fee rather than a management fee they can give you much more directed advice than the internet though you should learn it yourself as well because that will give you the best piece of mind that you are n't being taken advantage of

believe it or not this is done as a service to you the reason for this has to do with a fundamental difference between a credit card account and a checking account   with a credit card account there is no money in the account every charge is borrowed money when you get to your credit limit your credit transactions will start getting declined but if the bank does for some reason let one get approved it 's not a big deal for anyone it just means that you owe a little more than your credit limit note that almost every credit card transaction today is an electronic transaction   a checking account however has real money in it when it is gone it is gone when a balance inquiry is done the bank has no way of knowing how many checks you 've written that have not been cashed yet it is a customer 's responsibility to know exactly how much money is available to spend   if you write more checks than you have money for in your account technically you have committed a crime unfortunately there are too many people now that are not taking the responsibility of calculating their own checking account balance seriously and bad checks are written all the time when a bank allows these transactions to be paid even though you do n't have enough money in your account they are preventing a crime from being committed by you the fee is a finance charge for loaning you the money but it is also there to encourage you not to spend more than you have   even if you use a debit card it is still tied to a checking account and the bank does n't know if you have written enough checks to overdraw your account or not it is still your responsibility to keep track of your own available balance   every time this happens to you thank the bank as you pay this fee and then commit to keeping your own running balance and always knowing how much you have left in your account

this depends on a lot actually with the overall being your goals and how much you like risk    question what are your fees commissions for selling $ will wipe out some gains on those trades if all are sold with $ commission not including the commission payed when purchased that should be factored into the cost basis also i would recommend doing commission free etfs   you can get the same affect as a mutual fund without the fees associated with paying someone to invest in etfs and stocks on another note your portfolio looks rather risky   although everyone has their own risk preference so this might be yours but if you are thinking about a mutual fund instead of individual stocks you probably are risk averse i would suggest consulting with an adviser on how to set up for the future   financial advice is free flowing from your local barber dentist and of course stackexchange but i would look towards a professional disclaimer these are my thoughts and opinions only feel free to add comments below

question is what do we need to do as far as the irs is concerned i    mean we 'll get the money from them and pay it back less than two    months later you 're probably worried about the gift tax since you 're a couple the maximum exclusion amount is calculated like this the reason the pg multiplier stands separate is that gift splitting does require form 709 filed even if no tax is due unless they actually write separate checks for their respective portions so the math shows that you and your wife can get at least $ 28 k from anyone without the need of gift tax to be paid or gift tax return to be filed you can get up to $ 56 k from your parents but the gift splitting may need to be documented on form 709 since you 're in fact talking about a loan you 're going to repay you 'll need to document it with a note and everything and document the repayment if interest is being paid your parents must declare it on their tax return for the year obviously in this case if the loan is properly documented repaid and the interest is declared the irs wo n't even bother claiming it was a gift even if there 's no real interest it should n't be an issue the irs might assign some deemed interest at their rates that would be considered a gift but assuming no other gift transactions between you exist for the year the amount would be miniscule and way below the $ 14 k exclusion level of course as with any tax concern you get here what you paid for for a proper advice talk to a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state

the hard and fast rule is to pay off high interest loans first but each individual 's situation is different so there are some things to consider student loan interest is tax deductible up to $ 2,500   will your student loan interest exceed $ 2,500 for the year   if so i would try to pay down the student loan first to bring down the total interest for the year so that you get as much interest back as possible on your tax return   also it may be beneficial to pay off the car first to close that account so that you are only left with the 1 loan   once you have the car loan payment out of the way you can dedicate that amount to paying off the student loan i 'm in almost the same situation as you   i currently have a mortgage and car payment   in 6 months my grace period will be over and my student loan payments will start   i have $ 100k in student loan debt   so i will have a $ 1,100 mortgage payment $ 1,100 student loan payment and $ 700 car payment car loan is 0   i do n't want to have 3 loans active so i will pay off my car loan in a 2 3 months to get that out of the way   then i will pay down my student loan by paying $ 700 extra every month

i reread your question you are not asking about the validity of selling a particular stock after a bit of an increase but a group of stocks we do n't know how many   this is the s&p for the past 12 months trading at 1200 or so means that 80 100 points is an 8 move i count 4 such moves during this time   the philosophy of you ca n't go wrong taking a gain is tough for me to grasp as it offers no advice on when to get back in studies by firms such as dalbar you can google for some of their public material show data that supports the fact that average investors lag the market by a huge amount 20 years ending the s&p returned investor equity returns showed i can only conclude that this is a result of buying high and selling low not staying the course   the data also leads me to believe the best advice one can give to people we meet in these circumstances is to invest in index funds keeping your expenses low as you can i 've said this since read jack bogle decades ago and this advice would have yielded about over the 20 years beating the average investor by far by guaranteeing lagging the average by 10 basis points or so   a summary of the more extensive report citing the numbers i referenced is available for down load 2015 quantitative analysis of investor behavior it 's quite an eye opener and a worthy read the original report was dated 2009 but the link broke so i 've updated to the latest report 2015

i would at least encrypt the part of the drive you keep forms like that but not to protect myself from the odd villain who works for the irs    your broker does report your capital gains to the irs whether in sales or dividends    i received a bill last month from the irs for dividends i forgot to report on my 2013 return the bill contained a partial duplicate of my 1099-div form from the brokerage and included account numbers and ssn therefore it 's safe to say irs employees do n't need to hack your laptop in order to get that info as for minimum information it depends on your broker call them and ask they 'll tell you everything you need to know   vanguard for example has some security questions among other things

well yes it does but just because the debt is trading at 80 cents on the dollar does n't mean that the company can actually legally get away with paying only 80 cents on the dollar they would have to come to an agreement with the debt holders first and perhaps they could but the more conservative approach is to use the book value of the debt   or what about debt that 's trading at a premium to its face value because say interest rates have come down relative to the time the debt was issued the amount that the owes to the debt holders has n't suddenly gone up

well you have to understand that even when working full time at minimum wage you generally have very little money or time that can go towards going to school having kids or having any kind of fun at all in life do you really understand what it 's like to start from the bottom it 's always getting worse for the bottom subset so it 's always getting more difficult to change their lives   it 's not impossible but it actually is incredibly unfair this is not a society this is not a utilitarian society all the rich really want is to feel like they are better people than others they do n't have the incentive to want to actually make people better around them when almost everything is owned in society and you do n't own any of it than you yourself are effectively owned as well

it depends on the type of loan   fully amortized loans have a schedule of payments do n't recalculate as you pay   if you want to make an additional payment you need to contact the lender to apply your payment toward principle and the loan   otherwise all your additional payment will do is change the amount due on your next payment or push out your next payment due date regarding interest calculation you owe interest on the principle outstanding   say you have a 10 year loan 120 months at 5 apr and a $ 1,000 payment this means you borrowed roughly $ each month the amount of interest owed reduces because there is less principle outstanding   the reason loans are amortized like this is so the borrower has a predictable known monthly amount due

i think this advice to carry a balance each month is nonsense   you 're just wasting money that way   personally i have always paid off my credit cards every month for as long as i can remember and my credit score is only 8 points below the max   the bigger factors by far are it might be good advice to charge a small amount each month on your credit cards each month in order to keep seldom used accounts active remember longer payment history is better but there 's no reason not to pay off the balance to avoid the interest charges   in short the ideal balance to carry month to month on a credit card is zero

i read about the 90 90 90 rule aka 90 of the people lose 90 of the money in 90 days   anything that happens in 90 days or less is speculation effectively gambling not investment and the 90 90 90 thing sounds around right for inexperienced amateurs going up against professionals in that space i do n't know anyone who actually made significant amount money by investing in stocks or other financial products except those appearing in tvs lots and lots and lots of people do   i heard that people who actually encourage common people to invest in stocks are stock brokers and fund managers who actually gain by the fact that more people invest   no it 's true that lots of people will give you advice to by specific stocks or financial instruments that will earn them comission or fees but the basic idea of investing in the stock market is very sound ultimately it 's based on the ability of companies to create value and pay dividends could you please give some valid reasons to invest in stocks or other financial market thank you well what else can you do with your money put it in an interest bearing bank account effectively you 'll still be investing in the stock market the bank is just taking most of the returns in exchange for guaranteeing that you 'll never lose money even temporarily

is the mortgage debt too high the rental property is in a hot re market so could be easily sold with significant equity however they would prefer to keep it given the current income there is no stress however in absence of any other liquid cash near cash assets having everything locked into mortgage is quite high even if real estate builds assets these are highly illiquid investments have debt on such investments is risky if there are no other investments essentially everything looks fine now but if there is an crisis unwinding mortgage debt is time consuming and if it forces distress sale it would wipe out any gains can they afford another mortgage and in what amount e.g. they are considering $ 50 k for a small cabin which could be rented out i guess they can but should they or diversify into other assets like stocks etc other than setting cash aside what would be some good uses of funds to make sure the money would appreciate and outpace inflation and add a nice bonus to retirement mutual funds stocks 401 k or other such retirement plans they are currently in 's if there is one key strategy or decision they could make today that would help them retire early say 's what should it be this opinion based it depends on what their lifestyle is and what would they want their lifestyle to be when they retire they should look at saving enough corpus that would give an year on year yield equivalent to the retirement expenses

this is the exactly wrong thing to do especially in the age of algorithmic trading   consider this event from 2010   chart source   another similar event occurred in 2015 and there was also a currency flash crash in that year as you can see the s&p 500 and basically the entire market dropped nearly 7 in a matter of minutes   it regained most of that value within 15 minutes if you are tempted to think that 7 is n't that big of a deal you need to understand that specific securities will have a much bigger drop during such events   for example the s&p 500 low volatility etf was down 45 at one point on aug 24 2015 but closed less than 6 down consider what effect a stop loss order would have on your portfolio in that circumstance   you would not be able to react fast enough to buy at the bottom   the advantage of long term investing is that you are immune to such additionally as asked by others what do you do once you 've pulled out your money   do you wait for a big jump in the market and hop back in   the risk here is that you are on the sidelines for the gains   by missing out on just a small number of big days you can really hurt your long term returns

there is a misunderstanding    the business and the owner are not the same entity   you said    i give the business $ 25,000 and take 50 of the business no you can give the owner of the business 25 k and now he has 25 k and 50 of a 50 k business    that 25 k sits in mr. smith 's bank account not acme widget 's account    a more simple example is when you buy a car   the money goes to the car dealership it does not get put into the car 's glove box you may be thinking of an investor in a business   he could pump $ $ into the business as operating capital for a share of the business   in that case it would be a bit unfair to get 50 of the business for a 25k.   however the owner may be interested in doing such a deal because value of the investor can add more than just $ $ to the business   having a celebrity investor might do more good for the business than the actual dollars another situation is that the owner might be desperate   without a influx of cash the whole business might end there are guidelines to business evaluation but valuing them is not an easy thing

from wikipedia investment has different meanings in finance and economics in finance    investment is putting money into something with the expectation of    gain that upon thorough analysis has a high degree of security for    the principal amount as well as security of return within an    expected period of time in contrast putting money into something with    an expectation of gain without thorough analysis without security of    principal and without security of return is speculation or gambling the second part of the question can be addressed by analyzing the change in gold price vs inflation year by year over the long term as chuck mentioned there are periods in which it did n't exceed inflation more important over any sufficiently long length of time the us stock market will outperform those who bought at the 87 peak are n't doing too bad yet those who bought in the last gold bubble have n't kept up with inflation $ 850 put into gold at the 80 top would inflate today to $ per the inflation calculator you can find with a bit of charting some periods where gold outpaced inflation and some where it missed back to the definition of investment i think gold fits speculation far better than it does investment i 've heard the word used in ways i 'd disagree with spend what you will on the shoes but no they are n't an investment i tell my wife the treadmill purchase may improve my health and people may use the word colloquially but it 's not an investment

you got some answers that essentially inform you that ceos that have £ 200k written on their may in fact get much more i 'll take the opposite point of view and talk about people who according to whatever definition have a £ 200k year income   how can they afford it guess no 1 not all of them can in the sense that it is quite possible to end up with negative net worth at £ 200k year income particularly if you immediately want to show off with brand new luxury cars luxury holidays and a large house in a very representative region   guess no 2 not all of the £ 200k year ceos are equally visible there is a trade off between going for wealth large house and luxury car i deliberately ordered the three points according to increased display of wealth however display of wealth usually comes at a cost in a very monetary sense and there are ways to get much display without having much wealth see below lease the car also the mortgage on the house usually is n't displayed on the outside    you also need to take into account how long they are already building up wealth i guess the typical ceo with £ 200k year you 're asking about did not just finish school and enter his work life in this position it would be very interesting to see how income accumulating wealth and possibly displayed wealth correlate my guess is that the correlation between income and accumulated wealth is n't that high and the correlation between displayed and actual wealth is probably even lower they possess luxury cars large house and huge savings are you sure these are the same managers e.g. the ones with the huge savings   are and the ones with the luxury cars i 'm asking particularly about the luxury cars because such cars loose value very quickly and/or are often not owned by the driver but rather by the bank or leasing company which on the other hand offers the more savings oriented ceo who is not that much interested in having a brand new luxury car the possibility to go for a one year old and save the rest knowing that your ceo should be able to buy a one year old mercedes sl 350 year or a new one every 1 1/2 years without building up savings or buying a house however building up wealth will be much faster with the ceo going for the one year old as the brand new car option amounts to loosing ca £ 20 30k within a year an even more savings oriented ceo who keeps his existing mercedes 300 td for another few years thinking that this conservative choice of car will be trust inspiring to the customers or goes for the thinking that most people anyways do n't know that the k between sl and halves the price   however if you just want to be seen with the car after an initial payment of say £ 8 10k you can get a decent 350 not the base model either at a monthly rate of ca or less than £ 7k year note however that this money does not count towards any kind of wealth it 's just renting a nice car   in other words if driving the 350 is your absolute goal you could in theory have that with a net salary of £ 25k year according to your tax calculation that should be somewhere around £ 35k year gross if you have the savings for the initial payment being able to make the initial payment may also help the leasing company that you 're serious about it and able to pay your rates    there are also huge differences in value between large houses compare e.g. these 2 and last but not least there is a decided one way component in the timing of priorities here it is much easier to go and get a luxury car when you have savings than first going for the luxury car and then trying to make up with the savings     i forgot to answer the question in the of your question how do i build wealth by going on to live as if your income were only £ 50k as far as that is compatible with your job i gather the median gross income in the uk is about £ 30k so aiming at £ 50k leaves you a very comfortable budget for luxury spending   if you want to build up wealth faster adjust that in general if you can manage to withhold much of any income increase from spending that will help trivial but powerful truth from the leasing calculation you can conclude that you basically have no chance to show off your wealth by luxury cars that is you 'd need to go for luxury cars that are completely incompatible with with building if you want to show your built up wealth by the car there are too many people who even destroy their existing wealth in order to display luxury   at least if anyone is around who has either a correct idea what luxury cars cost or do n't cost or will look that up in the internet also people who know such things may also have the idea that the probability that such a car was downright paid wealth is small compared to the probability of meeting a   leased or mortgaged car which means the plan to show off does n't work out that well with the people you 'd want to impress as for the other people just a bit of display you can get far cheaper if you really want to drive the rent it for an occasion weekend rather than for years i met a sales manager who told me which rental cars they get when important customers from far east are visiting the rest of the year they drive normal business cars you may want to choose a rental company that does n't write their name on the license plate apply the same ideas to the decision of buying a house think about what you want for yourself and then look where you can get how much of that for how much money oh and by the way if i understand correctly the average uk ceo wage is   £ 120k not £ 200k

this is perfect for the eli5 posts that always come up on this topic   great article   i 'd be interested in seeing a little more on the regulatory aspects of derivative contracts   derivatives are complex because the associated risks are complex   when banks insurers and other entities large enough to have a chief risk officer enter into these contracts the assumption is that they know what they 're doing so to my knowledge they 're generally lightly regulated   additionally those that understand derivatives enough to regulate them are unlikely to work for the comparatively low wages that they 'd get in government that said i 'd be interested in seeing something discussing the challenges in regulating something like this   even before 2008 there were some pretty big failures involving derivatives where risk was not adequately managed that probably would n't have been avoided with stronger regulation

the important thing to realize is what would you do if you did n't have the call if you did n't have call options but you wanted to have a position in that particular stock you would have to actually purchase it but having purchased the shares you are at risk to lose up to the entire value of if the company folded or something like that   a call option reduces the potential loss since you are at worst only out the cost of the call and you also lose a little on the upside since you had to pay for the call which will certainly have some premium over buying the underlying share directly risk can be defined as reducing the variability of outcomes so since calls shorts etc reduce potential losses and also slightly reduce potential gains they pretty much by definition reduce risk it 's also worth noting that when you buy a call the seller could also be seen as hedging the risk of price decreases while also guaranteeing that they have a buyer at a certain price so they may be more concerned about having cash flow at the right time while at the same time reducing the cost of the share losing in value than they are losing the potential upside if you do exercise the option shorts work in the same way but opposite direction to calls and forwards and futures contracts are more about cash flow management making sure you have the right amount of money in the right currency at the right time regardless of changes in the costs of raw materials or currencies while either party may lose on the transaction due to price fluctuations both parties stand to gain by being able to know exactly what they will get and exactly what they will have to pay for it so that certainty is worth something and certainly better for some firms than leaving positions exposed of course you can use them for speculative purposes and a good number of firms people do but that 's not really why they were invented

if you 're going to be a day trader you really need to know your stuff   it 's risky to say the least one of the most important elements to being successful is having access to very fast data streams so that you can make moves quickly as trends stat to develop in the markets   if you 're planning on doing this using consumer grade sites like etrade that 's not a good idea   the web systems of many of the retail brokerage firms are not good enough to give you data fast enough for you to make good timely decisions or to be able to execute trades way that day traders do in order to make their money   many of those guys are living on very thin margins sometimes just a few cents of movement one way or the other so they make up for it with a large volume of trades one of the reasons you were told you need a big chunk of money to day trade is that some firms will rent you out a desk and computer access to day trade through their systems if you 're really serious about it   they will require you to put up at least a minimum amount of money for this privilege and $ 25k may not be too far out of the ballpark if you 've never done day trading before be careful   it does n't take much to get caught looking the wrong way on a trade that you ca n't get out of without losing your shirt unless you 're willing to hold on to the stock which could be longer than a day day trading sounds very simple and easy but it is n't   you need to learn about how it works a good book to read to understand this market is flash boys by michael lewis besides being very entertaining because it is a space filled with very sophisticated well funded firms and individuals who spend huge sums of money to gain miniscule advantages in the markets be careful whatever you do   and do n't play in day trading with your retirement money or any other money you ca n't afford to walk away from i hope this helps good luck

well reserve requirements concern as the name suggests the reserves e.g. a position on the balance sheet the price of equity only marginally impacts the balance sheet via positions in their own stock not nearly strong enough to be significant the french banks mainly had trouble with liquidity this year we witnessed another collapse of the interbank lending market just as in 2007 watch the libor o n spread and solvency through deterioration of the asset side of the balance sheet    naturally your ability to raise additional equity is influenced by the historic return of your stock but sharp price drops in fact can help you to raise equity simply because your ratios improved p e p b in fact any ratio that includes the price part and the stock became cheaper see ubs singapore gic and gs warren buffet

well i used to intern at a company finding its not easy there are prospecting tools like and but they are ridiculously expensive around $ 400 a month most advisers find clients through references so you 're going to have to network with cpas law firms and other advisers and get them to send you people what can you offer in return there is also the path of cold calling or setting up a website but those inevitably run into finra problems thus it tends to be a slow process that is built up over time the best thing you can do is create a niche for yourself and cater to it- so for example you can specialize in the retirement planning for certain occupations or under certain conditions however bear in mind wealth advisory is turning into a zero sum industry and software is going to make it even more compressed in the future my firm spent thousands of dollars on marketing and even then 3 5 new clients a year is good progress but these were also large accounts    what is your background

gt;so i am unsure of whether or not re selling other supplier ’s inventory without their consent is legal   you should n't wait to find out after you start making sales   gt;is using generic names for sale a workaround for selling inventory without their consent   that sounds like an issue concerning around unauthorized resale of merchandise issues   if you 're concerned that buying a company 's product from a canadian distributor might not be authorized for resale in the united states you should first ask the reseller and then ask the company if not provided with a satisfactory answer not getting that answer beforehand could be disastrous   generally speaking however let 's assume you 've got your logistics figured out you need to find a specialized need in the market that bigger suppliers ca n't meet if staples is selling bulk plain paper to get people in the door you're never going to compete with them you have to look for areas where companies like that ca n't compete for example a martin king jr. day themed line of stationary would be something you 'd never find at staples but some people would buy in a heart beat the trick is to find the biggest types of these ignored segments of buyers not addressed by larger players and start your way into the market    first step is to find your and supply this will probably be a balancing act in that many suppliers will could give you good rates but not have the products you need the second step if you 're selling online is to develop effective digital marketing strategy to target your niche 's keywords

this will work as intended but there 's another point to consider in the us the tax rate on proceeds from stock sales is higher for short term holdings which are defined as held for less than one year both rates vary based on your income bracket numbers are for fiscal year 2014 filing as single the difference between short and long term capital gains tax in the us is a minimum of ten percentage points and works out to 15 percentage points on average this is substantial if you wo n't be reporting much income the year you move to the us say because you only worked for a portion of the year it is decidedly to your advantage to wait and sell the stocks in the us to get that sweet 0 rate at a minimum you should hold the position for a year if you sell and rebuy from a tax optimization perspective two caveats

the post that you linked to saying that a pre paid credit card is really a debit card is kind of right and kind of wrong   from your point of view to get a $ 1000 pre paid credit card you need to hand over $ 1000 so nobody is giving any credit to you you can only spend money that you actually own like a debit card   for the merchant accepting your card it is exactly like a credit card he does n't know what deals you had to make to get the card the merchant just knows that up to some amount he will receive money so in that sense it is a credit card and will be accepted like a credit card

you need to hope that a fund exists targeting the particular market segment you are interested in for example searching for cloud computing etf throws up one result you 'd then need to read all the details of how it invests to figure out if that really matches up with what you want there 'll always be various trade offs the fund manager has to make for example with this fund one warning is that this etf makes allocations to larger firms that are involved in the    cloud computing space but derive the majority of their revenues from    other operations bear in mind that today 's stock prices might have already priced in a lot of future growth in the sector so you might only make money if the sector exceeds that predicted growth level and vice versa if it grows but not that fast you could lose money if the sector grows exactly as predicted stock prices might stay flat though you 'd still make a bit of money if they pay dividends also note that the expense ratios for specialist funds like this are often quite a bit higher than for general market funds they are also likely to be traded less frequently which will increase the bid ask spread i.e. the cost of buying into and getting out of these funds will be higher

in short your scenario could work in theory but is not realistic generally speaking you can borrow up to some percentage of the value of the property usually 80 90 though it can vary based on many factors   so if your property currently has a value of $ 100k you could theoretically borrow a total of $ 80 90k against it   so how much you can get at any given time depends on the current value as compared to how much you owe   a simple way to ballpark it would be to use this formula =      if your available equity allowed you to borrow what you wanted and you then applied it to additions renovations your base property value would hopefully increase   however as other people mentioned you very rarely get a value increase that is near what you put into the improvements and it is not uncommon for improvements to have no significant impact on the overall value   just because you like something about your improvements does n't mean the market will agree just for the sake of argument though lets say you find the magic combination of improvements that increases the property value in line with their cost   if such a feat were accomplished your $ 40k improvement on a $ 100k property would mean it is now worth $ 140k   let us further stipulate that your $ 40k loan to fund the improvements put you at a 90 loan to value ratio   so prior to starting the improvements you owed $ 90k on a $ 100k property   after completing the work you would owe $ 90k on what is now a $ 140k property putting you at a loan to value ratio of   meaning you theoretically have 26 equity available to borrow against to get back to the 90 level or roughly $ 36k   note that this is 10 less than the increase in the property value   meaning that you are in the realm of diminishing returns and each iteration through this process would net you less working capital the real picture is actually a fair amount worse than outlined in the above ideal scenario as we have yet to account for any of the costs involved in obtaining the financing or the decreases in your credit score which would likely accompany such a pattern   each time you go back to the bank asking for more money they are going to charge you for new appraisals and all of the other fees that come out at closing   also each time you ask them for more money they are going to your credit and see the additional inquires and associated debt stacking up which in turn drops your score which prompts the banks to offer higher interest rates and/or charge higher fees also when a bank loans against a property that is already securing another debt they are generally putting themselves at the back of the line in terms of their claim on the property in case of default   in my experience it is very rare to find a lender that is willing to put themselves third in line much less any farther back   generally if you were to ask for such a loan the bank would insist that the prior commitments be paid off before they would lend to you   meaning the bank that you ask for the $ 36k noted above would likely respond by saying they will loan you $ 70k provided that $ 40k of it goes directly to paying off the previous equity line

unless you are getting the loan from a loan shark it is the most common case that each payment is applied to the interest accrued to date and the rest is applied towards reducing the principal   so assuming that means 26 equally spaced payments during the year the interest accrued at the end of the first fortnight is $ x = $ and so the principal is reduced by $ $ = $ for the next payment the principal still owing at the beginning of that fortnight will be $ = $ and the interest accrued will be $ x = $ and so slightly more of the principal will be reduced than the $ of the previous payment   lather rinse repeat until the loan is paid off which should occur at the end of 17.5 years or after biweekly payments if the loan rate changes during this time since you say that this is a variable rate loan the numbers quoted above will change too and no it is not the case that just 5.75 of the $ 2300 is interest and the rest comes off the principle sic interest is computed on the principal amount still owed $ for starters and then decreasing not the loan payment amount edit   after playing around with a spreadsheet a bit i found that if   payments are made every two weeks 14 days apart rather than 26 equally spaced payments in one year as i used above interest accrues at the rate of 5.75 x for the 14 days rather than at the rate of for the time between payments as i used above each 14 days $ is paid as the biweekly mortgage payment instead of the $ stated by the op then payments slightly less than 17.5 calendar years when leap years are taken into account will pay off the loan   in fact that payment should be reduced by 65 cents   in view of rounding of fractional cents and the like i doubt that it would be possible to have the last equal payment reduce the balance to exactly 0

the can and the should have been discussed in other answers and comments   and so i will discuss the how   as others have noted it is important to make sure that the additional money goes to reducing principal and not towards   prepayment of interest   unfortunately very few bank tellers understand how mortgages work and very few bank officers even loan officers understand how mortgages work too thus a statement that you want the extra money to go towards principal will likely be met with a blank look furthermore what they do with the money and how it is entered on the bank books that afternoon when the transactions are recorded may have no to what was discussed and agreed to earlier in the day   based on my personal experiences and   many arguments with banks about how they handled my prepayments and how interest was computed i would   recommend the following which is easier now that automated payments are possible for the standard monthly payment and additional payments are possible via electronic funds transfer make sure that automated payments are made on the day that the payment is due not at the end of the ten day grace period that banks love to grant you for making the monthly payment yes there is no penalty for late payment as long as you pay before the end of the grace period but interest continues to be charged and so more of each delayed payment goes to interest   and less towards principal make the additional payment on the same day as the standard monthly mortgage payment is made this ensures that at worst just one day 's interest is owing when the additional payment is made also payment in the middle of the monthly cycle is an almost sure way of getting ripped off on the interest because the bank 's computers will post the payment in the manner most favorable to them and usually contrary to the terms of your mortgage   i have   complained to banks about mid month payments and won every time and on many occasions the bank officer would say we have always done it this way and nobody   ever complained till you did today i doubt very much if the bank 's programs got changed as a result of my complaints if you are not sure how mortgages work and how interest   is calculated or do n't have the time or inclination to go hassle with the bank each time but do prefer not to get ripped off make the payment as described on the dot and at the same time as the regularly scheduled monthly payment the amortization schedule that the bank should have given you shows how much the principal amount is after the monthly   payment is made on each due date   assuming that you have   not been taking advantage of the grace periods and so the schedule is correct make an additional payment not of a round sum but an exact amount down to the last penny that will jump you from principal owing after today 's regular payment to principal owing after the regular payment n months from today here of course you choose n based on how much extra money you were planning on paying towards your mortgage   by making the extra payment you will effectively have cut the length of   the mortgage by n months and the same amortization schedule will apply over the shorter period   since very little of the principal is repaid in the early life of the mortgage an additional principal only payment can reduce the length of the mortgage by years paying a specific amount that matches the amortization schedule also helps if you ever need to hassle with the bank it is their print out you are arguing from and not trying to explain to a clueless bank officer how the bank did not compute interest   correctly after you paid $ extra at beginning of last month

it includes whatever you want to do with your investment   at least initially it 's not so much a matter of calculating numbers as of soul searching   identifying your investment objectives means asking yourself why do i want to invest   then you gradually ask yourself more and more specific questions to narrow down your goals   for instance if your answer is something very general like to make money then you may start to ask yourself how much money do i want what will i want to use that money for when will i want to use that money etc   of course not all objectives are realistic so identifying objectives can also involve down plans that are too one thing that can be helpful is to first identify your financial objectives that is money you want to be able to have and things you want to do with that money   investment in the sense of purchasing investment vehicles likes stocks or bonds is only one way of achieving financial goals other ways include working for a paycheck starting your own business etc   once you identify your financial goals you have a number of options for how to get that money and you should consider how well suited each strategy is for each goal for instance for a financial goal like paying relatively small short term expenses e.g. your electric bill investing would probably not be the first choice for how to do that because a there may be easier ways to achieve that goal e.g. ask for a raise eat out less and b the kinds of investment that could achieve that goal may not be the best use of your money e.g. because they have lower returns

it sounded an interesting question so i looked it up the reason i asked about the tax years is because it matters if the bonus was paid and then returned in the same year it should not appear on your w2 at all and your taxes would be calculated accordingly you might end up with overpayment of fica taxes but you can get that credited on your tax return if however the repayment is not in the same year as the payment it becomes more complicated the code section that deals with it is 26 usc what it says in short is this you can deduct the repaid amount from your current taxable income but only if its more than $ 3000 the tax benefit of such deduction can not exceed the actual tax paid on this in the year when you got the bonus i.e. you need to calculate that year with the amount and without the amount the credit can not exceed the difference but it can also not exceed the amount you would be paying on that amount in the current year i.e. if current taxes are less than that year you lost the difference if the signing bonus is less than $ 3000 and it spans across tax years you can not deduct it bummer

i say before investing your real capital into the stock market play around on the virtual stock exchange game it let 's you invest with virtual capital and you can gain experience with the stock market i would n't start investing in stock until i 'm sure i can cover losses though if you do intend to invest stocks so early in your career then you should learn how to read sec filings not necessary but helpful in understanding how investors think such as documents so you can predict profitability and growth of companies you invest in once you become a veteran of the stock market game you probably wo n't need to read the sec filings into too much detail especially if you have a diverse portfolio good luck the one takeaway from this message would probably be stop and play around on virtual stocks before yourself in the real thing

well first off yes every year the younger generation grows up but remember that the older generation also dying off leaving the market place also what happens if the younger generation ca n't take up enough debt in order to pay for previous commitments   secondly i think you 're confusing the money supply with actual production the two are pretty much divorced from each other money does n't require a resource per se at least not since leaving the gold standard it just requires that someone is able willing to take on debt for example every time you take a loan out from the bank you are effectively creating money this is called bank credit and if you live in a country that uses fractional reserve banking then it makes up a very large part of your money supply think like up to 95 when bank 's create money they only create the principle amount ie the original loan amount and not the interest amount as well this means that someone else needs to take out a loan so that you can repay the amount in interest that you owe on your new loan this does n't normally affect you because there are lots of people taking out lots of loans all the time and money is circulating around in the economy the problem is that eventually the system gets to a stage where people ca n't really take out loans any more they just have too much debt and so you end up with a liquidity crisis like in 2008    so what i was saying is that either i 'm missing something pretty obvious and i 've got this wrong or this is exactly how it works and economists like to just ignore it for the benefits that it offers

the reason that funds and the like are bad is n't because of the leverage ratio it 's because they 're compounded daily and the product of all the doubled daily returns is not mathematically equivalent to the double the long term return i 'd consider providing big fancy equations using pi as the product of elements in a sequence operator and other calculus but that would be overkill i do n't think i can do here and i do n't know the relevant anyway anyway from the economics theory perspective the ideal leverage ratio is 1x that is unlevered straight investment consider using leverage costs money you know that surely if someone could borrow money at n% and invest at an expected where x > 0 then they would they would borrow all the money they could and buy all the s&p500 they could but when they bought all that s&p500 they 'd eventually run out of people who were willing to sell it for that cheap that would mean the excess return would be smaller eventually you 'd get to a point where the excess return is zero well no empirically we can see that it 's definitely not zero and that in the real world that stocks do return more than bonds why   because stocks are riskier than bonds the difference in expected return between an index like the s&p500 and a us treasury bond is due to the relative riskiness of the s&p500 which is n't guaranteed by the us government to return your principal any money that you make off of leverage comes from assuming some sort of a risk now assuming risk can be a profitable thing to do but there are also a lot of people out there with higher risk tolerance than you like insurance companies and billionaires so the market is n't exactly short of people willing to take risks and you should n't expect the returns of assuming risk in the general case to be awesome now it 's true that investing in an unlevered fashion is risky also but that 's not an excuse to go leveraged anyway it 's a reason to hold back in fact regular stocks are sufficiently risky that most people probably should n't be holding a 100 stock portfolio they should be that risk with bonds instead and increasing the size of their bond holdings over time the appropriate time to use leverage is when you have information which limits your risk you have done research and have reason to believe that you understand the future of an individual stock index better than the rest of the stock market does you calculate that the potential for achieving returns with leverage outweighs the risks then you dump your money into the leveraged position in exchange for this the market receives information about anticipated future returns of this instrument because of the price movement which occurs as a result of someone putting his money where his mouth is if you 're just looking to dump money into broad market in a leveraged fashion you 're doing it wrong there is no free money ed which is not to say there 's not money there 's lots of money but if you go looking for the free kind you wo n't find it and may end up with money that you thought was free but was actually quite expensive edit okay so you do n't like my answer i 'm not surprised i 'm giving you a real answer instead of a make free money answer okay here 's your how to make free money answer assume you are using a constant leverage ratio over the length of time you 've invested your money and you do n't get to just jump into and out of the market that 's market timing not leverage so you have to stay invested you 're going to have a scenario which falls into one of these categories the s&p500 historically rises over time the average rate of return probably exceeds the average interest rate so the ideal leverage ratio is infinite of course this is a stupid answer in real life because you ca n't pull that off your risk tolerance is too low and you will have trouble finding a lender willing to lend you unsecured money and you 'll probably lose all your money in a crash sooner or later ultimately it 's a stupid answer because you 're asking the wrong question you should probably ask a better question when i use leverage to gain additional exposure to risk am i being properly compensated for assuming that risk

gt consumers do n't want a conversation with minimum wage employees who do n't give a damn   correct however consumers do want to have a conversation with employees who do give a damn    some of the happiest customers i 've had are the ones that i get to talk to one on one about the shoes they are interested in whether the customer knows what they are looking for or if they need help finding the right product they always appreciate talking to an employee who can confidently explain which features make a shoe the right fit for them    if we do n't have the right fit for the customer we can actually try to find it online and purchase it right then and there for them 99 of the responses to that are along the lines of well i 'd rather try it on first

gt vegetarian foods were added to the traditional mix two years ago to address the rise in youth obesity   there 's so much misinformation about vegetarian food   veggie burgers are often made with a lot of vegetable oil and can have the same number of calories as a burger   and if they had fries potato chips potato salad etc any of those things would contribute more to the added mostly empty calories of the meal than the burger   too often people go vegetarian for health reasons and then fail to take any of the supplements they need to to make up for the nutrients they are n't getting naturally from meat   and they end up eating a bunch of carbs and food high in vegetable oil     a healthy diet including moderate portions of meat is more healthy than just no longer eating meat and thinking that will make you healthier

there is no generic formula as such but you can work it out using all known incomes and expenses and by making some educated you should know your buying costs which include the purchase price legal fees taxes in australia we have stamp duty which is a large state based tax when you purchase a property other things to consider include estimates for any repairs and/or renovations also you should look at the long term growth in your area and use this as an estimate of your potential growth over the period you wish to hold the property and estimate the agent fees if you were to sell and the depreciation on the building these things including the agent fees when selling and building depreciation will all be added or deducted to your cost base to determine the amount of capital gain when and if you sell the property you then need to multiply this gain by the capital gains tax rate to determine the capital gains tax you may have to pay from all the items above you will be able to estimate the net capital gain after all taxes you could expect to make on the property over the period you are looking to hold it for in regards to holding and renting the property things you will need to consider include the rent the long term growth of rent in your area and all the expenses including loan fees and interest insurance rates land tax and an estimate of the annual maintenance cost per year also you would need to consider any depreciation deductions you can claim other things you will need to consider is the change in these values as time goes by and provide an estimate for these in your calculations any increase in the value of land will increase the amount of rates and the land tax you pay and generally your insurance and maintenance costs will increase with time however your interest and mortgage repayments will reduce over time will your rent increases cover your increases in the expenses from all the items above you should be able to work out an estimate of your net rental gain or loss for each year again do this for the number of years you are looking to hold the property for and then sum up the total to give a net profit or loss if there is a net loss from the income then you need to consider if the net capital gain will cover these losses and still give you a reasonable return over the period you will own the property below is a sample calculation showing most of the variables i have discussed

there are api libraries available to various banks in various programming languages for example in perl there are many libraries in the some of these use screen scraping libraries and talk to the gui underneath so they are vulnerable to any changes the bank makes to their interface but some of the better banks do seem to provide back end interfaces which can then be used directly in either case you should still be sure that the transactions are secure some bank sites have bad security a good place to start is to call your bank and ask if they offer any programming apis for accessing their back end

allen welcome to money se you 've stumbled into the issue of debt snowball which is the low balance method of paying off debt the other being high interest i absolutely agree that when one has a pile of cards say a dozen there is a psychological benefit to paying off the low balances and knocking off card after card i am not dismissive of that motivation personal finance has that first word personal and one size rarely fits all for those who are numbers oriented it 's worth doing the math a simple spreadsheet showing the cost of the ds vs paying by rate   if that cost is even a couple hundred dollars i 'll still concede that one less payment envelope stamp etc favors the ds method on the other hand there 's the debt so large that the best payoff is 2 or 3 years away during that time $ 10000 paid toward the 24 card is saving you $ vs the $ 500 if paid toward 5 debt hard core do n't even want to discuss the numbers strangely enough   in your case you do n't have a pile of anything the mortgage is n't even up for discussion you have just 2 car loans send the $ 11,000 to the $ 19 k loan carrying the 2.5 this will save you $ 500 over the next 2 years vs paying the zero loan down once you 've done that the remaining $ 8000 will become your lowest balance and you should flip to the debt snowball method which will keep you paying that debt off   ds is a tool that should be pulled out for the masses the radio audience that the david dave ramsey radio show host appeals to they may comprise the majority of those with high credit card debt and have greatest success using this method but you exhibit none of their symptoms and are best served by the math by bringing up the topic here you 've found yourself in the same situation as the guy who happens to order a white wine at a wedding and finds his cousin offering to take him to an aa meeting the next day   in past articles on this decision i 've referenced a spreadsheet one can download it offers an easy way to see your choice without writing your own excel doc for the situation described here the low balance total interest is $ vs $ for the higher interest not quite the $ 500 difference i estimated the $ 350 difference is low due to the small rate difference and relatively short payoffs in my opinion knowledge is power and you can decide either way what 's important is that if you pay off the zero interest first you can say i knew it was a $ 350 difference but i 'd rather have just one outstanding loan for the remain time my issue with ds is when it 's like a religion and followers are told to not even run the numbers i wrote an article thinking about dave ramsey a number of years back but the topic never gets old
