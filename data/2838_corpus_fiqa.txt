it 's going to be quite a challenge to give a definitive answer to any why question about law and especially so for a question about tax law one would need to try to dig up statements made by the legislators and/or their and debating the law as it is tax law is already inconsistent in many ways why are there people who ca n't contribute to a roth ira directly but can contribute to a traditional and then immediately convert it to roth why are maximum limits for 401(k plans and iras separate rather than being one combined retirement savings maximum in the absence of some specific legislative statements saying that it was set up this way for some specific purpose one must assume that it was written with the some goals as all tax law as a compromise between various ideas trying to accomplish some specific purpose feel free to add in some level of inefficiency and it being hard to completely understand the entirely of the tax law which leads to things perhaps not being as tidy as one might hope for but there 's no reason to think that the people the tax advantages for hsa plans had any reason to use 401(k plans as a template or wanted them to accomplish the same goals
# 106027
am i comparing apples and oranges yes different purposes different laws different regulations   one rationale could be that hsa benefits are immediate while retirement benefits are deferred so the benefit of employer contributions are not felt until retirement and thus do not need as stringent a limit but that 's a complete guess
# 240373
just like all employee benefits there is a focus on removing or limiting owners of businesses ability to abuse tax preferences under the guise of an employee benefit as you point out there is an overall plan maximum 401(k for employer contributions and match contributions   there is a test for fsa programs there is also a test for medical plans under sections 125 and   employer contributions are counted toward the total of hsa contributions    why an hsa has a different maximum arrangement than 401(k is anyone 's guess   but the purpose of the limit is to prevent owners of companies from setting up plans that do little more than funnel tax free funds to themselves   an owner employee could pay themselves a wage contribute the maximum then have the employer also match the maximum so there are limits in place

well the potential problem is that the ftse 100 could go down or just not up really it 's as simple as that after all why diversify if the ftse 100 will only go up so the question is why wait to diversify why not add in the gilt etf for a little government bond exposure why not a corp. bond etf maybe a little of that global ex uk for a little foreign stock exposure   that said saving is better than not saving so if starting it off with just the ftse 100 gets you saving go for it

your credit score is really bad and it 's highly unlikely anyone will be willing to give you a mortgage especially if you still have bad debt showing up on your credit report what would help well clearing off any bad debt would be a good place to start ideally you want to get your credit rating up above though that may be optimistic here note though that bad debt falls off your credit report after a while exactly how long depends on your province note that making partial payment or even just acknowledging the debt will reset the timer however i mention this though because you mention some of your debt is from 5 or 6 years ago it may be just about to fall off it would also help if you can show that your credit is so bad because of mistakes from a number of years ago but you 've been making payments and staying on top of all debts for the past few years if that 's the case also it would help if you had a reasonable downpayment 20 minimum but you 'll be a lower credit risk if you are able to put down 50 75 you could also consider having someone with good credit co sign the mortgage note that most people will not be willing to do this as they take on substantial financial risk all that said there are some institutions which specialise in dealing with no credit or bad credit customers you pay more fees and will pay a vastly higher interest rate but this may be a good option for you check out mortgage brokers specialising in high risk clients you can also consider a rent to own but almost all the advice i 've ever seen say to avoid these if you can one late payment and you may lose all the equity you think you 've been building up note that things may be different if you are moving from the u.s. to canada and have no credit history in canada in that case you may have no credit rather than bad credit most banks still wo n't offer you a mortgage in this case but some lenders do target recent immigrants do n't rule out renting for many people regardless of their credit rating renting is a better option the monthly payments may be lower you do n't need a downpayment you do n't have to pay realtor and legal fees and pay again if you need to move a couple of sites provide more information on how your credit rating affects your possibility of getting a mortgage and how to get mortgages with bad credit and along with

security in the merchant services system is mainly handled in two ways 1 before transactions are done the business itself must go through an application process similar but not identical to getting a loan   some high risk businesses must pay higher fees due to the increased likelihood of customer complaints 2 when a customer disputes a transaction that 's a mark against the business   get too many of these disputes and your of accepting credit cards will be revoked meaning you wo n't be able to again it 's in the merchant 's best interest to verify customer 's identity because disputes cost them money directly   it 's in the servicer 's best interest to verify the businesses integrity because fraud drives up the cost for everyone else as a whole it 's quite a reactionary system yet in practice it works remarkably well

this is only a partial answer to your question 1 if you have a conservative approach to savings and actually even if you do n't you should not invest all of your money in any single industry or product   if you want to invest some money in oil okay but do n't overdo it if your larger goal is to invest the money in a manner that is less risky but still more lucrative than a savings account you should read up on personal finance and investing to get a sense of what options are available   a commonly recommended option is to invest in low cost index funds that mirror the performance of the stock market as a whole   the question of how should i invest is very broad but you can find lots of starting points in other questions on this site by googling or by visiting your local library

contrary to most other advise given here i 'd recommend in your situation not to invest in stock yet there are some hidden cost to investing that will eat your profit and in the end that 's why you are investing banks will charge for buying selling and maintaining stock as well as for cashing dividends depending on which bank or intermediary these costs will rise so my advise is to start playing with stock creating a virtual portfolio and track that just as says start saving also look at my answer here

this is another version of an old scam let me have a check deposited in your account because i ca n't open one for some reason and i 'll share some of the money with you   here the scammer is promising to start a business with you as a way to gain your confidence and trust the first danger sign is that you only know this person from online   they are not someone you are friends with in the real world   they could be anybody    they used the name of a big company as a way to make what they 're doing sound legitimate but it 's all a fraud   they could be depositing a faked exxon check into your account which could land you in huge trouble here 's the thing the only way exxon or any other company can deposit money in a bank under someone 's name is if that person provides the account and routing numbers to an account that already exists   no company can just create an account in another person 's name   that 's hollywood movie stuff but it 's not how banking works   to open an account the bank would need identification on the account holder so your friend already has an account if exxon has allegedly deposited money   further exxon is n't going to take back money that has already been deposited   in fact they ca n't take it back   if the account is in his name they ca n't do anything to the account or with the account    this is a situation you should run away from and never look back   nothing about this story sounds right or legitimate but this is one of the oldest scams out there since the beginning of the internet you would be well advised to stay very far away from your supposed friend because they 're anything but your friend   you are being scammed   do n't be a victim   stop communicating with this person immediately and don't give them any personal information of any kind   they 're crooks i hope this helps good luck

so if i understand your plan right this will be your situation after the house is bought total debt here 's what i would do wait until your house sells before buying a new one   that way you can take the equity from that sale and apply it towards the down payment rather than taking a loan on your retirement account    if something happens and your house does n't sell for as as you think it will you 'll lose out on the gains from the amount you borrow which will more than offset the interest you are paying yourself at worst pay off the 401(k loan the instant your sale closes take as much of the remaining equity as you can and start paying down student loans   there are several reasons why they are a higher priority than a mortgage some are mathematical some are not should i look to pay off student loans sooner even if i refi at a lower rate of 3.5 or so or the mortgage earlier    my thoughts are that the student loans follow me for life but i can always sell and buy another home so you want this baggage for the rest of your life   how will it be when you get that off your back   how much investing are you missing out on because of student loan payments   what happens if you get lose your license   what if you become disabled   student loans are not but you can always sell the asset behind a mortgage or car loan   they are worse than credit card debt in that sense   you have no tangible asset behind it and no option for forgiveness unless you decide to practice in a high need area but i do n't get the sense that that 's your path the difference in interest is generally only a few payment worth over 15 years is the interest amortized the same as a 15 year if i pay a 30 year mortgage in 15 years   yes however the temptation to just pay it off over 30 years is still there   how often will you decide that a bigger car payment or a vacation or something else is more important   with a 15-year note you lock in a plan and stick to it some other options

would they go up at all perhaps that 's not unreasonable but not proportionally    if the minimum wage goes up some workers might choose to move out from living with relatives or roommates so there would be some increase in demand but we would n't be overflowing with potential   and if rents started going up these new entrants to the housing market would likely fallback on their original housing setup with would moderate the impact    as far as gas goes while i do n't have specific numbers in front of me   i think it 's a reasonable assumption that us labor costs are a relatively small percentage of what you pay at the pump so even if those costs went up you would n't expect prices to surge

if you are the only one who puts in a large market buy order then it would definitely push the price up how much up would depend on how many would be willing to sell at what price point it would also be possible that your trade will not get executed as there are no sellers the same would be true if you put in a large sell order with no buyers the price would go down or trade not get executed as there are n't enough buyers

afaik they use entirely different lte frequencies in japan and the us hence the issues with the new ipad being lte in the states but not here     additionally there are still japanese manufacturers who are big brands in the japanese market but more or less unheard of overseas   so there 's likely to be relatively limited scope for economies of scale regarding handsets   sure with a limited number of handsets e.g. the iphone you may be able to place a larger order but when was the last time you heard of a network operator dictating terms to apple   that 's why only softbank had the iphone at launch because they were the only one willing to cede to apple 's high pricing demands     and that 's before you even get into language related issues   as far as lte equipment goes it depends on suppliers and whether the of ordering equipment for two very different territories thousands of miles apart with very different geography will bear a lot of fruit   as for people traveling between japan and the states its such a tiny proportion of customers it would barely make a dent   and most corporate customers historically favor anyway and given japanese business culture are unlikely to change any time soon   in a nutshell the synergies may not be as strong as it first seems

the advice to pay off debt is tough to argue against that said i 'd project out a few years to understand the home purchase will you plan for the 20 down john recommends the crazy truth about pmi ca n't be ignored the way the math works if you put 15 down the pmi costs you so much it 's nearly like paying 20 interest on that missing 5   if your answer is that you intend to save for the full downpayment 20 and can still knock off the student loan by all means go for it i have to question the validity of we will definitely be in a higher tax bracket when we retire by definition pretax deposits save tax at the marginal rate i.e. if you are in the 25 bracket a $ 1000 deposit saves you $ 250 in tax that year but withdrawals come at your average rate i.e. your tax bill divided by gross income there 's the deductions for itemized deductions or the standard then 2 exemptions if you are married then the 10 bracket etc   today a couple grossing $ 100 k may be in the 25 bracket but their average rate is 12   i read this q&a again and would add one more observation student loans and your first mortgage is an article i wrote in response to a friend 's similar question with the op having plan to buy a house paying off the loan may be more costly in the long run it may keep him from qualifying for the size mortgage he needs or from having enough money to put 20 down as i noted earlier   with finance there are very few issues that are simply black and white it 's important to understand all aspects of one 's finances to make any decision even if thee faster payoff is the right thing it 's not a slam dunk the other points should be considered

first my economics professor would kill me if i did n't point out that lowering the price does n't change demand only quantity demanded there 's a pretty big difference between the two   anyway the answer to your question is it depends   you 're hoping that people who do n't buy your sandwich for the original price will start buying it at the lower price you 're also hoping that once you increase the price they 'll continue to buy it the relationship describing how much a change in price affects the quantity demanded is known as elasticity elastic demand means that small changes will have a big affect on buying decisions inelastic demand means that buyers are not very flexible and will continue to purchase even after a significant price increase theoretically at least   the decision to raise or lower a price is a very complex process with a lot of variables so i do n't think anyone can give you a right answer to your question   practically you need to figure out where these extra customers are coming from if they are n't buying your sandwiches now because there 's a cheaper alternative lowering the price might entice them to buy from you instead however this means that when you raise the price back they 'll likely leave again   if they do n't know about your deli or have n't tried your sandwiches yet a change in price is n't likely to do any good without a strong marketing campaign to back it up   the of your product could also have an effect if your product is subway quality at higher prices no one is going to stick around on the other hand if you lace your sandwiches with crack you might get some repeat customers long term loyalty is key   hopefully this rambling helps you it 's late and i need to sleep good luck

since you mention your expenses are very low i 'm going to assume that social security will cover your expenses once you qualify for it   since you have no savings currently the first and most important job for this money is to make sure that you can live comfortably until social security kicks in   social security could start for you as early as 62 so you need to set aside at least two years worth of money plus another chunk as a safety measure also if you do n't have health insurance please look to get a plan through your local aca exchange as not having health insurance is by far the most common way someone your age ends up bankrupt   insurance will eat up a good chunk of the money but will be much cheaper after the first year if you continue to have no income now if your expenses are low enough you can look to use this money to delay when you start taking social security as long as possible as the longer you delay social security the more money you get   the aarp has a calculator where you can see how much more per year you will get from social security if you delay taking it as long as you can   this is a great way to insure you live as comfortably as possible even if you live to 120   assuming you are reasonably healthy this is a very secure and very meaningful way to invest this windfall once you have set aside the money for your expenses emergencies health care and delaying social security in a combination of checking and high yielding savings accounts it can be in your interest to invest any remaining amount   common solid low risk investments for a 10 + year time frame would be either while is correct that it is possible for even the best bond fund to lose money it is rather unlikely that you will end up losing money over a period of 10 years   the nice thing about the bond fund is that most funds find the right one do n't charge a fee if you need to need to take your money out early   cds guarantee that you wo n't lose your money but if you have to take the money out in an emergency the fees will eat up way more money than a bond fund would normally lose   also a good bond fund will generally yield a bit more than a cd investing in stock is generally much too risky for this sort of time frame without large savings to back it up

i 'm going to suggest a slightly different approach most answers seem to suggest paying off the lower rate card to clear it some answers comments also talk about emergency funds one risk of paying off a card is that the card issuer may choose to reduce your credit limit if they see you as high risk to prevent you re spending the money if you do n't trust yourself with the card then this could be a good thing and remember you 're always free to ask for a limit decrease but if you want access to emergency funds then i would suggest paying half onto each card that way if one card cuts you off you have a chance of still having access to the other in an emergency

for personal investing and highly risky securities wasting assets which is exactly what options are it is better to think in terms of sunk costs do n't chase this trade trying to make your money back you should minimize your loss unwind the position now while there is still some remaining value in those call options and take a short term loss or you could try this   let 's say you own an exchange traded call option on a listed stock very general case i do n't know how much time remains before the option 's expiration date be that as it may i could suggest this to effect a recovery   you 'll be long the call and short the stock this is called a delta hedge as you would be delta trading the stock delta refers to short term price volatility   in other words you 'll short a single large block of the stock then buy shares in small increments whenever the market drops slightly on an intra day basis when the market price of the stock rises incrementally you 'll sell a few shares back and forth in response to short term market price moves while maintaining a static hedge ratio as your original call option gets closer to maturity roll it over into the next available contract either one month or preferably three month time to expiration if you do n't want to or ca n't borrow the underlying stock to short you could do a synthetic short a synthetic short is a combination of a long put and a short call whose pay off replicates the short stock payoff   i personally would never purchase an unhedged option or warrant but since that is what you own right now you have two choices get out or dig in deeper with the realization that you are doing a lot of work just to trade your way back to a net zero   while you can make a profit using this sort of strategy i 'm not certain if that is within the scope of the website

the tax deferred status of a 401k plan helps you in theory because your tax rate will be lower once you retire and start drawing the money   this theory could prove incorrect also the money you add to a 401k lowers your taxable income today so you end up paying less taxes to the government right now   depending on where you are in the tax bracket scale that could have the affect of lowering your tax bracket which will save you money in other areas each person 's situation is different by my general theory is to contribute towards retirement in the following order hope this helps

uh you want to lease a car through a dealer that is the worst possible way to obtain a car dealers love leases because it allows them to sell a car for an price and to hide additional fees it 's the most profitable kind of sale for them the best option would be to buy a used car off of craigslist or ebay then sell it again the same way when you leave if you sell the car for what you paid then you get the car for a year for free if you are determined to go through with the expensive risky and annoying plan of leasing a car then you should use a leasing agent i recommend reading some car buying guides before going out into the wilderness with the tigers and bears comment on leasing tricks do n't get tricked by the interest rate game the whole interest thing is just a distraction to trick you into think you are getting some kind of reasonable deal the leasing company makes most of their money from fees for example if you get into an accident it is a big payday for them the average person thinks they will never get into an accident but the reality is that most people get into an accident sooner or later they also collect big penalties for maintenance failures forget to change the oil boom money forget to comply with manufacture recall boom more money forget to do the annual service boom more money scratch the car boom more money the original car are missing boom you just paid $ 400 for a set of that cost the leasing company $ 25 bucks the leasing company is counting on the fact that 99 of people will not maintain the car correctly or will damage it in some way they also usually have all kinds of other bogus fees so called walk away fees disposition fees initiation fees whatever they think they can get away with the whole system is calculated to screw you

re a trader when buying needs to buy at the ask price and when selling needs to sell    at the bid price so how can a trade happen in between the bid and ask saying the trade can happen in between the bid ask is simplistic   there is a time dimension to the market   it 's more accurate to say that an order can be placed in between the current best bid ask observed at time t=0 thus establishing a new level for one or the other of those quoted prices observed at time if you enter a market order to buy or sell then yes you 'll generally be accepting the current best ask or best bid with your order because that 's what a market order says to do accept the current best market price being offered for your kind of transaction   of course prices may move much faster than your observation of the price and the time it takes to process your order you 're far from being the only participant market orders aside you are free to name your own price above or below the current best bid ask respectively then one could say that you are placing an order in between the bid and ask at the time your order is placed   however and this is key you are also moving one or the other of those quoted prices in the process of placing your above bid buy order or your below ask sell order then only if somebody else in the market chooses to accept your new ask or bid does your intended transaction take place and that transaction takes place at the new ask or bid price not the old one that was current when you entered your order read more about bid ask prices at this other question p.s fwiw i do n't necessarily agree with the assertion from the article you quoted i.e. by looking for trades that take place in between the bid and ask you can tell when a strong trend is about to come to an end   i would say maybe perhaps but maybe not

you have to be the owner of record before the ex dividend date which is not the same day as the date the dividend is paid this also implies that if you sell on or after the ex dividend date you 'll still get the dividend even if you no longer own the stock   keep in mind also that the quoted price of the stock and on any open orders that are not specifically marked as do not reduce on its ex dividend date is dropped by the amount of the dividend first thing in the morning before trading starts if you happen to be the first order of the day before market forces cause the price to move you 'll end up with zero gain since the dividend is built into the price and you got the same value out of it the dividend in cash and the remaining value in stock as pointed out in the comments thanks you 'll still get a market price for your trade but the price reduction will have had some impact on the first trade of the day source nyse rule also remember that the dividend yield is expressed in annualized terms so a 3 yield can only be fully realized by receiving all of the dividend payments made by the company for the year you can of course forget about individual companies and just look for dividends to create your own effective yield over time but see the final point finally if you keep buying and selling just to play games with the dividends you 're going to pay far more in transaction fees than you will earn in dividends and depending on your individual circumstances you may end up paying more in capital gains taxes

theoretically there is limited demand for risky investments so higher risk asset classes should outperform lower risk asset classes over sufficiently long time periods in practice i believe this is true but it could be several decades before a risky portfolio starts to outperform a more conservative one stocks are considered more risky than most assets small cap stocks and emerging market stocks are particularly high risk i would consider low fee etfs in these areas like vb or if you want to seek out the absolute riskiest investments you could pick individual stocks of companies in dire financial situations as bank of america was a couple years ago most importantly if you do n't expect to need the money soon i would maximize your contribution to tax advantaged accounts since they will grow exponentially faster than taxable accounts over 50 years a 401(k or ira will generally grow at least 50 more than a taxable account maybe more depending on the tax efficiency of your investments try to contribute the maximum $ 17,500 for most people in 2014 if you can if you can save more than that i 'd suggest contributing a roth 401k rather than a traditional 401(k since roth contributions are post tax the effective contribution limit is higher also contribute to a roth ira up to $ 5,500 in 2014 using a backdoor roth if necessary

i would say it 's a bit more complicated than that do you understand what a market maker does   an ecn electronic communication network is a virtual exchange that works with market makers using a rebate structure that works by paying for orders adding liquidity and charges a fee for removing liquidity so liquidity is created by encouraging what are essentially limit orders orders that are outside of the current market price and therefore not immediately these orders stay in the book and are filled when the price of the security moves and triggers them   so direct answer is nyse arca is where market makers do their jobs these market makers can be floor traders or algorithmic when you send an order through your brokerage your broker has a number of options your order can be sent directly to an ecn exchange like nyse arca sent to a market making firm like americas formerly knight capital or is when the broker uses an in house service to execute your trade brokerages must disclose what they do with orders for example etrade 's this is a good graphic showing what happens in general along with the names of some common liquidity providers

littleadv 's first comment check the note is really the answer but your issue is   every mortgage i 've had over 10 in my lifetime allows early principal payments the extra principal can only be applied at the same time as the regular payment think of it this way only at that moment is there no interest owed if a week later you try to pay toward only principal the system will not handle it pretty simple extra principal with the payment due in fact any mortgage i 've had that offered a monthly bill or coupon book will have that very line extra principal by coincidence i just did this for a mortgage on my rental i make these payments through my bank 's billpay service i noted the extra principal in the notes section of the virtual check but again the note will explicitly state if there 's an issue with prepayments of principal the larger issue is that your friend wishes to treat the mortgage like a bi weekly the bank expects the full amount as a payment and likely has no obligation to accept anything less than the full amount given my first comment above here is the plan for your friend to do 99 of what she wishes tell her there 's nothing magic about bi weekly it 's a budget clever way to send the money but over a year it 's simply paying 108 of the normal payment if she wants to burn the mortgage faster tell her to add what she wishes every month even $ 10 it all adds up   final note there are two schools of thought to either extreme a pay the mortgage off as fast as you can no debt is the goal and b the mortgage is the lowest rate you 'll ever have on borrowed money pay it as slow as you can and invest any extra money i accept and respect both views for your friend and first group i 'm compelled to add be sure to deposit to your retirement account 's matched funds to gain the entire match $ 1 can pay toward your 6 mortgage or be doubled on deposit to $ 2 in your 401(k if available and pay off all high interest debt first this should stand to reason but i 've seen people keep their 18 card debt while prepaying their mortgage

in a traditional ira contributions are often tax deductible for instance if a taxpayer contributes $ 4,000 to a traditional ira and is in the twenty five percent marginal tax bracket then a $ 1,000 benefit $ 1,000 reduced tax liability will be realized for the year so that 's why they tax you as income because they did n't tax that income before if a taxpayer expects to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement than during the working years then this is one advantage for using a traditional ira vs a roth distributions are taxed as ordinary income so it depends on your tax bracket   update for comment currently you may have heard on the news about the fiscal cliff cnbc at the end of the year this is due to the fact that the bush tax cuts are set to expire and if they expire many tax rates will change but here is the info as of right now dividends from 2003 to 2007 qualified dividends were taxed at 15 or 5 depending on the individual 's ordinary income tax bracket and from 2008 to 2012 the tax rate on qualified dividends was reduced to 0 for taxpayers in the 10 and 15 ordinary income tax brackets after 2012 dividends will be taxed at the taxpayer 's ordinary income tax rate regardless of his or her tax bracket if the bush tax cuts are allowed to expire reference wikipedia capital gains tax rates can be seen here the capital gains tax rate is relative to your ordinary income tax rate for example this year long term gains will be 0 if you fall in the 15 ordinary tax bracket note these rates can change every year so any future rates might be different from the current year

no   the wsj prime rate is 4.25 even the fed prime rate is 1.75 way above the 1.20 you 'll be making from your savings account if you are high worth individual with great credit history the bank might give you a personal loan at 4.25 they wo n't care what you do with it as long as they get their payments if you are not that creditworthy they 'll ask for a collateral you can mortgage your house for example it ends up being the thing you get your money and do what you want with it if you can make more than the interest rate the bank gave you great you made profit the bank however wo n't agree to lend you money at 0.6 1/2 of the 1.2 apy your savings account will bring why would they when they can loan that at prime rate of 4.25 the closest you can get to something like this is if you are a hot shot wall street money manager with track record of making big profits in that case the bank might put some money in your fund for you to manage but that 's not something a regular person can do

if it is a business loan the borrower would be able to claim a deduction for any interest paid on the loan and the lender would include the interest earned as part of their taxable income you need to be careful on what you do and do n't include as income if the repayments made to you by the borrower in a year is $ 10,000 but only $ 8,000 of that is interest and the other $ 2,000 is part of the principal being returned to the lender then you would only claim $ 8,000 as your income and the borrower would only claim $ 8,000 as a business deduction of course if it is interest only then you and the borrower would use the full $ 10,000

i 've been doing healthcare financial consulting for a few years now and i was going to start studying to take cfa level i and slowly change industries but ended up learning programming instead at this point in my career i 'll be way too far behind if i do n't solely focus on increasing technical skills related to programming and data science    i think this is the point in time where if you do n't start gaining experience and skills in those areas any professional field is going to be out of reach in 5 years or so for healthcare finance no one will care that you have 10 + years of experience with the industry if you ca n't turn the experience into useful data analysis then no firm is going to want you   right now our firm has moved from the typical pyramid structure with tons of analysts on the bottom and a few high level consultants at the top towards more of a balloon most of our staff are in the middle tier and we are all with varying level of experience but our real selling point is how we are able to collect and process a hospital 's data i feel like i started working at a typical small finance firm and now i work at a typical saas style startup so we can feel it in other financial fields so i 'm sure you equity folks are going to have the same experiences

you should plan 1 3 months for an emergency fund   saving 6 months of expenses is recommended by many but you have a lot of goals to accomplish and youth is impatient   early in your life you have a lot of building saving that you need to do you can find a good car for under $ 5000   it might take some effort and you might not get quite the car you want but if you save for 5 6 months you should have a decent car   my son is a college student and bought a sedan earlier this year for about $ 4000 onto the house thing   as you said at $ 11,000 expenses yearly plus about $ 10,000 saved you are making low 30 's   using a common rule of thumb of 25 for housing you really can not afford more than about $ 600 for housing you probably want to wait on that first house for awhile down payments really should be about 20 and depending upon the area of the country a modest house might be $ 120,000 or $   even on a $ 120,000 the 20 down payment would be $ 24,000 as you have student loans $ 20,000 you should put together a plan to pay them off perhaps allocating half your savings amount to paying down the student loans and half to saving as you are young you should have strong salary gains in the first few years and once you are closer to $ you might find the numbers working better for housing my worry is that you are spending $ 22,000 out of about $ for living expenses   that you are saving is great and you are putting aside a good amount   but you want to target saving 30 40 if you can

the good news about maintenance is that there 's much less scheduled maintenance because the cars are mechanically much simpler see the official service schedule most of it is just rotate tires replace cabin air filter the brake and suspension systems are very similar to those of a normal car and require comparable maintenance the bad news is the battery will decay over time and is a major component of the cost of the car from that link in the uk the leaf ’s standard battery capacity loss warranty is for    60,000 miles or five years so you should factor your battery lifetime into the depreciation calculation i do n't think there are going to be many or year old electric cars from the current crop in 2030 or 2040 as they 're still improving dramatically year on year slightly too long for a comment slightly too short for a proper answer

depending on how you view the loan it could either be considered an asset or a liability   since you are not charging interest it might seem more intuitive to create an assets cash loan account and transfer money to from it when you receive payments like you would with a bank account personally i prefer to think of all loans as liabilities   whether it 's a debt which you owe someone or a balance which someone else owes you since it 's an unsettled amount i file it under liabilities loan   either way you record the initial balance as a debit from your bank and then record payments as credits back to your primary account the only way that income or expenses ever gets involved would be if you charged interest income or if you some or all of the loan expense at some point in the future

although there is no single best answer to your situation several other people have already suggest it in some form always pay off your highest after tax interest loan first that being said you probably also have heard about the differentiation for good debt vs. bad debt good debt is considered a mortgage for buying your primary home or as is the case here debt for education as far as i am concerned those are pretty much the only two types of debt i 'd ever tolerate there may be exceptions for health medical reasons everything else is consumer debt and my personal rule is do n't buy it if you do n't have the money for it meaning do n't take on consumer debt one other thing you may consider before accelerating paying off your student debt the interest paid on it may be tax deductible so you should look at what the true interest is on your student loan after taxes if it is in the very low single digits meaning between 1 3 you may consider using the extra money towards an automatic investment plan into an etf index fund but that would be a question you should discuss with your tax accountant or financial adviser it is also critical in that case that you do n't view the money invested as found money later on unless you have paid off all your debt this part is the most difficult for most people so be very cautious and conscious if you decide to go this route at any rate congratulations on making so much progress paying off your debt keep it going

if the foreclosed property is sold for more than is owed then the borrower is entitled to the excess if sold for what is owed or less then the borrower gets nothing any money that you are entitled to would be determined by your contract with the mortgaged owner but the bank is the first lien holder they get made whole first and if there is excess then you may see some of your money back depending on your contract with the mortgaged owner since the bank owns the property until the mortgage is paid off you would have had to work with the bank in order to have legal ownership of a portion of the house and approving partial sale of a house is not something most banks would likely care to do a contract you worked up with the borrower does n't give you legal claim to the house in foreclosure at least due to the bank 's lien you 'd have to contact a lawyer for firm answers but it sounds bleak

no it is not if that were the case you would have no such thing as a growth stock dividends and dividend policies can change at any time   the primary reason for investment in a company is access to a firm 's earnings hence the idea of p e. dividends are factored in with capital appreciation but studies have shown that dividends are actually detrimental to future growth    they tend to allow easier access to shareholders because of the payouts reducing the cost of equity but if you reduce the growth rate as well sensitivity tables can demonstrate deterioration or stagnation over time    some good examples are ge and microsoft

in many countries giving something free to the employee is considered a taxable income equivalent and taxes have to be paid on it as it can not be assigned to specific employees the company pays a flat tax on it so it actually costs the company more also not all employees value it equally or consider it as a part of their income so reducing the salary accordingly would not be considered ok by many employees as a result the company can only do it as an additional offer which is too expensive for small businesses

check out professor damodaran 's website tons of good stuff there to get you started if you want more depth he 's written what is widely considered the bible on the subject of valuation investment valuation dcf is very well suited to stock analysis one does n't need to know or forecast the future stock price to use it in fact it 's the opposite business fundamentals are forecasted to estimate the sum total of future cash flows from the company discounted back to the present divide that by shares outstanding and you have the value of the stock the key is to remember that dcf calculations are very sensitive to inputs be conservative in your estimates of future revenue growth earnings margins and capital investment i usually develop three forecasts pessimistic neutral optimistic this delivers a range of value instead of a false precision single number this may seem odd i find the dcf invaluable but for the process not so much the result the input sensitivity requires careful work and while a range of value is useful the real benefit comes from being required to answer the questions to build the forecast it provides a framework to analyze a business you 're just trying to properly fill in the boxes estimate the to do so you through the financials skimming reading with a purpose in the end you come away with a fairly deep understanding of the business how they make money why they 'll continue to make money etc

all discount brokers offer a commission structure that is based on the average kind of order that their target audience will make different brokers advertise to different target audiences they could all have a lot lower commissions than they do the maximum commission price for the order ticket is set at $ 99 by the industry securities regulators when discount brokers came along and started offering $ 2 $ 9.99 trades it was simply because these new companies could be competitive in a place where incumbents were overcharging the same exists with robinhood the market landscape and costs have changed over the last decade with regulation and other brokerage firms never needed to update drastically because they could continue making a lot on commissions with nobody questioning it the conclusion being that other brokers can also charge a lot less despite their other overhead costs robinhood like other brokerage firms and anyone else trading directly with the exchanges are paid by the exchanges for adding liquidity not only are many trades placed with no commission for the broker they actually earn money for placing the trade if robinhood was doing you any favors they would be paying you but nobody questions free commissions so they do n't robinhood like other brokerage firms sells your trading data to the highest bidder this is called payment for order flow these subscribers see your order on the internet in route to the and before your order gets to the exchange the subscriber sends a different order to the exchange so they either get filled before you do analogous to front running but different enough to not be illegal or they alter the price of the thing you wanted to buy or sell so that you have to get a worse price these subscribers have faster computers and faster internet access than other market participants so are able to do this so quickly they are also burning a lot of venture capital like all startups you should n't place too much faith in the idea they are making enough money they also have plans to earn interest off of balances in a variety of ways and offer more options at a price like margin accounts

got some questions related to banks and cash specifically required reserve ratio and capital requirements   the way i understand it is a bank is required to hold a percentage of money it has loaned to other people required reserve ratio   example if the is 10 i give the bank 100k because it is only required to hold 10 10k it loans 90k to my neighbour neighbour buys a car from the dealership the dealership banks the 90k   now the bank can loan 81k of the dealerships 90k the bank loans to businessman who buys land worth 81k land owner banks the 81k   so the bank received 100k from me to hold and protect loaned 90k to bob recieved 90k from dealership loaned 81k to businessman recieved 81k from land owner   = bank over time will receive another 90k from bob and 81k from business man + interest this all assumes there is 1 bank and all these people put there money in the bank not keeping cash   in my native country we have no required reserve ratio we have a capital requirement on our central bank website it states a total capital ratio of 8   a capital ratio is equity + profit money given to shareholders risk weighted assets   question how do you determine equity profit and risk weighted assets for a bank   is equity the cash the bank has profit the money from and risk weighted assets how much money the bank has in loans

go to your local bank or credit union before talking to a dealership ask them if putting both names on the loan makes a difference regarding rates and maximum loan you qualify for ask them to run the loan application both ways having both names on the loan helps build the credit of the spouse that has a lower score     you may find that both incomes are needed for a car loan if the couple has a mortgage or other joint obligations the lender will treat the entire mortgage payment or rent payment as a liability against the person applying for the loan they wo n't split the housing payment in half if only one name will be on the car loan therefore sometimes the 2nd persons income is needed even if their credit is not as good that additional income without a significant increase in liabilities can make a huge difference regarding the loan they can qualify for once the car is in your possession it does n't matter who drives it in general the insurance company will put both spouses as authorized drivers note it is almost always better to ask your bank or credit union about a car loan before going to the dealership that gives you a solid data point regarding a loan and removes a major complexity to the negotiations at the dealership

article behind paywall   gt there has been a glut of brexit predictions about the uk ’s financial services industry consultancy oliver has said up to 75,000 jobs could leave britain ey another consulting firm thinks as many as roles could move the london stock exchange group has for 100,000   gt much of the analysis is based on worst case hard brexit scenarios involving only a very loose association or no deal at all between the uk and the eu the banking industry would be most at risk experts agree but there would also be some impact on insurance analysts have been more optimistic however about the asset management industry   gt for anyone paying attention over the summer break though this last piece of received wisdom has been thrown into doubt   gt in mid july the eu securities regulator published an opinion paper suggesting national regulators should take a tougher line on policing the asset management sector after brexit   gt in particular it zeroed in on delegation rules that allow a fund management company registered in one country to outsource its asset management to another place either within the eu or outside it   gt this sounds like pretty arcane stuff but it is crucial architecture for the european and global asset management industry philip a former fidelity executive who is now a consultant about 90 per cent of eu assets under management make use of delegation rules most european funds are registered in or luxembourg but the actual fund management takes place globally with the largest chunk delegated to london   gt anecdotal evidence suggests france is very keen to win more of this business and when published its paper the uk industry a rat not only is the regulator paris based but the convergence agenda under which the opinion paper was published is the responsibility of a seasoned french regulator   gt the wording in the delegation section of the document has alarmed some fund managers delegation to non eu entities could make oversight and supervision of the delegated functions more difficult national competent authorities should therefore give special consideration to such delegation arrangements and be satisfied that their implementation is justified based on objective reasons despite the additional risks which may arise from them   gt in plain language that could mean at the very least that more risk management functions need to be put on the ground where a fund is registered or at most that no fund management functions can be delegated outside the eu   gt taken to its logical extreme this would not only be very disruptive for the asset management industry and the current hubs in the uk the us and asia where most of the best fund managers are based but there would in likelihood be a second order magnetic effect on the investment banks whose traders and salespeople would need to follow their fund manager clients to parts of mainland europe if that happened those apparently doom mongering post brexit job move predictions might start to look conservative   gt according to the european fund management association total assets under management in europe last year were € equivalent to almost a third of the global total more than 4,000 asset management groups are registered in europe directly employing 100,000 people nearly 40 per cent of them in the uk across the eu close to half a million people are in jobs that service the asset management industry   gt all of the above is a worst case interpretation of a non binding document eyes are now turning to the european commission which is due next january to review the a directive that covers alternative asset managers such as hedge funds   gt it may also review the directive on the rules on mutual funds based in the eu even if the commission did decide the delegation rules should be tightened any changes would need to go through the full eu process at the european parliament and european council fund experts believe ireland and luxembourg which have as global administration hubs for the industry thanks to the current rules would reject calls for change no matter how hard france pushes   gt such optimism may prove justified but in the meantime another brexit risk for london has appeared on the horizon

the major drawback to borrowing to invest i.e. using leverage is that your return on investment must be high enough to overcome the cost of finance the average return on the s&p 500 is about 9.8 from cnbc a typical unsecured personal loan will have an interest rate of around 18 36 apr from nerdwallet this means that on average you will be paying more interest than you are receiving in returns so are losing money on the margin investment sometimes the s&p falls and over those periods you would be paying out interest having lost money so will have a negative return you may have better credit and so be able to get a lower rate but i do n't know your loan terms currently secured loans such as remortgaging your house will have lower costs but come with more life changing risks the above assumes that you are getting financing by directly borrowing money however it is also possible to trade on margin this is where you post a proportion of the value that you wish to trade with as collateral against a loan to buy the security this form of finance is normally used by day traders and other short term holders of stocks although the financing costs here are low i am not charged an interest rate on intraday margin trading there are very high costs if you exceed the term of the loan an example is that i am charged a fee if i hold a position overnight and my profits and losses are at that time if i am in a losing position at that time the process and fee can result in not having enough margin to recover the position and the loss of a potentially profit making position additionally if the amount of collateral cash margin posted is insufficient to cover the expected losses as calculated by your broker they will initiate a margin call asking for more collateral money if you do not or can not post this extra margin your losing position will be cashed out and you will take as a loss the total loss at that time since the market can change very rapidly such as in a flash crash this can result in your losing more money than you had in the first place as this is essentially a loan you can be bankrupted by this overall using leverage to invest magnifies your potential profits but it also magnifies your potential losses in many cases this could be sufficient to lose you more money than you had originally invested in addition to you need to consider the cost of finance and that your return over the course of the loan needs to be higher than your cost of finance as well as inflation and other opportunity costs of capital the s&p 500 is a relatively low volatility market in general so is unlikely to return losses in any given period that will mean that leverage of 1.25 times will take you into losses beyond your own capital investment but it is not impossible the low level of risk automatically means that your returns are lower and so your cost of capital is likely to be a large proportion of your returns and your returns may not completely cover the cost of capital even when you are making money the key thing if you are going to trade or invest on leverage is to understand the terms and costs of your leverage and discount them from any returns that you receive before declaring to yourself that you are profitable it is even more important than usual to know how your positions are doing and whether you are covering your cost of capital when using leverage it is also very important to know the terms of your leverage in detail especially what will happen when and if your credit runs out for whatever reason be it the end of the financing period the length of the loan or your leverage ratio gets too high you should also be aware of the costs of closing out the loan early should you need to do so and how to factor that into your investing decisions

mathematically it seems like the expected rate of return whatever that might be is the same for both an aggressive strategy is higher risk and higher reward a conservative strategy is lower risk and lower reward that is not true   roughly the mathematical of higher risk and higher reward is higher standard deviation and higher mean   in other words the aggressive strategy does have a higher expected rate of return higher mean   its disadvantage is that it has a higher likelihood of incurring intermediate losses and/or higher magnitude of intermediate losses on the way this is illustrated with the following chart   from vanguard you can see that the average return is greater the riskier the portfolio i.e. the more allocated to stocks relative to bonds but this higher average return comes at the price of a greater range of possible returns   with an aggressive portfolio you take a greater risk of losses at any given moment for a greater chance of gains over a long period given this it should be obvious why the advice is to be aggressive early on   early in life you do n't care about whether your current position is up or down because you 're not taking the money out   if your portfolio is down you just leave the money in there until it goes back up again   later in life you need to spend the money you now care about whether your current position is up or down because you ca n't afford to wait out a down market and may have to realize a loss by selling it 's important to note that the expected return is always greater for a higher risk portfolio as is the expected risk the expected rate of return does n't magically change as you age   what changes is your ability to absorb losses to hold out for later gains

it would be incredibly unusual for the same institution to offer checking and savings accounts with exactly the same features benefits including interest etc the reason is that in the usa anyways the fed makes banks keep a certain percentage of their total assets called the reserve requirement in house checking account deposits can not be re loaned of the money you put in your checking account must be held by the bank in its vaults savings accounts are not limited in this way so logic dictates that if depositing into one type of account is better for the bank than the other ie they can use more of the money to make money they will reward people for using the one that is more beneficial to their bottom line i 'm this from college finance 101 so i may be slightly mis remembering things but i 'm 99.99 sure that this is the primary reason you see checking accounts with lower interest rates banks would prefer you to use savings accounts and set up incentives so that you will sorry i know this does n't really answer your question but i think it may help you understand your options a little better i hope

that 's exactly what is saying and it lines up with established financial theory well some of it   the general argument is that stocks are priced according to what risks they 're exposed to   several although not all of the major financial economics theories propose and find empirical evidence for this that the market as whole is a risk factor so individual stocks would be priced in part based on how correlated they are with the market   strictly speaking the risk free rate is purely theoretical and ca n't be directly observed but the us t bill yield is usually considered to be a pretty good proxy for it

the answer would depend on the equities held some can weather inflation better than others such as companies that have solid dividend growth and even outpace inflation some industries are also safer against inflation than others such as consumer staples and utilities since people usually have to purchase these regardless of how much $ they have in looking over the data comparing s&p 500 returns dividends and inflation the results are all over the map in the 50 's the total return was with inflation at 2.2 then in the 70 's returns were 5.8 with inflation at percent leading one to think that inflation diminished returns but then in the 80 's inflation was 5.1 yet the return on the s&p was up to either way aside from the 70 's every other decade since 1950 has outpaced inflation as long as you are including dividends hence my first paragraph s&p 500 total and inflation adjusted historical returns also the 7 average stock appreciation you mention is just that an average you are comparing a year over year number 7 inflation with an aggregated one stock performance over x number of years and that is a misrepresentation and is not being weighted for the difference in what those numbers mean finally there are thousands of things that have an effect on the stock market and stocks some are and others are not the idea that any one of them such as inflation has any sort of long term effect on prices that they can not is improbable this is where researching your stocks comes in and if done prudently who cares what the inflation rate is

one way to analyze the opportunity cost of using a 401 k loan would be to calculate your net worth after using a 401 k loan   if your net worth increases then the 401 k loan would be advisable   note that the calculations provided below do not take into account tax considerations a net worth calculation is where you add all your assets and then subtract all your liabilities   the resulting number is your net worth first calculate the net worth of not taking the loan and simply paying the credit card interest   this means you only pay the interest on the credit card   in addition to the parameters identified in your question two additional parameters will need to be considered cash and the market rate of return on the 401k. scenario 1 only pay credit card interest after 12 months all you have paid is the interest on the credit card   the 401 k balance is untouched so it will hopefully grow   the balance on the credit card remains at the end of 12 months scenario 2 use 401 k loan to pay credit card balance you borrow $ 5,000 from your 401 k to pay the credit card balance   you will have to pay $ 5,000 plus the 401 k interest rate back into your 401 k account use the following equation to determine when scenario 2 increases your net worth more than scenario 1 thus if your credit card interest rate is greater than the rate you can earn on your 401 k then use the 401 k loan to pay off the credit card balance another scenario that should be considered borrow money from somewhere else to pay off the credit card balance scenario 3 external loan to pay credit card balance you borrow $ 5,000 from somewhere besides your 401 k to pay off the credit card balance the following is used to determine if you should use an external loan over the 401 k loan this means you should use an external loan if you can obtain an interest rate less than the rate of return you can earn on your 401k.   the same methodology can be used to compare scenario 3 to scenario 1

as others have said the decision is a very personal one personally i think you have a good idea for those of us that thrive in structured systems having a detailed breakdown and distribution of assets is a great idea i recommend going one step further however instead of having a single necessities account have a division here 1 account for bills and another for living expenses your bills account should recieve the funds to pay your monthly expenses such as rent utilities insurance living expenses is for day to day spending i recommend this because your bills are generally a fairly fixed expense keeping your flexible spending separate allows you to manage it more carefully and helps prevent overspending   i keep my living expenses in cash and divide it up by the number of days before my next check every day i put my portion of the living expenses in my wallet this way i know that i can spend as much money in my wallet and still be fine for the rest of the pay period i also know that if i want to go out to a nice dinner on friday it would be helpful if i have money left over at the end of the day monday through thursday

once you turn 18 you should open an account in your own name and transfer the assets there currently your mom is the one responsible as far as the irs cares with respect to taxes as it is her name on the account the taxes due will be based on your mom 's tax rate as a good child you can reimburse your mom for the taxes that she has to on your behalf also legally that money currently belongs to her any legal judgement against your mom can claim that money and it is not available for using as an asset by you on credit applications and such a better solution would have been for your mom to open a custodial account in your name this way the money is still yours you just do n't have control of it until you turn 18 while probably not an issue here the transferring of money between you and your mom and then back is considered a gift by the irs if the account was very well funded then you could run into having to deal with the annual gift limit and lifetime gift exclusion based on the clarification that the question is in reference to india while i do n't know the particulars of the law in india my advice of transferring the assets when you turn 18 still remains the main difference that i would see been india and the us would be the gift tax exclusions unless someone else knows otherwise i would still expect the law in india to see the current account as being the property of the mother

if you are n't already contributing the maximum allowable amount by all means do so if you are already contributing the maximum it does n't matter that much when you make those contributions making fixed monthly contributions is done mostly for budgeting reasons most of us ca n't predict fund performance well enough to optimize our contributions by which i mean contributing more early if you think the market is going up but waiting if you think it will go down following the buy low strategy as for employer matching check with your company to see how they compute matches they may match contributions for the year even if those matching funds are only paid up to a maximum per paycheck for example if you contribute 200 of the match for the first 6 months then contribute nothing for the remaining 6 months you may still receive the same matching funds per pay period as if you were contributing 100 throughout the year

the article best stock fund of the decade focus from the wall street journal in 2009 describe the highest performing mutual fund in the usa between 2000 and 2009 the investor return in the fund what the shareholders actually earned was abysmal why because the fund was so volatile that investors panicked and bailed out locking in losses instead of waiting them out the reality is that almost any strategy will lead to success in investing so long as it is actually followed a strategy keeps you from making emotional or knee jerk decisions btw beware of anyone selling you a strategy by telling you that everyone in the world is a failure except for the few special people who have the privilege of knowing their secrets link removed as it 's gone dead

i 'd try to gently point out to your husband that what he thinks he wants to do now and what he might want to do in 20 or 30 years are not necessarily the same thing when i was 40 i was thinking that i would work until i died now i 'm 58 and have health problems and i 'm counting down the days until i can retire even if your husband is absolutely certain that he will not change his mind about retiring in the next 20 + years maybe something will happen that puts things beyond his control like medical problems or simply getting too old to be able to work is he sure that he will be able to continue to put in 40 hour weeks when he 's 80 90 100 just because you put money away for retirement does n't mean that you are required to retire if you put money away and when the time comes you do n't want to retire great now you can collect the profits on your investments in addition to collecting your salary and live very well or have a nice nest egg to leave to your children putting money away for retirement gives you options retirement does n't necessarily mean sitting around the house doing nothing until you waste away and die of boredom my parents were busier after they retired then when they were working they spent a lot of time on charity work visiting people in the hospital working with their church that sort of thing some people start businesses as they have retirement income coming in they do n't have to worry about the business earning enough to provide a living so they can do something they want to do because they think it 's fun or contributes to society or whatever etc

both are saying essentially the same thing   the forbes articles says as much as 20 up to a maximum of $ 50,000   this means the same as what the irs page when it says the lesser of a percentage of your income or a total of $ 53,000   in other words the $ 53k is a cap you can contribute a percentage of your earnings but you can never contribute more than $ 53k even if you make so much money that 20 of your earnings would be more than that the difference between 20 and 25 in the two sources appears to reflect a difference in contribution limits depending on whether you are making contributions for employees or for yourself as a self employed individual see publication 560   the difference between $ 50k and $ 53k is due to the two pages being written in different years the limits increase each year

the 0.14 is coming out of the assets of the fund itself the expense ratio can be broken down so that on any given day a portion of the fund 's assets are set aside to cover the administrative cost of running the fund a fund 's total return already includes the expense ratio this depends a lot on what kind of account in which you hold the fund if you hold the fund in an ira then you would n't have taxes from the fund itself as the account is sheltered there may be notes in the prospectus and latest annual and semi annual report of what past distributions have been as remember the fund is n't paying taxes but rather passing that along in the form of distributions to shareholders also there is something to be said for what kinds of investments the fund holds as if the fund is to hold small cap stocks then it may have to sell the stock if it gets too big and thus would pass on the capital gains to shareholders other funds may not have this issue as they invest in large cap stocks that do n't have this problem some funds may invest in municipal bonds which would have tax exempt interest that may be another strategy for lowering taxes in bond funds depending on the fund quite a broad range actually in the case of the fidelity fund you link it is a fund of funds and thus has a 0 expense ratio as fidelity has underlying funds that that fund holds what level of active management are you expecting what economies of scale does the fund have to bring down the expense ratio and what expense ratio is typical for that category of fund would come to mind as a few things to consider that fidelity link is incorrect as both morningstar and fidelity 's site list an expense ratio for the fund of funds at i 'd expect an institutional us large cap index fund to have the lowest expense ratio outside of the fund of fund situation while if i were to pick an actively managed fund that requires a lot of research then the expense ratio may well be much higher though this is where you have to consider what strategy do you want the fund to be employing and how much of a cost are you prepared to accept for that is vanguard target retirement fund which has a expense ratio which is using index funds in the fund of funds system

of course credit cards are viewed as credit if you 're using money on a credit card you are not directly paying for your transactions on goods services immediately this is the act of borrowing credit to pay for them debit cards on the other hand work where the funds are taken from an account immediately or subject to a small delay but usually no more than 24 hours depending on various factors you should never miss credit card payments as that will affect your credit rating if you have unpaid money on your card this is debt plain and simple but to answer your question succinctly yes credit cards are a form of credit as the name suggests when you apply for a mortgage any unpaid credit debt is considered and would adversely affect you if you have such debts the level to which it affects you depends on the amount of debt this is how it works in the uk but to my knowledge it is the same in the us and most other countries please clarify if you think this is incorrect

in some cases we when we see an opportunity to save our clients money without risking valuable coverage or diminishing benefits we make certain recommendations for more affordable life insurance one of these strategies is laddering or term lengths or term maturities the strategy is simple while most people who are considering longer terms such as 20 or 30 year term purchase a single policy to fit their needs the laddering strategy has you purchase two policies totaling the same amount of coverage you currently need but with a shorter length term mixed with the longer term for example instead of purchasing a 30 year term for $ 1 million dollars you might purchase two policies for $ 500,000 each one with a 15 year term and the other with a 30 year term the result is typically a savings of on your term life insurance just be aware that the plan going in is to let the first policy go the one with the shorter term length when its level term has expired for example in a 15 year term the premiums will be guaranteed to stay level the first 15 years and then increase every year thereafter there is typically a sizable jump in rates in that 16th year clients often see rates increase 8 10 times or more therefore it ’s important you understand that going in and realize you will most likely let that first policy go when the premiums increase leaving you with the second policy through the end of its longer level term you can crunch some numbers with our laddering calculator

does the 457(b plan allow for the rollover of other retirement funds into it and do you have very specific reasons for wanting to roll over your sep ira into the 457(b plan instead of into some other ira plan with a different custodian for example if you already have a traditional ira is there any reason why your sep ira should not be rolled over into the traditional ira with regard to the question about separate accounts once upon a time rolling over money from an employment retirement plan e.g. 401k into a traditional ira required establishing a separate account called a rollover traditional ira so that the rolled over money and the earnings were not commingled with standard traditional ira money resulting from personal contributions this was so that the account owner had the option of rolling over the separately kept money into a new employer 's retirement plan if such a rollover was permitted by the new 401k plan if one did not want to ever roll over money into a new employer plan one had to write a letter to the custodian telling them that commingling was ok you never wanted to put that money into another 401k plan the law changed some time later and the concept of rollover iras holding non commingled funds has disappeared   with that as my answer to your question is that perhaps the law did not change with respect to 457(b plans and so the money that you want to rollover into the 457(b plan needs to be kept separate and not commingled with your contributions via payroll deduction to the 457(b plan in case you want to ever roll over the sep ira money into another sep ira hence separate accounts are needed one to hold your sep ira money and one to hold your contributions via payroll deductions

these are all factually correct claims s corporation is a pass through entity so whatever gain you have on the corporate level is passed to the shareholders if your s corp has capital gains you 'll get your pro rata share of the capital gains interest the same dividends you get it on your k-1 earned income taxed as such to you i.e. whether you earn income as a s corp or as a sole proprietor matters not that 's the answer to your bottom line question the big issue however is this you can not have more than 25 passive income in your s corp you pass that limit three consecutive years one off is ok your s corp automatically converts to c corp and you 're taxed at the corporate level at the corporate rates you then lose the capital gains rates personal brackets etc this means that an s corp can not be an investment company most of its income has to be earned not passive another problem with s corp is that people who work as self proprietors incorporated as s corp try to abuse it and claim that the income they earned by the virtue of their own personal performance should n't be taxed as self employed income irs upon such a position and if considerable amounts are at stake will take you all the way up to the tax court to prove you wrong this has happened before you should talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa attorney licensed in your state to educate you about what s corp is and how it is taxed and whether or not it is appropriate for you

why should n't i bring it up freight is one thing but if there 's an interest in increased commuter rail or other passenger rail areas where businesses would use freight rail if it was extended to them or anything like the system then it 's far more likely that the government will have to be shelling out the money instead of private organizations it takes huge capital investments and years to extend something like commuter rail and businesses probably do n't want to wait potentially decades to real the rewards of a risky venture so it will be left to public investment to extend systems into some areas that may become of activity after rail reaches them it 's not all about the freight lines

dollar cost averaging is a fancy name someone came up with to say invest all of the time i would not bother with spreading out purchases if the market is too expensive right now so what the items you sell will bring top dollar the fund you buy will cost top dollar it all out   you could sell your assets and just sit on cash but that would require knowing when the next market drop is coming which no one knows also it never really is cash it goes into a money market fund which is not guaranteed i would rather own and collect the dividend

thanks for quoting the meat of the article i agree with the gp i did n't have the patience to make it to page 2 but this meat is still textured flavored soy protein   gt well one of the reasons there 's no place to invest the cash is that wages as a percentage of gdp have fallen by so much that workers ca n't afford to buy anything any more   what   this manages to be both circular and wrong on multiple levels   our workers ca n't afford our product so we ca n't spend all this cash rolling in on them   gt we kept profits to a minimum because if we had high profits we would have to pay high taxes so at every opportunity we bought another machine or we opened another plant or we hired more people to try to build long term value through expansion because that was the way you avoided tax   ah daddy had the luxury of operating in a non saturated market   meanwhile google apple and microsoft piss away money as fast as they can on all sorts of basic research and yet still have massive stockpiles   but then i think that touches on the real problem with hanauer 's point it 's just plain   we live in a world where the governments have become so dysfunctional that private industry is now funding things like space exploration energy policy education transportation

congratulations on recognizing your problem and getting serious about paying down your debt that 's the first step if you have a loan with 80 interest yes get that paid off as quickly as possible much better to be paying even the outrageous 20 on a credit card than the astounding 80 as others have noted if you can get a consolidation loan or refinance that 80 to something more realistic do it and do it as soon as possible heck if you have the credit limit use the credit card to off the 80 loan 20 on a credit card is better than 80 of course you may not have enough credit limit to do that cash back rewards are nice if you are paying off the credit card balance each month but in your case you 're not 25 with a 2 cash back reward means you 're still paying 23 the first month and 25 every month after that that 's worse than 20 remember you pay the interest on your balance every month that you do n't pay it off while a cash back is a one time thing so if you 're not going to pay off the balance at best a cash back reward could be effectively subtracted from the interest rate 20 with a 2 cashback is effectively somewhere between 18 and 20 if you 're comparing 20 with 2 cashback to 19 could be complicated to figure out which is better but it 's clearly worse than anything more than 20 besides that you do n't say what your total debt is in relation to your income if you have a lot of debt i 'd say first thing is to figure out what you can do to cut your expenses lots of things that people call fixed expenses are n't really fixed at all they just take some effort to cut like if you have a big expensive house and you 're paying a large mortgage you can probably cut that by selling the place and moving to a cheaper house i say probably because the housing market may make it impossible to sell for enough to improve your situation if you have large heating bills you can turn the thermostat down and get used to wearing a around the house etc   final note i 've talked to a fair number of people with debt problems and i often hear them say yes i really need to cut my spending and start paying off these debts and i intend to right after i buy this one last thing that i really really want but of course after that there 's one more vital purchase and then another etc avoid falling into this trap

if you are just trying to curb impulse spending i 'd suggest the following   1 set up a separate bank account for your savings do not order checks or a debit card for this account 2 get your employer to split your paycheck to put the saving amount in the new account most employers will do this the trick to avoid impulse spending is to make it a chore to get at the money with the above arrangement you would have to physically go to the bank fill out a withdrawal slip and get cash this way you still can access the money in an emergency but it forces you to plan things out better

i have a similar situation five different accounts between me and my wife just as you and b describe i maintain my asset allocation across the combination of all accounts i also maintain a spreadsheet to track the targets deviations from the targets amounts required to get back in balance and overall performance i mostly do n't use mutual funds i have selected for each category 1 or 2 etfs choosing index etfs with low expense ratios and a brokerage with cheap or free trades keeps expenses low my broker offers free etf trades if you buy off their list as long as you are n't short term trading this is great for rebalancing for free 2 or 3 times a year using etfs also solves the minimum balance problem but watch out for commissions if you pay $ 10 to buy $ 500 worth of an etf that 's an immediate 2 loss trade a couple of times a year and that etf has to gain 5 just to break even one issue that comes up is managing cash and avoiding transaction fees say your ira has all the growth stock funds and your roth has the bonds stocks do well and bonds do poorly so you sell off some stocks which creates a bunch of cash in your ira now you want to buy some bonds but you do n't have enough cash in your roth so you buy the bonds in your ira not a problem at first but if you do n't manage it you can end up with small amounts of various funds spread across all of your accounts if you 're not careful you can end up paying two commissions in two different accounts to sell off purchase enough of a category to get back to your targets another problem i had is that only one account 401k is receiving deposits on a regular basis and that 's all going into an s&p 500 index fund this makes it so that my allocation is off by a fair amount every quarter or so too much in large cap equities not enough of everything else my solution to this going forward is to over rebalance a couple of times a year sell enough spy from my other accounts so that i 'm under allocated in large caps by the amount i expect to add to my 401k over the next 3 months so that in six months at my next rebalancing i 'm only 3 months over allocated to large caps plus or minus whatever gains losses there are

their is no arbitrage opportunity with buying dividends you 're buying a taxable event this is a largely misunderstood topic the stock always drops by the amount if the dividend on the ex date the stock opens that day trading ex excluding the dividend it then pays out later based in the shareholders on record   there is a lot of talk about price movement and value here that can happen but it 's from trading not from the dividend per se yes sometimes you do see a stock pop the day prior to ex date because people are buying the stock for the dividend but the trading aspect of a stock is determined by supply and demand from people trading the stock   the dividends are paid out from the owners equity section of the balance sheet this is a return of equity to shareholders the idea is to give owners of the company some of their investment back from when they bought the stock without having the owners sell the shares of the company after all if it 's a good company you want to keep holding it so it will appreciate   another similar way to think of it is like a bonds interest payment   people sometimes forget when trading that these are actual companies meant to be invested in your buying an ownership in the company with your cash   it really makes no difference to buy the dividend or not all other things constant though market activity can add or lose value from trading as normal

the prices we pay for goods and services are n't set by our levels of income why should the compensation we owe the community in taxes   lvt and with their capitalisation into selling prices are economically one and the same thing the only difference is who collects   if lvt is an income tax then so is rent or mortgage repayments in fact paying for anything is an income tax   the lvt is merely the way by which we equally share the value derived from scarce natural resources if we do n't do that then inequality and dysfunction are baked into our economies and societies   lvt does n't tax the wealth people create from land but taxes the wealth creating potential of land it is the of taxing incomes capital and transactions that causes losses whereas the lvt has none     this is because it is set by market not levels of income as the amount an individual or firm is prepared to pay for exclusive use of that location so if you can not pay the lvt then someone else will   that is not only fair but the optimally efficient way of allocating resources   this is how a capitalist free market based economy is supposed to work those that opposed the lvt are nothing but blue socialists

here 's your problem the debt is valid and it is your debt regardless of your arrangement with the insurance company the insurance company possibly owes you money and you owe the doctor money you are stuck in the middle and in the end it does n't matter whether the insurance company pays as to whether you owe the money do n't ignore them also disputing the debt it pointless because the truth is that you do owe the debt the insurance company may owe you money which is in dispute but the debt to your medical provider is your own you are just stuck in the middle it sucks but is pretty common i think the best you can do is keep working on the insurance company and responding to the bill collectors letting them know that you are working on it and will need to pay late in theory they deal with this a lot and probably understand not that it will make them lay off you in the meantime   in the end it is possible you might have to sue the insurance company to get the money one thing to be careful about if the debt is fairly old several years you may want to avoid making partial payments because if this goes on your credit report that payment may extend the period where the negative information can appear on your credit history

if the fee is paid directly from the account then unfortunately no you can not deduct it it 's probably too late now but in the future you can ask the financial institution if they will allow you to write them a separate check to cover the fees if they allow that then you can preserve your tax free account balance and potentially deduct the fees too more details here update as discussed in the comments below a strict interpretation of the irs description of deductible investment expenses may not include expenses for a roth ira even if they are paid outside of the account however there seems to be conflicting interpretations of this irs rule so i would advise speaking to an accountant or the irs directly for clarification but even if you determine you can not deduct the fees paying for them outside of the roth is still a good idea because it enables you to maintain a higher balance in your tax advantaged account

you can infer some of the answers to your questions from the bats exchange 's market data page and its associated help page   i 'm pretty sure a page like this exists on each stock exchange 's website bats just happens to be the one i 'm used to looking at the matched volume section refers to all trades on a given date that took place on lit exchanges that is where a public protected us stock exchange 's matching engine helped a buyer and a seller find each other   because there are exactly 11 such exchanges in existence it 's easy to show 100 of the matched volume broken down into 11 rows the finra volume section refers to all trades on a given date that took place on non lit exchanges   these types of trades include dark pool volume and any other trade that is not required to take place in public but is required to be reported the r in to finra   there are three venues via which these trades may be reported to finra nasdaq 's nyse 's and finra 's own   they 're all operated under the of finra so the fact that they 're located at nasdaq or nyse is a red herring   for example from the volume data it 's clear that the nasdaq facility does not only handle nasdaq listed tape c securities nor does the nyse facility only handle nyse listed tape a securities or anything like that the number of institutions reporting to each of the is large many more than the 11 public exchanges so the data is not broken down further   also i think the whole point of the is to report in secret   i do n't know enough details to say why the has always handled more reporting volume than the other two facilities   of course since we ca n't see inside the reporting anyway it 's sort of a moot point

disclaimer i am not a tax specialist you probably need a sales tax permit if you 're going to sell goods since just about every state taxes goods though some states have exemptions for various types of goods   for services it gets there is a database here that lists what services are taxed in what states in wyoming for example cellphone services and diaper services are taxed while insurance services and barber services are not   for selling over the internet it gets even there 's a guide on that claims to be comprehensive it states that the default rule of thumb is that if you have a physical presence in a state such as a warehouse or a retail shop or an office you must collect tax on sales in that state given your situation you probably only need to collect sales tax on customers in wyoming probably   in any event i 'd advice having a chat with an accountant in wyoming who can help walk you through what permits may or may not be needed

the satisfaction from gains packs less of an emotional impact than the fear of loss it 's very difficult for many people to overcome this fear so when prices begin to fall many investors sell to minimize their potential loss this causes a further drop which can lead to more selling as other investors reach their emotional threshold for loss this emotion based selling keeps the market inefficient in the short term if there are n't enough value investors waiting to scoop up the stock at the new discount it can stay undervalued for a long time

in such a situation is it really safe to give financial info to a person who does not encrypt it encryption only helps to an extent i.e. during transmission of data or during brute force makes it more difficult to get the real data however you concern is more of staff using this data which encryption will not help much as they would be able to and see the data in what ways could it be misused this depends on the type of data the financial data can be used to hack into your accounts if other bits of info are known i.e. most of the times on telephone requests say putting card on hold requesting balance on account etc only your address mother name last few transaction details are asked some critical requests need more id proofs so generally not of concern the other misuse would be selling this to marketing companies so that you can be bombarded with sales pitch for anything and everything the pan and other id documents are becoming more prone to mis use i.e. give a copy of pan to open fraudulent accounts etc a good practise would be to mark every copy of id proof you give with the purpose as to why its given and a date this would make the id proof stale to an extent if she is not going to encrypt it should i ask her to delete all my old data and then create a new profile for my communication with her the new profile not being my name but a fake name the regulations would not allow her to create fake accounts and may lead to issues and as such any recognised financial advisor would not allow this to be done quite a few countries have regulations for financial advisor 's that need to be to

you should definately have a stop loss in place to manage your risk for a time frame of 5 to 10 years i would be looking at a trailing stop loss of 20 to 25 off the recent high   another type of stop you could use is a volatility stop here the more volatile the stock the larger the stop whilst the less volatile the stock the smaller the stop you could use 3 or 4 x weekly average true range to achieve this the reason you should always use a stop loss is because of what can happen and what did happen in 2008 some stock markets have yet to fully recover from their peaks at the end of 2007 almost 9 years later what would you do if you were planning to hold your positions for 5 years and then withdrawal your funds at the end of june 2021 for a particular purpose and suddenly in february 2021 the market starts to fall by the time june comes the market has fallen by over 50 and you do n't have enough funds available for the purpose you planned for instead if you were using a trailing stop loss you would manage to keep at least 75 of the peak of your portfolio you could even spend 10 minutes each week to monitor your portfolio for warning signs that a downtrend may be around the corner and adjust your trailing stop to maybe 10 in these situations protecting 90 of the peak of your portfolio if the downtrend does not you can adjust your trailing back to a higher percentage if you do get stopped out and shortly after the market recovers then you can always buy back in or look for other stocks and etfs to replace them sure you might lose a bit of profits if this happens but it should always be part of your investment plan and risk management how you will handle these situation if you are not using stop losses risk management and money management you are essentially gambling if you say i am going to buy these stocks and etfs hold them for 10 years and then sell them then you are just hoping to make gains which is essentially gambling

some countries like the united states allow a mortgage interest tax deduction   this means the interest you pay on a mortgage which is typically much more than half of the monthly payment at the beginning of a 25 year mortgage is tax deductible so you might get 33 or more of the interest back and that effectively makes the interest rate significantly lower   therefore you are borrowing the money really cheap   that makes mrchrister 's answer even more appropriate

a long put you have a small initial cost the option premium but profit as the stock goes down you have no additional risk if the shock rises even a lot short a stock you gain if the stock drops but have unlimited risk if it rises the call mitigates this by capping that rising stock risk the profit loss graph looks similar to the long put when you hold both the short position and the long call   you might consider producing a graph or spreadsheet to compare positions you can easily sketch put call long stock short stock and study how combinations of positions can synthetically look like other positions often when a stock has no shares to short the synthetic short can help you put your stock position in place

most people on reddit do n't seem to get any system they 're talking about and this is the perfect example    the patent was approved before the sale it takes about 2 years to get a non controversial patent in the us maybe they were in talks for this acquisition 2 1/2 years ago but that 's somewhat unlikely given the timelines for most acquisitions    it would be so far and away more valuable to amazon to prevent a shopper at a competitor from seeing that they could get the same product for 30 less on amazon than to ever prevent someone in their forthcoming brick and mortar empire from doing it   as far as a brick and mortar store goes groceries is also a very low margin one yes they picked the high end market that would be better than your average safeway bi lo or walmart but it 's also a relatively small one compared to the alternatives and i think it 's dumb to expect that to make a difference groceries are the final frontier for amazon as far as making sure they can deliver anything anywhere today it 's basically having cold storage warehouses in every metro area without having to build them    edit yeah there was a missed double negative there obviously it 's in their interest to keep other businesses from preventing people in their stores from realizing they can get things cheaper on amazon

here 's how capital gains are totaled long and short term capital gains and losses are either long term or    short term it depends on how long the taxpayer holds the property if    the taxpayer holds it for one year or less the gain or loss is    short term net capital gain   if a taxpayer ’s long term gains are more than their    long term losses the difference between the two is a net long term    capital gain if the net long term capital gain is more than the net    short term capital loss the taxpayer has a net capital gain so your net long term gains from all investments through all brokers are offset by any net short term loss   short term gains are taxed separately at a higher rate i 'm trying to avoid realizing a long term capital gain but at the same time trade the stock if you close in the next year one of two things will happen either the stock will go down and you 'll have short term gains on the short or the stock will go up and you 'll have short term losses on the short that will offset the gains on the stock   so i don;t see how it reduces your tax liability   at best it defers it

mlp stands for master limited partnership investors who buy into one are limited partners rather than shareholders and have their taxable income reported on rather than 1099s mlps are engaged in businesses e.g. real estate natural resources that generate a lot of cash that does n't need to be reinvested or put back into the company because of this feature the irs will exempt it from corporate tax if it pays out at least 95 of its income in the form of dividends the advantage is that you avoid the double taxation common to most corporations and get a higher yield as a result   the disadvantage is that the company ca n't retain earnings for growth and needs to borrow money if it wants to grow in this regard an mlp is much like a utility except that a utility has to pay corporate taxes and is otherwise heavily regulated by the federal and/or state governments you can look upon an mlp as an unregulated utility this means that mlps are most suitable for utility type investors who are more interested in current income than capital gains because they are unregulated they are riskier than utilities

yes from the point of view to the end speculator investor in stocks it is ludicrous to take on liabilities when you do n't have to   that 's why single stock options are far more liquid than single stock futures however if you are a farmer with a huge mortgage depending upon the chaos of agricultural markets which are extremely volatile a different structure might appeal to you   you could long your inputs while shorting your outputs locking in a profit   that profit is probably lower than what one could expect over the long run without hedging but it will surely be less volatile here 's where the advantage of futures come in for that kind of structure the margin on the longs and shorts can offset each other forcing the farmer to have to put up much less of one 's own money to hedge   with options this is not the case also the gross margin between the inputs rarely fluctuate to an degree so if your shorts rise faster than your longs you 'll only have to post margin in the amount of the change in the net of the longs and shorts this is why while options on commodities exist to satisfy speculators futures are the most liquid

robert is right saying that options prices are affected by implied volatility but is wrong saying that you have to look at the vix index for two reasons   1 the vix index is for s&p500 options only if you are trading other options it is less useful 2 if you are trading an option that is not at the money your implied volatility may be very different and follow a different dynamics that the vix index   so please look at the right implied volatility   in terms of strategy i do n't think that not doing anything is a good strategy i accept any point of view but you should consider that option traders should be able to adjust positions depending on market view   so you are long 1 call suppose strike 10 suppose the underlying price at the time of entry was 10 so the call was at the money now it 's 9   1 you still have a bullish view buy 1 call strike 9 and sell 2 calls strike 10 this way you have a bull call spread with much higher probability of leading to profit you are limiting your profit potential but you are also reducing the costs and managing the greeks in a proper way and in line with your expectations   2 you become bearish you can sell 1 call strike 9 this way you end up with a bear call spread again you are limiting your profit potential but you are also reducing the costs and managing the greeks in a proper way and in line with your expectations 3 you become neutral buy 1 call strike 8 and sell 2 calls strike 9 this way you end up with a call butterfly you are almost delta neutral and you can wait until your view becomes clear enough to become directional at that point you can modify the butterfly to make it directional   these are just some opportunities you have there is no reason for you to wait options are eroding contracts and you must be fast and adjust the position before time starts eroding your capital at risk   it 's true that buying a call does n't make you loose more than the premium you paid but it 's better to reduce this premium further with some adjustment is n't it   hope that helps

i never said i agreed with you nor does your experience line up with almost a decade of my own academic and teaching experience   the higher education system is dysfunctional because it is trying to operate as a institution for an industrial economy when we are clearly in a post industrial economy that does n't lend itself well to a 3 or 4 year bachelor program designed to turn people into technical specialists accountants engineers lawyers etc    college is absolutely designed to mold people for jobs why else would businesses provide so many grants and scholarships to business schools they expect academic institutions to produce workers that are ready to function without any on the job training   speaking from experience working in the consulting industry right now i think there is a serious problem when liberal arts graduates in a business environment show more aptitude and willingness to learn and prove themselves than individuals who have specifically taken business centric degrees yet are constantly unable to think beyond the of what they were taught in school and refuse to open themselves up to different ways of thinking   you would not believe how many lawyers and mbas are unable to express themselves in writing to the point where clients become upset because they ca n't understand what they are being told the basics of education are no longer systematically taught to students

i definitely agree with this before i could get federal or state loans i had to do this online orientation and while you probably could skip most of it and click accept i actually read through and am competent in how the interest works and how even though not paying until after graduation is an option that 'll increase my total loans by like 50 almost every other student i 've talked to with student loans has little to no knowledge as to how interest works and how it applies to their loans     and the choosing what to study because while it is nice to study something fun if you ca n't practically get a decent paying job in your field then you have a lot of knowledge and nothing to do with it

the reason people buy earthquake insurance is not because normal insurance goes straight to the lender it does not but because oftentimes earthquake damage is not covered under normal homeowner 's insurance natural disasters are often not covered under regular insurance this is why people buy flood insurance if your pipes burst and flood your house your home owner 's insurance will typically cover if the local river floods and floods your house oftentimes insurance will not cover this is why a lot of state federal agencies have separate pools of insurance all earthquake insurance in california is technically through the state agency though you may go through your homeowner provider to get it i pay $ 200 a year for mine i would n't say it 's very expensive my concern is not a giant earthquake that destroys my house my concern is a large earthquake that might cause cracks in my slab or structural damage that my regular insurance is in no way obligated to cover but i need to fix i think if you live in an earthquake prone area it 's as reasonable as getting flood insurance if you live in an area known to flood

you can think of the situation as a kind of equilibrium   if the market values stock based on the value of the company then from an individual point of view it makes sense to value stock the same way as an illustration imagine that stock prices were associated with the amount of at the company 's location rather than the assets of the company   in this imaginary stock market it would not benefit you to buy and sell stock according to the company 's value   instead you would profit most from buying and selling according to the weather like everyone else   whether this system or the current one   would be stable in the long term is another matter entirely

since you 're coming out of college you 're probably a new investor and do n't know too much about stocks etc i was in the same situation as well   i wanted to keep my cash liquid and wanted to make low risk investments what i ended up doing was investing the majority of my money in higher interest gics guaranteed investment certificate and keeping the rest in my chequing savings account i understand that gics are n't exactly the most liquid asset out there however instead of investing it all into 1 gic i put them in to smaller increments with varying lock in times and roll over options i.e. for 15000 keep $ 3000 on hand in your account invested for 2 years invested for 1 year invested for 180 days invested for 90 days when you find that you run out of cash from your $ 3000 you 'll have a gic expiring soon   the problem with gics is that redeeming them before the maturity period usually incurs a penalty in the form of no interest   keeping them in smaller increments allows you to redeem only the amount you need without losing too much interest   at maturity if you do n't need the money you can just have the gic renew    the other problem with gics is that interest rates though better than savings accounts are n't that much more   you 're basically just fighting off inflation   the benefit is that on maturity you are guaranteed your principal and the interest    this plan is easy to implement if your bank credit union allows you to create and manage gics online

when credit locks up junk bond prices fall rapidly and you see more defaults the opportunity to make money with junk is to buy a diversified collection of them when the market declines look at the charts from some of the mutual funds or etfs like pimco high yield or northeast investors very volatile stuff keep in mind that junk bonds are not representative of the economy as a whole they cluster in certain industries retail and financials are big industry segments for junk   also keep in mind that the market for these things is not as liquid as the stock market if your investment choice is really a sector investment you might be better served by investing in sector funds with stocks that trade every day versus bonds whose market price may be difficult to determine

as an easy way to answer look at an index let 's say the s&p 500   look at the price this last october and predict where it will move in november easy right   it already happened and you have the benefit of hindsight   the move looks like such a consistent obvious continuation of the previous up and down pattern   it looks predictable like you could have guessed that   now look at today 's price and predict where it will go next month   not so easy now   the problem is every point you 're at all the time looks like a possible inflection point or turning point   if you 're following an uptrend you may think it 'll continue but you may also think that it so far up already that now it 's ready for a down where you 'll buy   so you wait and it keeps rising and you kick yourself for missing out   next time you see another uptrend and resolve to buy it regardless thinking now it 'll keep going but it turns down the second you buy it and keeps dropping   you kick yourself again   the market is amazing at doing this to you every time   in real time every wiggle in the price looks simultaneously like a trend that could continue and like a trend that has moved far enough and is ready to reverse   and more likely you 'll guess the wrong one    the only way with some little hope of succeeding is to study study study and find and learn trading rules with just over 50/50 chances like buying when a moving average is touched within an uptrend as an example and setting a stop loss at -1 and a sell limit at + 2 or something and then never ever deviate from that strategy because your only hope is in the consistency of statistics and odds over time   you 'll get many -1 losses and hopefully enough 2 gains to compensate the losses plus some profit    or to make it easier just buy in on a dip and hold and hold and collect dividends and be content to match the market without effort

this is a bit unusual but not unheard of i have known more than one car whose owner was not its driver   besides the obvious risk that the legal owner of the car will repossess it this seems fairly safe   your insurance should cover any financial liability that you incur during an accident   even if the car is repossessed by the owner you are only out the registration fees i would suggest you avoid looking this gift horse in the grill   her father on the other hand might be in for some drama and financial mess if he has a falling out with his friend this arrangement reminds me of where one spouse owns the car but the other drives it and pays the loan   usually when the relationship goes south one spouse is forced to sell the car at a loss

the loan you will just have to get by applying to a bunch of banks or hiring someone a broker to line up bank financing on your behalf for a point on the loan fha is for your first house that you live in and allows you to get loan to cost financing that is n't for investment properties however fha loans do exist for multifamily properties under section    your corporations should be so they do n't affect each other in the end its up to you if you think it makes sense for all the single family homes to be in one portfolio may make it easier to refi if you put all the properties in a cross collateralized pool for the bank to lend against there is also no requirement for how long a corporation has been in existence for a loan the loan has a claim on the property so it 's pretty safe so long as you have n't committed fraud before they wo n't care about credit history

in china people are using litecoin and bitcoin to circumvent capital controls are the biggest exchanges of smart money disclaimer this is not advice this is the answer on a question and answer site the exchange rate of smart money is very volatile you will experience very brief exposure to those networks although litecoin is popular for speculation in china bitcoin gives you and your trading partners the most flexibility as the united states does not have robust and liquid exchanges for litecoin only bitcoin you buy smart money on one of the exchanges in china you send all of it to an exchange in the united states you sell all of it on that exchange for usd if it is n't clear smart money 's flexibility comes the fact that it does n't use banks to work exist and can be transferred to valid addresses over the internet   current regulated liquid and fdic insured us exchanges are coinbase and circle other exchanges use private insurance such as and   so in the course of 30 minutes you should have converted all of your funds from yuan back to stable us dollars in a regulated and insured us banking account to make it for goods and services you need to transfer it out of the exchange to a us bank account this has very little exposure to the bitcoin or litecoin network you do n't need any friends or mules for this the chinese government has issued many many on smart money such as litecoin and bitcoin so it is hard to keep up because they have made half efforts to prevent banks from directly servicing those networks while retaining the legality of their operations within china party members have been waiting for ways to get their wealth out of the country too without risk of blowback so you will need to see what hoops you need to jump through to move your funds to one of those exchanges to begin with this is faster and only uses one transaction instead of broken up ones and there are no tax consequences for sending money to yourself

a mortgage is simply a loan backed by a property and because it 's both very large and very common covered by some specific laws   as such the bank is n't an investor in your house it simply is lending you money with the property as collateral   so it does n't get any share of the profit as long as you sell the house on your own for more than you owe most of the time in the us you will get about 92 94 of the sale price back minus whatever you owe on the house   the 6 8 you do n't get will go to the realtors as commission unless you sell by owner and do n't sell to someone with a buyer 's agent and to pay some of the costs of the sale how much of those you pay depends on the deal you make with the buyer but it 's common to pay some of them in some areas   you also will owe taxes potentially   you then pay the bank back from that amount as such in your example let 's say bob owes $ 50k on his house and sells it with a realtor for $ 150k   he gets $ 150k = after commission he then hands the bank a check for the current payoff of the loan that amount is usually slightly higher than the remaining principal because you owe the interest that 's accrued between last payment you made and day of sale   let 's say this is a 6 loan which works out to around 0.5 per month and it 's been half a month since his last payment so he owes another 0.25 or another $ 125   some mortgages also may have prepayment penalties check your note   in this case there is n't a penalty so the bank gets $ from the sale   usually the bank would get that immediately at closing ie he does n't get the full $ or $ 150k and then write a check instead the title closing company gets that amount and gives the $ 9k to the realtors the $ to the bank and the remaining $ to him    do n't forget he may also owe income taxes and sometimes other local taxes on the profit on the sale in this case the irs would n't get anything as it 's under $ 250k assuming it 's a primary residence but keep that in mind also in the case of a foreclosure the bank will get some extra money to pay for the costs it incurred in foreclosing on and selling the house

i think you 're talking about two types of machines at least in the united states the term change   machine usually refers to a machine that accepts large denominations of currency and returns an equal amount of currency in smaller bills or coins typically these machines are used to provide coins in exchange for paper currency in which case they are also often known as bill exactly what bills or coins these machines return depends on the machine read the instructions on the machine to get the details they 're usually right on the machine for example my apartment building has a machine that converts small bills like ones and to quarters since the laundry machines only took quarters the other type of machine are coin cashing machines like the coinstar machines you might see at a grocery store many banks used to have these machines as well although in my area they 're few and far between now these machines perform the opposite function of the traditional change machine and convert smaller denominations mostly coins into bill form for example if you dump all your accumulated pennies into the machine it will probably give you bills and larger coins like quarters dimes nickels in exchange after subtracting a small fee i 've heard that now some of these machines may give you a gift card of some kind instead of bills although they 'll still subtract a fee from your original amount usually once again just read the instructions and they should tell you when my bank had one of these machines they did n't charge a fee as long as you were a customer at the bank i 'm sure that varies from place to place and bank to bank though wikipedia 's article has this to say see the article for references in some sections of the u.s. regional banks have begun offering free coin counting services in the amount of a gift card refunds are often given in cash rather than in the form of a gift card in some cases it is not even necessary for the customer to have an account at the bank the free service is offered as a way to attract new business from individuals who are not current account holders td bank 's penny arcade coin counters were free and available to both customers and non customers in many branches but as of november 2010 the bank charges a 6 fee for non customers to use the machine

to be completely honest i think that a target of 10 15 is very high and if there were an easy way to attain it everyone would do it if you want to have such a high return you 'll always have the risk of losing the same amount of money option 1 i personally think that you can make the highest return if you invest in real estate and actively manage your if you do this well with short term rental and/or airbnb i think you can make healthy returns but it will cost a lot of time and effort which may diminish its appeal think about talking to your estate agent to find renters or always ensuring your airbnb place is in good nick so you get a high rating and keep getting good customers if you 're looking for passive income i do n't think this is a good choice also make sure you take note of 's point of costs no matter what you plan for your costs will always be higher than you think think about water damage a tenant that breaks things doesn't take care of stuff etc option 2 i think taking a loan is unnecessarily risky if you 're in good financial shape as it seems unless you 're gon na buy a house with a mortgage and live in it option 3 i think your best option is to buy bonds and shares you can follow 's 100 minus your age rule which seems very reasonable personally i invest all my money in shares because that 's how my father brought me up but it 's really a matter of taste both can be risky though bonds are usually safer i think i should note that you can not expect a return of 10 or more because as everyone always says if there were a way to guarantee it everyone would do it you say you do n't have any idea how this works so i 'd go to my bank and ask them you probably have access to private banking so that should mean someone will be able to sit you down and talk you through also look at other banks that have better rates and/or pretend you 're leaving your bank to negotiate a better deal if i were you i 'd invest in blue chips big international companies listed on the main dax ftse 100 dow jones or passively managed mutual funds etfs that track these just remember to diversify by country and industry a bit note i would not buy the vehicles plans that my bank no matter what they promise and they promise a lot suggest because if you do that then the bank always takes a cut off your money tldr do nt expect to make 10 15 on a passive investment and do what a lot of others do shares and bonds also make sure you get a lot of peoples opinions

the cost of paying tax should be considered an additional financial expense and the administrative burden of filing those taxes should be considered an additional labour expense simplified your question is asking how to determine whether these additional expenses are worth it there are many ways to calculate what your time is worth consider two situations where you may consider picking up additional part time work at minimum wage 1   if you are working 80 hours a week at a stressful but high paying job working another 5 hours a week at minimum wage would likely not be worth your time both because you already make a lot of money and also because your time is limited and therefore precious   2 if you are working 20 hours a week at minimum wage then another 5 hours a week at the same job would likely be worth your time both because it would increase your income by 25 and also because it would not put a heavy strain on your light schedule   these two extreme examples highlight the inferred principle that i think generally applies to weigh such decisions competes with in your specific example the actual work component will happen regardless of the money aspect that is your wife will be providing these services regardless so your question is essentially would it be worth it for my wife to make $ 5k given that she would pay tax on that money and would bear the burden of the tax filings etc   we ca n't answer this directly because it relates to what your wife values if doing this would make the activity which is otherwise just a hobby an unwanted chore then it may not be worth the post tax income if doing this would not impact her enjoyment of the teaching but would add on an unwanted ~1 hour week of paperwork is it worth spending 50 hours over the course of the year to earn $ 5k i assume the answer then would be yes

no the reinvestment is done as a courtesy consider one can have say 100 shares of a $ 50 stock a 2 dividend is $ or $ it would be a pretty bad deal if brokers charged you even $ 5 for that trade when cap gains and dividends are grouped as you suggest it refers to mutual funds my funds will have a year end dividend and cap gain distribution in a non retirement account one has to pay the tax due and be sure to add this to your cost basis as it 's money you are effectively adding to your account it does not mean cap gain the same as when you sell your shares of apple for a huge gain   those check boxes seem to offer you a chance to put all your holding on the same reinvestment plan for div cap gain you should also be able to choose one by one what you 'd like to do

no there is no indication that the recent decline will have an impact on the house market in the uk the for the downward move these last few weeks are mainly due to the last two points caused the chinese government to decide to the yuan this in turn triggered an unforeseen panic attack among investors and speculators around the globe starting with the chinese that are trading on borrowed money not only on margin but also by using loans the uk house prices are not influenced by the above factors not even indirectly the most important factors for house prices are in general if you keep the above points in mind you should be able to decide whether now is the right time to buy a house in your area given that a lot of central banks incl boe are maintaining a low interest rate policy except fed soon now is a good time to take a mortgage sources used i know interest rates are determined by the boe which looks at the global picture to determine these rates but the main directive of a central bank is to maintain an inflation close to but not exactly 2 as to spur on economic growth   as such the value of a company as on the stock market is not or barely taken into account the negligible impact is the reason why i stated that the crash in the summer of 2015 does n't even have an indirect impact   also such a crash is very short lived it 's more the underlying reason for the fears that could cause issues if they drag on

well first problem is usually that you are trying to do too much you end up micro managing once a company becomes large enough this is impossible to keep doing at the same level    if you find that you do n't have enough time maybe it 's time to either hire someone new or promote transfer someone you need to trust and give freedom to your employees to do their job in their own way which may or may not be better than yours communicate with each at intervals    a lot of business owners struggle with this because it costs them money and that is wrong it 's cost your company money which is a separate entity than you a piece of property that makes you less money than the week before is still making you money you are not losing money so get that out of your head it 's not your money until you take it out of the business until then that money including profits are the property of the business this is how the law see it by the way    marginally an understaffed store will make a larger percentage of profits from revenue a well staffed store will make more actual profits from more actual revenue because it can handle the business coming into the store better which in turns should lead to more business on a particular day you may see more money in profit from an understaffed store someone calls out let 's say   but trust me when i say that will not continue for very long    on of the biggest challenges new business owners face is they are as in they do n't spend the money they need to this means buying new equipment and hiring and giving raises and promotions so you can handle new business as well let say you are making t shirts or really adding new designs to pre made plain shirts you can only press one at a time which for a while is enough but eventually you are going to need another press so you can do 2 at a time but a lot business owners will somehow expect an employee to produce more with what he has now orders are n't being filed and you are in a panic and possibly angry but guess what you are angry at the employee not the fact you were to stupid to realize that he needs 2 presses to do the job correctly that 's your own fault and you 're blind to it because you feel as if you are working twice as hard than them because of the problem you created and let 's say the problem is different now the press is n't getting hot enough and it take 20 per shirt to get it to stay on correctly and you decide to never fix it then a light goes out then blank then blank and suddenly you realize finally all of this needs to be replaced at the same time i 've seen things like this happen in new and old businesses things work fine for the first 5 years then normal maintenance is forgotten have a depreciation fund ready so it does n't feel like you are spending any money that 's what that fund is for and you put into it from the beginning need a $ 2k equipment i have $ 4k saved for this already it was money intended to be spent on this    but of course some of this is going to depend on the type of business you are running and since you have provided us no details i ca n't give an answer for you because all businesses are different but i feel that these things refusing to give freedom and authority to other employees and refusing to spend money when needed are the biggest pitfalls most business owners fall into

really a comment on joetaxpayer 's answer but it 's too long there 's one big factor that for some people tips things strongly in favor of the roth while the limits on paper for traditional and roth are the same in practice they are not you can contribute more to a roth than you can to a traditional while the contribution limits are the same in both cases the roth holds after tax dollars and an after tax dollar is worth more than a pre tax dollar   if you 're not maxing your contribution this is completely irrelevant but if you are maxing your contributions and would like to contribute more this is a big push in the roth direction illustration   you 're in the 25 bracket you have $ 100k in a traditional ira   what 's it really worth   $ 75k because the irs will take $ 25k as you pull it out   you have the same $ 100k in a roth it 's really worth $ 100k as the ira wo n't take anything

yes an estate plan can be very important   estate planning typically attempts to eliminate uncertainties over the administration of a probate and maximize the value of the estate by reducing taxes and other expenses are often designated for minor children and beneficiaries in in general your estate includes all of your assets less all debt plus death benefits from all life insurance policies not held in an irrevocable trust the biggest reason to have an estate plan is to make sure that your personal values about both medical and personal finance financial matters are honored in the event that death or prevents you from acting for yourself in addition tax is a further and very important goal of estate planning for persons with taxable estates to create an estate plan for yourself or update an existing plan you will most likely need the services of an estate planning attorney when you consult with an estate planning attorney the attorney considers how you want assets distributed to heirs what taxes might your estate be liable for and whether there are tax strategies that would be appropriate and appealing what your preferences and values are with respect to the management of medical and financial affairs in the event of and any complicating family issues to deal with these issues your attorney will need full and accurate information about you including when an estate plan is created be sure you understand what the attorney is saying estate planning ideas can be confusing it is also appropriate and expected for you to ask about the attorney 's fee for any legal service some articles and resources get ahead of your estate planning estate planning by cba

they are just now where you might expect them they ca n't bring it to major cities yet but there are some companies bringing fiber to rural areas they are doing this where the max dsl speeds are not fast enough to be considered broadband and there is no other alternative that qualifies there is a government grant program which gives them money to bring fiber or any broadband but there 's no reason to not run fiber if you 're going to the trouble if when these companies can become profitable enough to move into territories without the grant you will see google fiber competitors in my town they are basically circling the city with fiber to the home just by covering the grant areas and expect to bring it in the city where we have charter which is actually pretty good except for the upload speeds within two years charter has already been upping their offerings in the area and has even doubled the speed at no cost for people in areas that are being served by the new fiber or will be soon as there is some overlap    fiber is n't that far off for most people because from what i understand almost everyone lives with 2 miles of a fiber run if you have cell phone access as most all cell phone towers have fiber to them and the way it works is odd in that no normal isp owns the fiber it 's by other companies that have to sell access to whoever can pay for it this is just what i 've heard from some discussions with people about the fiber company here so i do n't know everything maybe someone else here has more information

from how are indexes weighted market capitalization weighted indexes or market or cap weighted    indexes weight their securities by market value as measured by    capitalization that is current security price outstanding shares    the vast majority of equity indexes today are cap weighted including    the s&p 500 and the ftse 100 in a cap weighted index changes in the    market value of larger securities move the index ’s overall trajectory    more than those of smaller ones if the fund you are referencing is an etf then there may be some work to do to figure out what underlying securities to use when handling creation and redemption units as an etf will generally have shares created in 50,000 shares at a time through authorized participants if the fund you are referencing is an open end fund then there is still cash flows to manage in the fund as the fund has create and redeem shares in on a daily basis note in both cases that there can be updates to an index such as quarterly rebalancing of outstanding share counts changes in members because of mergers acquisitions or spin offs and possibly a few other factors how to beat the benchmark has a piece that may also be useful here for those indices with many members from 1998 as you can see its te is also persistently positive but if anything    seems to be declining over time in fact the average net te for the    whole period is + per month or an astounding + pa net    after expenses the fund expense ratio is annually for a    whopping before expense te of + 2.5 annually this is once again    highly statistically significant with p values of after    expenses and before expenses the sd of the te is higher for    than for lowering its degree of statistical    significance it is remarkable enough for any fund to beat its    benchmark by 2.5 annually over 17 years but it is downright to    see this done by an index fund to complete the picture since 1992 the vanguard extended index fund    has beaten its benchmark the wilshire 4500 by per year after    expenses net of expenses and even the vanguard index trust    500 has beaten its benchmark by a razor thin 0.08 annually before    but not after expenses in the same period so what is going on here a hint is found in 's 1996 reference    guide the 9 10 portfolio captures the return behavior of u.s. small company stocks as identified by and other academic    researchers dimensional employs a patient buyer discount block    trading strategy which has resulted in negative total trading costs    despite the poor liquidity of small company stocks beginning in 1982    ibbotson associates of chicago has used the 9 10 portfolio results to    calculate the performance of small company stocks for their stocks    bonds bills and inflation a small cap index fund can not possibly own all of the thousands of    stocks in its benchmark instead it owns a representative sample    further these stocks are usually thinly traded with wide bid ask    spreads in essence what the folks at learned was that they could    tell the market makers in these stocks look old chaps we do n't have    to own your stock and unless you let us inside your spread we 'll    pitch our elsewhere further we 're prepared to wait until a    motivated seller wishes to unload a large block in a sense this    gives the fund the luxury of picking and choosing stocks at prices    more favorable than generally available hence higher long term    returns it appears that vanguard did not tumble onto this until a    decade later but tumble they did to complete the picture this strategy works best in the    markets so the excess returns are greatest in the smallest stocks    which is why the positive te is greatest for the 9 10 fund less    in the vanguard small cap fund less still in the vanguard index    extended fund and minuscule with the s&p500 there are some who say the biggest joke in the world of finance is the    idea of value added active management if so then the punch line    seems to be this if you really want to beat the indexes then you    got ta buy an index fund

to round out something that w. rea pointed out the business that a reit is in will be either a equity reit property management b mortgage reit lending or c hybrid reit both   a very key point about why reits broadly have been struggling lately and this would show up in the reit indices etfs you 've linked to is linked to the reit business models   for an equity reit they borrow money at the going rate let 's say for commercial scale loans and use that to take out mortgages on physical properties if a property rents for $ 15 k per month and they can take out a $ 1.8 million loan at $ 9,000 per month then their business is around managing maintenance operating expenses and taxes on that $ 6,000 per month margin for a mortgage reit they borrow funds as a highly qualified borrower again let 's say and lend those funds back out at a higher rate the basic concept is that if you borrow $ 10 million at 4.5 for 30 years you need to pay it back at $ per month if you can lend it out reliably at 5 you collect $ per month a handy $ 3,000 per month the cheaper you can get money at below 4.5 and the higher you can lend it at above 5 the better your margin is   the worry is that both reit business models are very highly dependent on the cost of borrowing money with the us fed changing its bond buying qe stimulus activity the prevailing interest rates are likely to go up while this has its benefits inflation it also will make it more expensive for these types of companies to do business

if you are going to finance a used car it is frequently best to arrange financing before you even pick out the car     the easiest way i recommend is to talk to a local credit union or two    they 'll be able to tell you your interest rate and terms without having to talk to the dealer at all   most likely they 'll be significantly better than the dealer at getting a good interest rate as far what is a good rate check out bankrate for average loan rates today 's numbers look like is the average for a used car loan    that means if the bank comes back with something ridiculous like 9 or 10 you know they are way overcharging you    i know someone who got a first time buyer rate from ford and ended up with a 19.99 rate    i could literally buy the car on my credit card and end up in a better spot honestly though if you are 18 and have $ 5500 to put towards a car i 'd buy a $ 4500 car and save $ 1000 for repairs and maintenance    after you have the car put $ 250 every month for a car payment into a savings account for your next car

people treat an emergency fund as some kind of ace in the hole when it comes to financial difficulty but it is only one of many sources of money that you can utilize what is an emergency first you have to define what an emergency is   is it a lost job   is it an unplanned event pregnancy perhaps   is it a medical emergency   is it the death of you or your spouse also what does it mean to be unplanned   is being so unhappy with your job that you give a 2-week notice an emergency   is one month of planning an emergency   two only you can answer these questions for yourself but they significantly shape your financial strategy   planning is highly dependent on your cashflow and for some people it may take them a year to build enough savings to enable them to take 3 months off work   for others they may be able to change their spending to build up enough for 3 months in 1 month also you have to consider the length of the emergency   job loss is rarely permanent but it 's rarely short as well   the current average is weeks that 's 7 months money in an emergency there are six main places that people get money during a financial emergency a good emergency strategy takes all six of these into account   some emergencies may lean more on one source than the other   however some of these are correlated for example in 2008 three things happened   the stock market crashed unsecured debt dried up and people faced financial emergency lost jobs cut wages   if you were dependent on a stock portfolio and/or a line of credit you 'd be up a creek because the value of your investments suddenly decreased and you ca n't really tap your now significantly limited line of credit however if you had a one or more of cash savings unemployment income and unemployment insurance you would probably have been ok budgeting for an emergency when you say financial emergency most people think job loss   however the most common cause of bankruptcy in the us is medical debt   depending on your insurance situation this could be a serious risk or it may not be    people say you should have of your monthly income in savings because it 's an easy back of the envelope way to handle most financial emergency risk but it 's not necessarily the most prudent strategy for you to properly budget for an emergency you need to fully take into account what emergencies you are likely to face and what sources of financing you would have access to given the likely factors that led to that emergency generally having a savings account with some amount of liquid cash is an important part of a risk mitigation strategy   but it 's not a panacea for every kind of emergency

a share of stock is a small fraction of the ownership of the company if you expect the company to eventually be of interest to someone who wants to engineer a merger or takeover it 's worth whatever someone is willing to pay to help make that happen or keep it from happening which means it will almost always track the company 's value to some degree because the company itself will buy back shares when it can if they get too cheap to protect itself from takeover it may also start paying dividends at a later date you may also value being able to vote on the company 's actions including whether it should offer a dividend or reinvest that money in the company basically you would want to own that share or not for the same reasons you would want to own a piece of that business because that 's exactly what it is

no do n't bother   you need to decide what you are saving for and how much risk you are prepared to take it would make sense if you wanted the money only in x years and could n't afford to lose say 20 or more if the stock market crashed the day before you needed the cash   typically if you are about to retire and buy an annuity you want to protect your capital   this is n't you at 28 you might be saving for a wedding a deposit on a house possibly for school fees or for eventual retirement   it does n't sound like you need to get back exactly 24k in july 2022 keep the 6 months expenses in accounts that you can withdraw from at short notice   some of this in a current account some might be in a savings account that does n't pay interest if you make withdrawals after that i 'd stick most of the rest in stock market tracker funds but you might go for actively managed funds instead ask another question and take professional advice there will presumably be local tax considerations too and add in most of your monthly savings too   these should beat the 2.3 over the 5 years and you can liquidate them easily if you want to buy a house if there is a recession and a stock market dip you presumably have the flexibility to hold on to them longer for the economy to recover   and if you are intending to buy a house then a recession will probably also involve a fall in house prices so the loss in your savings will be somewhat balanced by the drop in the purchase price of your house of course the worst case scenario is a severe downturn where you lose your job are unemployed for a considerable period of time burn through your emergency fund and need to sell shares at a considerable loss to meet your expenses    you might have family or dependents that you can borrow from or would need to support which would change your tolerance for risk   having money locked away for 5 years in this scenario is even worse   so if you do n't want to put all your non emergency savings into the stock market you still want to choose something that is accessible at a slightly lower interest rate but ultimately it sounds like you can afford to lose some of your savings and the probability is that you will be rewarded with much better returns than 2.3 over 5 years

how have i moved the goalposts my original claim was that the was a result of the unions that 's what you quoted and what you responded to just there said the exact same thing   it 's a factually true statement boeing made these demands as a result of the union labor driving up labor costs washington state offered boeing incentives to stay as they would otherwise be looking to move as a direct result of the union labor wages

obama is a piece of shit who is nothing more than a puppet you will get no arguement from me on that what piece of shit would you like to see in his place these horrid anti competition agreements are not possible without 's supporting them you wonder why governments and corporations are so friendly with one another think about it who collects the taxes for the government and do you think the government could get those taxes without those corporations doing the job for them they would have to come to your house and force it out of your hands face to face by getting your boss to do it they make him the bad guy who does n't pay you what you feel you are worth you ignore the fact that if he did n't steal from your cheque he would be shut down   you think the mafia has a monopoly on extortion    what part in your own words do i have completely backwards

yes i know i never claimed they did haha i 'm not saying to cut a $ 15 billion share buyback and make it a $ 15 billion dividend payout depends on the company of course but i 'd prefer a more balanced approach with sitting cash rather than using a large majority on buybacks which seems to be a trend these days i think it poorly for the future and that 's all i 'm saying

talk about coincidence we just recieved letters from our bank saying that our interest only loans will be going up by and if we want to keep our lower rate we will need to change early to now our interest only periods end in 6 months to about 16 months anyway we have decided to change to p&i early and save on our interest expenses why because the main purpose of investing is to make money not to save on tax even if you are on the highest marginal tax rate for every extra dollar of expenses you spend and claim as a deduction you will only get about 50 cents back through tax savings if you are on the lowest marginal tax rate your tax savings will reduce to less than 20 cents for every extra dollar spent if you are investing in order to save on tax you may be investing for the wrong reasons your primary reason for investing should be to make money for wealth creation a good reason to stay with an interest only loan for an investment property would be if you require the extra cash flow you would receive compared with an loan
