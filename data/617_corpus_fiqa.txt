if you call them you can make sure they 'll use the new address but if you want to do it online there is some risk that the update is delayed note also that an address change with an immediate request for a replacement debit card smells very fishy this what a hacker thief would do to get your money calling seems to be the better approach as you can verify your identity further otherwise you might well run into an automated block

in the us section of the uniform commercial code sets the rules for how any confusion in checks or other business transactions is handled if an instrument contains contradictory terms terms prevail over printed terms handwritten terms prevail over both and words prevail over numbers   if there was any ambiguity in the way you wrote out the amount the institution will compare the two fields the written words and the courtesy box digits to see if the ambiguity can be resolved   the reality is that the busy tellers and atm operators typically are going to look at the numeric digits first so even if they happen to notice the traditional and missing it seems highly unlikely that such an would cause enough ambiguity between these the two fields to reject the payment common sense dictates here i would n't worry about it

i was wondering how future cash flows of the asset are predicted are they also predicted using fundamental and/or technical analysis there are a many ways to forecast the future cash flows of assets for example for companies it seems like calculating expected required rate using capm does not belong to either fundamental or technical analysis does it i would qualify the capm as quantitative analysis because it 's mathematics and statistics it 's not really fundamental since its does not relies on economical data except the prices and as for technical analysis the term is often used as a synonym for graphical analysis or but quantitative analysis can also be referred as technical analysis the present value of future cash flows called intrinsic price value if i am correct yes you are correct i wonder when deciding whether an asset is over fair under valued what kind of price is compared to what other kind of price if it 's only to compare with the price usually the net asset value which is the book value the discount cash flows the intrinsic value and the price of comparable companies and the capm are used in comparison to current market price of the asset that you are studying why is it in the quote to compare the first two kinds of prices instead of comparing the current real price on the markets to any of the other three kinds actually the last line of the quote says that the comparison is done on the observed price which is the market price the other prices ca n't really be observed but think that the part an asset is correctly priced when its estimated price is the same as the present value of future cash flows of the asset means that since the capm gives you an expected rate of return by using this rate to compute the present value of future cash flows of the asset you should have the same predicted price i wrote this post explaining some valuation strategies maybe you can find some more information by reading it

do n't sell ever   well almost a number of studies have shown that buying equal amounts of shares randomly will beat the market long term and certainly wo n't do badly   starting from this premise then perhaps you can add a tiny bit extra with your skill maybe but who knows you might suck   point is when buying you have the wind behind you a monkey would make money selling is a different matter you have the cost of trading out and back in to something else only to have changed from one monkey portfolio to the other if you have skill that covers this cost then yes you should do this but how confident are you a few studies have been done on retail broker accounts and they show the same story   retail investors on average lose money on their switches even if you believe you have a real edge on the market   you 're strategy still should not just say sell when it drops out of your criteria   your criteria are positive indicators lack of positive is not a negative indicator   sell when you would happily go short the stock    that is you are really confident it is going down otherwise leave it

margin is when you borrow to buy stock     the margin is the amount you can have borrowed over your own stock there may also be some other considerations e.g. risk portfolio say you have 10,000 your broker allows you buy on margin with a margin requirement of 100 so you buy 18,000 of stock you have 10k of your own and borrowed 8k to buy this so you have 80 extra stock on margin say the stock has a downturn and loses 12 or so suddenly you have 16k stock value but you still owe 8k you are now at 100 margin 8k is yours 8k is borrowed money      at this point if you drop anymore you are exceeding 100 margin and your broker may sell to ensure they get their 8k     the benefits of this are of course if the stock goes in your favor 10 rise is 1,800 instead of 1,000

there are several ways that the issuers profit from cfds if the broker has trades on both sides buy and sell they can net the volumes off against each other and profit off the spread whilst using the posted margins to cover p&l from both sides because settlement for most securities is not on the same day that the order is placed they can also buy the security with no intention of taking delivery and simply sell it off at the end of day to pass delivery on to someone else here again they profit from the spread and that their volumes give them really low commissions so their costs are much lower than the value of the spread if they have to do this rather than netting the position out the spreads will be wider   sometimes that may be forced to buy the security outright but that is rare and the spreads will be even wider so that they can make a decent profit

there are cases where it makes sense to insure something even if you can bear its loss   insurance is a tool to control risk   one reason you might want to control risk is indeed if you can not afford to bear it 's loss   however there are other reasons you might wish to insure something when you look at your life in totality let 's say you have $ 100 to work with and you have an item a that costs $ 30 perhaps you really need a in your life but its clear here that you can afford to replace it so maybe you do n't insure it   then you get item b which also costs $ 30 and item c which costs $ 30   we can see that you can cover all three of these total value $ 90 so one might argue that you do n't need to insure it now let 's add item d onto the plate also at a cost of $ 30   now you 're in an interesting position with 4 items you depend on a b c and d which have a sum total replacement cost of $ 120   now if all of these break or are stolen you no longer have the funds to replace them   of course what are the odds that all of them break at the same time   you may be able to do the math to determine the probability of going broke and use that to determine whether you want to insure the item or not now consider that you will have to make a similar mathematical analysis for every additional purchase you make   you will also have items which you can bear to lose but you really do n't want to   these can add a large amount of effort to every decision you make   it may be worth getting insurance in such a case   one could think of the purchase in two parts   there is the part that accounts for the statistical expectation of loss and the other is the insurance company 's profits   the profits could be thought of as paying the insurance company for a service which makes it easier for you to think through complicated decisions by removing risk

insurance is to mitigate risk you ca n't handle yourself   all insurance not just car insurance   the expected value of the insurance will always cost more than the expected value of your loss that 's how the insurance company makes money   but sometimes the known fixed cost is better for your ability to sleep at night than the unknown though likely lower variable cost if you were suddenly hit with a bill the size of your car tomorrow would you be ok   if so then you can handle the risk yourself and do n't need insurance   if not then you need the insurance the insurance company sells thousands of policies and it 's much easier to predict the number out of 1000 people that will get in an accident tomorrow than the chance that you specifically will get in an accident tomorrow   so they can manage the risk by making a small amount of money from people and buying the other guy a new car

in general you can only be charged for services if there is some kind of contract the contract does n't have to be written but you have to have agreed to it somehow however it is possible that you entered into a contract due to some clause in the home purchase contract or the contract with the home owners association there are also sometimes services you are legally required to get such as regular inspection of heating furnaces though i do n't think this translates to automatic contracts but in any case you would not be liable for services rendered before you entered into the contract which sounds like it 's the case here

this entirely depends on two factors now let 's look at what applecare gives you what it covers is any manufacturing defect it also covers you for phone support as otherwise it 's a $ incident charge even for simple issues it also covers any software issues that you may come across as long as the issues pertain to apple software or the operating system itself what it does n't cover is any damage caused by the user if you snap the corner of the screen drop it spill liquid on it modify it etc then you 're responsible for paying the repair costs if you 're outside of phone support then you 're going to have to pay someone to fix any problems you come across now if we 're to trust this handy study done in 2009 then we can say that the 3-year failure rate for and macbook pros is we could go ahead and say that $ 350 $ 2000 = 17.5 so the chances match up but what 's the likelihood that apple is going to cover the full $ 2000 only under extreme cases are you losing the full $ 2000 theft shock damage etc and those are all cases that apple wo n't cover anyways instead we 're looking at cases such as please keep in mind it has been several years since i worked for apple so these figures may be off so this reduces our possible savings significantly let 's then also look at what the warranty becomes after they fixed a part a replacement part or apple product including a user part that has been installed in accordance with instructions provided by apple assumes the remaining term of the warranty or 90 days from the date of replacement or repair whichever provides longer coverage for you which means in this case that you have a 90-day warranty after they 've fixed an issue this significantly reduces the likelihood of a same part going bad multiple times in a row therefore the chances of that $ 350 being worthwhile are very much against you even if the system does fail in some way it is likely that the repair would be cheaper than the applecare the chances of running into a repair or series of repairs that pays for the applecare and then some are astonishingly low i would still get it if you were giving it to someone who was significantly lacking in any technology concepts such as a parent or grandparent as they are more likely to utilize the extended phone support especially for smaller things that they might you about

firstly how far behind on rent are they have you sent them notices in writing about late rent and if so how many have you had to send how often do they say they are going to do things like pay overdue rent and they never do to tell you the truth imho if they are starting to be regularly late in rent payments and they do n't do things they say they are going to do then it is time to evict them in nsw australia if the tenant is more than 2 weeks late in rent and prior to them reaching 2 weeks late you have called them asking for late rent and sent notices you can evict the tenants if the tenants do not leave you can apply to the tribunal to get them out and ask for outstanding money to be paid to you however if it does get to this stage the tenants may be pissed off so may do some damage to the property in retaliation then you have to go back to the tribunal to get the tenant 's bond security deposit and any other funds to repair any damages done to your place the longer you leave it the worse it will get we had some tenants similar to this which we finally got out earlier this year they would say they would pay rent due by the end of the week and no money would come by the end of the week we took them to tribunal and got them out and we got the bond plus unpaid rent and other money for damages and leaving the place dirty over and above the bond awarded to us just under $ 4k.   the tenants said they could n't pay and so went on a payment plan to pay about $ every 2 weeks they did n't pay any of the payments so then we went to the local court to get a sheriff to go to their new place and take their property the must have gotten scared from this because they approached the local court and agreed to pay $ 60 per week we have currently received about 10 payments so it will be a long time before we get all our money back as i said the longer you leave it the worse it can get you should also look at improving your criteria for selecting new tenants i have given an answer to this question how to choose a good tenant as a private landlord hopefully it can give you some ideas of what to ask for when searching for your next tenant update due update in question six weeks behind in rent is quite a bit to be behind if the landlord had been asking the tenant to pay the late rent during this period and the tenant had been giving excuses why the rent was late and saying they would pay it by a certain time but never did it is a big sign that they will tell you lies   if this is the first time they have been late in paying rent and now they are back up to date with the rent you might want to give them one more chance if this is a pattern that happens regularly it is better to get them out as it will happen again you will get in an argument with them and then they might stop paying rent altogether you can usually gain a better perspective of the tenants from their action rather than their words that is why their past rental history is so important when finding a new tenant

there are two common types of p e ratio calculations trailing and forward and then there are various mixes of the two trailing p e ratios are calculated as current price trailing 12-month eps an alternative is the forward p e ratio which is based on an estimate of earnings in the coming 12 months the estimate used is usually called consensus and to answer your question is the average estimate of analysts who cover the stock any reputable organization will disclose how they calculate their financials for example reuters uses a trailing ratio indicated by ttm on their page for bhp so the first reason a pe ratio might not jump on an announcement is it might be forward looking and therefore not very sensitive to the realized earnings the second reason is that if it is a trailing ratio some of the annual eps change is known prior to the annual announcement for example on 12/31 a company might report a large drop in annual earnings but if the bulk of that loss was reported in a previous quarterly report then the trailing eps would account partially for it prior to the annual announcement   in this case i think the first reason is the culprit the reuters p e of nearly 12 is a trailing ratio so if you see 8 i 'd think it must be based on a forward looking estimate

as chrisinedmonton describes shorting has an asymmetric risk reward ratio and put options have a time cost if you think the market is overvalued and buy lots of puts but they expire before the market finally corrects you can lose your entire investment   betting on market timing of any kind is extremely difficult to do some would argue it 's impossible the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent is a favorite wall street trader saying instead of playing a game that 's difficult to win the better option is to play one you can win that 's to learn how to value individual investments well and accumulate cash until you can find investments that are under valued to invest in the best way to learn to value investments is to read graham and buffett the intelligent investor is a good starting point and you can read all of buffett 's investor letters for the last 30 years + for free on the berkshire hathaway web site finally the textbook on valuing stocks and other investments is securities analysis the 6th edition is only version to get it was updated with buffett and other leading value investors oversight a basic overview of valuing investments is that every investment has an intrinsic value consisting of it 's future cash flows discounted for the time it takes to receive them the skill is being able to estimate how likely those cash flows are to happen a is it a good business does it have a moat i.e. barriers that make it hard for competitors to duplicate it b will management invest or distribute those cash flows wisely then your strategy is to not even worry about the market spend your time looking at individual stocks and investments and wait until some come along that 's well undervalued that may be during a market correction or it may be tomorrow and it 's not just good enough to intelligently value your investments you also have to have psychological fortitude to not panic and to think for yourself buffett describes it best ben graham my friend and teacher long ago described the mental attitude toward market fluctuations that i believe to be most conducive to investment success he said that you should imagine market quotations as coming from a remarkably accommodating fellow named mr. market who is your partner in a private business without fail mr. market appears daily and names a price at which he will either buy your interest or sell you his even though the business that the two of you own may have economic characteristics that are stable mr. market ’s quotations will be anything but for sad to say the poor fellow has emotional problems at times he feels and can see only the favorable factors affecting the business when in that mood he names a very high buy sell price because he fears that you will snap up his interest and rob him of imminent gains at other times he is depressed and can see nothing but trouble ahead for both the business and the world on these occasions he will name a very low price since he is terrified that you will unload your interest on him mr. market has another characteristic he does n’t mind being ignored if his quotation is uninteresting to you today he will be back with a new one tomorrow transactions are strictly at your option under these conditions the more manic his behavior the better for you but like at the ball you must heed one warning or everything will turn into and mr. market is there to serve you not to guide you it is his not his wisdom that you will find useful if he shows up some day in a particularly foolish mood you are free to ignore him or to take advantage of him but it will be disastrous if you fall under his influence indeed if you are n’t certain that you understand and can value your business far better than mr. market you do n’t belong in the game lastly learning to value investments is n't just useful in the stock market they are applicable to investing in any investment such as bonds real estate and even buying your home or running a business

stock prices are n't constant they rise and fall    the overall return on a share is the combination of the dividends paid plus the change in value of the share   some companies pay no dividend at all yet investors still buy their shares because they believe the share price will rise people invest in stocks because they believe that the overall return will exceed what they can get from cash in the bank    as to options they do offer higher potential profits but they also offer higher potential losses   different investors have different appetites for risk   many are comfortable with the risk of mainstream stock investing but not with that of options trading

grad school applications typically have deadlines around december or january so you 're thinking about this at the right time    first obviously you should get an idea of where you want to go and what kind of program there 's plenty of ranking lists online that can help give you an idea grad school applications take a non trivial amount of effort so most people apply to only 5 10   next you 'll want to contact potential references the grad school websites should inform you what type of reference they want but in my experience these were mostly academic and usually 2 3 per application finance programs may want more professional references as well try to choose the right references for the application e.g. i applied to financial engineering programs and would usually have one economics professor and then either a math professor or a statistics professor depending on the focus of the program   now check to see if your programs require a gre gmat score they probably will and start studying asap there 's tons of study materials available both in book form and online and if you can put the time in you can probably get a decent score with just a few weeks 4 6 of studying as far as i know just about every program that accepts a gmat score will also accept a gre score but not necessarily the other way around so you may be better off studying for the gre verify this   and with all those components complete you 'll basically be done some applications will ask for various forms of cover letter or have other essay questions so set aside some time to write these as well    also if you 're looking at finance master 's programs i notice that they tend to come in a few varieties some set you up for phds and are naturally more academic focused where as terminal master 's that resemble an mba will focus on trying to get you a job reflect a bit on what you want to accomplish with your degree and figure out the program that 's best for that if you get in to a top school then it wo n't matter much regardless but otherwise it is very likely that schools which produce good phd candidates and research are not necessarily the same schools which place people on wall street   hope that helps

for the person being hired this is a tricky situation specially with the new laws there is no real magic number that can be applied as a lot will depend on what benefits you want and what is actually available this will really shift the spectrum quite a bit   under the care act everyone has to have insurance or pay a fine were really not sure what to call this yet but there are two provisions that really mess with the numbers you look at as an employee   first the cost of heath care has skyrocketed so the same benefits that you had 5 years ago now cost maybe 10 15 times as much as they used to this gets swept under the rug a bit because the main costs of insurance has only increased a tiny amount what this actually comes down to is does your new aca approved heath plan cover exactly the benefits you need or does it cut corners   sorry this is complicated and i do n't mean it to come off as a speech against the aca so i will give an example my wife has ra she really has it under control with the help of her ra doctor this is not something she ever wants to change because she has had ra from the age of 15 and because it 's she does n't want to spend 5 years working with a new doctor to get to the same place she is with her current doctor   in addition the main drugs she takes for ra are not covered under any aca plan nor are the that her doctor makes we are trying to have kids so she has to be off the main meds and a couple of the things this doctor has tried has been meds that reduce are pregnancy safe but are not for the treatment of ra you now have to take into effect rather the cost of health insurance + the cost of the things now not covered by the heath insurance + the out of pocket expenses is worth the insurance   second the aca has set up provisions to straight up trick those people that have lower income and are not paying close attention when shopping for insurance they get quotes like $ 50 a month or $ 100 a month the truth is that the remainder of the actual cost is deducted from their tax returns this takes consideration because if you thing your paying $ 50 a month for insurance but your really paying $ 650 then you need to make sure your doing your math right finally you need to understand how messed up things are right now in the us with heath care largely this goes unreported i 'm not really sure why but in order to do this i will have to give examples   for my wife to see a specialist her ra doctor the co pay is $ 75 so she goes to the doctor he charges her $ 75 and bills the insurance $ 200 the insurance pays the doctor $ 50 with out insurance the visit costs $ 50   at first you want to blame the doctor for cheating the system but the doctor has to pay for hours of labor to get the $ 50 back from the insurance company from the doctors perspective it 's cheaper to take the $ 50 then it is to charge the insurance company and by charging the insurance company he has no control over the cost of the co pay he essentially has to charge more to make the same money and the patient gets the in the process another example i got throat last year i went to the walk in clinic paid $ 75 saw the doctor got my z pack for $ 15 went home in bed and got better my wife who still had separate insurance from before the marriage got throat that went to the same clinic they charged her $ 200 for the visit $ 50 co pay and $ 250 for the z pack $ 3 co pay the insurance paid the clinic $ 90 for the visit and $ 3 for the drugs again the patient is left out in this scenario in this case it worked better for my wife unless you account for the fact that to get that coverage she had to pay $   my point is that when comparing costs of with insurance and without out insurance its often times much cheaper for the practices to have you self pay then it is for them to go through the loops of trying to insurance to make them whole this creates two rates self pay rates and insured rates when your trying to figure out the cost of not having insurance then you need to use the self pay rates these can be vastly different   so as an employee you need to figure out your cost of heath care with insurance and your cost of heath care without insurance then user those numbers when your trying to negotiate a salary the problem is that there is no magic number to use for this because the cost will very a lot for us it was cheaper to not have insurance even with a pre existing condition that takes constant attention it 's just better if we set aside $ 500 a month then it is to try to pay $ 750 a month that might not hold true for everyone for some people or conditions it may be better to pay the $ 750 then to try to handle it themselves   so for my negotiations i would go with without insurance or with insurance   now as an employer it 's a lot simpler usually you have a group plan that offers you a pretty straight $ x per year per person or $ y per year per family so you can offer exactly that salary $ x or salary $ y. as a starting point however this is where negotiations start   if your offering me $ and insurance i would rather just have $ and no insurance of course your real cost is only $ 55,000 cause you do n't care about my heath care costs only about insurance costs so you try to negotiate down towards $ 55,000 and no insurance but that 's not good enough for me so i either go else where and you loose talent or i accept $ and insurance or somewhere in between

googling vanguard target asset allocation led me to this page on the bogleheads wiki which has detailed breakdowns of the target retirement funds that page in turn has a link to this vanguard pdf which goes into a good level of detail on the construction of these funds portfolios i excerpt to the question of why so much weight in equities in our view two important considerations justify an expectation of an    equity risk premium the first is the historical record in the past    and in many countries stock market investors have been rewarded with    such a premium   historically bond returns have lagged equity returns by about    percentage points annualized amounting to an enormous return    differential in most circumstances over longer time periods    consequently retirement savers investing only in safe assets must    dramatically increase their savings rates to compensate for the lower    expected returns those investments offer the second strategic principle underlying our    construction that younger investors are better able to withstand    risk recognizes that an individual ’s total net worth consists of both    their current financial holdings and their future work earnings for    younger individuals the majority of their ultimate retirement wealth    is in the form of what they will earn in the future or their human    capital therefore a large commitment to stocks in a younger    person ’s portfolio may be appropriate to balance and diversify risk    exposure to work related earnings to the question of how the exact allocations were decided as part of the process of evaluating and identifying an appropriate    glide path given this theoretical framework we ran various    financial simulations using the vanguard capital markets model we    examined different risk reward scenarios and the potential    implications of different glide paths and approaches the pdf is highly readable i would say and includes references to quant articles for those that like that sort of thing

a bank is insolvent when it can no longer meet its short term obligations   in this example the bank is insolvent when depositors withdraw more cash than the bank can pay out in this case it 's probably something in the range of $ 600 700k because the bank can borrow money from other banks using assets as collateral in the us we manage this risk in a few ways first fdic insurance provides a level of assurance that in a worst case scenario most depositors will have access to their money guaranteed by the government this prevents bank panics and reduces the demand for cash the risk that remains is the risk that you brought up in your scenario bad debt or investments that are valued we mitigate this risk by giving the federal reserve and in some instances the us treasure the ability to provide nearly unlimited capital to get over short mid term issues brought on by the market in cases of long term structural issues with the bank balance sheets regulators like the fdic federal reserve and others have the ability to assume control of the bank and sell off its assets to other stronger institutions the current financial regime has its in the bank panics of the 1890 's when the shift from an agricultural based economy where no capital is available until the crops come in to an industrial economy revealed the weakness of the unregulated model where ad hoc groups of banks backed each other up good banks were being destroyed by panics until a trusted third party jp morgan stepped in committed capital and make personal guarantees

the more i think about this the more i think you are actually better off letting it go to collections at least then you would be able to agree an affordable repayment schedule based on your real budget and having a big dent in your credit score because it 's gone to collections does n't actually put you in any worse position in terms of acquiring credit in the future than you are now   whoever is the creditor on your original loan is imo quite unreasonable demanding a payment in full on a given date especially given that you say you 've only been made aware of this debt recently the courts are usually much more reasonable about this sort of thing and recognise that a payment plan over several years with an affordable monthly payment is much more likely to actually get the creditor their money back than any other strategy they will also recognise and appreciate that you have made significant efforts to obtain the money i 'm also worried about your statement about how panicked and ready to give up you are is there someone you can talk to around here uk we have debt counselling bureaus they ca n't help with money for the actual debt itself but they can help you with strategies for dealing with debt and will explain all parts of the process to you what your rights and responsibilities are if it does go to court etc if you have something similar i suggest you contact them even just to speak to someone and find out that this is n't the end of the world it 's a situation but in a few years you 'll be able to look back and at least laugh at it

daniel first of all i 'm jealous of your predicament   that said i think you 've gotten some good advice already so i wo n't repeat what 's been said   but i will throw out a few ideas that have n't come up   my first thought is that you may be underestimating upcoming expenses   it sounds like your current expenses are low and that 's great   i 'm impressed that you 're living below your means and looking for the best way to use your extra cash   but you may not be thinking of a few things you have a girlfriend and maybe your relationship is n't such that you are planning a wedding quite yet   but regardless of whether your current girlfriend is your future life partner or not if you think marriage may be in your future at all you 'll save yourself a lot of stress if you 've got some savings for a wedding in place before you 're ready to commit next what are you driving   if it 's a good car that you expect to last you another 10 years you 're probably ok right now   but if you may need to replace your vehicle in the next few years start saving now and you may be able to buy it outright   i expect your interest rate on financing a car would be higher than your current student loan rates so i would save for a car before paying down loans with such beautiful rates a house has already been discussed and there was also mention of additional education and both of those require a solid financial plan that begins far in advance in summary i think you need a lot more than $ 5 k in savings   sure have some fun and take advantage of opportunities to travel etc as they come along but if you 're able to bump your savings by $ 500 to $ 1000/month i think you 'll really be glad you did   when it comes time for a new car or you find you 're ready to settle down it will be nice to have somewhere to draw from and if there 's only $ 5 k in your savings you may come to regret choices you made when you were 22

credit in general having no significant change between an income level or net worth is due to the economic reciprocity principle inherent in many societies although some areas of credit may be more admirable to those who are n't as well off such as car loans the overall understanding of credit is a trust agreement between someone getting something e.g. credit card user and someone giving something e.g. bank or company credit does n't have to mean just money it can be anything of value including tangible materials services etc the fact is that a credit is a common element in most economical systems and as such its use is not really variable between income levels etc sure there is variance in things like credit line amounts and rewards but the overall gist is the same for everyone borrowing paying back benefits etc all of these exchanges form the same understanding we all know and follow credit brings along with it trust the form represented in a score while not everyone may depend entirely on credit and no one should use credit as a means of getting by entirely money everyone can understand and reap the benefits of a system whether they make 10 k a year of 10 m a year this is the general idea behind credit in the broadest sense possible besides just because one has or makes more money does n't mean they do n't prefer to get good deals nobody should like being taken advantage of and if credit can help anyone can establish trust

i think you misunderstand the purpose of the liability account   i would suggest you review the standard accounting model but to give you a brief overview income and expenses are money coming into and out of your possession   they are the pipes flowing into and out of your box   inside your box you have assets bank savings cash etc and liabilities credit cards unpaid debts etc   money can flow into and out of either asset or liability accounts for example deposit a payment income to asset buy office supplies with cash asset to expense pay a bill with credit card liability to expense customer pays one of your debts directly income to liability   paying off a debt with an asset does not affect your overall net worth so paying a check to your credit card bill asset to liability does n't decrease your total balance it merely moves the value from one bucket to another now to your question mandatory payments such as taxes or insurance or for that matter utilities rent all things that must be bought occasionally are not liabilities instead they are all expenses   they might be paid from a liability account if they are paid on credit for example but the money still flows from liability to expense   in my own records i have expense taxes and expense insurance with sub accounts in each   where the money comes from depends entirely on how i pay my bills whether from cash or banks asset or whether it 's a charge liability   sometimes you receive payments back from an insurance company   i find that rather than treating insurance premiums as a positive balance in a liability with eventual payments as debits to the liability account it is better to treat any payment from the insurance as income hope that helps

this does n't answer your question but as an aside it 's important to understand that your second and third bullet points are completely incorrect while it used to be true that swiss bank accounts often came with guarantees of neutrality and privacy in recent years even the swiss banks have been to political pressure from many sides especially us obama with regards to the most extreme cases of criminals that is to say if you 're a terrorist or a child or in possession of nazi assets swiss banks wo n't provide the protection you 're interested in you might say but i 'm not a terrorist or a or profiteering of war crimes but if you 're trying so hard to hide your personal assets it 's worth wondering how much longer until swiss banks make further concessions to start providing information on not to discourage you this is just food for thought the bulletproof protection these accounts used to provide has been compromised i work with online advertising companies and a number of people i know in the industry get sued on a regular basis for copyright or trademark infringement or spamming most of these people still trust swiss bank accounts because it 's still the best protection available for their assets and because swiss banks have n't given up details on someone for spamming yet

the main reason to exercise the shares sooner rather than later is that you have to hold the shares for 1 year to gain access to the long term capital gains rate when you sell your shares you do not want short term capital gains rates to apply to these shares when you sell them if the company is unable to go public and sells privately you may not have any choice but to sell your shares immediately if the company goes public you will simply have to hold your shares for a year after you buy them before selling to get the lower tax rate

a debenture is a security document this means that the bond is secured over assets under english law you can issue bonds which if defaulted upon you can enforce your security against the issuer i.e. the company which means you can attempt to get your money back by getting hold of the company 's assets    as for a floating charge i 'll first explain what a fixed charge is say you 're a bank a lender and you lend £ 1000 to x. you take security by way of a fixed charge over x 's photocopy machines x is unable to dispose of the machines without the lender 's consent this means that if x can not pay up the loan you can enforce security by taking possession of the photocopy machines sell them and hopefully get enough money back to cover the default   a floating charge works the same way but over assets which fluctuate e.g. x 's stock of potatoes x sells potatoes to supermarkets all the time so you ca n't just take a fixed charge over it for practical reasons you ca n't just ask the lender each time you want to sell a potato when an event of default occurs i.e. you do n't pay back the loan or breach a condition of the loan agreement the floating charge and becomes a fixed charge thus enabling the lender to sell the potatoes to get their money back   random examples but makes sense   source future english solicitor

there are no immediate tax related benefits to putting money into a roth ira you are investing after tax money in the hope that the rules wo n't change and you 'll be able to take out the money tax free when you retire under current rules you can take out your contributions at any time without penalties or taxes you ca n't take out earnings without penalties until you retire you said you do n't have any debt great so if you have cash that you do n't have other uses for and you do n't mind possibly tying it up for a long time you can put money into a roth ira i 'd argue that if you have say $ 25 50/month to put into long term savings it 's a good habit to start when you move into a job that gives you more disposable income you can increase this amount the earlier you start the lower the monthly amount you 'll need to contribute towards a comfortable retirement once you get started putting a little bit away you 'll never miss it

in regards to the legal recourse no there is none   also despite your with citi it may not be their fault   mortgage companies are now forced to select appraisers essentially at random through 3rd party appraisal resource companies   this mandate from the government was issued in order to combat fraud but it is really causing more trouble for homeowners because it took away appraiser accountability   basically there 's nothing we can do to fire an appraiser anymore   i 've had appraiser do terrible jobs just blatantly wrong and have gone the distance with the dispute process only to find they wo n't change the value   my favorite real life example came from an appraiser who got the bedroom count wrong 4 instead of 5 yet he took pictures of 5 bedrooms   the one he excluded he stated it should n't count because it did n't have a closet   problem is it did have a closet   i had the homeowner take pictures of all of the in his house and send them in   he still refused to change the count   after close to 2 months of the dispute process the arc came in and changed the count but did not the value stating that the room count did n't increase the sqft and there would be no adjustment in value   i was   the only solution we had was to wait for the appraisal to expire then order it again which we did   the new appraiser got the count right and surprisingly not really it came in at the right value in regards to the value necessary to avoid mi they are likely using 80 but it 's not based on your current balance vs the value it 's based on the new loan amount which will include costs skipped mortgage payments etc vs the value here are your options get a new appraisal   if you are confident the value is wrong go somewhere else and get a new appraisal restructure the loan   any competent loan officer would have noticed that you are very close to 80 and should have offer you the option of splitting the mortgage into a 1st and 2nd loan   keeping the first loan at 80 and taking out a 2nd for the difference would avoid mi best regards newton

but in the debt payoff first scenario i 'd be wiping out my debt in    two years it would take several more years if i were to just pay the    minimums and put the extra money toward investing instead right the idea is that in 2 years you are likely to have more in the savings stock account than you owe on the loan but the range of returns for x years has a smaller standard deviation the greater x is e.g. any year has about a 1 in 3 chance of being negative a 10 year period had a negative return -1 cagr in the recently but the 15 year return even around that decade would have been successful jan 1 96 dec 31 2010 returned cagr jan 1 2001 dec 31 2015 returned cagr   this tells you that the time frame is as important as your sleep factor your 2 years i 'd just kill the loans a 10 15 year horizon i 'd ask how you feel about that debt the cost of going after a potential higher return may not be worth the risk to many for some it 's fine i retired with a mortgage still in place but the money in my 401(k that could have paid off the mortgage is now about twice the remaining balance so i sleep like a baby   in the end i 'm a fan of investing for the long term vs paying off low rate debt but it 's a choice based on the individual

since handled arbitrage i 'll take goodwill   goodwill is an accounting term that acts much like a plug account you add subtract to it the amount that makes everything balance   in the case of goodwill it generally only applies to mergers amp acquisitions   the theory and justification is this firms buy other firms at prices other than the market price usually higher and it is assumed that this is because the acquirer values its acquisition more than other people do   but whether you use historical prices or market prices when you add subtract assets and liabilities to to from your balance sheet this will never add up because you paid more less than the assets are worth in the market so more less cash flowed out than assets flowed in   the difference goes into the goodwill account so firms with a large goodwill account are ones that have made lots of acquisitions

if you are just barely scraping by on your current income then you should n't be thinking about buying a car or house unless you can present at least to yourself clear evidence that doing so will actually lower your monthly expenses yes there are times when even buying depreciating assets such as a car can lower your expenses but you need to think hard about whether that is the case or if it is just something you want to get because you feel you should remember the old adage that rich people buy themselves income streams investments that either earn money or reduce expenses while poor people buy expenses if you are in the situation of barely scraping by on your current income then the first step in my mind is to find out exactly what you are spending your money on do this for a month or two and then try to include non regular or rarely bills such as subscriptions insurance perhaps utilities and so on once you know where your money is going right now outline that in a budget at this point you are n't judging your spending but rather simply looking at the facts once you have a decent idea of where your money is going only then try to think about what you can cut back on some things will be easier than others to change it 's much easier to cancel a premium tv channels package than to move to cheaper living quarters for example although in some cases simply picking the low hanging fruit alone wo n't help you make a revised budget for the next month based on the new numbers and try to live by it keep writing down what you actually spend your money on then rinse and repeat of course you can make a budget for whatever period of time works for you if you get paid every two weeks budgeting per two weeks might be easier than budgeting per month the bottom line is that a budget is useless without a follow up process to see how well your spending actually matches the budgeted amounts so you need to spend some time following up on it and making adjustments no budget will ever match reality exactly think of the budget as a map not a by guide for getting from a to b. when you find some wiggle room in your budget for example let 's say you decide to cancel the premium tv channels package you got some time ago because it turns out you are n't watching much tv anyway do n't put that money into a discretionary spending category there is an old rule in personal finance that says pay yourself first if you are able to find $ of wiggle room put it into savings of some kind if you are unsure what kind of savings vehicle you should use i 'd suggest starting off with a simple savings account it certainly wo n't earn you a great return you 'll be lucky if you can keep up with inflation but it will get you into the habit of saving which at this point is a lot more important and make that savings transfer as soon as the money hits your account if you can get the depositor to put a portion of your income directly into the savings account if you can not make the transfer yourself immediately afterwards and try to force yourself to live with the money that 's left not touching the savings account ideally you should save a decent fraction of your income i 've seen figures everywhere from 10 to 25 of your after tax income recommended by various people and start out by budgeting that to savings and then working with whatever is left in practice saving anything and putting the money anywhere is much better than saving nothing just make sure that the savings are liquid easy to convert to cash and withdraw without a penalty should the need arise set up a regular bank transfer for whatever amount you can find in that budget and try to forget about it until you get the bank statement for the savings account and get that warm fuzzy feeling for actually having a decent amount of money set aside should something ever happen making you need it then later you can decide whether to use the money to buy a car start a company take early retirement or something entirely different having the money will give you the options and you can decide what is more important to you yourself just keep on saving

i 'm not sure there 's a good reason to do a closing the books ceremony for personal finance accounting and you 're not only wanting to do that but have a fiscal year that 's different from the calendar year yikes my understanding is that usually this process is done for businesses to be able to account for what their retained earnings and such are for investors and tax purposes generally individuals would n't think of their finances in those terms it 's certainly not impossible though gnucash for example implements a closing books feature which is designed to create transactions for each income and expenses account into an end of year equity retained earnings account it does n't do any sort of closing out of assets or liabilities however and i 'm not sure how that would make any sense as you 'd transfer it from your asset to the end of year closing account and then transfer it back as an opening balance for the next year if you want to keep each year completely separate the page about closing books in the gnucash wiki mentions that one can create a separate gnucash file per year by exporting the account tree from your existing file then importing that tree and the balances into a new file i expect that it makes it much more challenging to run reports across multiple years of data though while your question does n't seem to be specific to gnucash i just mention it because it 's the accounting tool i 'm most familiar with i 'd expect that any accounting program would have similar functionality i would however like to point out this section from the gnucash manual note that closing the books in gnucash is unnecessary you do not need to zero out your income and expense accounts at the end of each financial period gnucash ’s built in reports automatically handle concepts like retained earnings between two different financial periods in fact closing the books reduces the usefulness of the standard reports because the reports do n’t currently understand closing transactions so from their point of view it simply looks like the net income or expense in each account for a given period was simply zero and that 's largely why i 'm just not sure what your goals are if you want to look at your transactions for a certain time to just focus on the range of years i 'm interested in for any given purpose as you say then just go ahead and run the report you care about with those years as the dates the idea of closing books comes from a time when you 'd want to take your pile of paper ledgers and go put them in storage once you did n't need to refer to them regularly computers now have no challenges storing every account from the beginning of time at all and you can filter out that data to focus on whatever you 're looking for easily if you do n't want to look at the old data just do n't include them in your reports i 'm pretty sure that 's the better way to keep the books manageable

i do n't think 's explanation is correct   a trailing lit sell order adjusts downwards i.e. if you place the order with an price in it 's trigger price of and a trailing amount of 6.00 then assuming the ask is 100.00 will add the trailing amount to the ask price and if it 's less than the trigger price it will adjust so in my example if the market ask goes straight up to nothing will be adjusted the trigger is touched and the limit order will be placed see below if on the the other hand the market goes down to then amt + ask is if it goes further down to then the trigger price will be adjusted to because it 's less than the current trigger and so on for the lit part you have either an absolute limit price you can enter or you have an offset limit which will be subtracted from the trigger price in which case it is adjusted as well so back to my example the trigger is now and the limit offset is say 1.00 so my limit order would be placed at if the ask ever touches and that in turn is only visible if the bid touches because it 's limit if touched for a buy just use the same explanation with some swapped roles the trigger price adjust upwards when the trailing amount plus bid is larger than the current trigger and the limit offset will be added to the trigger price edit also quite succinct and worth having a look at guesswork highly subjective as for why this might be good well you have to believe in momentum strategies i.e. a market that goes down will continue to go down if you believe that and you believe in mean reversion as well then a trailing limit order can assist you in not buying selling but closer to the mean   i 've never used it that way though what i have done even just now to get the explanation right is to place trailing buy and sell orders simultaneously   you will find that you can just go in with estimates and because the adjustments will go towards each other you will end up with a narrowing band of trigger prices as opposed to trailing stop orders which will give you a widening band of trigger prices   if you believe in and then this can be one easy way to profit from it   i 've just sold eurusd for and bought it back at with a trailing amount of and a limit offset of within the time of writing this

no rep from amazon has ever my ego so i do n’t know what you mean    and as far as reps go people who help you with products beyond paint and decor rarely understand what they are selling hence the 1 guy they all depend on vs the staff at a home store in japan who all work in areas they know    so what are you buying tractors or some shit full of a c    if you are buying enough to save hundreds of dollars at a time i assume you are a contractor and you a should already know your shit so reps are just there to prepare paperwork and b missing the point of what i am saying    if i call a parts supply warehouse and ask them for a core i ’m not going to ask them what model it goes in or how to install it the rep ’s competence could easily be replaced by amazon    if i have a broken mac i want to go to a store where they know how to fix it and give me advice and in that manner home depot often falls flat    so they will eventually get their hat handed to them because eventually amazon will beat them in distribution and they wo n’t have the volume to warrant a chain of stores to draw foot traffic

a link to this article grabbed my interest as i was browsing the site for something totally unrelated to finance   your question is not silly i 'm not a financial expert but i 've been in your situation several times with carmax auto finance caf in particular a lot of people probably thought you do n't understand how financing works but your car loan set up is exactly how caf financing works which i 've used several times just some background info to anyone else reading this unlike most other simple interest car financing with caf they calculate per diem based on your principal balance and recalculate it every time you make a payment regardless of when your actual due date was   but here 's what makes caf financing particularly fair when you do make a payment your per diem since your last payment accrued x dollars and that 's your interest portion that is subtracted first from your payment and obviously per diem goes down faster the more you pay in a payment and then everything else including any extra payments you make goes to principal you do not have to specify that the extra payment(s are principal only if your payment amount per month is $ 500 and you give them 11 payments of $ 500 the first $ 500 will have a small portion go to interest accrued since the last payment depending on the per diem that was recalculated and then everything else goes to principal and still pushes your next due date i prefer to break up extra payments as precisely the amount due per month so that my intention is clear pay the extra as a payment for the next month and the one after that etc and keep pushing my next due date that last point of pushing your next due date is the key   not all car financing companies do that a lot of them will let you pay to principal yes but you 're still due next month with caf you can have your cake and eat it too i worked for them in college i know their financing system in and out and i 've always financed with them for that very reason   so back to the question should you keep the loan alive albeit for a small amount my unprofessional answer is yes car loans are very powerful in your credit report because they are installment accounts same as mortgages and other accounts that you pay down to 0 and the loan is closed credit cards are revolving accounts and do n't offer as much bang for your money unless you are savvy in manipulating your card balances take it up one month take it down to 0 the next month etc i play those games a lot but i always find mortgage and auto loans make the best impact   i do exactly what you do myself i pay off the car down to about $ 500 i actually make several small payments each equal to the agreed upon monthly payment because their system automatically treats that as a payment for the next month due and the one after that etc on top of paying it all to principal as i mentioned   do not leave a dollar as another reader mentioned they have a good will threshold i ca n't remember how much probably $ 50 for which they will consider the account paid off and close it out so if your concern is throwing away free money but you still want the account alive your sweet spot where you can be sure the loan is not closed is probably around $ 100   but something else important to consider if you decide to go with that strategy of keeping the account alive which i recommend in my case caf will adjust down your next payment due if it 's less than the principal left so let 's say your regular payment is $ 400 and you only leave a $ 100 your next payment due is $ 100 and it will go up a few cents each month because of the small per diem and that is exactly what caf will report to the credit bureaus as your monthly obligation which sucks because now your awesome car payment history looks like you 've only been paying $ 100 every month so leave something close to one month 's payment yes the interest accrued will be higher but i 'm not a penny when the reward is worth it if you left $ 400 for 1.5 years at 10 apr that equates to about $ 50 interest for that entire time well worth it in my books sorry for rambling a lot i suck myself into these debates all the time

but what about the following scenario which is my paraphrasing of a nanex article i 'm hoping you can help clarify this for me   1 i observe a 1,000 lot advertised for sell on a lit exchange   2 i try to lift the 1,000 by placing a limit order   3 my order goes through some kind of order routing process first 3 orders get executed on a dark pool let 's say i got a 50 lot filled so available offer reduces to 950   4 my order hits a lit exchange i get a partial fill for 100 offer shrinks to 850 but the offered size shrinks instead to 500 or 0   5 now in order to execute my trade i will have to take a higher price than the original advertised liquidity   my question maybe you can answer this is why did my original order size of 1,000 appear in smaller blocks is this because the order routing algorithm breaks up the size   or is it that market makers only post offers in small block sizes e.g. 100 so even if the order book looked like   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   all the way to 1,000 total as soon as the first 100 shares were lifted the mm can immediately cancel the remainder of the advertised liquidity in practical terms making it impossible to execute large orders at an advertised price

you want more information on what the general bond market this article is getting at something different but the first several pages are general background info on the corporate bond market     if you are trying to relate somehow the issue of federal debt a la treasuries to corporate debt you will find that you are jumping to a lot of conclusions    debt is not exactly currency only the promise of repayment at a certain date in the future the only reason that u.s. treasuries and those of certain other highly rated countries is interchangeable is because they are both very liquid and have very low risk    there is very little similarity to this in the corporate bond market companies are no where near to the risk level of a government for one they ca n't print their own money and when a corporation goes bankrupt it 's bondholder are usually recovery rates hover at around 50 of the notional debt amount this is why investors demand a premium to hold corporate debt now consider even the best of companies take ibm the spread between the interest the government must pay on a treasury bond and that which ibm must pay on a similar bond is still relatively large    but beyond that you run into a liquidity issue currency only works because it is highly liquid if you take the article about greece you posted above you can see the problem generated by lack of liquidity people have to both have currency and be willing to accept currency for trade to occur corporate bond are notoriously illiquid because people are unwilling to take on the risk involved with holding the debt there are other reasons but i 'm from them this is the other reason treasuries can be used as currency there is always someone willing to take your treasury in trade for the most part because there is almost zero risk involved you would always be much more willing to hold a treasury than an equivalent ibm bond    now take that idea down to a smaller level who would want to buy the bonds issued by the mom and pop down the street even if someone did buy them who would in turn take these bonds in trade practically speaking no one would they have no way to identify the riskiness of the bond and have no assurance that there would be anyone willing to trade for it in the future    if you read the whole post by the redditor from your first link this is precisely why government backed currency came about and why the scenario that i think you are is very unlikely

right now we 're producing enough food feed everyone on the planet per day around twice of what they need in the us we 're throwing away around 40 of the food we produce and we 're not using all available land have n't even tried optimizing land use and not all land used for animal farming is usable for growing crops   and meat is n't a problem for emissions i posted this in another r documentaries     global emissions from animal agriculture including deforestation is just 14.5 news story en and in the us where you do n't have deforestation issues all agriculture including crops grown for human consumption is just 8.1 of emissions   gt in 2012 emission sources accounted for in the agricultural chapters were responsible for 8.1 percent of total u.s. greenhouse gas emissions   environmental protection agency sources of greenhouse gas emissions climatechange downloads us   the 2015 draft also shows that this is declining as a percentage to 7.6 chapter climatechange pdfs us   meanwhile we have 31 from electricity and another 27 from transportation   sector emission   epa sources of greenhouse gas climatechange   switching to clean energy solar wind nuclear and moving to alternative fuels would make a huge impact and address the actual problem far more efficiently blaming animal agriculture is just a red wiki pushed by groups with other motivations than climate change it 's not based on actual science

see publication 505 specifically the section on annualized income installment method which says if you do not receive your income evenly throughout the year for example your income from a repair shop you operate is much larger in the summer than it is during the rest of the year your required estimated tax payment for one or more periods may be less than the amount figured using the regular installment method the publication includes a worksheet and explanation of how to calculate the estimated tax due for each period when you have unequal income   if you had no freelance income during a period you should n't owe any estimated tax for that period however the process for calculating the estimated tax using this method is a good bit more complex and confusing than using the short method in which you just estimate how much tax you will owe for the year and divide it into four equal pieces   therefore in future years you might want to still use the equal payments method if you can swing it   it 's too late for this year since you missed the april deadline for the first payment   if you can estimate the total amount of freelance income you 'll receive even though you might not be able to estimate when you 'll receive it you can probably still use the simpler method   if you really have no idea how much money you 'll make over the year you could either use the more complex computation or you could use a very high estimate to ensure you pay enough tax and you 'll get a refund if you pay too much

trying to figure out how much money you have available each day sounds like you 're making this more complicated than it needs to be unless you 're extremely tight and you 're trying to squeeze by day by day asking do i have enough cash to buy food for today and so on you 're doing too much work here 's what i do i make a list of all my bills some are a fixed amount every month like the mortgage and insurance premiums others are variable like electric and heating bills but still pretty predictable   most bills are monthly but i have a few that come less frequently like water bills in my area come every 3 months and i have to pay property taxes twice a year for these you have to calculate how much they cost each month like for the water bill it 's once every 3 months so i divide a typical bill by 3 always round up or estimate a little high to be safe groceries are a little tricky because i do n't buy groceries on any regular schedule and sometimes i buy a whole bunch at once and other times just a few things when groceries were a bigger share of my income i kept track of what i spent for a couple of months to figure out an average per month today i 'm a little richer and i just think of groceries as coming from my spending money i allocate a percentage of my income for contributions to church and charities and count this just like bills it 's a good idea to put aside something for savings and/or paying down any outstanding loans every month then i add these up to say okay here 's how much i need each month to pay the bills subtract that from my monthly income and that 's what i have for spending money i get paid twice a month so i generally pay bills when i get paid for most bills the due date is far enough ahead that i can wait the maximum half a month to pay it worst case the bill comes the day after i pay the bills from this paycheck   then i keep enough money in my checking account to a cover any bills until the next paycheck and allow for the particularly large bills and b provide some cushion in case i make a mistake forget to record a check or make an arithmetic error or whatever and c provide some cushion for short term unexpected expenses to be safe a should be the total of your bills for a month or as close to that as you can manage b should be a couple of hundred dollars if you can manage it more if you make a lot of mistakes if you 've calculated your expenses properly and only spend the difference keeping enough money in the bank should fall out naturally i think it 's a lot easier to try to manage your money on a monthly basis than on a daily basis most of us do n't spend money every day and we spend wildly different amounts from day to day most days i probably spend zero but then one day i 'll buy a new tv or computer and spend hundreds   update in response to question what i do in real life is this to calculate my available cash to spend i simply take the balance in my checking account assuming that all checks and electronic payments have cleared my mortgage is deducted from my checking every month so i post that to my checking a month in advance i pay a lot of things with automatic charges to a credit card these days so my credit card bills are large and ca n't be ignored so subtract my credit card balances subtract my reserve amount what 's left is how much i can afford to spend so for example say i look at the balance in my checkbook today and it 's say $ 3000 that 's the balance after any checks and other transactions have cleared and after subtracting my next mortgage payment then i subtract what i owe on credit cards let 's say that was $ 1,200 so that leaves $ 1,800 i try to keep a reserve of $ 1,500 that 's plenty to pay my routine monthly bills and leave a healthy reserve so subtract another $ 1,500 leaves $ 300 that 's how much i can spend i could keep track of this with a spreadsheet or a database but what would that gain the amount in my checking account is actual money any spreadsheet could accumulate errors and get farther and farther from accurate values i use a spreadsheet to figure out how much spending money i should have each month but that 's just to use as a guideline if it came to say $ 100 i would n't make plans about buying a new mercedes if it came to $ 5,000 a month than buying a fancy new car might be realistic it also tells me how much i can spend without having to carefully check balances and add it up these days i have a fair amount of spending money so when for example i recently decided i wanted to buy some software that cost $ 100 i just bought it with barely a second thought when my spending money was more like $ 100 a month lunch at a fast food place was a big event that i planned weeks in advance obviously i hope do n't get stupid about small amounts if you can easily afford $ 100 for an impulse purchase that does n't mean that you can afford $ 100 five times a day every day two caveats 1 it helps to have a limited number of credit cards so you can keep the balances under control i have two credit cards i use for almost everything so i only have two balances to keep track of i used to have more and it got confusing it was easy to lose track of how much i really owed which is a set up for getting in trouble

it means that at the end of each month the apy divided by 365 for leap years is multiplied by your account 's ending balance on each day of that month then those interest amounts are summed up and paid out it 's exactly equivalent to the average daily balance method at the end of each month the balance of your account on each day is summed divided by the number of days in the month then that number is multiplied by the apy 365 number of days in the month if you write out all these terms and simplify you 'll find the two boil down to exactly the same calculation being performed in different order possibly with differing potential for rounding error the only difference between them is whether the daily interest percentage is distributed to each daily balance or applied to the sum and whether there 's an additional redundant pair of steps of dividing and then multiplying by the number of days in the month

you do n't state a long term goal for your finances in your message but i 'm going to assume you want to retire early and retire well any other ideas i 'm missing out on a fairly common way to reach financial independence is to build one or more passive income streams   the money returned by stock investing capital gains and dividends is just one such type of stream   some others include owning rental properties being a passive owner of a business and producing goods that earn long term royalties instead of just an immediate exchange of time effort for cash     of these rental property is probably one of the most well known and easiest to learn about so i 'd suggest you start with that as a second type of investment if you feel you need to diversify from stock ownership   especially given your association with the military it is likely there is a nearby supply of private housing that is n't too expensive so easier to get started with and has a high rental demand so less risk in many ways    also with our continued current low rate environment now is the time to lock in long term mortgage rates   doing so will reap huge benefits as rates and rents will presumably rise from here though that is n't guaranteed regarding the idea of being a passive business owner keep in mind that this does n't necessarily mean starting a business yourself   instead you might look to become a partner by investing money with an existing or startup business or even buying an existing business or franchise   sometimes perfectly good business can be transferred for surprisingly little down with the right deal structure if you 're creative in any way producing goods to earn long term royalties might be a useful path to go down   writing books articles etc is just one example of this   there are other opportunities depending on your interests and skill but remember the focus ought to be on passive royalties rather than trading time and effort for immediate money   you only have so many hours in a year   would you rather spend 100 hours to earn $ 100 every year for 20 years or have to spend 100 hours per year for 20 years to earn that same $ 100 every year all that being said while you 're way ahead of the game for the average person of your age $ 30k cash $ 20k stocks unknown tsp balance low expenses i 'm not sure i 'd recommend trying to diversify quite yet for one thing i think you need to keep some amount of your $ 30k as cash to cover emergency situations   typically people would say 6 months living expenses for covering employment gaps but as you are in the military i do n't think it 's as likely you 'll lose your job   so instead i 'd approach it as how much of this cash do i need over the next 5 years   that is sum up $ x for the car $ y for fun travel $ z for emergencies etc   keep that amount as cash for now beyond that i 'd put the balance in your brokerage and get it working hard for you now   i do n't think an average of a 3 div yield is too hard to achieve even when picking a safe conservative portfolio   though you do run the risk of capital losses if invested   once your total portfolio tsp + brokerage is $ 100k or more then consider pulling the trigger on a second passive income stream by splitting off some of your brokerage balance   until then keep learning what you can about stock investing and also start the learning process on additional streams   always keep an eye out for any ways to kick additional streams off early if you can find a low cost entry    the $ 100k number is admittedly a rough guess pulled from the air   i just think splitting your efforts and money prior to this will limit your opportunities to get a good start on any additional streams   yes you could do it earlier but probably only with increased risk lower capital means less opportunities to pick from lower knowledge levels both stock investing and property rental also increase risk of making bad choices

as a person who has had several part time assistants in the past i will offer you a simple piece of advise that should apply regardless of what country the assistant is located if you have an assistant personal or business virtual or otherwise and you do n't trust that person with this type of information get a different assistant   an assistant is someone who is supposed to make your life easier by off loading work modifying your records before sending them every month sounds like you are creating more work for yourself not less either take the leap of faith to trust your assistant or go somewhere else   an assistant that you feel you have to edit crucial information from is less than useful that being said there is no fundamental reason to believe that an operation in the philippines or anywhere else is any more or less trustworthy than an operation in your native country however what is at issue is the legal framework around your relationship and in particular your recourse if something goes wrong   if you and your virtual assistant are both located in the us you would have an easier time collecting damages should something go wrong   i suggest you evaluate your level of comfort for risk vs. cost   if you feel that the risk is too high to use an overseas service versus the savings then find someone in the states to do this work   depending on your needs and comfort you might want to seek out a cpa or other licensed bonded professional   yes the cost might be higher however you might find that it is worth it for your own piece of mind as a side note you might even consider finding a local part time assistant this can often be more useful than a virtual assistant and may not cost as much as you think if you can live without someone being bonded   or are willing to pay for the bonding fee yourself   depending on your market and needs you may be able to find an existing highly qualified ea or other person that wants some after hours work    if you are in a college town finance accounting or legal majors make great assistants   they will usually work a couple hours a week for beer money they have flexible schedules and are glad to have something pertinent to their degree to put on their resume when they graduate   just be prepared to replace them every few years as they move on to real jobs

why do savings accounts for businesses offer less yield than bank accounts for individuals   the money held in savings account on a collective average substantial amount stays with the bank the bank is better able to predict and thus invest this money in individual savings account in market to make more money money held in business accounts are unpredictable and can get withdrawn the bank is thus not able to predict the behaviour and hence not able to invest this better to get good returns hence the interest offered is low most banks have special products for businesses that would give better return but come with some kind of lock in or minimum balances

i would definitely pay down the debt first   if it is going to take 15 years to do so you probably need to allocate more money to paying down debt cut expenses by going out to eat less and keeping spending to the bare necessities   you might even consider getting a second job just for paying down the debt   if that is n't enough consider selling off some assets   you should be able to come up with a plan to be debt free excluding maybe a regular mortgage within 3 5 years once the only debt you have is a home mortgage then its time to look at putting money towards retirement again note you should not take money out of a 401k or ira to pay off debt   the costs for doing so are nearly always too great

gt;in this case aldi is making its own low quality branded goods instead of allowing for capitalist competitive brand selection and excluding from its stores all other branded goods made by other companies   which is part of why their prices are lower     is not a membership club and sells almost exclusively low quality in house brands   the only think aldi does n't do is the membership thing everything else is borrowed from costco   the no shelves in the store boxes stacked on top of each other limited staff company owned label etc   also if their quality was low then why do so many people like them   i never been in one before but they wo n't be expanding as rapidly as they are if they wo n't doing so well

several options are available she may ask the us bank to issue a debit card visa most probably to her account and mail this card to russia i think this can be done without much problems though sending anything by mail may be unreliable after this she just withdraws the money from local atm some withdrawal fee may apply which may be rather big if the sum of money is big in big banks bank citibank russia etc are atms that allow you to withdraw dollars and it is better to use one of them to avoid unfavorable exchange rate she may ask the us bank to transfer the money to her russian account i assume the currency on the us bank account is us dollars she needs an us dollar account in any russian bank this is no problem at all   she should find out from that bank the transfer parameters for transfering us dollars to her account this should include among other info a bank correspondent and a swift code or may be two swift codes after this she should contact her us bank and find out how can she request the money to be transferred to her russian bank providing these transfer parameters i can think of two problems that may be here first the bank may refuse to transfer money without her herself coming to the bank to confirm her identity how do they know that a person writing or calling them is she indeed however i guess there should be some workaround for this second with current us sanctions against russia the bank may just refuse the transfer or will have do some additional investigations however i have heard that bank transfers from us to private persons to russia are not blocked probably it is good to find this out in advance in addition the us bank will most probably charge some standard fee for foreign transfer after this she should wait for a couple of days maybe up to week for the money to appear on russian account i have done this once some four years ago and had no problems though at that time i was in the us so i just came to the bank myself the bank employee to whom i talked obviously was unsure whether the transfer parameters were enough obviously this was a very unusual situation for her but she took the information from me and i guess just passed it on to someone more knowledgable the fee was something about $ 40 another option that i might think of is her us bank issuing and mailing her a check for the whole sum and she trying to cash it here in russia this is possible but very few banks do cash checks here citibank russia is among those that do the bank will also charge a fee and it will be comparable to transfer fee plus mailing anything is not quite reliable here she would also have to consider whether she need to pay russian taxes on this sum if the sum is big and passes through a bank i guess russian tax police may find this out through and question her if it is withdrawn from a visa card i think it will not be noticed but even in this case she might be required to file a tax herself

generally these things are unrelated your tax debt is to agency x your license is mostly from agency y. if your business involves agency x then it may be a problem for example you can not get a ea license irs enrolled agent if you have unsettled tax debt or other tax compliance issues you should check michigan state licensing organizations if there are similar   also some background checks may fail and some state licenses require them to pass for example you can probably not get an active bar registration or a cpa license with an unsettled tax debt you might have a problem with registering as a notary public or other similar position you can probably not work in law enforcement as a contractor if you 're on an approved payment plan then your tax debt is settled unless you stop paying as agreed and should n't be a problem

wow where to start   your ad hominem attack was when you shifted away from the discussion and started questioning me on whether or not i had been around low skilled workers and even going as far as to give a judgment on if was around average people the definition is of an argument or reaction directed against a person rather than the position they are maintaining you went away from the topic and instead directed your argument at me which has nothing to do with my position on minimum wage you seek to discredit me as to say my views are invalid because in your opinion i have n't had enough experience with low skill workers it does n't matter if i have or had n't one 's experience or lack thereof with low skilled workers does n't make their position any more wrong or right this is a textbook example of ad hominem   your straw man was when you shifted the position to suggest things i did n't say in order to argue against them the definition is an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent 's real argument you say i assumed things i never even mentioned such as your claim that i would say rich people did n't earn their success and that poor people were not at fault for their low achievement once again no where did i suggest this and this suggestion by you away from my argument on paying people a live able wage basically one could say this was brought up by you to argue about something you felt would be easier to defeat   there were clear reasons i threw those fallacies out you tell me i do n't know what i 'm talking about yet you do n't even get it right and overlook everything that was stated smh   your whole response keeps proving my point once again you are so focused on whether i 've had experience working with or managing people nice goal post moving btw as if that makes your position more qualified ad hominem again when the reality is i can have a rational thought about something by reading up on logical and rational positions on this and seeing what the statistics and research say oh by the way i have had multiple economics classes in college did you i read up and studied this stuff and my tests and papers on it so now what does my collegiate backed economics understanding now outweigh the fact you just simply hired some low skilled workers   there are many topics out there you and i have no experience with but we can have a well thought out position on them because we talk to experts and read up on the research let me restate this again just because you have more experience with low skill labor does not make you any more qualified over me to have a smart logical and rational understanding of the effects of raising the minimum wage the same with the fact that just because i probably have had more collegiate studies on economics than you it does n't mean my position is any more right than yours or someone else 's   gt;you read a study that is incredibly biased and take it to the grave   this gave me a laugh because it 's the equivalent of your arguments do n't agree with mine so clearly your 's is the biased one dude we all are biased and stand for things you are just as biased as me i do n't have to give equal time to every position out there as if both are equal it 's often a false equivalence to do so anyways for example the idea that we should not raise minimum wage more because poor people are lazy and undeserving does not deserve the same consideration as inflation has caused the purchasing power of workers on the minimum wage to decrease to levels where they can not afford to live and thus now must seek out tax payer backed public assistance programs in order to make ends meet so a solution would be to raise the minimum wage   last your argument against raising the minimum wage comes down to i do n't think they deserve it because some people do n't work hard and my response is i do n't give a shit if someone works that job no matter how low skilled it is they deserve to be paid at a level that is live able other than that it 's their fault if they do n't do a good job and get fired   have you ever considered why the minimum wage came about in the first place it was to keep businesses in check because they were taking advantage of people and paying them poor wages wages were so low that some would argue they were technically slave wages yet as inflation rises and the purchasing power falls instead of bumping those wages back up people like you sit there and are like nah they are lazy and do n't deserve it trust me i know a guy that 's lazy that works those jobs he 's dumb too and does n't have a high school diploma you argument one again is just attacking their character with no consideration of statistical analysis and the economic effect of a change in the minimum wage    now to step away from the whole argument you and i have different values you do n't value people at low skilled levels as if their job is almost worthless yet you need them for your business sure you smile and say hello to the guy that brings you your burger or your coffee but the reality is you mostly do n't care about him in your mind if he only makes $ 7.25 then you have the right to assume that he does n't work hard and is undeserving of proper pay unless he 's proven it in some way to you your mindset is a problem because you are okay with people and then you assume whatever negative traits about them that you can as your justification for it   i do n't give a shit about how many houses have been built in houston or how many painters your friend brought to seattle it 's completely irrelevant to all of this

it 's not so much a credit card but a financial institution 's online platform that either provides this functionality or not the following canadian financial institutions show an itemized list of pre authorized transactions not an exhaustive list   the following institutions show a total value of pre authorized transactions most other institutions show the available credit e.g. chase financial used by amazon rewards which give an indication of how much you have to spend by subtracting the current balance and the available balance from the total credit limit you can get an indication of the total amount of pre authorized transactions example $ 1000 $ 500 $ 400 = $ 100 is the amount of pre authorized transactions from td 's demo it appears that they do n't include pre authorized transactions in the available credit you can verify for yourself by logging in to online banking after you make a purchase and comparing the available credit to credit limit current balance if it is equal then they do n't include if it is different most likely for the value of the transaction then they do

there are only two things you can directly do with the money in an amazon gift card you can keep the gift card or you can put the money into your amazon account   there are n't any other options   you ca n't deposit the value into a bank account or anything like that   so as far as safety those are the only options you need to consider because there 's nothing else you can do okay there is one other thing you can do you could sell the card to someone else or barter it for something you want   but you can do that with anything the gift card is just a string of numbers and letters that you put into your amazon account and it credits you with the appropriate amount of money   so yes it can be stolen   if you have n't redeemed it yet someone could find the code by hacking your email or looking over your shoulder or whatever   if they redeem it you wo n't be able to do so as for your edit if i do n't transfer the balance of the amazon card to my amazon account can i transfer the balance to other accounts or use the card to buy other gift cards if you do n't transfer it to your account you can transfer the balance to another account by giving the code to someone else and letting them deposit it in their account   you still wo n't be able to buy other gift cards with it because you ca n't buy anything with it until it 's deposited in an amazon account and once it 's deposited in an amazon account you ca n't buy gift cards with it because of their policy if you do n't want the restrictions imposed by amazon do n't buy amazon gift cards instead just use your actual money to buy things   if you 're worried about the cards being stolen just deposit them into your account right away and you eliminate the risk of them being stolen   if as you say you bought the cards for yourself there 's no reason not to do this presumably you bought them so you could buy things on amazon and you 'll have to deposit them into your account eventually anyway to do that so just put them in right away i do n't know specifically how walmart cards work but i assume they 're the same   in general anything called a gift card offered by a particular retailer works the same way you ca n't do anything with it except buy products at that retailer the only thing that really makes amazon different is that the only way to use your card is to add the money to your amazon account because the only way to pay for things on amazon is with an amazon account   there 's no way to spend just some of the value you have to deposit it all into your account   with gift cards for retailers with physical locations you can usually use the value up piecemeal by actually going to a store and spending just enough to buy something   i assume walmart works this way although i do n't know if you can use an e gift card this way there

i would use neither method   taking a short example first with just three compounding periods with interest rate 10   the start value is 1 so after three years the value is the same as 1 + depreciating like inflation by 10 to demonstrate gets us back to = 1 appreciating and depreciating by 10 cancels out appreciating by 10 interest and depreciating by 3 inflation this is the same as 1 + 1 + = so for 50 years the result is 1 + 1 + = note you can of course use subtraction but the not using the inflation figure directly   e.g. edit this appears to be the fisher equation 2nd note further to comments here is a chart to illustrate how much the relative performance improves when inflation is accounted for   the first fund 's return is 6 and the second fund 's return varies from 3 to 6   inflation is 3

because it ignores several important facts namely   a the base value from infrastructure is derived on a per capita basis it is a fixed cost as opposed to a variable one in other words roads are just as useful to me as they are to you regardless of my net worth a tank a missile a police officer protects me the same as it does anyone else   b as a percentage of income infrastructure is far more valuable to low income individuals than high income individuals a simple example if i have $ 5 m in net worth i can invest it in the stock market and stay home if you do n't have that option you need to go to work and that will likely require roads i wo n't be taking unemployment benefits but you are far more likely to and so on   c the activities of business owners generate massive tax revenues these far outweigh their personal utility from infrastructure   d society captures the majority of individual commercial efforts estimates vary but typically 85 in other words if i generate $ 10.00 of value as an entrepreneur i will realistically be able to capture only $ 1.50 of that   the infrastructure argument has been used to fool low and middle income voters the truth is that infrastructure benefits these voters and the government far more than it does wealthy individuals

ah gotcha   that would be moving the country towards a more socialistic or system where the government controls more of the means of production   i think there would be a problem successful companies need to be disruptive and the larger you are the harder it is to try a different approach i think if the government did try to offer a competing product the would weigh down the offering   the only way the government could be assured a profitable business is to compete unfairly   consider one of the big government companies the post office   ups has always been seen as the higher quality delivery overnight shipping was considered impossible until fedex did it even today the usps is in serious financial trouble even though it is granted a monopoly on letter delivery it is illegal for ups and fedex to deliver letters the post office is too inefficient to make money on package delivery so they subsidize that side of their business selling stamps   gt so we could abolish income tax and lower taxes over all   imo the taxes will be paid one way or another if you cut income tax then it will be replaced with a payroll tax or sales tax or property tax or tariff or passed to you in the form of higher prices the only question is the definition of a person or group 's fair share

when you buy a futures contract you are entering into an agreement to buy gold in the future usually a 3 month settlement date   this is not an option but a contract so each party is taking risk the seller that the price will rise the buyer that the price will fall   unlike an option which you can simply choose not to exercise if the price goes down with futures you are obligated to follow through or sell the contract to someone else or buy it back   the price you pay depends on the margin which is related to how far away the settlement date is but you can expect around 5 so the minimum you could get into is 100 troy ounces at todays price times 5   since we 're talking about 100 troy ounces that means the margin required to buy the smallest sized future contract would be about the same as buying 5 ounces of gold   roughly $ 9 k at current prices if you are working through a broker they will generally require you to sell or buy back the contract before the settlement date as they do n't want to deal with actually following through on the purchase and having to take delivery of the gold   how much do you make or lose lets deal with a smaller change in the price to be a bit more realistic since we are talking typically about a settlement date that is 3 months out and to make the math easy lets bump the price of gold to $   that means the price of a futures contract is going to be $ 10 k    lets say the price goes up 10   well you have basically a leverage since you only paid 5 so you stand to gain $ 20,000 sounds great right   wrong because as good as the upside is the downside is just as bad   if the price went down 10 you would be down $ 20000 which means you would not only have to cough up the 10 k you committed but you would be expected to top up the margin and throw in   another $ 10,000 as well   and if you ca n't pay that up your broker might close out your position for you oh and if the price has n't changed you are mostly just out the fees and commissions you paid to buy and sell the contract   with futures contracts you can lose more than your original investment   not for the faint of heart or the casual investor   not for folks without large reserves who can afford to take big losses if things go against them   i 'll close this answer with a quote from the site i 'm linking below the large majority of people who trade futures lose their money    that 's a fact they lose even when they are right in the medium term    because futures are fatal to your wealth on an and    temporary price blip now consider that especially the bit about price blip and then look at the current volatility of most markets right now and i think you can see how futures trading can be as they say fatal to your wealth man i love that phrase what a great way of putting it   this site has a pretty decent primer on the whole thing their view is perhaps a bit biased due to the nature of their business but on the whole their description of how things work is pretty decent   investopedia has a more detailed and perhaps more objective tutorial on the futures thing   well worth your time if you think you want to do anything related to the futures market

in the us title is the document that shows ownership of the car it is a nicely printed document you get from the dmv that includes the information about the car and about you you sign off the title when you sell the car part of the title is a form on which the owner of the title can assign it to someone else with your signature on the title the new owner goes to the dmv which exchanges it to a new title in the new owner 's name never sign on the title unless you got the payment for the car from the buyer usually when the car is bought with a loan the lender holds the title since you need to sign off the title to pass the ownership if you sell the car lender holding on to it will prevent you from selling the car until the lender gives you the title back when you pay off the loan your boss acting as a lender wants the title to hold on to it to prevent you from selling the car that secures your debt to him he wants that usually pink piece of paper here 's an article explaining about the title and showing a sample lenders holding the title will usually also add an endorsement at the dmv so that you ca n't go and claim that you lost it

open an investment account on your own and have them roll the old 401 k accounts into either a roth or traditional ira do not leave them in old 401k accounts and definitely do n't roll them into your new employer 's 401k. why well as great as 401 k accounts are there is one thing that employers rarely mention and the 401 k companies actively try to hide     most 401 k plans are loaded with huge fees you wo n't see them on your statements they are often hidden very cleverly with accounting tricks for example in several plans i have participated in the mutual fund symbols may look like the ones you see on the stock tickers but if you read the fine print they only approximate the underlying mutual fund they are named for that is if you multiply the number of shares by the market price you will arrive at a number higher than the one printed on your statement   the spread between those numbers is the fee charged by the 401 k management company and since employees do n't pick that company and ca n't easily fire them they are n't very competitive unless your company is really large and has a tough negotiator in hr if you work for a small company you are probably getting slammed by these fees also they often charge fees for the automatic rebalancing service they offer to do annually to your account to keep your allocation in line with your current contribution allocations   i have no idea why it is legal for them not to disclose these fees on the statements but they do n't i had to do some serious digging to find this out on my own and when i did it was downright scary in one case they were siphoning off over 3 annually from the account using this standard practice however that is not to say that you should n't participate in these plans especially if there is an employer match there are fees with any investment account and the free money your employer is kicking in almost always offsets these fees my point here is just that you should n't keep the money in the 401 k after you leave the company when you have an option to move it to an account with much cheaper fees

price is decided by what shares are offered at what prices and who first   the buyer and seller are both trying to find the best offer for their definition of best within the constraints then have set on their bid or ask the seller will sell to the highest bid they can get that they consider acceptable the buyer will buy from the lowest offer they can get that they consider acceptable the price and whether a sale purchase happens at all depends on what other trades are still available and how long you 're willing to wait for one you 're happy with and may be different on one share than another at the same time if the purchase could n't be completed with the single best offer and had to buy from multiple offers this may have been easier to understand in the days of open outcry pit trading when you could see just how chaotic the process is but it all boils down to a high speed version of seeking the best deal in an old fashioned marketplace where no prices are fixed and every sale requires or at least offers the opportunity for negotiation fred sells it five cents cheaper then why are n't you buying from him he 's out of stock well when i do n't have any my price is ten cents cheaper maybe i wo n't buy today or i 'll buy elsewhere maybe i wo n't sell today or maybe someone else will pay my price sam looks interested ok ok i can offer two cents more three sam looks really interested two and a half and throw in an apple for susie done and the next buyer or seller starts the whole process over again open outcry really is just a way of trying to shop around very very very fast and electronic reconciliation speeds it up even more but it 's conceptually the same process either seller gets what they 're asking or they adjust and/or the buyer adjusts until they meet or everyone agrees that there 's no agreement and goes home

the mode of payment mentioned by your bank is called the clearing house which means that payment gateway owners like banks themselves can process payments there can be a fraud declared against any payment that you have made and you can get every single penny back this amount can not be withdrawn in cash at all however for your situation i would suggest that you ask your bank to block any transactions above the amount of a specific sum this way they will require your authorization to finalize the payment you should feel safe after this also no one can access any other account apart from the one whose details you are giving out so do not worry about this anyone else for that matter to be able to access your other accounts   hope this helps i have experience in payment so i do understand these procedures cheers

having just gone through selling a car i can tell you that carmax will most likely not be the best solution i recently sold my 09 vibe which had a kbb and edmonds value private party sale of around $ 6k trade in value was around $ i took it to the local carmax for a quote and they came back with $ 3,500   refinancing is tricky banks have a set limit on how old a car they will finance many wo n't even offer financing if the vehicle has over 100k miles we looked at refinancing our other car and even getting the apr down over a point we would only have saved $ or so banks typically offer much higher interest rates for used non dealership cars and refinancing than they do for new cars or even used cars purchased from a dealership assuming you have 2 3 years left on your loan i do n't think that refinancing would save you enough to be worth considering carmax sells cars in 1 of 2 ways they are also up front with you about the process they do not reference kbb or edmonds or any other valuation tool other than their own internal system they either take the car it up a bit then resell it on their lot or they sell it at auction if they determine your car will be sold at auction then they will offer you a rock bottom price the determining factors that come into play include age of the car mileage and of course overall condition if you mini is still in good shape and does n't have a lot of miles then they may try to resell it on their lot for which they could offer you closer to personal sale price than trade in how many 2007 's are for sale in your area how much are they selling for i did sell them a truck back in 2005 and received $ 200 more than kbb valued it for but it was in great shape only a couple of years old relatively low mileage and it was in high demand god bless the south and their love for trucks i ended up selling my to another local car dealership they offered me $ after negotiating leaving the dealership then negotiating more over the phone it took me a day and a half and really very little effort i have several friends that have gone through the same thing with selling cars and all have had similar luck going to other dealerships where prices can be negotiated rather than carmax   carmax has no incentive to settle or forgive your loan if you really want to pay it off save up what you believe the difference will be then shop your car around the local dealerships and get prices for your mini remember that dealers have to turn a profit so be reasonable with your negotiation if you can find comparable vehicles in your area listed for $ then knock $ 1,500 off that price and tell the dealerships that 's what you want

your scenario 2 in the money options not at the money the former is when the share price is higher than the option strike the second is when share price is right at strike i agree this is a highly unlikely scenario because everyone pricing options knows what everyone else in that stock is doing much about an option has everything to do with the remaining time to expiration depending on how much more the buyer believes the stock will go up before hitting the expiration date that could make a big difference in which option they would buy i agree with the others that if you 're seeing this as real world then there must be something going on behind the scenes that someone else knows and you do n't i would tread with caution in such a situation and do my homework before making any move    the other big factor that makes your question harder to answer more concisely is that you did n't tell us what the expiration dates on the options are this makes a difference in how you evaluate them we could probably be much more helpful to you if you could give us that information

buy a fund of bonds there are plenty and are registered on your stockbroker account as funds rather than shares otherwise to the individual investor they can be considered as the same thing funds of bonds rather than funds that contain property or shares or other investments are often high yield low volatility you buy the fund and let the manager work it for you he buys bonds in accordance to the specification of the fund ie some funds will say european only or global high yield etc and he will buy and sell the bonds regularly you never hold to maturity as this is handled for you in many cases the manager will be buying and selling bonds all the time in order to give you a stable fund that returns you a dividend private investors can buy bonds directly but its not common   should you do it up to you bonds return the company issuing a corporate bond will do so at a fixed price with a fixed yield at the end of the term they return the principal so a 20-year bond with a 5 yield will return someone who invests £ 10k £ 500 a year and at the end of the 20 years will return the £ 10k the corporate does n't care who holds the bond so you can happily sell it to someone else probably for £ 10 km give or take people say to invest in bonds because they do not move much in value in financially difficult times this means bonds are more attractive to investors as they are a safe place to hold money while stocks drop but in good times the opposite applies no one wants a fund returning 5 when they think they can get 20 growth from a stock

it includes whatever you want to do with your investment   at least initially it 's not so much a matter of calculating numbers as of soul searching   identifying your investment objectives means asking yourself why do i want to invest   then you gradually ask yourself more and more specific questions to narrow down your goals   for instance if your answer is something very general like to make money then you may start to ask yourself how much money do i want what will i want to use that money for when will i want to use that money etc   of course not all objectives are realistic so identifying objectives can also involve down plans that are too one thing that can be helpful is to first identify your financial objectives that is money you want to be able to have and things you want to do with that money   investment in the sense of purchasing investment vehicles likes stocks or bonds is only one way of achieving financial goals other ways include working for a paycheck starting your own business etc   once you identify your financial goals you have a number of options for how to get that money and you should consider how well suited each strategy is for each goal for instance for a financial goal like paying relatively small short term expenses e.g. your electric bill investing would probably not be the first choice for how to do that because a there may be easier ways to achieve that goal e.g. ask for a raise eat out less and b the kinds of investment that could achieve that goal may not be the best use of your money e.g. because they have lower returns

your first step is to talk to the current lender and ask about refinancing in the other person 's name the lender is free to say no and if they think the other person is unlikely to pay it back they wo n't refinance if you 're in this situation because the other person did n't qualify for a loan in the first place the lender probably wo n't change their mind but it 's still worth asking from the lender 's point of view you 'll be selling the other person the car   if they qualify for a loan it 's as simple as getting the loan from a bank then doing whatever is required by your state to sell a car between either private parties or between relatives depending on who the other person is the bank might help you with this or your state 's dmv website   here are a few options that do n't involve changing who is on the loan taking out a loan for another person is always a big risk banks have entire departments devoted to determining who is a good credit risk and who is n't so if a person ca n't get a loan from a bank it 's usually for a good reason   one good thing about your situation you actually bought the car and are the listed owner had you co signed on a loan in the other person 's name you 'd owe the money but would n't even have the car 's value to fall back on when they stopped paying

i think it 's great that you want to contribute course instructor you may want to take a look at becoming an instructor for a course like dave ramsey 's financial peace university these are commonly offered through churches and other community venues for a fee this may be a good fit if you want to focus on basic financial literacy setting up and sticking to a budget and getting their financial house in order it may not be a good fit if you do n't want to teach an existing curriculum or if you find the tenets of the course too unpalatable a significant number of the people in dave 's audience are close to or in the middle of a financial meltdown and so his advice includes controversial ideas such as avoiding credit altogether often because that 's how they got into their current mess counselor if you want to run your own show i know of several people who have built their own practice that is run along the lines of a counselor charging hourly rates and they work with couples who are having money problems building a reputation and a network of referring counselors and professionals is key here and definitely seems like it would require a full time commitment i would avoid credit counseling and the like most of these organizations are focused on restructuring credit card debt not spending time on behavioral change you do n't need a series 7 63 65 etc or even a cfa i 've previously acquired a number of these and can confirm that they are investment credentials that are intended to help you get a job and/or get more business as a broker or conventional financial planner i.e. salesperson of securities the process is necessary to protect consumers from advice that serves the investment sales force but is bad for the consumer and because you must be licensed to provide investment advice there is a class of fee only financial planners but they primarily deal with complex issues that allow them to make money and often give away basic personal finance advice for free in the form of articles podcasts etc   charity for part time or free work in my area there are also several charity organizations that help people do their taxes and provide basic budgeting and personal finance instruction but this is very localized and may vary quite a bit depending on where you live however if there are none near you you can always start one journalism if you have an interest in writing there are also people who work as journalists and write columns books or newsletters and it is much easier now to publish and build a network online either on your own through a blog or contributing to a website speaker at community events there are also many opportunities to speak to a specific community such as a church or social organization for example where i live there are local organizations for spanish speaking polish speaking elderly young professional young mother and retiree groups for example all of who might be interested in your advice on issues that specifically address their needs good luck

you might convert all your money in local currency but you need take care of following tips while studying abroad here are some money tips that can be useful during a trip abroad know about fees when you use a debit card or credit card in a foreign country there are generally two types of transaction fees that may apply understand exchange rates the exchange rate lets you know the amount of nearby money you can get for each u.s. dollar missing any expenses there are sell rates for individuals who are trading u.s. dollars for foreign currency and the other way around purchase rates it 's a smart thought to recognize what the neighborhood money is worth in dollars so you can comprehend the estimation of your buys abroad   sites like x rates offer a currency converter that gives the current exchange rate so you can make speedy comparisons you can utilize it to get a feel for how much certain amount say $ 1 $ 10 $ 25 $ 50 $ 100 are worth in local currency remember that rates fluctuate so you will be unable to suspect precisely the amount of a buy made in a foreign currency will cost you in u.s. dollars to get cash check for buddy banks if you already have an account with a large bank or credit union in the u.s. you may have an advantage   being a client of a big financial institution with a large atm system may make it easier to find a subsidiary cash machine and stay away from an out of system charge   bank of america for example is a part of the global atm alliance which lets clients of taking an interest banks use their debit cards to withdraw money at any alliance atm without paying the machine 's operator an access fee in spite of the fact that you may at present be charged for converting dollars into local currency used for purchases   citibank is another well known bank for travelers because it has 45,000 atms in more than 30 countries including popular study abroad destinations such as the u.k. italy and spain atms in a foreign country may allow withdrawals just from a financial records and not from savings so make sure to keep an adequate checking balance also atm withdrawal limits will apply just as they do in the u.s. but the amount may vary based on the local currency and exchange rates weigh the benefits of other banks for general needs online banks and even foreign banks can also be good options   with online banks you do n’t have to visit physical branches and these institutions typically have lower fees use our checking account tool to find one that ’s a good fit foreign many american debit cards may not work in europe asia and latin america especially those that do n’t have an emv chip that help prevent fraud or some cards may work at one atm but not another one option for students who expect a more extended stay in a foreign country is to open a new account at a local bank this will let you have better access to atms and to make purchases more easily and without as many fees see our chart below for the names of the largest banks in several countries guard against fraud and identity one of the most important things you can do as you plan your trip is to let your bank know that you ’ll be abroad include exact countries and dates when possible to avoid having your card flagged for fraud unfortunately incidents may still arise despite providing ample warning to your bank bring a backup credit card or debit card so you can still access some sort of money in case one is canceled are also critical not just for traveling from place to place but also as identification to open a bank account and for everyday purposes you ’ll want to make two and give one to a friend or family member to keep at home and put the other in a separate secure location just in case your actual passport is lost or stolen

the first issue is if the stock has returned 8 since you purchased it that could be either very good 8 in two days or very bad 8 over 20 years   even just measured over the past year it could be relatively very good up 8 and the market is down 5 or very bad up 8 and the market is up 16 either way the good rule of thumb is that you should n't choose your positions using the returns of the stock in the past but only on your view of the future returns of the stock   for instance if the stock has gone up 8 in two months but you think it has another 8 to go in the next two months you probably should n't take your earnings as for the $ 5k at first glance that is not an unreasonable amount   if you use a discount broker the fees should n't be so large that you will eat up any return on a $ 5k amount   also from what you describe it is not such a large amount that mistakes will put your retirement in danger

at 5 this means you expect rents to double every 14 years i bought a condo style apartment 28 years ago sold a while back by the way and recently saw the going rate for rents has moved up from $ 525 to $ 750 after all this time the rent has n't increased four fold   if rents appear to be too low compared to the cost of buying the house people tend to prefer to rent on the flip side if the rent can cover a mortgage and then some there 's strong motivation to buy if not by the renters then by investors who seek a high return from renting those houses thereby pushing the price up   the price to rent ratio is n't fixed it depends in part on interest rates consumer sentiment and banks willingness to lend similar to stock 's p e there can be quite a range but too far in either direction is a sign a correction is due

i 'm not 100 sure but i do n't think it would be considered a free ride the idea of a free ride is that you are engaging in a transaction when you do not actually have the money available to cover it since the broker is technically giving you a 3 day loan whenever you purchase your stock 3 day rule to settle however if you are using a margin account and you have enough credit available then you are not actually using unsettled assets but rather an additional line of credit which was granted to you you would just need to make sure that your total transactions are less than your purchasing power that 's my take on it anyway i hope that helps and hopefully someone can confirm or reject what i have said

this may be a bit advanced now but once you start really working and get a place i think this will apply more do i set up a bank account now yes there is no reason not to as an adult you will be using this much more than you think   assuming you have a little money you can walk in to any bank almost any day of the week and set up an account with them in very little time note that they may require you to be 18 if your parents wo n't be with you on the account otherwise just ask any bank representative to help you do this just to be clear if you can get a credit union account over a typical bank account this is a great idea credit unions provide exactly the same financial services as a normal bank but typically have variety of advantages over banks    bank account parts bank accounts typically have two parts a checking account and a savings account your checking account typically is what you use for most day to day transactions and your savings account is generally used for well saving money   having a bank account often gives you the following advantages they give you an ability to store money without having large amounts of cash on hand once you start working regularly you 'll find you wo n't want to keep + cash every two weeks in your wallet or apartment they help you pay bills when you set up your bank account you will likely be able to get a visa debit card which will process like a regular credit card but simply deduct funds from your checking account you can use this card online to pay utilities i.e. electricity and water general bills e.g. your cell phone and cable purchase items ex at amazon or use it in stores to pay in lieu of cash   be aware some banks will give you an atm only card before they send you the visa debit card in the mail this atm only card can only be used at atms as it 's name implies   similarly if you can invest about ~$200 to build your credit you can often get a deposit secured credit card attached to your account basically a credit card where the bank keeps your money in case you ca n't pay your bill if you treat this card with responsibility you can eventually transition to an unsecured credit card they save you hassles when cashing your check if you do n't have a bank where you can cash your check e.g. you do n't have an account you will likely be charged check cashing fees usually by places such as grocery stores or payday loan chains or even other banks furthermore if your check is over a certain amount some places may refuse to cash your check period and a bank may be your only option they give you a way to receive money electronically the most common example of this is direct deposit many employers will send your money directly to your bank account instead of requiring you to cash a check if they are prompt this money gets to you faster and saves you trouble on payday you 'll just receive a pay stub detailing your wages and the amount deposited rather than a check   also since you asked about taxes you should know that when you do eventually file with the irs they have an option to receive your tax refund electronically as well e.g. direct deposit into your bank account and that can literally save you months in some cases depending on when you file your return and how many paper checks they have to process does it cost money to setup it depends some banks have special offers some do n't most places will set up an account for free but may require a minimum deposit to open the account typically $ 50-$100 the visa debit card mentioned above generally comes free if you want a secured credit card as above you will want about an additional $ 200 so $ 250 $ 300 total note that this is absolutely not required you can exclusively use the visa debit card above if you wish bank account fees any fees charged when you have a bank account are usually minor anymore regardless the bank will hand you a whole bunch of paperwork mostly in legalese detailing exactly how your account works that said the bank person helping set things up will cover what you need to know about keeping the account in plain english the most common types of fee associated with a bank account are monthly maintenance fees and overdraft fees but these are n't always necessarily charged likewise there may be some other fees associated with the account but these vary from bank to bank   monthly maintenance fees to give some examples overdraft fees overdraft fees are typically charged when you attempt to spend more money than you have in your bank account and the bank has to cover these charges overdraft fees typically apply to using paper checks which it is unlikely you will be using but not always   that said it is very unlikely you will be charged overdraft fees for three reasons many banks have done away with these fees in lieu of other ways of generating revenue     banks that still charge these fees usually have overdraft protection options for a little more money a month effectively negating the possibility you will be charged these fees   the ability to deduct an amount of money from your checking account is now typically checked electronically before the payment is authorized that is using a visa debit card the card balance is checked immediately and even when using paper check most retailers have check scanning machines that do roughly the same thing on a personal note the bank that i have allows my account to be deducted below my checking account balance only if the payment is requested electronically e.g. someone who has my card information charges me for a monthly service in this case the funds are simply listed in the negative and deducted from any amount i deposit till the proper amount is repaid e.g. if i 'm at dollars due to a charge when my account balance was $ 0 and then i deposit $ 100 my available balance will then be $ 75 not $ 100 finally per the comment by while i minimize the likelihood you will be charged overdraft fees it is good to check into the exact circumstances under which you might be charged unexpectedly by your bank read the documentation they give you carefully including any mailed updates and you 'll reduce the chance of receiving a nasty surprise for reference here are some of the fees charged by bank of america what about taxes when you begin working an employer will usually have you fill out a tax form such as a w-4 employee 's withholding allowance certificate so that your employer can withhold the correct federal income tax from your wages if they do n't then it is your responsibility to calculate and file your own income taxes if you are self employed an independent contractor or paid under the table   if your employer is reputable they will send you additional information generally in february you need to properly file your taxes prior to april 15th the irs tax deadline for most people this additional information will likely be some variation of a w-2 wage and tax statement or possibly a form 1099-misc   do i have to worry about money in my bank account unless you have a significant amount in your bank savings account earning interest see should i save for the future below you wo n't have to pay any sort of tax on money in your bank account if you do earn enough taxable interest the bank will send you the proper forms to file your taxes how do i file taxes while it wo n't apply till next year you will likely be able to fill out a form 1040ez income tax return for single and joint filers with no dependents as long as you do n't have any kids in the meantime you will either mail in the paper form available at your local irs office post office public library etc or file electronically there will be a lot of information on how to do this when the time comes so do n't worry about details just yet   assuming your all paid up on your taxes very likely unless you get a good paying job and take a lot of deductions throughout the year on your w-4 you 'll probably get money back from the irs when you file your tax return as i mentioned above if you have a bank account you can opt to have your refund money returned electronically and get it much sooner than if you did n't have a bank account again possibly saving you literal months of waiting should i save for my future if so how much any good articles yes you should save for the future and start as soon as possible it 's outside the scope of this answer but listen to your economics professor talk about compound interest in short the later you start saving the less money you have when you retire   not that it makes much difference now but you have to think that over 45 years of working age 20 65 you likely have to have enough money for another 20 + years of not working 65 85 + so if you want $ 25,000 a year for retirement you need to make $ 75,000 a year between your job and any financial instruments you have savings account stocks bonds cds mutual funds iras job retirement benefits etc where you should stick money your money is a complicated question which you can investigate at length as you get older personally though i would recommend some combination of ira individual retirement account long term mutual funds and some sort of savings bonds there is a metric ton of information regarding financial planning but you can always read something like investing for dummies or you can try the motley fool 's how to invest online and highly recommended but i 'm only 17 so what should you do now budget sounds dumb but just look at your basic expenses and total them all up rent utilities phone cable food gas other costs and divide by two out of each paycheck this is how much money you need to save not to go into debt   try to save a little each month $ 50 $ 100 a month is a good starting amount if you can swing it you can always try to save more later invest early you may not get great returns but you do n't need much money to start investing often you can get started with as little as $ 20 $ 100 you 'll have to do research but it is possible put money in your savings account checking accounts do not typically earn interest but money in savings accounts often do that is the bank will actually add money to your savings assuming you leave it in there long enough unfortunately this rate of interest is only about 3.5 on average which for most people means they do n't get rich off it you have to have a significant amount of money $ 5,000 + to see even modest improvements in your savings account balance each month but still you may eventually get there get into the habit of putting money places that make you money in the long run do n't go into debt do n't get payday loans pawn items or abuse credit cards besides wrecking your credit even a small amount of debt $ 500 + can be very hard to break out of if you do n't have a great paying job and can even make you homeless no rent means no apartment   remember be financially responsible but assuming your parents are n't totally tight with money do n't be afraid to ask for cash when you really need it this is a much better option than borrowing from some place that charges outrageous interest or making your payments late have an emergency account as already mentioned in another excellent answer you need to have money to smooth things out when you encounter unexpected events your employer has trouble with your check you have to pay for some sort of repair bill you use more gas in your car in a month than normal etc anywhere from $ 200 $ 2000 + should do it but ideally you should have at least enough to cover a month of basic expenses build good credit avoid the temptation to get a lot of credit cards even if stores and banks are dying to give them to you you really only need one to build good credit preferably a secured one from your bank as mentioned above never charge more than you can pay off in a single month charging then paying that amount off before the due date on your next statement will help your credit immensely likewise pay attention to your rent utilities and monthly services cell phone cable etc even though these seem like options you can put off oh my electric bill is only $ 40 i 'll pay that next month late payments on all of these can negatively affect your credit score which you will need later to get good loans and buy a house   get health insurance now that the affordable care act aca a.k.a obamacare has been enacted it is now simpler to get health insurance and it is actually required you have some hopefully your employer will offer health coverage you can find reasonably priced coverage on your own or you live in a state with a health exchange even if you ca n't otherwise get afford insurance you may qualify for some sort of state coverage depending on income if you do n't have some sort of health insurance private or otherwise the irs can potentially fine you when you file your taxes not to be too scary but the fine as currently proposed is jumping up to about $ 700 for individuals in 2016 or so so even if you do n't grab health insurance which you absolutely should you need to save about $ 60 a month even if just for the fine   this answer turned out a bit longer than intended but hopefully it will help you a little bit welcome to the wonderful world of adult financial responsibility

the reason people buy earthquake insurance is not because normal insurance goes straight to the lender it does not but because oftentimes earthquake damage is not covered under normal homeowner 's insurance natural disasters are often not covered under regular insurance this is why people buy flood insurance if your pipes burst and flood your house your home owner 's insurance will typically cover if the local river floods and floods your house oftentimes insurance will not cover this is why a lot of state federal agencies have separate pools of insurance all earthquake insurance in california is technically through the state agency though you may go through your homeowner provider to get it i pay $ 200 a year for mine i would n't say it 's very expensive my concern is not a giant earthquake that destroys my house my concern is a large earthquake that might cause cracks in my slab or structural damage that my regular insurance is in no way obligated to cover but i need to fix i think if you live in an earthquake prone area it 's as reasonable as getting flood insurance if you live in an area known to flood

first i do n't think your parents are ripping you off but you should get your agreement in writing the fact that you never own more than 25 does n't matter if the condo 's value is increasing you are in fact building equity your share of the equity just does n't increase but it does n't decrease either for example if the condo is worth $ 300,000 now you have $ 75,000 in equity of course if the value is decreasing so is your equity if you are paying $ 500/month in interest as op clarified above and you do n't have a written agreement you are probably unable to claim that payment as mortgage interest if you itemize your deductions on u.s. federal or state tax returns thus you may be losing out on a legal tax deduction assuming you earn enough to itemize they will need to give you each year the proper irs form for mortgage interest form 1098 and they have to claim the $ 500/month as interest income on their tax returns having a written and signed contract eliminates confusion and potential for misunderstanding the future and it sounds like you are already experiencing some doubt and confusion now your rate seems within market rates for an interest only loan let 's say you wanted to buy out your parents share of the condo right now would you pay $ 115,000 or would you have to get an appraisal to find out what the condo is worth now if you ca n't answer that question you need to get that in writing so that you wo n't have an argument over it someday if the condo has appreciated significantly and all you have to pay is the $ 115,000 then that 's a sweet deal for you because you 'd be buying out a much more valuable property for much less than it 's worth if that is the agreement and the property is appreciating no guarantee especially with condos then you are essentially building equity if the property is declining in value and you do wish to sell it then you wo n't have to pay $ 115,000 they 'll just end up with their 75 share which will be less than the $ 115 k they invested both of you would lose some of your investment but you would have had all the benefits of living in a nice condo all those years and they would n't they are definitely taking more risk than you are second if you had $ 40,000 cash saved up your parents probably raised you with some good financial sense and work ethic so i 'm optimistic they have good intentions for your future operate from that frame of mind when you go to ask for a written agreement next read up about equity share agreements there are many models that will help inform your decisions but you should engage a real estate lawyer to help you draw up a fair agreement for both parties   i was in an equity share agreement for my first townhouse it 's a common practice and it wo n't cost all that much to get one created it 's worth the money to get it done properly

1 interest rates what you should know is that the longer the term of a bond fund the more it will be affected by interest rates so a short term bond fund will not be subject to large gains or losses due to rate changes an intermediate term bond fund will be subject to moderate gains or losses and a long term bond fund will be subject to the largest gains or losses when a book or financial planner says to buy bonds with no other qualification they almost always mean investment grade intermediate term bond funds or for individual bonds the equivalent would be a bond ladder averaging an intermediate term if you want technical details look at the average duration or average maturity of the bond fund as a rough guide if the duration is 10 then a 1 change in interest rates would be a 10 gain or loss on the fund another thing you can do is look at long term 10 years or ideally longer performance history on some short intermediate and long term bond index funds and you can see how the long term funds bounced around more non investment grade bonds aka junk bonds or high yield bonds are more affected by factors other than interest rates including some of the same factors economic booms or recessions that affect stocks as a result they are n't as good for diversifying a portfolio that otherwise consists of stocks having stocks investment grade bonds and also a little bit in high yield bonds can add diversification though just do n't replace your bond allocation with high yield bonds a variety of complicated bonds exist convertible bonds are an example and these are tough to analyze there are also floating rate bonds bank loan funds these have minimal interest rate sensitivity because the rate goes up to offset rate rises these funds still have credit risks in the credit crisis some of them lost a lot of money 2 diversification the purpose of diversification is risk control your non bond funds will outperform in many years but in other years say the s&p 500 drop in 2008 they may not you will not know in advance which year you 'll get you get risk control in at least a few ways there 's also an academic modern portfolio theory explanation for why you should diversify among risky assets aka stocks something like for a given desired risk return ratio it 's better to leverage up a diverse portfolio than to use a non diverse portfolio because risk that can be eliminated through diversification is not compensated by increased returns the theory also goes that you should choose your diversification between risk assets and the risk free asset according to your risk tolerance i.e. select the highest return with tolerable risk see for excruciating detail the translation of the mpt stuff to practical steps is typically put as much in stock index funds as you can tolerate over your time horizon and put the rest in intermediate term investment grade bond index funds that 's probably what your planner is asking you to do my personal view which is not the standard view is that you should take as much risk as you need to take not as much as you think you can tolerate http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ but almost everyone else will say to do the 80/20 if you have decades to retirement and feel you can tolerate the risk so my view that 60/40 is the max desirable allocation to stocks is not mainstream your planner 's 80/20 advice is the standard advice before doing 100 stocks i 'd give you at least a couple see also

with regard to your edit although i did n't downvote one way to reduce the security risk is to separate the payment from the ability to drain your account   a considerable part of the security risk is inherent in giving people a number which is directly linked to a bank account where you keep all your money   if you do n't want that risk do n't do that   instead of or in addition to trying to reduce the chance of fraud you can reduce the impact of fraud even if it occurs by not paying for things using the details of an account where you have all your money   trying to protect against fraud while keeping all your money in the account is sort of like carrying around thousands of dollars in cash in your wallet and then worrying about how to defend against robbery   yes you can carry a weapon or hire a but it 's probably simpler to just not carry that much money in the first place you already mentioned one solution with your option 1 which is to just keep a small amount of money in a separate account and use that for online payments   assuming you can easily transfer money in and out of this account via online banking this effectively is what you say you want in your edit you log in to your bank online but rather than informing it you 're about to make a payment you just transfer money in   you 'll probably have to keep a small amount of money in the account to keep it open but if this is an important issue for you that should n't be that big a deal another solution is a credit card   with a credit card you simply make the payment online   in the us if the merchant or someone else stealing the info makes fraudulent charges the credit card company assumes the liability and the consumer suffers only the inconvenience of having to get a new card issued   i do n't know what the uk laws are regarding credit vs. debit fraud but some sites i found seem to suggest that credit cards have fraud protection in the uk as well   this is probably worth looking into if you are concerned about fraud

and where does that spending by the government usually end up right back into the economy putting that tax money into the hands of the wealthy means they will do what they do best hoard it if you have an economy that 's built on a certain amount of spending by the government then cut that off because you decrease the government 's cash flow then you have to have an equal response in terms of spending kansas showed that most wealthy people do not spend the money they get to keep from lower taxes that in turn causes a strain on the economy and you end up with both fiscal woes at the state level and economic woes for businesses and individuals that 's what happened in kansas and that 's what will happen at the federal level if these tax cuts are enacted this is fine for the wealthy they win in this scenario but they are the only ones who do instead the tax cuts should be focused on the lower and middle classes who will actually go out and spend that money but as written these tax cuts disproportionately favor the wealthy who will not spend to help individuals and small businesses

one such strategy i have heard for those who have this opportunity is to purchase the maximum allowed when the window to sell opens sell all of your shares and repurchase the most you can with the amount you gained or keep an equivalent to avoid another transaction fee this allows you to buy at a discount and spread out the risk by investing elsewhere   this way you are really only exposing yourself to lose money which you would n't have had access to without the stock discount

with an investment you tend to buy it for a very specific purpose namely to make you some money either via appreciation ie it hopefully increases value after you take all the fees and associated costs into account you sell the investment realise the gains or via a steady cashflow that after you subtracted your costs leaves you with a profit your primary residence is a roof over your head and first and foremost has the function of providing shelter for yourself and your family it might go up in value which is somewhat nice but that 's not its main purpose and for as long as you live in the house you can not realise the increase in value as you probably do n't want to sell it of course the remortgage crowd would suggest that you can increase the size of the mortgage aka the home atm but a we all know how that movie ended and b you 'd have to factor in the additional interest in your p&l calculation you can also buy real estate as a pure investment ie with the only objective being that you plan to make money on this normally you 'd buy a house or an apartment with a view of renting it out and try to increase your wealth both due to the asset 's appreciation hopefully and the rent which in this scenario should cover the mortgage all expenses and still leave you with a bit of profit all that said i 've never heard someone use the reasoning you describe as a reason not to buy a house and stay in an apartment if you need a bigger place for your family and can afford to buy something bigger that falls under the shelter provision and not under the investment

reading through the details makes it sound even worse     estimates it will be able to save about $ 2 billion annually by cutting out costs such as sending paper bills       come on you ca n't seriously pretend to offer cell plans for $ 3 per month while citing cutting out paper bills as a cost savings measure where are you getting your infrastructure right now it 's owned by the big players so you either spend a fortune leasing bandwidth or spend an even larger fortune laying out your own infrastructure   instead this guy plans to buy t mobile who already has contracts in place except they are already being acquired by sprint so good luck with that mr. no experience in the us market    this feels like the same sort of hubris that us companies have when they think they can expand overseas it does n't work for us companies because of a fundamental lack of understanding of the us market and it looks like this guy suffers from the same knowledge deficit

a true 0 loan is a losing proposition for the bank that 's true   however when you look at actual 0 loans they usually have some catches there might also be late payment fees prepayment penalties and other clauses that make it a good deal on average to the bank   individual borrowers might be able to get away with free money but the bank does not look to make money on each loan they look to make money on thousands of loans overall for a retailer including new car sellers the actual financing costs will be baked into the sales price   they will add say 10 to the sales price in exchange for an interest free loan they can also sell these loans to an investment bank or other entity but they would be sold at a deep discount so the difference will be made up in the sales price or other fees it 's possible that they would just chalk it up to promotional discounts or customer acquisition costs but it would not be a good practice on a large scale

for example started an animation studio and production developing company to produce something in the ballpark of $ and he had a $ 12k yearly salary i have no clue what you mean as others have mentioned i 'm not sure what the 12 million refers to   do you mean total cost of created by the company in a year or   if so 12 million would amount to say 5 to 20 major brand name tv commercials for example   do you mean the cost of plant so for a tv commercial production company you mean purchasing desks drawing pads and so on your specific example of a film or tv commercial production company is a bad example it 's not really a business that is to say it does not rely on capital and return on capital the way famous film or tv commercial production companies happens is precisely like this a young guy girl g perhaps a designer or is working just as you say for a menial wage at a film company g got that first job perhaps out of art school   g gets a chance at doing a photo shoot animation or helping direct a tv commercial   g does a fantastic job later that year a large important animation or commercial job arrives at the company due to the earlier excellent result g is allowed to work on the new one g again he does a fantastic job   soon within that company g is a highly regarded or director and has attracted fame amongst colleagues and clients eventually g hears of a company xyz hotel that needs a tv ad made or an animation or whatever g says to xyz look you could spend $ 230,000 with a production company and in reality they 'd have me direct it anyway i 'm leaving to work independently so i will do your job for only $ 190,000 in a word xyz says yes and hands over a cheque for $ 190,000   g spends $ 160,000 on the usual actors editing etc and uses 2 months of g 's own time and pockets $ 5000 after tax g then does n't get a job for a couple months and then gets three more in the new year because the commercial for xyz was so good xyz gave him another couple to do for another product line eventually g has just enough money coming in that he hires a few freelance people for a few weeks here and there a and so on   eventually g has enough tv ads solidly booked g can risk actually hiring long time friend p as a producer   p spends most of her time actually bringing in more work and it builds from there eventually you have a very busy well known in the industry tv commercial production company with many staff and endless clients example say it might be at some point in there say around year three g would like to borrow the odd million bucks to basically help with cashflow the answer to that is nothing more than through business contacts g knows a wealthy dentist whoever who is prepared to do that but note carefully that at that point g 's company is already very firmly established famous for doing 20 spectacular commercials and so on   note too that 999 times out of 1000 when this happens the money evaporates and the dentist d never sees a penny back in that case g only much much later once the company has many many staff and great cashflow could the production company actually borrow from a bank or perhaps from actual investors which is more what you have in mind regarding your four categories   numbers 1 and 3 are totally wrong they do not work at all like you are asking indeed the very simple answer is borrow money to start a category 1 or 3 type of business it 's totally the only exception would be if you literally just have an extremely rich uncle who loans you a few million to start an animation studio which would be completely   because in that example company xyz could not care less if you have an animation studio ie your uncle has given you a platinum card and you bought a building some drawing pads and a few dozen macs   xyz just could n't care less   all they care about is your folio of work   in this example rsa would get the job     my guess is you 're thinking people somehow magically go around borrowing money to get businesses like that started   your examples 1 and 3 the simple answer is they do n't and ca n't   your fears are

mrchrister makes some good points but i saw his invitation to offer a counter opinion first there is a normal annual deposit limit of $ 13,000 per parent or donee this is the gift limit due to rise to $ 14,000 in 2013   if your goal is strictly to fund college and this limit is n't an issue for you the one account may be fine unless both kids are in school at the same time in that case you 're going to need to change beneficiaries every year to assign withdrawals properly   but as you mention there 's gift money that your considering depositing to the account in this case there 's really a legal issue the normal 529 allows changes in beneficiary and gifts to your child need to be held for that child in an irrevocable arrangement such as a utma account there is a 529 flavor that provides for no change of beneficiary a utma 529 clearly in that case you need separate accounts   in conclusion i think the single account creates more issues than it potentially solves if the true gift money from others is minimal maybe you should just keep it in a regular account edit on further reflection i strongly suggest you keep the relatives gifts in a separate account and when the kids are old enough to have legitimate earned income use this money to open and deposit to roth iras they can deposit the lesser of their earned income or $ 5000 in 2012 $ 5500 in 2013   this serves two goals avoiding the risk of gift money being stolen from one child for benefit of the other and putting it into an account that can help your children long term but not impact college aid as would a simple savings or brokerage account

the definition of market cap is exactly shares share price so something is wrong here it seems that the share price is expressed in pence rather pounds there 's a note at the bottom currency in gbp note the p rather than p so the share price of is actually i.e. £ however it 's not really clear just from the which figures are in pence and which are actually in pounds it seems that the market cap is in pounds but the enterprise value is in pence given that billion is about the right value in pounds whereas billion only really makes sense if expressed in pence it looks like they actually got the enterprise value wrong by a factor of 100 perhaps their calculation treated the share price as being denominated in pounds rather than pence

you buy stocks for dividends over the long term   if a share of stock pays $ 1.00 in dividends every quarter that 's four dollars a year   if you bought it for $ 40 it pays out $ 4 in a year and it 's still worth roughly $ 40 at the end of the year you 're $ 4 richer   people will often invest large amounts of money in stable stocks not planning to sell it but only collect the dividends which are either re invested or pulled out as income

if you want to monitor how well you did in choosing your investments you will want to use stock prices that account for the dividends and splits and other changes not just the closing price   the adjusted close will include these changes where the straight close will not include them   using the adjusted close you will get your true percentage change   for example i have a stock called pets that paid an $ 0.18 dividend in july 2015 the adjusted closes before that day in july are all $ 0.18 lower per share   say the closing price had been unchanged at $ 20.00   the close prices would say i made no profit but the adjusted closing price would say i made $ 0.18 per share on this investment because the adjusted close would read $ in june 2015 but would read $ 20.00 in august 2015 just like the closing price   the adjusted close allows me to know my true profit per share

financial problems are often due to budget income statement issues either caused by excessive expenses or too little income you state your income at $ 115 k pre tax which is much larger than median income but you do not supply all expenses other than state that you have debts that require large payments and that you are doing well budgeting which is hard to accept based upon the large debt load though you do not mention specific card amounts interest rates and options you have considered for addressing these balances you do suggest that you understand the problem and want to pay the credit cards off you have a large amount of debt comprised mainly of large credit card balances there are no easy solutions for high credit card debt this is a problem that you need to learn how to manage and the costs that you incur when you allow easy credit to chain you to service to the credit card companies rather than sacrifice your future look to finding ways to fix your present situation which is tough try to find a way to dig out of the debt which will take several years lets put this debt in perspective consider that a five year 60 months plan to repay the debt will require paying > $ 1000/month towards principal plus the interest on all the cards difficult but not impossible   you also mention two cars with $ on one car $ unknown month on the other car   plus you mention $ 500/month for private school since the debt is a balance sheet problem do you have any assets you can sell to payoff some of the debt can you sell your cars and obtain cheaper vehicles that have smaller payments can you examine you budget and find areas where you can save when you were making $ 75k year or $ 30k year you certainly had lower expenses and a smaller expense budget can you reduce your expenses to a more modest level can you go on a budget diet this would be the advice dave ramsey and others would give you probably have $ income net after taxes which using the approach would give you three budget categories modify the approach to allocate more for financial priorities paying down debt until you have the credit cards under control i have estimated below essentials 50 $ 3200 financial 30 $ 1920 lifestyle 20 $ some suggestions the debt snowball approach works driving a cheaper car works scaling back on monthly lifestyle expenses works slash your expenses for a year cut back on everything and pay off some of that debt you really need to manage this situation with a focus on reducing that unsecured debt to a manageable level consider a reputable debt repayment plan

many a time even if the tax is deducted and paid by the company it does not reflect as a credit against your pan for various reasons like you not submitting it to your employer in time errors of reconciliation etc its advisable that you inform your company finance officer that you have received such a letter q1 the sure shot way of knowing that your company is depositing tax with government is to view your tax credit report this was set up in 2004 and gives the details of all credits against your pan and the tax deducted against your pan it shows if the tax was tds and which employer paid it or if this was a self assessment or etc   to view this report there are 2 options   register directly at   follow the one time registration process and keep viewing the tax credits note it normally takes 2 3 months to reflect the data   the other alternative is that quite a few leading banks citi sbi etc provide a direct access to this report from their internet banking frontend provided your pan is associated to your account q2 the only details you need to submit are the form 16 this would have all the details of when the tax was paid and the number required for reconciling q3 tds is the liability of the employer however if this has not been deducted or too little was deducted based on incorrect incomplete information give by you then its your liability for example if you change jobs in a year the tax deducted is always less and you have to pay the difference q4 if its established that the company was at fault for not deducting the tax or deducting and not paying it to government on time there are enough provisions to penalize the company including putting the top management team behind bars

in most countries trading platforms are legally required to be overseen by a regulator in the us this is the sec securities and exchanges commission this regulatory oversight is required in order to operate i.e. have clients in that country and the company will lose the right to operate in that country if they do not comply with the regulations if you believe that you have genuine cause to complain that a trading platform that you are using within your jurisdiction is behaving unfairly towards you you can report this to the regulator and they will investigate so long as you can provide them with some concrete evidence note that in many jurisdictions gambling websites are also regulated they are in the uk for example and so arguments about their fairness are specious a big problem with a lot of these complaints is that people who lose money are very vocal about blaming everyone else people who make money are very vocal about their own amazing skills think about that

let me start with something you might dismiss as trite correlation does not mean causation   a money manager charging say 1 is n't likely to take on clients below a minimum level   on the other hand there 's a long debate regarding how on average managed funds do n't beat the averages   i think that you should look at it this way people that have money tend to be focused on other things a brain surgeon making $ 500k yr may not have the time nor the inclination to want to manage her own money   i was always a numbers person i at the difference between raising 1.1 to the power getting i.e. getting times your investment after 40 years at 10 vs at 9 that 1 difference feels like nothing but after a lifetime 1/3 of your money has been skimmed off the top the data show that one can do better by simply putting their money into a mix of s&p index and cash and beat the average money manager over time regardless of convoluted 12 asset class allocations   similarly there are people who use a tax guy in quotes because i mean this as an individual whom they go to year after year not a storefront my used to go to one and i was curious what they got for their money each year he sent them a form 3 pages they needed to fill in every cell made its way into the guy 's tax program the last year i went with them to pick up the tax return i asked him if he noticed that they might benefit from small roth conversions each year or by making some of their ira rmd directly to charity he kindly told me that 's not what we do here and us away i planned both questions in advance the roth conversion was a strategy that one could agree made sense or dismiss as convoluted for some clients but the rmd issue was very different they did n't have enough schedule a deductions to itemize therefore the $ 3000 they donated each year was n't impacting their return by donating directly from their iras this money would avoid tax it would have saved them more than the cost of the tax guy who charged a hefty fee in my opinion it seemed to me this particular strategy should be obvious to one whose business is preparing returns

pay off your highest interest debt first credit card car maybe even mortgage pay minimums on all else student loans are typically low interest so pay off anything else first but double check your rate of course   even if you have no other debt you may still want to hang on to your savings instead of paying down your student loans if getting rid of your savings causes you to accrue debt for example if you have a low income and no savings you may accrue credit card debt high interest or you may want to buy a car with cash instead of getting a loan even if this is not an issue consider what you can do with your savings that others who lack them can not do you can put it into mutual funds which may offer higher rate of return albeit with risk than your student loan interest or you may pay a down payment on a home the very low interest rates of student loans are to a person with savings essentially a source of cheap money that does n't need to be justified to a bank you can use it as seed money to start a business as funds for travel for living expenses while in the peace corps or whatever else but if you pay down that principal you bind yourself in short pay down your student loans when there is no better use for the money

it depends on the terms of the mortgage generally speaking residential mortgages specifically prohibit letting out a property without the bank 's express permission but as you say that tends to assume that the whole property is being let not just a part of it conversely buy to let mortgages generally prohibit living in the property yourself the final as to what is allowed under a mortgage is the mortgage provider so the safest option is to speak to one or more banks and see what they say note that if you 're changing the use of part of a property from business to residential you may need to apply for permission check with your local council

the wikipedia page for repurchase agreement has two relevant pointers on this topic   the legal title for any securities used in a repo actually pass from seller to buyer during the term of the agreement in basic terms this means that if one sells a bond on repo with a promise to buy it back then the ownership actually transfers to the buyer for that period of time   if a coupon is paid during this time period it can either go to the buyer or the seller usually the coupon payment goes to the initial owner of the security pre repo our seller but sometimes the repurchase agreement will specify otherwise so again in basic terms usually the repo seller initial security owner receives any payments made during the term of the repurchase agreement both points are in the first paragraph of the section structure and terminology

well if you worked in the united states you have social security and medicare and medicaid in most cases as well   so you have a small amount of income to spend every month to cover your most basic living expenses as well as your basic medical expenses   at least that 's the idea in reality it probably is n't anywhere near enough money for most to live comfortably   also there is a real fear that the us will have to inflate itself out of its debt to some extent in the future   this theory implies that the money retired individuals have saved or are receiving down the road could buy significantly less in the future than they expect if you have the ability to put money away into an ira or 401 k early in your life it will be greatly beneficial to do so   however that is another issue i wo n't begin to discuss fully here edit since your question was restated after i typed my initial response the final answer is   you will receive some assistance from social security medicare and medicaid   you will most likely need to either continue working draw on savings such as an ira or 401k or will need assistance from others   if none of those are options you would most likely end up living in poverty or worse

imo what it seems like you 've done is nothing more than having screened out a company worth further investigation the next step would be a thorough analysis of the company 's past financials and current statements to arrive at your own opinion forecast of the immediate and far future of the company 's prospects   typically this is done by looking at the company 's regulatory filings and maybe some additional searching on comparison businesses   there are many sources of instruction for how one might value or analyze a company or that provide help on reading a balance sheet   this is not an easy skill to learn but it is one that will prove invaluable over a lifetime of investing it is possible that you 'll uncover a deteriorating business where the latest selling and subsequent drop in price that caused the high yield is well deserved   in which case you know to stay away and move on to the next idea on the other hand you might end up confident that the company is not suffering from a drop in sales rise in expenses growing debt payments loss of moat etc   in which case you 've found a great investment candidate   i say candidate because you still may decide this company is n't for you even if the financials are right because you might find better opportunities for an equal or acceptable return at lower risk while you 're researching as to the yield being high when there are no problems with the fundamentals of the business this may simply be because of panic selling during this past few week 's downturn or some other sort of temporary and superficial scare   however be warned that the masses can remain irrational and thus the price stay suppressed or even drop further for longer than you 're willing to wait for your roi   the good news is that in that case you 're being well compensated to wait at a yield

they 're not going to look very hard at the asset value except for actual cash in the bank which does n't bear much relationship to the real value of the company more likely they will look at the last three years earnings and choose a target p e ratio based on that the owner 's share depends entirely on how much of the business they choose to sell if the business is worth $ 60 m and they want to raise $ 20 m for themselves then that means selling 33 of the company if they want to raise $ 20 m for the business as well then that means selling half the company and retaining ownership of the other half which is now worth $ 80 m because of the cash infusion but many stock exchanges will have minimum requirements for the percentage of the shares that are trading freely so they will have to sell at least that much

in financial theory there is no reason for a difference in investor return to exist between dividend paying and non dividend paying stocks except for tax consequences   this is because in theory a company can either pay dividends to investors who can reinvest the funds themselves or reinvest its capital and earn the same return on that reinvestment and the shareholder still has the choice to sell a fraction of their holdings if they prefer to have cash that theory may not match reality because often companies pay or do n't pay dividends based on their stage of life   for example early stage mining companies often have no free cashflow to pay dividends they are capital intensive until the mines are operational on the other side longstanding companies may have no projects left that would be a   good fit for further investment and so they pay out dividends instead effectively allowing the shareholder to decide where to reinvest the money therefore saying dividend stock can be a proxy for talking about the stage of life + risk and return of a company saying dividend paying implies long standing blue chip company with relatively low capital requirements and a stable business likewise growth stocks non dividend paying implies new startup company that still needs capital and thus is somewhat unproven with a chance for good return to match the higher risk so in theory dividend payment policy makes no difference in practice it makes a difference for two reasons 1 you will most likely be taxed differently on selling stock vs receiving dividends which one is better for you is a specific question relying on your jurisdiction your current income and things like what type of stock how long you hold it for example in canada if you earn ~ < $ 40k your dividends are very likely to have a preferential tax treatment to selling shares for capital gains but your province and specific other numbers would influence this in the united states i believe capital gains are usually preferential as long as you hold the shares for a long time but i am not 100 on this without looking it up 2 dividend policy implies differences in the stage of life risk level of a stock this implication is not guaranteed so be sure you are using other considerations to determine whether this is the case   therefore which dividend policy suits you better depends on your tax position and your risk tolerance

i think that those options might well be your best bet given the potential 700 return in one year if you 're right you could look and see if any synthetic zeros a synthetic zero is a derivative that will pay out a set amount if the underlying security is over a certain price point exist for the share but chances are if they do they would n't offer the 700 return also might be worth asking the question at the quant stack exchange to see if they have any other ideas

good question there are plenty of investors who think they can simply rely on intuition and although luck is always present it is not enough to construct a proper portfolio first of all there are two basic types of portfolio management passive and active the majority of abnormal gains are made with active portfolio management although passive managers are less likely to suffer loses   both types must be created with some kind of qualitative and quantitative research but an active portfolio requires constant adjustments market timing to preserve the desired levels of risk and return   the topic is extremely broad and every manager has his own preferred methods of quantitative analysis i will try to list here some most common in my opinion ways of stock picking and portfolio management 's criterion the best portfolio is that with the lowest probability that the return will be below a specified level   this is achieved by maximising the number of standard deviations between the return on the portfolio and minimum specified level max k = rp where rp return on portfolio rl specified minimum return sp standard deviation of portfolio return 's criterion maximise the minimum return rl subject to constraint that the chance of a return below rl is less than or equal to a specified value a maximise rl subject to prob rp < rl = < a for example assume that the specified value is 20 this will be met provided rl is at least standard deviations below rp therefore the best portfolio is the one that rl where rl = 's criterion maximise expected return subject to the constraint that the chance of a return below the specified minimum is less than or equal to some specified minimum a maximise rp subject to prob rp < rl = < a assuming same data as previously   rl = < and select the portfolio with highest expected return security selection now let 's look at some methods of security selection this is important when a manager believes some shares are mispriced the required return on security i is given by ri = where rf is a risk free rate return on the market bi security 's beta the difference between the required return and the actual return expected is known as the security 's alpha ai ai = rai ri where rai is actual return on security i stock picking one way of stock picking is to select portfolios of securities with positive alpha of a portfolio is simply the weighted average of the of the securities in the portfolio ap = where is sigma sorry for such weird typing have n't figured out yet how to type proper looking formulas n share of security in portfolio so another way of stock picking is ranking securities by their excess return to beta erb erb = ri the greater the erb the more desirable the security and the greater the proportion it will make up of the portfolio thus portfolios produced by this technique will have greater proportion of some securities than the market portfolio and lower proportions of other securities   the number of securities depends on a cut off rate c for the erb defined so that all securities with erb > c are included in portfolio while if erb   the cut off rate for a portfolio containing the first j securities is given by i 'm inserting an image cut from word below   here comes the tricky part basically what you do is first calculate erb for each security then calculate cj for each security mix gradually adding new securities one by one and cj each time then you select an optimum portfolio by comparing cj of each mix to erb 's of it 's securities let me show you a simple example say you have securities a b c and d you calculated erb 's also you calculated then you check erb(a),erb(b),erb(c are greater than c(a but c(a only contains security a so c(a is not an optimum mix erb(a),erb(b),erb(c are greater than but only contains securities a and b erb(a),erb(b),erb(c are greater than and contains a b and c so it is an optimum is lower than so is not an optimum portfolio finally the most important part below is a formula to find the share of each security in the portfolio   here you simply plug in already obtained values for each security to find it 's proportion in your portfolio i hope this somehow answers your question however there is a lot more than this to consider if you decide to manage your portfolio yourself some of the most important areas are   market timing hedging stocks vs bonds   good luck with your investments and remember the safest portfolio is the one that replicates the global market   the cut off rate for a portfolio containing the first j securities is given by i 'm

government registering of financial institutions usually is to make the government safe eg is watching for money laundering and financing terrorism rather than to make it 's customers safe   most governments have many levels of registrations and regulatory bodies the most stringent requirements are usually obligatory only for banks and they indeed often include precautions for insuring customer 's deposits even this insurances have limits eg in most eu countries the state guarantees deposits up to if you deposit more and the bank you lose everything over the limit companies like forex or currency exchanges usually make their best effort to avoid as many regulations as possible just because it 's costly if a given company does have guarantee funds and/or customer insurance it should be advertised and explained on their website however the whole issue of trust is you do n't have to trust in your grocery store to shop there there is no government guarantee that the vegetables sold will be tasty if you buy and the product short of your expectations you call it a loss and start shopping elsewhere financial services are no different than any other product i recommend to your aunt to start small and see how it works if a service turns out well she can increase the amount sent through exchange and decrease amount sent through bank but still it 's always prudent to send eg $ 1000 every week instead of $ 4000 once a month it 's more time consuming and cumbersome than having your bank do it but it 's the safety and convenience you 're paying premium for

what would be the best strategy to avoid paying income taxes on the    sale after i move to another us state leaving the us and terminating your us residency before the sale closes otherwise consider checking your home country 's tax treaty with the us in any case for proper tax planning you should employ a licensed tax adviser an ea cpa or an attorney licensed in your state the one you 'd be when the sale closes no one else is legally allowed to provide you tax advice on the matter because the company abroad is i have control over when    and e.g. in how many chunks the earnings of the sale flow into my    llc so i can plan where i live when that money hits my us account i 'm not familiar with the term in this context but form what i understand your description its a shell corporation under your own control this means that the transfer of money between the corporation and your llc is of no consequence you constructively received the money when the corporation got it not the llc your fundamental misunderstanding is that there 's importance to when the money hits your us bank account this is irrelevant the us taxes your worldwide income so it is taxed when you earn it not when you transfer it into the country as opposed to some other countries for example india or the uk as such in your current scheme it seems to me that you 're breaking the us tax law this is my personal impression of course get a professional advice from a licensed tax professional as i defined earlier

scanned or electronic copies of invoices should be sufficient as long as they are accurate and you can deliver them during an audit also if you have an accountant prepare your taxes you would either need to provide them a copy of the invoices or a summary of them with the corresponding amounts to be claimed personally i prefer to print out a paper copy and file that away with that quarter 's and year 's other tax documents i do my own taxes and find paper copies handy as i can go through each invoice receipt and make sure i have entered its information by ticking it i find that when handling a large number of documents that paper copies are more easy to handle than electronic ones in the end you will need to use a system that you feel comfortable with and are able to use effectively

is investing in a roth retirement account only better if you will be in a higher     tax bracket in retirement if you are pushing up against the contribution limits a roth account may allow you to save more money in tax advantaged accounts in your example you are putting $ 100 pre tax in a traditional account vs $ 85 post tax in a roth account but if there are limits and the limits are the same for traditional or roth accounts as they currently are for us 401(k accounts you can effectively put more into a roth account where the limit applies to the post tax amount than a traditional account where the limit applies to the pre tax amount if so is there any case in which a traditional retirement account is better than a roth account it is smart to have some money in a traditional account because the first amount of money you earn or withdraw each year up to the standard deduction is taxed at 0 which is probably less than your current rate and the next bit of money is taxed at only 10 which may also be less than your current marginal rate of course things may change by the time you retire but it is probably safe to assume that we will still have some kind of progressive income tax structure

the issue is online stores driving prices down and that drives down revenue and more importantly profit   the most effective way to cut costs is to cut wages and that leaves uneducated and under qualified employees at a retail establishment    the business model simply can not be sustained    walmart has it right   leave everything to the consumer to decide and neglect to give them assistance   until a sales associate earns more than their wage in profit they are losing the company money assuming their only job is to sell   electronics sales has very little profit outside of the extra items such as cables cases protection plans etc so they really have to be a professional sales associate to be valuable   professionals cost money and become the managers or more which brings us back to the uneducated and under qualified associates that walk the floors

i must say that this is a question that you should hire a professional tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state to answer it is way above our amateurs pay grade that said i 'll tell you what i personally think on the issue i 'm not a licensed tax adviser and nothing that i write here can be used in any way as a justification for any action read the full disclaimer in my profile i believe you 're right to treat those as assets you bought them as an investment and you intend to sell them for profit here the good news for you end as we decided to define the domains as an asset we need to decide what type of asset it is i believe you 're holding a sec 197 asset this is because domain is essentially akin to franchise and trademark and as such falls under the sec 197 definition that means that your amortization period is 15 years your expenses related to these domains should also be amortized on the same schedule when you sell a domain you can deduct the portion that you have not yet deducted from the amortization schedule from your proceeds keep in mind passive loss limitations since losses from assets held as investment can not offset schedule c income
