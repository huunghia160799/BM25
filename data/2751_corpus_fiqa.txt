one thing to look into is if there is an extra fee for covering a spouse under you plan if she is covered under her own employer 's plan   i know that my wife 's company charges around $ a year if i was to be covered under her plan since i am eligible for the coverage where i work as far as tax issues there should n't be any   i think the choice comes down to the coverage offered by both plans
# 469941
if i read your figures correctly then the cost difference is negligible $ difference the main determining factor i 'd think would be the coverage   do you get more or less coverage now than you would if you went together on the same plan   you 'd both be covered but what is the cap plans and employer contributions change all the time   how is business in both of your companies   are you likely to get cut are you able to get back into a plan at each of your employers if you quit the plan for a while   these rules may be unpleasant surprises if say your wife cancels her plan goes on yours and you lose your job   she may not be able to get back into her insurance immediately or possibly not at all   a spouse losing a job is n't a qualifying life event the way marriage birth of a child divorce etc is

this is a case where human nature and arithmetic lead to different results depending on the your income the effective interest rate on the mortgage is probably right around 2.5   so purely by arithmetic the absolute cheapest way to go is to put the $ 11k to the bigger car loan then pay off the mortgage then the smaller car loan the debt snowball is more effective however because it works better for people progress is demonstrated quickly which maintains and often enhances motivation to continue   i can say as a case in point having tried both methods that if does indeed work   so i am with you pay off the car loan first and roll that payment into the bigger car loan if you add no extra dollars you should get the small loan paid off in 6 to 8 months and the bigger car loan in another 16 to 18 months it sounds like from your message that you have another $ 1500 or so a month   if that is the case small loan paid off in two months bigger loan paid off in another year   if you stick with the ramsay program you then build an emergency fund and start investing good luck

several factors are considered in loans as significant as a home mortgage   i believe the most major factors are 1 credit report 2 income and 3 employment status if you borrow jointly all joint factors are included not just the favorable ones   some wrinkles this can cause may include credit report the second person on the loan may have poor credit or no credit   this can will hurt your rate or even prevent them from being listed on the loan at all which will also mean you ca n't include their income in addition there are future consequences that any late payments default foreclosure etc will be listed on all borrower 's reports if you both have solid work history great credit and want to jointly own the home then there should n't be any negatives   if this is not the case compare both cases fully not just rates as some agents could say you can get the same rate either way but then not tell you closing costs in one scenario are higher and pick the one that is best overall this is just information from my recollection so make sure to verify and ask plenty of questions do n't go forward on assumptions

you do realize that the fund will have management expenses that are likely already factored into the nav and that when you sell the nav will not yet be known right there are often fees to run a mutual fund that may be taken as part of managing the fund that are already factored into the net asset of the shares that would be my caution as well as possible fee changes as dilip sarwate notes in a comment expense ratios are standard for mutual funds yes individual stocks that represent corporations not structured as a mutual fund do n't declare a ratio of how much are their costs e.g. apple or google may well invest in numerous other companies but the costs of making those investments wo n't be well detailed though these companies do have non investment operations of course do n't forget to read the fund 's prospectus as sometimes a fund will have other fees like account maintenance fees that may be taken out of distributions as well as being aware of how taxes will be handled as you do n't specify what kind of account these purchases are being done using

another way to look at this is if we separate the owner 's account from the business 's account   at the start of the year the owner puts $ 9 into the business account to get the business started at the end of the first day the business account has $ 10 and at the end of the second day the business account has $ 11   the owner does n't need to add any more of his own money into the business account at the end of the day the business will have $ which is $ 365 profit + $ 9 investment   assuming the business has no other expenses the business will calculate profit for the year like this the author is making a strange point the two numbers he is talking about are two different quantities the business owner 's return on investment is $ 365 $ 9 =   but the business 's profit margin is $ 365 $ = 10   both are useful numbers when running the business i disagree with the author 's that a business is doing something tricky when calculating profit margin remember that in addition to the business owner 's monetary investment he worked every day for a year to earn that $ 365

what littleadv said is correct   his worth is based on the presumed worth of the total company value which is much greater than all investment dollars combined because of valuation in other words his worth is based on the potential return for his share of ownership at a rate based on the latest valuation of the company he is worth $ 17.5 billion today but the total funding for facebook is only $ 2.4 billion i do n't understand this in private companies valuations typically come from either speculation analysts or from investments   investment valuations are the better gauge because actual money traded hands for a percentage ownership however just as with public companies on the stock market there are at least two caveats just because someone else sold their shares at a given rate does n't mean that rate in both cases it 's possible the value may be much lower or much higher   some high value purchases surprise for how high they are such as microsoft 's acquisition of skype for $ 8.5 billion the formula for one owner 's worth based on a given acquisition is valuation = acquisition amount acquisition percent worth = owner 's percent × valuation according to wikipedia zuckerberg owns 24   in january goldman 's invested $ 500 million at a $ 50 billion valuation that is the latest investment and puts zuckerberg 's worth at $ 12 billion however some speculation places a facebook ipo at a much higher valuation such as as $ 100 billion   i do n't know what your reference is for $ 17 billion but it puts their valuation at $ billion between the january goldman valuation and current ipo speculation for instance originally invested $ 10,000 which at his estimated 5 ownership would now be worth $ 3 5 billion

you sound like you 're already doing a lot to improve your situation paying off the credit cards paying off the taxes started your 401k i 'm in a similar situation credit ruined savings gone after the divorce   i know it feels like you 're just spinning your wheels but look at it this way every monthly payment you make on a debt directly increases your net worth   paying those bills regularly is one of the single best things you can do right now as for how you can improve your situation only two things really jump out at me 1 $ 1,300 in rent plus $ 300 in utilities seems quite high for a single man   i do n't know the housing costs in your area though   depending on where you live you could cut that in half while still living alone or get a roommate and save even more   you might have to accept a suboptimal living arrangement like a smaller apartment but we all have to sacrifice at times 2 that last $ 1,000 you really need to budget how it 's being spent   consider cooking at home more eating out less or trading in your car for one with lower insurance premiums   or spending less money on the kids   you say it 's for their entertainment but do n't say what that is are we talking about going to the movies once a month or rock concerts twice a week 3 if the kids are on their own for college it 's not the end of the world   i know you want to provide the best future you can for them help them get good grades and it 'll do more for them than any amount of money after all those any other ways you find to save money even if you can only put a hundred bucks in a savings account at the end of the month and i 'd be surprised if you could n't put five do it   put it in and leave it there despite the temptation to take it out and spend it

first let me say that you have to take everything your agent says with a grain of salt freakonomics had a great article that discussed the math behind the motivation of the real estate agent   it described the home seller trying to get say $ 400k. on a 6 commission the $ 24 k is destined to be split between seller realtor office and buyer 's realtor 's office the selling agent gets $ 6,000 or so in the end as a seller if i settle for $ 380 k my realtor is only out $ 300 netting $ but $ 20 k lower sale price and i just lost nearly $ 19 k after commission is paid   the agent would have the natural goal of volume not extracting the last dollar from the buyer gaining back the last $ 20 k to the seller will cost the realtor far more than $ 300 in her time keeping the house on the market and waiting for the better offer   sellers might use down payment as one way to estimate the probability of the financing falling through but it 's a rough estimate at best because in the case of bank financing the bank needs the same time to run through the paperwork for a 3 down or a 20 down it 's just as easy for the buyer to qualify or not qualify for one loan or the other there are young couples with great incomes and no debt who blow away the required ratios for proposed debt to income but have n't saved up the otherwise huge 20 downpayment then there are those who have saved for years even having 30 to put down but their income is still not going to qualify them the offer will be contingent on the financing regardless it will show that you are putting $ xx dollars as a downpayment and the final transaction is contingent on your bank approving you

start by going onto and click through every publicly traded fortune 500 company click on all their charts and look through their graphs for any there will almost always be a pattern even if it is vague and fairly unpredictable then look for any jumps or drops in price look for the reason of the jump or drop it could range commonly from news lay off announcements acquisitions etc or just moving along with the market direction for the day looking at each stock is key because every stock has its own pattern trying to understand the market at a whole is quite impossible but when you narrow it down to just one stock it is much more doable for practice try most of my time on it during high school and create 10 100 accounts and use various techniques for each portfolio    just from that you will have much more practice than the majority of traders it is all very time consuming but if you truly try on it you will do better i have to market drop today good time to buy   i 'll answer more questions later

i would encourage you to read the warren buffett way   its a short read and available from most libraries as an audio book   it should address most of the ignorance that your post displays    short term prices offered in the market do not necessarily reflect the future value of a company   in the short term the market is a popularity contest in the long run prices increases based on the performance of the company   how much free cash flow and related metrics does the company generate   you seem way overly concerned with short term price fluctuations and as such you are more speculating expecting a 10 in 2 3 years is unrealistic   has it happened sure but it is a rare thing   most would be happy to have a 2 in that time frame if i was in your shoes i 'd buy the stock and watch it   provided management meet my expectations and made good business decisions i would hold it and add to my position as i was able and the market was willing to sell me the company at a good price    it is good to look at index funds as a diversification    assuming everything goes perfectly in 2 3 years you would have an extra 1 k dollars   big deal   how much money could you earn during that time period   simply by working at a fairly humble job you should be able to earn between 60 k and 90 k during that time   if you stuck 10 of that income into a savings account you would be far better off 6 k to 9 k then if this stock actually does double   hopefully that gets you thinking staring out is about earning and saving investing   start building funds that can compound   very early on the rate of return provided it is not negative is very unimportant   the key is to get money to compound

i would say that for the most part money should not be invested in the stock market or real estate   mostly this money should be kept in savings i feel like your emergency fund is light   you do not indicate what your expenses are per month but unless you can live off of 1k month that is pretty low   i would bump that to about 15 k but that really depends upon your expenses you may want to go higher when you consider your real estate investments   what happens if a water heater needs replacement   41 k left edit   as stated you could reduce your expenses in an emergency to   at the bare minimum your emergency fund should be   i 'd still be likely to have more as you do n't have any money in sinking funds or designated savings and the real estate leaves you a bit exposed   in your shoes i 'd have 12 k as a general emergency fund   another 5 k in a car fund i do n't mind driving a 5,000 car 5k in a real estate home repair fund and save about 400 per month for yearly insurance and tax costs   your first point is incorrect you do have debt in the form of a car lease   that car needs to be replaced and you might want to upgrade the other car   how much   perhaps spend 12 k on each and sell the existing car for 2 k   19 k left congratulations on attempting to bootstrap a software company   what kind of cash do you anticipate needing   how about keeping 10 k designated for that   9 k left assuming that medical school will run you about 50 k per year for 4 years how do you propose to pay for it   assuming that you put away 4 k per month for 24 months and have 9 k you will come up about 95 k short assuming some interests in your favor   the time frame is too short to invest it so you are stuck with crappy bank rates

after the initial public offering the company can raise money by selling more stock equity financing or selling debt e.g. borrowing money   if a company 's stock price is high they can raise money with equity financing on more favorable terms   when companies raise money with equity financing they create new shares and dilute the existing shareholders so the number of shares outstanding is not fixed companies can also return money to shareholders by buying their own equity and this is called a share repurchase   it 's best for companies to repurchase their shared when their stock price is low but american companies have a terrible track record of buying their own shares high and selling them low the management of a company typically likes a rising stock price so their stock options are more valuable and they can justify bigger pay packages

on monday the 27th of june 2011 the xiv etf a 10:1 share split the yahoo finance data correctly shows the historic price data adjusted for this split   the google finance data does not make the adjustment to the historical data so it looks like the prices on google finance prior to 27 june 2011 are being quoted at 10 times what they should be    coincidentally the underlying vix index saw a sudden surge on the friday 24 june and continued on the monday 27 june the date that the split took effect   this would have magnified the bearish moves seen in the historic price data on the xiv etf here is a link to an article detailing the confusion this particular share split caused amongst investors   it appears that google finance was not the only one to it up   some brokers failed to adjust their data causing a lots of confusion amongst clients with xiv holdings at the time this is a recurring problem on google finance where the historic price data often though not always fails to account for share splits

as a landlord for 14 years with 10 properties i can give a few pointers be able and skilled enough to perform the majority of maintenance because this is your biggest expense otherwise   it will shock you how much maintenance rental units require do n't invest in real estate where the locality state favors the tenant e.g. new york city in disputes   a great state is florida where you can have someone evicted very quickly require a minimum credit score of 620 for all tenants over 21   this seems to be the magic number that keeps most of the nightmare tenants out makes sure they have a job nearby that pays at least three times their annual rent every renewal adjust your tenant 's rent to be approximately 5 less than going rates in your area   use zillow as a guide   keeping just below market rates keeps tenants from moving to cheaper options do not rent to anyone under 30 and single   trust me trust me trust me   you ca n't legally do this officially but do it while offering another acceptable reason for rejection there 's always something you could say that 's legitimate bad credit or chose another tenant etc charge a 5 late fee starting 10 days after the rent is due   20 days late file for eviction to let the tenant know you mean business do n't sink yourself too much in debt put enough money down so that you start profitable   i made the mistake of burying myself and i have n't barely been able to breathe for the entire 14 years   it 's just now finally coming into profitability do n't get adjustable rate or balloon loans under any circumstances   fixed 30 only   you can pay it down in 20 years and get the same benefits as if you got a fixed 20 but you will want the option of paying less some months so get the 30 and treat it like a 20 do n't even try to find your own tenants   use a realtor and take the 10 cost hit   they actually save you money because they can show your place to a lot more prospective tenants and it will be rented much sooner   empty place = empty wallet   also block out the part of the realtor 's agreement to lease where it states they keep getting the 10 every year thereafter   most realtors will go along with this just to get the first year but if they do n't find another realtor buy all in the same community if you can then you can use the same vendor list the same lease agreement the same realtor the same documentation spreadsheets etc   much much easier to have everything a clone   they say do n't put all your eggs in one basket but the reality is running a bunch of properties is a lot of work and the more similar they are the more you can duplicate your work for free   that 's worth a lot more day to day than the remote chance your entire community goes up in flames

1 in most cases the difference between filing joint or married filing single is close to zero when there is a difference you 're better off filing joint   2 the way the w4 works is based on how many allowances you claim unfortunately even in the day of computers it does not allow for a simple well my deduction are $ xxx do n't tax that money each allowance is equal to one exemption same as you get for being you same as the wife gets same as each kid 3 people x $ 3800 = $ you are telling the employer to take off the top before calculating your tax she does this by using circular e and is able to calculate your tax as you request if one is in the 15 bracket one more exemption changes the tax withheld by $ 570 so if you were going to owe $ 400 in april one few exemption will have you overpay $ 170 i.e. in this 15 bracket each exemption changes annual withholding by that $ 570   for most people running the w4 numbers will get them very close and only if they are getting back or owing over $ 500 will they even think of adjusting   3 my recently published last minute tax moves offers a number of interesting ideas to address this the concept of grouping deductions in odd years is worth noting   4 i 'm not sure what this means 2 accounts each worth $ 5000 should grow at the same rate if invested the same the time it makes sense to load one person 's account first is if they have better matching you say you are not sure what percent your wife 's company matches you need to change this for both of your retirement plans you need to know every detail exact way to maximize matching expense ratios for the investments you choose any other fees etc knowledge is power and all that in what is an appropriate level of 401k fees or expenses in a typical plan i go on to preach about how fees can wipe out any tax benefit over time for any new investor my first warning is always to understand what you are getting into if you ca n't explain it to a friend you should n't be in it   edit you first need to understand what choices are within the accounts the 4 and 6 are in hindsight right these are not fixed returns you should look at the choices and more heavily fund the account with the better selection deposit to her account at least to grab the match   as far as the longer term goals see how the house purchase goes life has a way of sending you two kids and forcing you to tighten the budget you may have other ideas in three years i have no p2p lending experience by the way   last many advise that separate finances are a bad path for a couple it depends jane and i have separate check books and every paycheck just keep enough to write small checks without worry most of the money goes to the house account whatever works for you is what you should do we 've been happily married for most of the 17 years we 've been married

unless you are buying a significant value of your goods in usd then the relative strength of usd versus your local currency will have little to no effect on what the value of your investments is worth to you in fact only will effect your purchasing power if your investments are in your local currency and your future expenses usage of the returns on the investments will be in your local currency fx has no effect to answer your question however since all investments involve flows of money there can be no investment other than perhaps gold which is really a form of currency that is n't bound to at least one currency in general investments are expected to be valued against the investor 's home currency i tend to call it fund currency as i work with hedge funds as the return on the investment will be paid out in the fund currency and returns will be compared on the same basis if investments are to be made internationally then it is necessary to reduce or hedge the exchange rate risk this is normally done using fx swaps or futures that allow an exchange rate in the future to be locked in today far from being from fx moves these derivatives are closely bound to any moves but are bound in the opposite direction to the hoped for fx move an example of this would be if i 'm investing my local currency in a us company xyz corp which i expect to do well suppose i get for my and so buy 1 shares in xyz no matter what happens to xyz stock any move in gbp usd will affect my p&l so i buy a future that allows me to exchange for in 6 month 's time if gbp rises i can sell the future and make money on both the higher exchange rate and the increase in xyz corp if gbp falls i can keep the future until maturity and exchange the from xyz corp for so i only take the foreign exchange hit on any profits if i expect my profits to be i can even buy futures such that i can lock in the exchange rate for in 6 months so that i will lose even less of my profit from the exchange rate move

i had a 2000 chevy until late 2011 it worked well but was very definitely at the end of its life this was a low end car certainly but i dispute your claim that cars last 20 25 years consumer reports apparently says the average life expectancy of a new vehicle is around 8 years or 150,000 miles when it came time to replace my i was significantly concerned about car safety and about the ability to handle canadian winters temperatures lots of snow i chose a subaru forester as a good match for me i could have bought one second hand but i was n't willing to get one as old as five years car manufacturers constantly improve safety and features over that time period the forester is massively more capable of handling canadian winters than the was if i was buying a forester now i 'd want the driver assist system which subaru added a couple of years after my model year the newer models score slightly higher in crash tests too that would limit me to 2014 or later models and i 'd be concerned someone selling a 2014 or 2015 knew something i did n't knew they had purchased a lemon i did n't need financing for my vehicle on the other hand i could have invested the money i saved so if all i wanted was something to get me from point a to point b my choice does not make much financial sense but canadian winters are brutal and car safety is massively important to me i 'm well aware that i paid considerably for this and i 'm comfortable with my decision

the basic problem here is that you need to have money to invest before you can make a profit from it   now if you have say $ 500 k or more you can put that in mutual funds and live modestly off the profits   if you do n't have that $ 500 k to start out with you 're either looking at a long time frame to accumulate it say by working a job for 30 + years and contributing the max to your 401k or are playing the market trying to get it   the last is essentially gambling though with somewhat better odds than casinos or horse racing and puts you up against the gambler 's ruin problem you also i think have a very mistaken idea about the a typical investor 's lifestyle   take for instance the best known one warren buffet   no offence to him but from everything i 've read he lives a pretty boring life   spends all day reading financial reports and what sort of life is that as for flying places being exciting ever tried it   i have with scientific conferences but i expect are much the same and it is boring   flying at 30,000 ft is boring and if it 's a commercial flight unpleasant as well   a conference room in london paris or is exactly the same as a conference room in iowa   even the cities outside the conference rooms are much of a these days you can eat at mcdonalds in paris or shanghai   only way to find interest is to take time from your work to get outside the conference rooms commercial districts and then you 're losing money

i think he makes a little mistake here   gt and so we might see that there has been this tendency for our psychology and our humanity to be less and less innovative at a time when in fact we may need to be more and more innovative if we 're going to be able to survive the vast numbers of people on this earth   in the first part of the sentence he is talking about our per capita rate of innovation i.e. we as individuals do n't have to be as innovative to benefit as much as we used to because we have more access to innovative ideas and hence can get that benefit from better copying   in the latter part of the sentence the need to be more and more innovative he 's talking about the cumulative innovation not per capita the argument contradicts itself because the reason we can be individually less innovative is because we can produce the same or greater cumulative innovation by aggregating fewer local innovations over more people   this is how idea evolution i.e. works as opposed to material wealth say for instance we all contribute a little to gdp if there are more people contributing gdp will grow but we each can only access our little portion of it so gdp per capita really tells a better story   ideas do n't work like that if we aggregate everyone 's useful innovations into an innovation gdp we all share the full cumulative gdp it does n't get divided such the we can only access a small portion of the idea hence less per capita contribution can still produce more innovation value so in the latter sense we are becoming more innovative on aggregate   he also seems to miss the important factor of efficiency we have evolved means to make selection of good ideas more efficient via for instance the scientific method hence with the same or less innovation at the hypothesis level we can produce more useful idea output with less effort trial and error   he has some good discussion points but i think he 's missed a few key parts of the math

you have a few options none of which are trade off free apply for a credit card and live off of that    here of course you will go into debt and there are minimums to pay   but it will tide you over   in any case you are getting unsecured credit so your rates will probably be very very high   you do n't want to build up a lot of 20 per annum debt an alternative to this would be to go to any bank and ask for an unsecured loan   having no income it will be difficult though not necessarily impossible to secure some funds   when i was in between houses once for example i was able to borrow $ 30,000 in unsecured debt to help me construct my new house just based on my income   grant you i paid it 2 months later in order to avoid the 10 year interest but the point is that unsecured debt does exist   credit cards are easier to get   arrange for personal financing through your parents or other relatives if your parents can send you remittances the terms will most likely be more generous   they know your credit and your true ability to repay   just because they send you money does n't mean you have to live with them   as a parent i have a stake in ensuring my children 's success   if i think that them over briefly is in their best interest and mine you better be sure i 'll do it a variation on this is something like kiva   here if you can write up a story compelling enough to get finance there are people who might lend you money   kiva is normally directed towards poorer countries and but local variations exist update google backed is far more appropriate to this situation than kiva   same general idea but that 's the vendor find freelance contract or light employment your concern about employment is justified you do n't want to be in a position where you are unable to travel to an interview because starbucks or mcdonalds will fire you if you do n't show up for a shift   then again do you really care if mcdonald 's lets you go   as such you need to find income that is less bound by schedule   freelance work in particular will give you that freedom assuming you have a skill you can trade   likewise short term contract work is equally flexible usually   finally it may be easiest just to get temporary pickup work in a service capacity   in any event doing something will be better than doing nothing   who knows you might want to be a manager owner of a mcdonalds some day   would n't hurt to say i started at the bottom

in short yes by forward selling you enter into a futures contract by which you agree to trade euros for dollars us or singapore at a set rate agreed to by both parties at some future time you are basically making a bet you think that the dollar will gain on the euro and thus you 'd pay a higher rate on the spot than you 've locked in with the future the other party to the contract is betting against you he thinks the dollar will weaken and so the dollars he 'll sell you will be worth less than the euros he gets for them at the agreed rate now in a traditional futures contract you are obligated to execute it whether it ends up good or bad for you you can to avoid this buy an option by buying the option you pay the other party to the deal for the right to say no thanks that way if the dollar weakens and you 'd rather pay spot price at time of delivery you simply let the contract expire un executed the tradeoff is that options cost money up front which is now sunk whether you exercise the option or not the other party gets the option price that basically creates a point spread you win if the dollar appreciates against the euro enough that you still save money even after buying the option or if the dollar depreciates against the euro enough that again you still save money after subtracting the option price while you lose if the exchange rates are close enough to what was agreed on that it cost you more to buy the option than you gained by being able to choose to use it

i do n't see a way out of this that does n't involve economic upheaval on a scale that would make 2008 look like boom times   economic upheaval could also be considered economic re formation and re organization   the danger lies in the political sphere that the problems inherent in any such even will create a mob that makes demands which inevitably result in strong man rule i.e. a full blown dictator   americans themselves that we have never had this in the past when in fact we have several times most notably fdr we just retained the forms of a democracy and the labels of a republic and then we got very lucky that the dictator died when he did and power transitioned to someone who was a token place holder and not party to his grand scheme and so unwound the whole thing   iow we may be headed over a proverbial cliff but that does n't necessarily mean that it will be an apocalyptic affair just that it will be tough to weather and get through though the agile will still manage and there is potential hope for the other side however minimal

a 529 plan is set up in a specific beneficiary 's name but the money can be rolled over or transferred into another 529 plan in the same beneficiary 's name or the beneficiary can be changed by the owner of the account   i mistakenly believed that the new beneficiary could be anyone else but as mhoran_psprep has   pointed out in the comment below the new beneficiary must be related to   the previous one in specific ways as detailed in publication 970 2011 tax benefits for education in order for the change to occur without any tax consequences   so my original statement that distributions can be used for anyone 's educational expense without tax consequences was incorrect if the new beneficiary is not related to the original beneficiary tax consequences will indeed occur   note also that unlike iras where the entire amount can be withdrawn by the owner without incurring a 10 penalty after a certain period or after reaching a certain age distributions from a 529 plan for nonqualified expenses including as a special case a withdrawal of funds by the owner will incur the 10 penalty tax regardless of when this occurs the problem with ugma accounts is that you have to turn the money over to the beneficiary when that beneficiary becomes an adult 18 years old in most cases regardless of your current opinion of that beneficiary and the beneficiary is free to use the money to buy a motorcycle with it if she chooses instead of using it for her education   in this sense i agree with mhoran_psprep 's answer that it is best to put away the money in an ordinary account without seeking tax benefits and deal with the matter as you see fit when the niece is filling out her college paperwork

first you need to understand how modern insurance companies operate on the front end they write contracts with customers collecting up front premiums and promising to pay out to cover future losses efficient premiums cover exactly what 's paid out if you charge too much customers leave for competition and if you charge too little the company goes under or at least loses money large armies of people are employed to accurately guess future risks hopefully to the point of certainty you have in human mortality   so over time they will pay back those premiums and there 's a constant stream of new premiums coming in to replace money going out so there 's this effective pool of money they can use to buffer against large losses with it 's called float and when the pool of money remains relatively constant they can invest it longer term than the people who comprise the underlying risk large insurance companies like berkshire hathaway function in this manner it 's where warren buffet finds capital to invest while hiding from wall st in nebraska the way these companies profit is by making sure the equation works   profits = premiums payouts + return on float payouts could be just payments for insured risk but they could also be for the whole life insurance you 're running across from time to time these contracts offer the insured the chance to invest their money with the people who invest the float and as long as the return on float is greater than the return they 're offering it 's still profitable for the company since this guarantees suboptimal returns for you it 's usually a good idea to buy term insurance much cheaper and invest the difference yourself

yep there just is no free lunch   so called high dividend stocks are usually from companies that have stable cash flows but relatively little or moderate growth potential utility companies come to mind let 's take telecommunications as an example   such stocks usually indeed are considered more conservative in a bull market they wo n't make high jumps and in a bear market they should n't experience deep falls i mean just because the stock market fell by 10 you 're not going to stop using your phone the stock might suffer a bit but the divided is still yielding you the same however fundamental data can have a significant impact let 's say a recession hits the country of the people might not get the newest iphone and lock in to an expensive contract anymore they might use cheaper forms of communication they might stop paying bills go bankrupt etc this will have a severe impact on the company 's cash flow and thus hit the stock in a double whammy one the dividend is gone two the price will fall even further   there are basically two scenarios after that either the recession is temporary and your stock became a regular growth stock that at some point might bounce back and re establish at the previous levels or the economy has contracted permanently but regained stability in which case you will again have a stock with a high dividend yield but based on a lower price in conclusion high dividend stocks make sense in a portfolio but never consider their income to be safe reduce your risk by diversifying

because my accountant said i 'm in the 28 bracket and need more write offs when i hear someone say this i tell them to get a new accountant advisor tax guy   the benefit if any is the fact that if and only if a hat tip to you are already itemizing your deductions   it means that for me my 3.5 mortgage is really costing me   the only effect of this is the when i line up my debts the mortgage might fall to a lower priority for payback this is where there 's a balance between the choice of a robust emergency fund earning close to 0 today or using those funds to pay the mortgage at an accelerated rate   if the sentiment expressed by the question implies that one should carry a mortgage needed or not it really comes down the a question of risk over the long term i do n't suggest that people take a mortgage today to invest in the market a zero return as we just saw in the will show you that the 10 market return is an average over the very long term fwiw the period returned and 2 years short of the 10 few have the discipline to patiently wait out the dips and see the returns i quoted   that said the fact that the interest is deductible is a small factor given the low rates we are currently enjoying   each of the points above can be expanded into its own answer a great question with not so simple answers

you are correct a possible dead cat bounce is forming on the stock markets if it does form it will mean that prices have not reached their bottom as this pattern is a bearish continuation pattern for a dead cat bounce to form prices will need to break through support formed by the lows last week if prices bounce off the support and go back up it could become a double bottom pattern which is a reversal pattern the double bottom would be confirmed if prices break above the recent high a couple of days ago regarding the psychology of the dead cat bounce pattern is that after a distinct and quick reversal of prices from recent highs you have 2 groups of market participants who create demand in the market firstly you have those who were short covering their short positions to take profits and secondly you have those who are looking for a bargain buying at what they think is the low so for a few days you have the bulls taking over the bears   then as more less positive news comes in the bears hit the market again these are more participants opening short positions but more so those who missed out in selling previously because prices fell too quickly seeing another opportunity to sell at a better price so the bears take over again   unless there is very good news around the corner it is likely that the bears will stay in control and prices will fall further how to trade a dead cat bounce assuming you have been stopped out of your long already if you are aggressive you can go short as prices start reversing from the top of the bounce with your stop loss just above the top of the bounce if you are more conservative you would place your entry for a short position just below the support at the start of the bounce with your stop above the top of the bounce you could also place an order for a long position above the top of the bounce if a double bottom a one cancels the other oco would be an appropriate order for such a situation

if you 've got the money to pay off your credit cards do it today if possible there is no need to pay another penny of interest to them   they may or may not cancel your cards that is up to them we ca n't know what will trigger an individual bank to cancel your card the answers you got on your other question offer some speculation on why some banks might cancel but this is not something banks reveal anything you do on your own to try to keep the cards open is just a guess and may or may not succeed   but ask yourself why do you want to keep these cards   is it for the convenience of the card i agree that credit cards paid in full monthly are convenient but when they start costing you money they are n't worth it anymore in my opinion debit cards have most of the same conveniences of credit cards and are free   if it is for emergencies i recommend instead building up an emergency cash fund that way if an emergency arises you wo n't be forced to borrow money at high credit card interest rates   if the reason you want to hang on to the credit card is so you can spend more than you have then you will find yourself in the same situation again if i were you i would pay off the cards asap if the banks cancel your cards just switch to a debit card and be thankful that you are no longer continuously leaking money to the banks

i would look at it as more of a balance in general assuming you have the ability to contribute pre or post tax money and you expect your retirement tax rate to be about the same pre tax money gives you flexibility of withdrawal during retirement say one year you have unusually high expenses you can pull money from your taxed accounts until you hit the top of your target tax bracket and then pull the rest out of already taxed accounts note that if you have the same tax rate today as when you retire the traditional account will net you slightly more money but not a huge amount

if you sold the stock for a profit you will owe tax on that profit whether it is taxed as short term or long term capital gains depends on how long you held the stock before selling it presumably you 're going to invest this money into mutual funds or something of that sort those may pay dividends which can be reinvested and will grow in value you hope just as the individual stock shares would you hope assuming the advice you 've been given is at all reasonable there 's no need for buyer 's remorse here you 're just changing your investing style to a different point on the risk versus return curve if you have to ask this question i tend to agree that you should do more homework before playing with shares in individual companies unless you 're getting shares at employee discount in which case you should still seriously consider selling them fairly quickly and reinvesting the money in a more structured manner in a very real sense your job is itself an investment in your employer if they ever get into trouble you do n't want that to hit both your income and investments

this might vary from other answers but i generally prefer to use debt before touching an emergency fund   but one of the reasons i have an emergency fund is to that i can make sure i can cover any debt payments   essentially this give you leverage   you might start off with a small emergency such as needing a new refrigerator   if you pull the cash out of the fund to pay this off immediately you 've depleted your account and if something major comes along you might be short   by using debt you can often cover the costs with cash flow and leave your risk buffer in place often retailers will offer really sweet financing deals   0 for 12 months or whatever   often though if you do n't pay it off in time they can be costly   i 'm not sure if this is legal in the us anymore but if it was n't fully paid off in time you 'd be retroactively charged interest on the whole amount   but if you have an emergency fund you pretty much guarantee that wo n't happen   the only time it will is if something else happens that requires the emergency fund to be cashed in   but if things are that dire the debt is unsecured   you 're credit may suffer but they ca n't come after your assets it 's not an either or situation   you give yourself options by having the cash available   it allows you to take advantage of opportunities that might be too risky otherwise   ultimately what you want to be able to weather the storm in a situation where you have say a mortgage on a house that is underwater the stock market is down and you have no income   in that situation you do n't want to liquidate your stock when it 's down and you probably do n't want to lose your home equity in a foreclosure

risk is the problem as others have pointed out your fixed mortgage interest rate is for a set period of time only let 's say your 3 might be good for five years because that 's typical of fixed rate in canada so what happens in five years if your investment has dropped 50 due to a prolonged bear market and interest rates have since moved up from 3 to 8 your investment would be underwater and you would n't have enough to pay off the loan and exit the failed strategy rather you might just be stuck with renewing the mortage at a rate that makes the strategy far less attractive being more likely to lose money in the long run than to earn any leverage or borrowing to invest amplifies your risk considerably if you invest your own money in the market you might lose what you started with but if you borrow to invest you might lose much more than you started with there 's also one very specific issue with the example investment you 've proposed you would be borrowing canadian dollars but investing in an index fund of u.s based companies that trade in u.s. dollars even if the index has positive returns in u.s. dollar terms you might end up losing money if the canadian dollar strengthens vs. the u.s. dollar it has happened before multiple times so while this strategy has worked wonderfully in the past it has also failed in the past unless you have a crystal ball you need to be aware of the various risks and weigh them vs. the potential rewards there is no free lunch

depending on the student loan this may be improper usage of the funds   i know the federal loans i received years ago were to be used for education related expenses only   i would imagine most if not all student loans would have the same restrictions bonus answer you must have earned income to contribute to an ira e.g. money received from working see irs publication 590 for details   so if your earmarked money is coming from savings only then you would not be eligible to contribute   as far as whether you can designate student loans for the educational expenses and then used earned income for an ira i would imagine that is fine   however i have not found any documentation to support my assumption

you can rollover money from a 401(k to traditional ira and back to a 401(k there are likely account closure fees associated with this so it 's not completely free as long as you 're rolling from one tax deferred account to another there are no penalties the irs has a handy chart showing what accounts can roll where note starting next year you can only do one ira rollover per year the irs has additional general information on retirement account rollovers one additional comment on the concept of your money being locked into an ira generally you have far more options with an ira than a 401(k if you go with a large low cost provider like vanguard you 're likely to be much better off than in a small company 401(k that only offers costly funds that are likely selected primarily to benefit the administrator of the plan choose your ira provider and the investments with them wisely and leave that money there for a very long time

on average you should be saving at least 10 15 of your income in order to be financially secure when you retire   different people will tell you different things but really this can be split between short term savings cash long term savings 401ks iras stocks bonds and paying down debt that $ 5k is a good start on an emergency fund but you probably want a little more   as justkt said 6 months worth is what you want to aim for   put this in a money market account where you 'll earn a little more interest but wo n't be penalized from withdrawing it when its needed you may have to live off it after all beyond that i would split things up if possible have payroll deductions going to a broker sharebuilder is a good one to start with if you ca n't spare much change as well as an ira at a bank set up a separate checking account just for rent and utilities put a month 's worth of cash in there and have another payroll deduction that covers your living expenses + maybe 5 put in there automatically   then set up automatic bill payments so you do n't even have to think about it   check it once a month to make sure there are n't any surprises pay off your credit cards every month   these are by far the most expensive forms of credit that most people have   you should n't be financing large purchases with them you 'll get better rates by taking a personal loan from a bank set specific goals for savings and set up automatic payroll deductions to work towards them   especially for buying a house most responsible lenders will ask for 20 down   in today 's market that means you need to write a check for $ 40k or $ 50k   while it 's tempting to finance up to 100 of the property value it 's also risky considering how volatile markets can be   you do n't want to end up owing more on the property than it 's worth two years down the road if you find yourself at the end of the month with an extra $ 50 or so consider your savings goals or your current debt instead of blowing it on a toy   especially if you have long term debt high balance credit cards vehicle or property loans applying that money directly to principal can save you months or years paying it back and hundreds or thousands of dollars of interest all depending on the details of the loan of course above all have fun with it   think of your personal net worth as you do your gamer score on the xbox and look for ways to maximize it with a minimum of effort or investment on your part   investing in yourself and your future can be incredibly rewarding emotionally

arbitrage is basically taking advantage of a difference in price   generally extending to in different places for the same thing a monetary version would be stocks that is stocks in companies that are on both the nyse nasdaq and toronto stock exchanges   if somebody comes along and buys a large number of shares in toronto that will tend to make the price go up standard supply and demand but if someone else can buy shares instead in ny and then sell them in toronto where the first person is buying up shares where the price is higher they the the second person can make pretty easy money by its very nature this tends to bring the prices back in line as ny will then go up and toronto will then go down ignoring fx rates and the like for ease of explanation the same can work for physical goods although it does tend to get more complex with taxes duties and the like

there 's nothing particularly special about a two million dollar cheque while they are n't commonplace the bank certainly has experience with them many atms wo n't allow a deposit of that size but the bank cashiers will certainly accept them they will typically get a supervisor to sign off on the deposit and may ask about the source of the money for fraud prevention reasons they may be held for longer than a smaller cheque if the bank manager chooses to do so if there 's nothing remotely suspicious for example it is a cheque from an insurance company for an expected payout you should expect it will clear in about a week on the other hand if it is a cheque from a bank in another country and the bank manager has any reason to suspect it may not be legitimate they may hold it for a month or more even then you are not guaranteed the cheque was legitimate this is used in a common scam

i concur with the other answers about not mixing family and money the one whose loans are paid off second will be taking the credit risk of the other not paying being able to pay there may also be tax implications that said if you do still want to do this i think there 's a fairly straightforward way to account for the payments with your scenario your brother should make you a personal loan at some interest rate 5 and 10 that loan would be tracked independently of the actual student loans any money that your brother transfers to you to pay off your loans add to that personal loan and later on once your loans are paid off you start repaying the loan to him and he uses the proceeds for his own loans the interest rate will determine how the benefit of paying off the 10 loans is shared if the rate is set at 10 then your brother will get all the benefit if 5 you will get all the benefit and 7.5 would roughly share it out this means that you can still manage your own student loans separately your brother can choose how little or much to commit to the snowball rather than his own loans of course he should first make the minimum payments on his own loans anything he does loan you benefits you both if we ignore the credit and tax issues he gets more than the 5 interest on his own loans and you pay less than the 10 interest on your loans you 'll need to track the payments each way on this personal loan and apply interest to it every so often i 'd suggest monthly beware that the monthly equivalent of 5 annual interest is not because of compounding

good question there are plenty of investors who think they can simply rely on intuition and although luck is always present it is not enough to construct a proper portfolio first of all there are two basic types of portfolio management passive and active the majority of abnormal gains are made with active portfolio management although passive managers are less likely to suffer loses   both types must be created with some kind of qualitative and quantitative research but an active portfolio requires constant adjustments market timing to preserve the desired levels of risk and return   the topic is extremely broad and every manager has his own preferred methods of quantitative analysis i will try to list here some most common in my opinion ways of stock picking and portfolio management 's criterion the best portfolio is that with the lowest probability that the return will be below a specified level   this is achieved by maximising the number of standard deviations between the return on the portfolio and minimum specified level max k = rp where rp return on portfolio rl specified minimum return sp standard deviation of portfolio return 's criterion maximise the minimum return rl subject to constraint that the chance of a return below rl is less than or equal to a specified value a maximise rl subject to prob rp < rl = < a for example assume that the specified value is 20 this will be met provided rl is at least standard deviations below rp therefore the best portfolio is the one that rl where rl = 's criterion maximise expected return subject to the constraint that the chance of a return below the specified minimum is less than or equal to some specified minimum a maximise rp subject to prob rp < rl = < a assuming same data as previously   rl = < and select the portfolio with highest expected return security selection now let 's look at some methods of security selection this is important when a manager believes some shares are mispriced the required return on security i is given by ri = where rf is a risk free rate return on the market bi security 's beta the difference between the required return and the actual return expected is known as the security 's alpha ai ai = rai ri where rai is actual return on security i stock picking one way of stock picking is to select portfolios of securities with positive alpha of a portfolio is simply the weighted average of the of the securities in the portfolio ap = where is sigma sorry for such weird typing have n't figured out yet how to type proper looking formulas n share of security in portfolio so another way of stock picking is ranking securities by their excess return to beta erb erb = ri the greater the erb the more desirable the security and the greater the proportion it will make up of the portfolio thus portfolios produced by this technique will have greater proportion of some securities than the market portfolio and lower proportions of other securities   the number of securities depends on a cut off rate c for the erb defined so that all securities with erb > c are included in portfolio while if erb   the cut off rate for a portfolio containing the first j securities is given by i 'm inserting an image cut from word below   here comes the tricky part basically what you do is first calculate erb for each security then calculate cj for each security mix gradually adding new securities one by one and cj each time then you select an optimum portfolio by comparing cj of each mix to erb 's of it 's securities let me show you a simple example say you have securities a b c and d you calculated erb 's also you calculated then you check erb(a),erb(b),erb(c are greater than c(a but c(a only contains security a so c(a is not an optimum mix erb(a),erb(b),erb(c are greater than but only contains securities a and b erb(a),erb(b),erb(c are greater than and contains a b and c so it is an optimum is lower than so is not an optimum portfolio finally the most important part below is a formula to find the share of each security in the portfolio   here you simply plug in already obtained values for each security to find it 's proportion in your portfolio i hope this somehow answers your question however there is a lot more than this to consider if you decide to manage your portfolio yourself some of the most important areas are   market timing hedging stocks vs bonds   good luck with your investments and remember the safest portfolio is the one that replicates the global market   the cut off rate for a portfolio containing the first j securities is given by i 'm

i 'll be happy to edit when you provide answers to the question i posed in the comments   given the choice and i assume there is no other i 'd take a loan from the 401(k vs a withdrawal   you withdraw $ i 'll assume 25 bracket as you 're planning at least a $ 200 k house hopefully your taxable income is above $ 38 k the 25 line for singles the tax and penalty is 35 total federal you net $ and you have $ 40 k less in the retirement account in 40 years at 10 average growth that 's $ 1.8 m you wo n't have in your 401(k and as littleadv stated no deposits for 6 months meaning no matching there 's a few more thousand you 'll lose   you borrow $ 20k. your 401(k will see a return on the $ 20k that 's better than the short bond account 4 5 vs less than 1 you are short $ 6 k but in return have paid no tax no penalty etc i respect those who are strongly anti loan but even they would agree this is the far lesser of 2 evils    the above is pretty generic there are better choices but your cpa friend 's advice is nearly as bad as it gets by the way the tax you 'll save once you have the mortgage has nothing to do with that 10 penalty say you bought the house with cash as many would be happy to do you 'd pay the penalty for the 401(k withdrawal but have no mortgage deduction if you had the 20 you still have a loan and the deduction but no penalty for taking his bad advice   my advice is to take that refund and use it to pay the loan faster

setting up an entity that is partially foreign owned is not that difficult it takes an additional 1 1.5 months in total and in this particular case you guys would be formed as a joint venture it will cost a bit more about 3 5000 if you 're serious about owning a part of a business in china you should carefully examine what he means by more complicated from my point of view i have set up my own in china and examined the possibilities of a and even considered using a friend to set up the company under their personal name as a domestic company which is what your supervisor is doing any difference between the three are not really a big deal anymore and comes down to the competency of the agencies you are using and the business partner themselves    it cost me 11,000 for a including the agency and government registration fees only chinese speaking   you should also consider the other shareholders who may be part of this venture as well if there are other shareholders and you are not providing further tangible contribution you will end up replaced and unless of course you trust them too because they are actually paying money to be part of the business and you are not they will not part with equity for you   i 'm not a lawyer but think you should not rely on any promises other than what it says on a company registration paper good luck

there 's an odd anomaly that often occurs with shares acquired through company plans via espp or option purchase the general situation is that the share value above strike price or grant price may become ordinary income but a sale below the price at day the shares are valued is a capital loss   e.g. in an espp offering i have a $ 10 purchase price but at the end of the offering the shares are valued at $ 100 unless i hold the shares for an additional year the sale price contains ordinary w2 income so if i see the shares falling and sell for $ 50 i have a tax bill for $ 90 of w2 income but a $ 50 capital loss tax is due on $ 90 and for 1 k shares $ 90,000 which can be a $ 30 k hit but that $ 50 k loss can only be applied to cap gains or $ 3k yr of income   in the dotcom bubble there were many people who had million dollar tax bills and the value of the money netted from the sale could n't even cover the taxes and $ 1 m in losses would take 300 years at $ 3k yr   the above is one reason the lockup date expiration is why shares get sold and one can probably profit on the bigger companies stock   edit see yelp down 3 following expiration of 180 day ipo lock up period for similar situation

from the etoro website in the financial trading industry rollover is the interest paid or earned for holding currency overnight each currency has an interest rate associated with it and because currencies are traded in pairs every trade involves two different interest rates if the interest rate on the currency you bought is lower than the interest rate on the currency you sold then you will pay rollover fees if the interest rate on the currency you bought is higher than the interest rate of the currency commodity you sold then you will earn rollover fees

first utilize a security screener to identify the security profiles you are looking to identify for identifying your target securities for shorting   most online brokers have stock screeners that you can utilize    at this point you may want to look at your target list of securities to find out those that are eligible for shorting the sho list is also a good place to look for securities that are hard to borrow to eliminate potential target securities   also your broker can let you know the stocks that are available for borrowing   you can then take your target securities and then you can look at the corporate filings on the sec 's edgar site to look for the key words you are looking for i would suggest that you utilize xbrl so you can electronically run your key word searched in an automated manner    i would further suggest that you can run the key word xbrl daily for issuer filings of your target list of securities   additional word searches you may want to consider are those that could indicate a dilution of the companies stock such as the issuance of convertible debt   also the below link detailing real short interest may be helpful   clearing firms are required to report short interest every two weeks

good news it will be enough if you make the most important decision after retirement that is the decision to live within your means with $ 220,000 per year in 2015 resources will you live in the same size home in the same location as you do now or will you downsize a bit and move to a town with more reasonably priced homes and lower taxes apply the same thinking to all of your expenses in my opinion making the decision to live within your means is the biggest decision you can make going into retirement

typically in a developed developing economy if there is high overall inflation then it means everything will rise including property real estate the cost of funds is low too much money chasing too few goods causes inflation which means more companies borrow money cheaply and more business and hence the stock market should also go up    so if you are looking at a situation where industry is doing badly and the inflation is high then it means there are larger issues the best bet would be gold and parking the funds into other currency

is the mortgage debt too high the rental property is in a hot re market so could be easily sold with significant equity however they would prefer to keep it given the current income there is no stress however in absence of any other liquid cash near cash assets having everything locked into mortgage is quite high even if real estate builds assets these are highly illiquid investments have debt on such investments is risky if there are no other investments essentially everything looks fine now but if there is an crisis unwinding mortgage debt is time consuming and if it forces distress sale it would wipe out any gains can they afford another mortgage and in what amount e.g. they are considering $ 50 k for a small cabin which could be rented out i guess they can but should they or diversify into other assets like stocks etc other than setting cash aside what would be some good uses of funds to make sure the money would appreciate and outpace inflation and add a nice bonus to retirement mutual funds stocks 401 k or other such retirement plans they are currently in 's if there is one key strategy or decision they could make today that would help them retire early say 's what should it be this opinion based it depends on what their lifestyle is and what would they want their lifestyle to be when they retire they should look at saving enough corpus that would give an year on year yield equivalent to the retirement expenses

thanks /u great information do you have any terms   or on investopedia or can recommend i search for how much debt is ideal to take on for a start up   i 'd like to learn more instead of getting you to do my homework if that makes sense   my simulation is similar to we 've made two strategic decisions 1 we went capital intensive in the first year to build up factory capacity year 1 we have very little r&amp;d but year 2 we plan to increase r&amp;d budget    since it is a capital intensive year should that capital expenditure be funded by debt entirely and i leave equity alone i noticed this drives down my wacc but i see a decrease in npv because of increased interest payments also does it make sense to increase the debt to pay for r&amp;d as well the way i see it paying for the manufacturing plant on debt is n't bad because you get an asset out of it at the end but paying for a r&amp;d program seems foolish because in this simulation there 's a chance your r&amp;d program fails and does not provide results so we would   see no return on the debt in that case    thanks again

it is called credit card installments or equal pay installments and i am not aware of them being widely used in the usa while in other countries they are supported by banks directly right in us you may find this option only in some big stores like home improvement stores car dealerships cell phone operators so that you can buy a new phone etc some stores allow 0 financing for say 12 months which is not exactly the same as installments but close if you have discipline to pay $ 250 each month and not wait for 12 months to end splitting the big payment in parts means that the seller gets money in parts as well and it adds risks of customer default introduces debt collection possibility etc that 's why it 's usually up to the merchants to support it bank does not care in this case from the bank point of view the store just charges the same card another $ 250 every month in other countries banks support this option directly i think taking over or dividing the risk with the merchants this has not happened in us there is a company which installments if stores want to support it but again it means stores need to agree to it here is a simple article describing how credit cards work in general if you move to us you are unlikely to be able to get a regular credit card because you will not have any credit history which is a system designed to track each customer ability to get pay off debt the easiest way to build the history request secured credit card which means you have to give the bank money up front and then they will give you a credit card with a credit limit equal to that amount it 's like a practice credit card you use it for 6 12 months and the bank will report your usage to credit bureaus establishing your credit score after that you should be able to get your money back and convert your secured card into a regular credit card credit history can be also built by paying rent and utilities but that requires companies who collect money to report the payments to credit bureaus and very few do that as anything else in us there are some businesses which help to solve this problem for extra money

mutual funds generally have a minimum amount you must start with to own any of the fund for vanguard funds they have a $ 1,000 minimum for certain target date funds and $ 3,000 for most everything else what you would do is open an account at vanguard or other brokerage that handles vanguard funds and send them a check for $ 3,000 after it clears you can specify which fund you want it to go into and it buys what the price at end of day was divided into your account balance number of shares fractional share are fine and your balance will not usually be an even number of shares most brokerages will let you set up an automatic transfer where some amount out of your paycheck is put into your account each pay period you can specify which of the funds you own it goes into once you 've got the minimum to be in the fund you can add whatever amount you like each month

back when i was 25 and living near kansas city i would put 500 700 miles on my car almost every weekend traveling to other places like omaha st. louis iowa city occasionally minneapolis once to fargo and one longer trip all the way to virginia there 's a whole lot of nothing out there so road trips are quite naturally long they 're also quite attractive and i still would n't miss an opportunity to get up and drive somewhere for the weekend but i have spent less money on cars in my entire lifetime than you have on this single car i preferred then and still do to buy older cars for a few thousand dollars or even less and drive them until they die or can no longer pass inspection changing the oil is usually the most maintenance i 'll do since i 've spent so little on each car i do n't really care if it suffers some minor damage or even gets totaled in an accident which fortunately has never happened so i would only carry the mandatory liability insurance this is going to be much cheaper than the full coverage you will have on your car if something did happen i would just go buy another junker one such car i bought cost me a grand total of $ 150 excluding gas and gave me almost 10,000 miles until its transmission fell out another that i paid $ 100 for had difficulty getting over 60 miles an hour but it did those trips almost every weekend for two years before the engine threw a rod this might not be something you want to do perhaps you do n't want to be seen driving what one of my called a mobile because people will you but consider that billionaire sam walton of wal mart could afford any vehicle he wanted but drove an old pickup truck i present it as an option because it works for me and might work for you and my ex liked my old cars especially the 1983 station wagon with enough space in the back for a full size bed thus you have one possible way to cut your expenses significantly the only thing left to deal with is parking and its attendant security issues my have never been stolen broken into or even looked at funny though i have never left anything visible in them but the occasional bit of trash thieves do n't seem to expect an old beater to contain valuables or even be and a chop shop certainly would n't want one and as i noted in a comment earlier it 's possible to find cheaper monthly parking in nyc if you search carefully the $ example in the being just the first one i found after 25 seconds on google i am pretty sure that if you do some more extensive research you can find cheaper parking that is reasonably secure and at least relatively convenient to your most common travel plans

you could say the same thing but replace money with and it would be true for the guys who are really good at    making money can be no different than any other hobby the only difference is that you can engage in direct exchange after the fact instead of barter exchange    but make no mistake enjoying it does not make warren any more insane than the guys or more seriously most academics

i know your pain   but do n't worry about investing the money right now leave it uninvested in the short term   you have other stuff you need to school up on   investment will come and it 's not that hard   in the short term focus on taxes   do some mock run of your expected end of year taxes use last year 's forms if this year 's are n't available yet   must you pay estimated tax periodically throughout the year   the tax authorities charge hefty penalties for forgetting to do it or not knowing you have to   keep an eye out for any other government gotchas    do not overlook this   this is the best investment you could possibly make   max out your government sanctioned retirement funds in the us we have employer plans like 401 k or keogh and personal plans like the ira   this is fairly straightforward   avoid any products the financial advisors want to sell you like annuities   also if you have the roth type ira learn the difference between that and a normal one   there are some tricks you can do if you expect to have an off year in the future   charitable giving is worth considering at high income levels   do not donate directly to charities   instead use a donor advised fund   it is a charity of its own which accepts your tax deductible donation and holds it   you take the tax deduction that year   then later when the spirit moves tell your daf to donate to the charity of your choice    this eliminates most of the headaches associated with giving   you do n't get on the soft sucker lists because you tell the daf not to disclose your address phone or email   you do n't need the charity 's acknowledgement letter for your taxes since your donation was actually to the daf it shuts down scams and non charities since the daf confirms their nonprofit status and sends the check to their official address only this also those evil for profit fundraising companies it 's a lot simpler than they want you to know   so called financial advisors are actually salesmen working on commission   they urge you to invest because that 's what they sell   they sell financial products you ca n't understand because they are intentionally unduly complex specifically to confuse you   they are trying to you into believing all investments are too complex to understand so you 'll give up and just trust them   simple investments exist   they actually perform better since they are n't burdened down with overhead and internal complexity   follow this rule if you do n't understand a financial product do n't buy it    but seriously do commit and take the time to learn investment   you are the best friend your money will have or its worst enemy   the only way to protect your money from inflation or financial salesmen is to understand investment yourself you can have a successful understanding of how to invest from 1 or 2 books certainly not everything those salesmen keep making the financial world more complicated but you do n't need any of that junk    for instance how do you allocate domestic stocks foreign stocks bonds etc in an ira if you 're under 40   well how do smaller universities invest their endowments they all want the same thing you do   if you look into it you 'll find they all invest about the same   and that 's quite similar to the asset mix suze orman recommends for young people 's iras   see not that complicated   then take the time to learn why it is n't stupid easy but it is    for someone in your tier of income i recommend suze orman 's books   i know that some people do n't like her but that into a big problem you 'll run into   people have very strong feelings about money   intense irrational emotions   people get it from their parents or they get sucked into the trust trap i mentioned with so called financial advisors   they bet their whole savings on whatever they 're doing and their ego is very involved   when they push you toward their salesman or his variable annuity they want you to agree they invested well   so you kinda have to keep your head low not listen too much to friends family and do your research for yourself   john bogle 's book on mutual funds is a must read for picking mutual funds and allocating assets   certain financial advisors are ok   they are fee only advisors   they deal with all their customers on a fee only basis and are not connected to a company which sells financial products   they will be happy for you to keep your money in your account at your discount brokerage and do your own trading on asset types not brands they recommend   they do n't need your password   here 's what not to do a good friend strongly recommended his financial advisor   in the interview i said i wanted a fee only advisor and he agreed to charge me $ 2000 flat rate   later i figured out he normally works on commissions because he was selling me the exact same products he 'd sell to a commission free advice customer and they were terrible products of course   i fired him fast

if you receive a loan from your parents it is treated legally just as a loan a bank or from any private person with spare money you do n't pay tax on a loan that you get from your bank or your parents and the bank or your parents do n't pay tax when you repay the loan if you pay interest the parents will have to pay tax on the interest just like they would have to pay tax if the money was in their own bank account   i would advice both you and your parents to make sure that a contract is signed saying that this is a loan and how it is repaid and that you follow the contract otherwise if you or your parents treat the loan as an actual present then you might have to pay tax because there is tax due on gifts and you might get a penalty for trying to avoid tax by declaring the gift as a loan so pay the money back only up to £ 3,000 in cash gifts that a person gives each year is tax free but the parents can use any unused money from last year so they can give a gift of £ 6,000 if they gave nothing in the previous year and it is per parent so both the mother and father can make a gift

is my understanding okay if so it seems to me that this system is    rather error prone by that i mean i could easily forget to make a    wire some day and be charged interests while i actually have more than    enough money on the check account to pay the debt which is where the credit card company can add fees so you pay more and they make more money do n't forget that in the credit case you are borrowing money rather than using your own another thing that bothers me is that the credit card apparently has a    rather low credit limit if i wanted to buy something that costs $ 2500    but only have a credit limit of $ 1500 can i make a wire    from my check account to the visa account to avoid facing the limit    if so what is the point for the customer of having two accounts and    two cards for that matter if you were the credit card company do you believe people should be given large limits first there are prepaid credit cards where you could put a dollar amount on and it would reject if the balance gets low enough prepaid mastercard would be an example here that i received one last year as i was involved in the floods in my area and needed access to government assistance which was given this way part of the point of building up a credit history is that this is part of how one can get the credit limits increased on cards so that one can have a higher limit after demonstrating that they will pay it back and otherwise the system could be abused there may be a risk that if you prepay onto a credit card and then want to take back the money that there may be fees involved in the transaction generally with credit cards the company makes money on the fees involved for transactions which may come from merchants or yourself as a cash advance on a credit card will be charged interest right away while if you buy merchandise in a store there may not be the interest charged right away

if you look at the biotech breakdown you 'll find a lot of when it comes to p e since there are many young biotech companies that have yet to make a profit   thus there may be something to be said for how is the entire industry stat computed biotechnology can include pharmaceutical companies that can have big profits due to patents on drugs as an example look at plc which has a p e of which is pretty high with a market capitalization of over a billion dollars so this is n't a small company   i wonder what dot com companies would have looked like in that could well be similar as some industries will have bubbles you do realize right the reason for pointing out the market capitalization is that this a way to measure the size of a company as this is merely the sum of all the stock of the company   there could be small companies that have low market that could have high p es as they are relatively young and could be believed to have enough hype that there is a great deal of confidence in the stock   for example amazon.com was public for years before turning a profit   in being without profits there is no p e and thus it is worth understanding the limitations of a p e as the computation just takes the previous year 's earnings for a company divided by the current stock price   if the expected growth rate is high enough this can be a way to justify a high p e for a stock   the question you asked about an industry having this is the derivation from a set of stocks   if most of the stocks are high enough then whatever mean or median one wants to use as the industry average will come from that

the general argument put forward by gold lovers is n't that you get the same gold per dollar or dollars per ounce of gold but that you get the same consumable product per ounce of gold in other words the claim is that the inflation adjusted price of gold is more or less constant see link for a chart of gold in 2010 gbp all the way from in 2010 gbp means its an inflation adjusted chart as you can see there is plenty of fluctuation in there but it just so happens that gold is worth about the same now as it was in see link for a series of anecdotes of the buying power of gold and silver going back some 3000 years what this means to you if you think the stock market is volatile and want to de risk your holdings for the next 2 years gold is just as risky if you want to invest some wealth such that it will be worth more in real terms when you take it out in 40 years time than today the stock market has historically given better returns than gold if you want to put money aside and it to not lose value for a few hundred years then gold might be a sensible place to store your wealth as per comment from it might be possible to use gold as a partial hedge against the stock market as the two supposedly have very low correlation

firstly the agent does n't work for you he works for himself   it 's in his interest not to get you a house at the lowest cost but to sell you a house the higher the price the higher his commission is or the higher the probability that the seller will sell it meaning less work for him it depends on the market what price you should give if i were you i would do my own research about this area and not just trust the agent 's assessment of it being a seller 's market not sure where we are talking about but as you know house prices have fallen a lot in the last few years and the economy is n't doing that well it also depends on yourself every house is different and there 's an emotional attachment to buying property how much do you really want this house would it matter if you did n't get it are you prepared to keep looking if this is your dream house then maybe it is worth offering a bit more to ensure that you get it if not and you are prepared to wait then yeah i would shoot a little lower and see what they say one thing i will say though is generally even if you give them a low offer unless they 're getting lots of other offers or they have to sell urgently alot of the times the seller will come back and try to negotiate with you anyway after all it 's business and they 're there to get the highest price

my original point to this post was that this asset bubble is playing out in slow motion just like others have in the past this of a recovery will bump along the bottom for years if history is a guide eg 1934    this is long term pain for the average middle class person underwater mortgages stagnating wages and here in dc overpriced houses completely out of line with median incomes    it 's been a recovery for the wealthiest in society but everyone else is sinking or water economic indicators are not a reflection of the average middle class persons struggle take a look at what said last week to a group of nobel winners    you are telling me that no one got a heloc on the speculative value of their house between 2000 2007

i find it really hard to feel sorry for them for many years now the local post office has been a farce many local businesses quit using them because they 'd just flat out lose mail so consistently    the small company i worked for local isp was constantly fighting this battle since we would have customers calling up pissed off because their service got cut off when we did n't receive their payment now sure you have the classic check 's in the mail bit but this happened too frequently to such a random selection of customers that it was quite obvious there was an issue more than once i took it up personally with the local functioning manager type person and would always get told oh it 's not us it 's the columbia branch and when i called to straighten it out there i was told sorry you 'll have to take this up with your local office funny they never seemed to lose all that fucking junk mail that crammed up our po or mailbox    hate that it got that bad but once again sounds like a bad business model provide services at a loss pay into pensions you know you ca n't afford and refuse to modernize effectively and in time

if the intention is after maturing to convert back the rupees into euro its not a good idea   generally the interest rate in euro and the interest rate in rupee are offset by the predicted exchange rate i.e. the rupee will fall compared to euro by similar rate the point at step 5 is generally what is expected to happen at times this can be less or more depending on the local global factors so on average you will not make money some times you will loose and sometimes you will gain plus i have shown flat conversion rates typically there is a buy rate and a sell rate for a pair of currencies there is a difference spread that is the margins of bank typically in the range of 2 to 4 depending on the currency pairs

gt in europe we act as if workers are people not a commodity to be prices as low as possible   it works both ways regulating workers wages can decrease the number of small companies starting up this is because entrepreneurs starting up might not be starting off with many millions in the bank so they may be fearful of paying too much same goes for job security regulation and wage are generally bad for small innovative companies and not so bad for big established firms who just want to protect their market share and for whom compliance costs peanuts as a percentage of their revenue    my two cents on this are much better to create a system whereby the state pays everybody a basic level of income then the market can be freed up and people 's entrepreneurship can be fully leveraged

i use two different brokerages both well known i got a bit spooked during the financial crisis and did n't want to have all my eggs in one basket the sipc limits were n't so much a factor at the time i was more worried about the hassle of dealing with a lehman style meltdown if one were to fail the misery of waiting and filing and dealing with sipc claims would be mitigated by having half of my money in another brokerage in hindsight i was perhaps a bit too paranoid dealing with two separate brokerages is not much of an inconvenience though and it 's interesting to see how their web interfaces are slightly different and some things are easier to do with one vs the other overall they 're really similar and i ca n't say there 's much advantage other than my tin foil hat tendencies to splitting it up like that

rebalancing your portfolio does n't have to include selling   you could simply adjust your buying to keep your portfolio in balance   if you portfolio has shifted from 50 stocks and 50 bonds to 75 stocks and 25 bonds you can just only use new savings to buy bonds until you are back at 50 50 remember to take into account taxes if you are thinking of selling to rebalance in taxable accounts the goal of rebalancing is to keep your exposures the way that you want them   assuming that you had a good reason to have a portfolio of 50 stocks and 50 bonds you probably want to keep your portfolio similar in the future   if you end up with a portfolio of 75 stocks and 25 bonds due to stock market fluctuations the exposure and the risk return profile of your portfolio will have changed and it 's probably not something that you want you do n't want to rebalance just for the sake of rebalancing either   there can be costs to rebalancing taxes transaction fees etc and these are n't always worth the effort   that 's why you do n't need to rebalance every month or if your portfolio has shifted from 50/50 to i take a look at my portfolio once a year and adjust my automated investments so that by the end of the next year i 'm back to the ratio i want

note i am the currency units   while i strongly suspect it 's us$ i do n't know from the chart   the system works the same no matter what the currency a call or a put is the right to sell put or buy call shares at a certain price on a certain day this is why you see a whole range of prices   not all possible stock values are represented the number of possibilities has to be kept reasonable   in this case the choices are even units for an expensive stock they may be spaced even farther apart than this the top of the chart says it 's for june   it 's actually the third friday in the month june 15th in this case   thus these are bets on how the stock will move in the next 10 days while the numbers are per share you can only trade options in lots of 100 the left side of the chart shows calls   suppose you sell a call at 19 the top of the chart   the last such trade would have gotten you a premium of per share the flip side of this is when the third friday rolls around it will most likely be exercised and they 'll be paying you only 19 a share for a stock now trading at something over 26   note the volume bid and ask columns though you're not going to get for such a call as there is no buyer   the most anybody is offering at present is a share now lets look farther down in the chart say a strike price of 30   the last trade was only .10 think it 's very unlikely that fb will rise above 30 to make this option worthwhile and thus you get very little for being willing to sell at that price   if fb stays at 26 the option will expire worthless and go away   if it 's up to 31 when the 15th rolls around they 'll exercise the option take your shares and pay you 30 for them   note that you already gave permission for the trade by selling the call you ca n't back out later if it becomes a bad deal going over to the other side of the chart with the puts here the transaction goes the other way come the 15th they have the option of selling you the shares for the strike price   lets look at the same values we did before   19   there 's no trading you ca n't do it 30   here you will collect 3.20 for selling the put   come the 15th they have the right to sell you the stock for 30 a share   if it 's still 26 they 're certainly going to do so but if it 's up to 31 it 's worthless and you pocket the 3.20 note that you will normally not be allowed to sell a call if you do n't own the shares in question   this is a safety measure as the risk in selling a call without the stock is infinite   if the stock somehow up to 10,000 when the 15th rolls around you would have to come up with the shares and the only way you could get them is buy them on the open market you would have to come up with a million dollars   if there simply are n't enough shares available to cover the calls the result is catastrophic whoever owns the shares simply gets to dictate terms to you   and in the days of old this sometimes happened

i 'd question whether a guaranteed savings instrument underperforming the stock market really is a risk or not   rather you reap what you there 's a trade off and one makes a choice   if one chooses to invest in a highly conservative low risk asset class then one should expect lower returns from it   that does n't necessarily mean the return will be lower stock markets could tank and a cd could look brilliant in hindsight but one should expect lower returns   this is what we learn from the risk return spectrum and modern portfolio theory you 've mentioned and discounted inflation risk already and that would've been one i 'd mention with respect to guaranteed savings yet one still accepts inflation risk in choosing the 3 cd because inflation is n't known in advance   if inflation happened to be 2 after the fact that just means the risk did n't materialize   but inflation could have been say 4 nevertheless i 'll try and describe the phenomenon of significantly underperforming a portfolio with more higher risk assets   i 'd suggest one of perhaps we can sum those up as the risk of investing alternatively if one were actually fully aware of the risk reward spectrum and mpt and still chose an excessive amount of low risk investments such that one would n't be able to attain reasonable investing goals then i 'd probably file the risk under psychological risk e.g. overly cautious excessive risk aversion yet the term psychological risk with respect to investing encompasses other situations as well e.g. chasing high returns fwiw the risk of also came to mind but i think that 's mostly used to describe the risk of choosing say an actively managed fund or individual stocks over a passive benchmark index investment more likely to match market returns

whole life insurance accumulates a cash value on a pre tax basis with a paid up policy you make payments until a particular age usually 65 or 70 at which point you are insured for the rest of your life or a very old age like 120 you can also access this pool of money via loans while you are still alive but you reduce your benefit until you repay the loans this may be advantageous if you have a high net worth also if you own a business or farm a permanent policy may be desirable if the transfer of your property to heirs is likely to generate alot of transactional costs like taxes nowadays there are probably better ways to do that too whole life universal life is a waste of money of the time an example my wife and i were recently offered open enrollment no medical exam insurance policies our employers in new york we 're in our early 30 's i bought a term policy paying about $ 400k which costs $ my wife was offered a permanent policy that pays $ 100k which costs $ and would have a cash value of $ 35k at age 65 if you invested the $ difference between those policies and earned with 30 taxes on the gains you 'd have over $ 40k with 4x more coverage

the coupon should save you $ 10 either way assuming that you meet the criteria for using the coupon you 're figuring out the discount based on the cost of the food alone   you should be including the tip in your calculations yes they 're tacking on something that is otherwise optional but that 's because enough people forget that the server works just as hard regardless of whether there 's a coupon involved or not   so restaurants build the tip in to keep employee morale up which in turn encourages them to keep a good level of service up i guess it gets down to how much you tip   if you typically do n't tip which would be rather then yes you do lose money with a $ 60 meal   if you tip 18 then you save exactly $ 10 $ $ 10.00 = $   if you normally tip 10 15 a customary range then it 's somewhere in between edit following littleadv 's discussion on this question i am assuming that the 18 goes directly to the and is more or less expected if it does n't in which case one might choose not to tip at all because it would just line the pockets of the restaurant owner then you 're absolutely correct in figuring out the value of the coupon by treating the 18 as a tax

to optimize your return on investment you need to buy low and sell high   if you knew that one stock had hit rock bottom and the others had not buying the low stock would be the best however unless you can predict the future you do n't know if any individual stock has hit the bottom or if it will continue to drop if you decide to spend the same amount of money each month on stock purchases then when the price is low you will automatically buy more shares and when the price is high you will buy fewer shares   this strategy is sometimes called dollar cost averaging   it eliminates the need to predict the future to optimize your buying all that having been said i agree with that at the investment amount that you are talking about and the per transaction fee you listed a monthly investment in several stocks will cause you to lose quite a bit to transaction fees   it sounds like you need a different strategy

rob i 'm sorry your first visit here has been unpleasant   what you are asking for is beyond the capability of most software if you look at you find the standard deduction for married filing joint is $ in 2012 and $ in 2013 i offer this anecdote to share a deduction story the first year i did my mil 's taxes i had to explain that she did n't    have enough deductions to itemize every year since she hands me a    file full of paper medical deductions that do n't exceed    7.5 of her income in turn i give her two folders back one with the 5 or so documents i needed and the rest labeled trash fewer than 30 of filers itemize and a good portion of those that do have no question that 's the right thing to do e.g. my property tax is more than the $ 12 k so anything else i have that 's a deduction adds right to the number   it 's really just those people who are at the edge that are likely frustrated i wrote an article regarding standard deduction vs itemizing in which i describe a method of pulling in one 's deductible expenses into odd years reducing the number in even years to allow a bi annual if this is your situation you 'll find the concept interesting   you also ask about filing status think on this for a minute after pulling in our turbotax imports the data right from adp i do the same for our stock info the stock info and all schedule a deductions are n't assigned a name so any effort to split them in search of savings by using married filing separate would first require splitting these up turbotax has a what if worksheet for this function but when the marriage penalty was lifted years ago the change in status had no value items that phaseout over certain income levels are often lost to the separate filer anyway when i got married i found my real estate losses each year could not be taken they accumulated until i either sold or until our income dropped when the mrs retired   so while is respect your desire for these magic within the software i think it 's fair to say they would provide little value to most people   if this thread stays open i 'd be curious if anyone can cite an example where filing separately actually benefits the couple

the fundamental flaw here is conflating net worth with utility at least failing to recognize that there 's a nonlinear relationship between the two   in the extreme example imagine taking a bet that will either make you twice as rich or completely broke your expected return is zero but it would be pretty dumb to take it since being flat broke could ruin your life while being twice as rich may only improve it marginally in more realistic cases most of your income is tied up in fixed costs which magnifies relatively small to your net worth losing something essential like your house or car even if it 's only 20 of your net worth renders you effectively broke until you scrape together enough cash to get another one that situation robs you of much more utility than you 'd gain from a 20 increase in net worth in either case avoiding the risk is completely rational as long as you believe in nonlinear utility as a function of net worth it 's not just an issue of humans being risk averse

if there is a plus side to american healthcare it is that the huge wealth it accumulates funds a lot of medical research and facilities i 've explored many american cities and the healthcare system is often a huge empire that keeps expanding until a large part of the city is consumed by the hospital and countless associated facilities a college campus also grows into an empire of real estate in some cities the healthcare empire and the higher education empire expand to border each other and then there is a battle for the remaining real estate   but often there is nothing else going on in these communities no restaurants no retail no theater no housing it is all service related economic activity

there are markets in which there is n't a lot of choice to enable downward price pressure like drugs and healthcare     also consolidation always results in reduced consumer choice and sooner or later increased prices   that 's a big part of why they do it    in healthcare in the us there is huge consolidation among specialty practices in order to force insurance companies to pay more   e.g every and in a 30 mile radius from here was bought by the same practice so now the are forced to pay the rate this practice dictates   no small practices have started here in the past 20 years all the new mds just join the big existing practice in order to fill any increased demand   these practices often pick and choose which insurers they will work with and they do n't take medicare   but this is one example of how markets get and harmful if not regulated there are many others

i think most financial planners or advisors would allocate zero to a gold only fund that 's probably the mainstream view metals investments have a lot of issues more here what would be the signs of a bubble in silver also consider that metals and commodities despite a recent drop are on a big run up and lots of random people are saying they 're the thing to get in on usually this is a sign that you might want to wait a bit or at least buy gradually   the more mainstream way to go might be a commodities fund or all asset fund some funds you could look at just examples not recommendations might include several pimco funds including their commodity real return and all asset hussman strategic total return diversified commodities index etfs stuff like that has a lot of the theoretical benefits of gold but is n't as dependent on gold specifically another idea for you might be international bonds or stocks if you feel us currency in particular is at risk oh and reits often come up as an inflation resistant asset class i personally use diversified funds rather than gold specifically fwiw mostly for the same reason i 'd buy a fund instead of individual stocks is probably about right to put into this kind of stuff depending on your overall portfolio and goals pure commodities should probably be less than funds with some bonds stocks or reits because in principle commodities only track inflation over time they do n't make money the only way you make money on them is rebalancing out of them some when there 's a run up and back in when they 're down so a portfolio with mostly commodities would suck long term some people feel gold 's virtue is rather than being a piece of paper in an apocalypse ish scenario but if making that argument i think you need physical gold in your basement not an etf   plus i 'd argue for guns ammo and food over gold in that scenario

kentucky property tax is assessed as of the owner on january 1 of each calendar year   in april you should be notified of what ky considers you to owe them and you have a two week period in may to appeal those decisions though it appears that you can only appeal real property tax assessments   the final tax bill is then sent to you in the fall by october and you have until the end of the year to pay the bill see kentucky property tax calendar overview for more details thus if you owned the car on jan 1 2016 then you should owe personal property tax on it for 2016 due in the fall   you may not have owed the tax paid in november if it was indeed personal property tax unless the seller was asking you to them for the tax they paid in 2015 note that property tax is separate and distinct from usage tax the 6 tax for vehicles paid at purchase date once and only once

as best as i can understand your payout is based on your which    is also capped at that same $ 118,500 so trump 's payout should also be    equivalently small exactly proportional to this cap not sure what you want from bernie here but that is correct is it accurate to say that trump will be paid by social security as    though his actual income was $ 118,500 rather than his full income assuming trump does pay that much depends on how much of his income is actually subject to the fica se tax yes it is accurate however i believe what confuses you is the point bernie sanders made about people getting the same benefit while being rich bernie 's point was that trump and the likes do n't need the social security income while they 're still getting it social security is designed at least theoretically to be the safety net for people of age who can not provide for themselves thus it is not supposed to be you get what you paid system this is a political discussion though social security system by definition is based on a major principle of any socialist society we as a group should support those who can not support themselves thus bernie 's point is that we should n't support trump and the likes at all since they do n't need that money but they should still pay the tax to allow supporting those who do need but can not pay in

congratulations to you and good luck and good health with the baby i had a friend in a similar situation and i told him that he could do quite well by putting out the word to an upper middle class neighborhood that he was available to setup routers home networks etc   i suggested that he could start at a low enough wage that people would see the beneficial tradeoff to having him come over for a few hours versus doing it themselves after a few months he hired someone to take the extra work he was receiving and directed the more routine requests his employee   he had a full time job plus all the extra work he wanted   most people who hire him simply want someone they would trust in their home and his service spread by word of mouth   he also got to meet many people who liked him and were impressed by his work ethic resulting in many good connections if he ever wanted to pursue other employment my friend was an it professional the best support person at our tech heavy firm so he was n't giving his time away   he did enjoy doing it and he did enjoy the extra money   on an hourly basis especially once he added the assistant he was making more on the side than he did at his job   however i believe he did start lower than that good luck

i 'm kind of shocked that no formal behavioral modeling has been proposed as an explanation yet one such model would be steep hyperbolic quasi hyperbolic discounting   consumers would rather pay for popcorn later than for an expensive movie ticket now   for instance consumers might when purchasing the ticket see a low value of popcorn and view the ticket price as the whole price because they do not predict purchasing popcorn   then when entering the theater the present value of popcorn is very high and they purchase it   there might therefore be a market for a commitment device such as a theater to make the appropriate decision ex ante   another commitment device that seems to be practiced is when individuals sneak their own popcorn into the theater   they may not actually want the popcorn but by bringing their own they ensure they do not purchase the theater 's

# 159840
in addition to the answer from cqm let me answer your am i missing anything question then i 'll talk about how your approach of simplifying this is making it both harder and easier for you last i 'll show what my model for this would look like but if you are n't capable of stacking this up yourself then you really should n't be borrowing 10,000 to try to make money on the margin am i missing anything yes you 're forgetting 1 taxes specifically income tax and 2 sales fees   on the first you have not considered anything in your financial model for taxes you should include at least 25 of your expected returns going to taxes because anything that you buy and then sell within 12 months is taxed as income not capital gains on the second you will incur sales commissions and/or transaction fees depending on the brokerage you are using for your plan these tend to vary widely but i would expect to spend at least $ 25 per sale so if i were building out this model i would think that your break even would have to at least cover monthly interest + monthly principal payment income tax when sold commissions and broker 's fees every time you sell holdings on over simplifying you have the right idea with thinking about both interest and principal in trying to sketch this out but as i mentioned above you 're making this both harder and easier for yourself you are making it harder because you are doing the math wrong the actual payment for this loan assuming it is a normal loan can be found most easily with the pmt function in excel = nper pv fv = 24 0 that returns a monthly payment   of principal + interest of   so you actually are over calculating the payment by $ with your ballpark approach however you did n't actually have all the factors in the model to begin with so that does n't matter much   you are making it artificially easier because you have not thought about the impact of repaying principal what i mean is this in your question you indicate   i 'm guessing the necessary profit is just the total interest on this loan = = $ 720 usd so i 'll break even on this loan if and only if i make $ 720 from stocks over 24 months so the rate of return is + 720 = this sounds all you need is a total return across two years but assuming this is a normal loan and not an interest only loan you have to get rid of your capital a little bit at a time to pay back the loan in essence you will pay back 1/3 of your principal the first year and then you have to keep making the same fixed interest + principal payments out of a smaller base of capital   so for the first few months you can cover the interest easily but by the end you have to be making phenomenal returns to cover it   here is how i would build a model for it i actually did and your breakeven is about per month at that outstanding annual return you would be earning a whopping $ 4 at least as far as the variables are concerned you need to be considering your current capital balance because month 1 you may have $ 10,000 but month 2 you have just after paying back some principal   your rate of return if you do this in excel you can play with it some but you should save the time and just invest somewhere else your actual return that month rate of return existing capital balance   loan payment = for the parameters you gave earlier   income tax = actual return .25 with this kind of loan you 're not actually making enough to preserve the 10,000 capital and you 're selling everything you 've gained each month   commission = $ 25 per month assuming that covers your trade fees and broker commissions i guarantee you that this is not the deal breaker in the model so do n't get excited if you think i 'm over estimating this and you realize that scottrade or somewhere will let you have trades at $ each    monthly ending balance = = next month 's starting capital balance   stack it all up in excel for 24 months and see for yourself if you like the key thing you left out is that you 're repaying each month out of capital that you 'd like to use to invest with this makes you need much higher returns   even if your initial description was n't clear and this is an interest only loan you 're still looking at a rate of about 7.6 annually that you need to hit in order to just break even on the costs of holding the loan and transferring your gains into cash

if you are looking for a simple formula or buying order strategy to guarantee a lower buying price unfortunately this does not exist   otherwise all investors would employ this strategy and the financial markets would no longer have an validity aka arbitrage   buying any investment contains a certain level of risk other than us treasuries of course having said that there are many option buying strategies that can employed to help increase your ror or hedge an existing position   most of these strategies are based a predicted future direction of a stock on the investor 's part   for example you hold the ford stock and feel they are releasing their earnings report next week   you feel that they will not meet investors expectations   you do n't want to sell your shares but what you can do is buy put options   if the stock does indeed go down then you make money on your put options here is a document on options   it is moderately technical but very good if you want a good introduction on the subject   the strategy that i described above is on pg 33

unless you can have your savings earning more than the transfer fees you should just pay the credit cards off before the interest free period ends also there is the difficulty in finding new cards offering 0 interest continuously you are better off paying off all your bad debt as soon as possible start saving and investing instead of wasting your time and energy trying to find new offers of 0 for your transfers before it expires rule of thumb get rid of your bad debts as soon as possible keep your good debts as long as possible as long as you can afford them

  gt this strategy is not for everyone borrowing against your home is psychologically difficult and if the investments do n't yield expected returns this strategy could yield negative results by re borrowing the equity in your home you are also removing your cushion of safety if the real estate or investment markets take a turn for the worse by creating an income producing portfolio in an unregistered account there can also be additional tax consequences so always consult with a professional financial advisor to determine whether this strategy is for you and if it is have it tailor made to you and your family 's personal financial situation

you have received much good advice but based on 53 years investing and the first 25 getting my nose and breaking even i very strongly offer the following before doing so let me first offer this caveat i am not questioning your broker or the advice but it is only valuable to you if history proves correct no one not even bernanke can predict how stock will perform in the future maybe if he sees a depression my advice to someone new to stock investing is to purchase a index fund from a discount broker e.g. fidelity or vanguard and then study the market and economics the wall street journal and the web are my favorites i started with a hell of a lot less than you have saved i would not turn $ 200 k over to anyone until you know exactly the risk and cost involved also i would n't depend on one person or firm to advise or manage my money i like to balance one against the other i do not recall different firms recommending the same stocks one must remember everyone in the business of recommending stock or any investment is selling something and must be compensated that 's how they earn a living

sell 200 at 142 what does that mean i have n't seen the movie so i wo n't try to put anything in story context   sell 200 at 142 means to sell 200 units usually shares but in this case it would likely be gallons or barrels of orange juice or pounds or tons of frozen juice    in general this could mean that you have 200 units and want to sell what you have   or you could borrow 200 units from someone and sell those this is called a naked short   in this case it seems that what they are selling is a futures contract   with a futures contract you are promising to obtain orange juice by some future date and sell it for the agreed price   you could own an orange and plan to turn your oranges into juice   or you could buy a futures contract of oranges to turn into juice   or you could arbitrage two futures contracts such that one supplies the other what they 're doing here    in general people make profits by buying low and selling high   in this case they did so in reverse order   they took the risk of selling before they had a supply   then they covered their position by purchasing the supply   they profited because the price at which they bought was lower than the price at which they sold    the reason why this is necessary is that before buying the oranges the orange juice makers need to know that they can make a profit   so they sell orange juice on the futures market   then they know how much they can afford to pay for oranges on a different market   and the growers know how much they can get for oranges so they can pay people to water and pick them    without the futures markets growers and orange juice makers would have to take all the risk themselves   this way they can share risks with each other and financiers   combined with insurance this allows for predictable finances   without it growers would have to be wealthy to afford the variation in crop yields and prices

gt even if tesla takes care of the issue quickly and gave me a loaner it 's still hours if not a day that i would n't have a car   the thing is it 's really not   they can come get your car from wherever it is and drop off a loaner at the same time   the loaner is generally a model s unless they run out and then they offer you a free rental of something cool i got offered a for my roadster 's warranty service once but chose to take a leaf instead because i am fully over gasoline   oftentimes they can pick up the car while you 're at work and have it back to you by the end of the day   like they mentioned i think only 2 repairs required an overnight stay and they had access to a loaner at the time anyway   further they mention multiple times that many of the repairs were for issues related to early production cars the door handle problem for example was only in the first 1,000 cars or so before a software update fixed it   the software update for that one was applied over the air   gt;and my admittedly short experience with our own camry so far   interestingly cr dropped their recommendation for the camry last year according to the most recent info i could find which is from so there may be something more recent than that while they still recommend the model s based on their review and reliability survey   that article even claims the model s to be above average in reliability though i think they may have gotten that wrong   gt;since these two reviews switched me from being interested in tesla to being apprehensive i 'd say that they were quite unfavorable   again i wonder if you read the full reviews or followed their various updates on the long term tests   because both have been with the car all along and like i said it almost feels to me like they 're hunting for things to say they had problems with just so they seem to be objective   one of the guys even said something to that effect in the cr talking cars segment on youtube   also you should try driving the car because like cr and edmunds you will still be plenty interested in the car were you to drive it   yes it 's that good just as their reviews claim

i agree with the answers above would just like to make a couple of additional points it 's a good and simple strategy to try it out with a small amount as suggested by @joetaxpayer it 's also generally safe to assert that card issuers currently do n't receive or actively look at itemized transaction details but that does not mean they can not in the future some stores utilize level 3 data processing which tells the card issuers exactly what you bought in a transaction an example of level 3 data being utilized to reject rewards is with discover which announced a 10 cashback reward for any transactions made with apple pay last year it later introduced an additional term to exclude gift card purchases and this has been verified to be effective no more reward on gift card purchases of cashback on existing gift card transactions as far as i know amex does receive and look at some level 3 data that does not necessarily mean they will claw back your cashback after initially rewarding the 6 but it might show up if you ever trigger an account review and be used as evidence of your abuse of the program which btw is defined rather there has been many cases of account because of this card issuers are also trying to do a better job preventing abuses by proactively setting caps on rewards as opposed to closing those accounts afterwards and taking the rewards away altogether given the trend in recent years i have to speculate that at some point the card issuers would put clear language in the terms against gift card purchase and enforce it effectively if they have n't already this reward game is constantly changing it 's good while it lasts just be prepared and do n't get surprised when things go south

the stock will slowly gain that $ 1 during the year suppose we have the highly theoretical situation that a company 's stock is worth exactly $ 10 right after it paid its dividend its dividend is always $ 1 per stock and the company and everything else is so stable that its value never changes then the stock value right before the next dividend is paid will be close to $ 11 after all it 's worth a certain $ 1 dividend the next day plus the $ 10 stock and in between half a year after the dividend was paid it will be in between say $ 10.50 or actually slightly less than that because people like to buy in late so they can make money some other way with the money first but the point holds the price decrease on the day that dividend is paid had been building up the whole period before that decrease so stock dividends do make you money

whenever you do paid work for a company you will need to fill out some sort of paperwork so that the company knows how to pay you and also how to report how much they paid you to the appropriate government agencies you should not think of this as a hurdle and you should n't worry that you have n't been employed for a long time the two most common ways a company pays an individual are via employee wages or independent contractor payments when you start a relationship with a company if you are going to become an employee then you will out a w4 form and at the end of the year you will receive a w2 form if you are an independent contractor which you would be considered in this case you will fill out form w9 and at the end of the year you will receive a 1099 this is completely normal and you have nothing to worry about all it means is that if you make more than a certain amount typically $ 600 in a year you will receive a 1099 in the mail or electronically the 1099 form basically means that they are reporting that amount to the irs and it also helps you file your tax return by showing you all the numbers you need on one form please remember that when you are paid as an independent contractor no taxes are withheld on your behalf so you may owe some tax on the money you make it 's best to set aside some of your income so you are prepared to pay it come tax time next year

consider this before you buy one i spent 1900 dollars for a car warranty years back when i bought a car 9 months after i bought the car it broke down and it was covered by the warranty without the warranty the fix would have cost me dollars this is a huge savings except for one thing the warranty company went bankrupt so i spent 1900 + for a grand total of as you can imagine i was n't smiling at the time contrast that with my second warranty i know i know do n't put your hand in a fire twice where i spent 2400 for the warranty and then got my transmission fixed for 4000 dollars and it cost me 100 dollars deductible in summary it 's hit and miss but make sure you do n't pay more than 10 15 of the product price for the warranty

the united states taxes nonresident aliens on two types of income first a nonresident alien who is engaged in a trade or business in the united states is taxed on income that is effectively connected with that trade or business second certain types of u.s source payments are subject to income tax withholding the determination of when a nonresident alien is engaged in a u.s. trade or business is highly fact specific and complex however keeping assets in a u.s. bank account should not be treated as a u.s. trade or business a nonresident alien 's interest income is generally subject to u.s. federal income tax withholding at a rate of 30 percent under section of the tax code interest on bank deposits however benefit from an exception under section so long as that interest is not effectively connected with a u.s. trade or business even though no tax needs to be withheld on interest on a bank deposit the bank should still report that interest each year to the irs on form the irs can then send that information to the tax authority in brazil please keep in mind that state and local tax rules are all different and whether interest on the bank deposits is subject to state or local tax will depend on which state the bank is in also the united states does tax nonresident aliens on wages paid from a u.s. company if those wages are treated as u.s source income generally wages are u.s source income if the employee provides services while physically present in the united states there are a few exceptions to this rule but they depend on the amount of wages and other factors that are specific to the employee 's situation   this is an area where you should really consult with a u.s. tax advisor before the employment starts maybe your company will pay for it

please declare everything you earn in india as well as the total amount of assets it 's called fbar the penalties for not declaring is jail time no matter how small the amount and lots of ordinary people every 2 3 years are regularly sent to jail for not declaring such income it 's taken very seriously by the irs and any indian bank who has an office in the us or does business here can be asked by irs to provide any bank account details for you you will get deductions for taxes already paid to a foreign country due to double taxation so there wo n't be any additional taxes because income taxes in us are on par or even lower than that in india using tricks like transferring ownership to your brother may not be worth it note you pay taxes only when you realize gains anyway both in india or here so why do you want to take such hassles   if you transfer to your brother it will be taxed only until you hold them make sure you have exact dates of gains between the date you came to us and the date you gifted to your brother as long as you clearly document that the stocks transferred to your brother was a gift and you have no more claims on them it should be ok but best to consult a cpa in the us if you have claims on them example agreement that you will repurchase them then you will still continue to pay taxes if you sell your real estate investments in india you have to pay tax on the gains in the us and you need proof of the original buying cost and your sale if you have paid taxes on the real estate gains in india then you can get deduction due to double tax avoidance treaty no issues in bringing over the capital from india to us

so it 's not always what degree of risk you want be exposed to but what type of risk so let 's say you were happy with the s&amp;p 500 etf but you wanted to avoid oil stocks so you combine that etf with some derivatives that profit if oil goes down and you will outperform the s&amp;p 500 on a net basis   hedge funds can be very with what exposure they want they include a lot of different strategies so it 's kind of incorrect to group them into one asset class per se   as for the question if hedge funds are worth it well if the market tanks you might find your hedge fund 's performance to be very positive ex kyle bass made big money with the crisis

from the irs perspective there 's no difference between your taxes and your sole proprietorship 's taxes they 're all just your taxes while i could see it being very useful and wise to track your business 's activities separately and use separate bank accounts and the like this is just a convenience to help you in your personal accounting and not something that needs to relate directly to how tax forms are completed or taxes are paid when calculating your taxes if you want to figure out how much you owe vs. how much your business owes you 'll have to do so yourself one approach might be just to take the amount that your schedule c puts as income on your return and multiply by your marginal tax rate another approach might be to have your tax software run the calculations as though you had no business income and see what just your personal taxes would have been without the business if you think of the business income as being first and should use up the lower brackets rather than your personal income maybe do it the other way around and have your software run the calculations as though you had only the business income and no other personal investment income and see what the amount of taxes would be then once you 've figured out a good allocation the actual mechanics of paying some personal tax amount from your personal bank account and some business tax amount from your business bank account are up to you i 'd probably just transfer the money from my business account to my personal account and pay all the taxes from the personal account writing two separate checks one from each account that total to the correct amount i 'm sure would work just fine as well you can probably make separate payments from each account electronically through direct pay or as well as long as all taxes are paid by the deadline i do n't think the irs is too picky about the details of how many payments are made

this would inevitably lead to a few gatekeepers from which everyone trusts the bonds ibm ge etc and millions of small businesses which will have absolutely no access to capital once this happens you will quickly end up with a shadow banking system where companies like ge switch from making stuff to basically being banks giving loans to other small businesses with no access to capital etc    this is basically done in china in a slightly different way but the core state owned enterprises have near unlimited access to capital and they use this advantage to invest in and buy up any and all interesting companies simply because they 're the only organizations that can essentially print money whether you agree with it being printing money or not the fact is ge ibm would be able to issue bonds almost whenever they want similar to the treasury 's monthly bond auctions and other firms simply unable to    so then you have a few key companies with nearly unlimited right to print used loosely cash they use this advantage to push on other businesses buy them up or control them in many ways and then they use this position to eventually take over anything that looks interesting    what you 're imagining as being an open market where everyone 's bonds have full information will quickly devolve into information overload and people choosing the well known brands as their trusted source once that happens the whole idea falls apart and those few firms will find a way to control not only the money supply but also who gets to use their money    you will also have situations where some mom and pop takes john llc bonds as payment for dinner and when they try to give john llc bonds to their suppliers their suppliers say no thanks we only deal in ibm bonds    mom and pop will find themselves stuck with paper that nobody wants to accept and mom and pop will quickly find themselves in a cash flow crisis as they have tons of paper but none of their suppliers will accept that paper    the only way to get out of this situation would be to convince ibm or ge to give mom and pop some ge bonds in exchange for the john llc they have that nobody will accept of course ge and ibm being in the position as some of the few trusted money printers can refuse to accept john llc bonds except at a severe discount we know john gave you john llc bonds to pay for his dinner worth $ 100 but we 'll only give you $ 40 worth of ge bonds for it   mom and pop will quickly be fucked and go out of business due to having no hard currency aka trusted currency that they can use to purchase their raw materials   demand for ge bonds will skyrocket as everyone seeks a safe haven a trusted currency almost everyone will accept adn ge will find the entire market begging them to print bonds even at no interest just so that the money supply can increase to hold the full amount of trade occurring in the territory    this is then no different from the fed during the recession a few years ago and up until now where they sell tons of bonds at rock bottom interest rates because all the world is looking for a safe place to put their cash    the difference of course is that ge ibm can take all this money and issue themselves huge bonuses either on the cash directly or on the profit they 've amassed by being the only trusted money issuer whereas government officials can not

yes and the reason for that is because things that are above the market eg regulators politicians et al manipulate it constantly   i think personally the market is still a price discovery mechanism the rules of the game have just changed i.e. risk now has taken on additional dimensions so a lot of conventional theories of asset pricing can effectively be out the window    whether we ever see the return to a more econ driven reality in market expectations and by that extent therefore asset pricing is anyone 's guess for now bye bye to the established light touch framework of decades past hello to randomness

put options are contracts to sell you pay me a fee for the right to put the stock or other underlying security in my hands if you want to that happens on a specific date the strike date and a specified price the strike price you can decide not to exercise that right but i must follow through and let you sell it to me if you want to put options can be used by the purchaser to cap losses for example you purchase a put option for ge from me on october 19th you can make me let you sell your ge stock to me for $ a share if the price for ge has fallen to $ that would be a good idea if its now at $ 15.00 a share you will probably keep the ge or sell it at the current market price call options are contracts to buy the same idea only in the other direction you pay me a fee for the right to call the stock away from me calls also have a strike date and strike price like a put you can choose not to exercises it you can choose to buy the stock from me on the strike date for the strike price but i have to let you buy it from me if you want to   for example you purchase a call option for ge 16.00 option from me on october 19th you can buy my ge stock from me for $ 16.00 a share if the current price is $ you should make me let you buy if from me for $ 16.00 if its less than $ 16.00 you could by it at the current market price for less commonly options are for a block of 100 shares of the underlying security note this is a general description options can be very complicated the fee you pay for the option and the transaction fees associated with the shares affects whether or not exercising is financially beneficial options can be very risky you can loose all your money as there is no innate value in the option only how it relates to the underlying security before your brokerage will let you trade there are disclosures you must read and affirm that you understand the risk

gt women entered the work force en mass and with twice as many potential employees the cost of labor decreased   sorry i 'll have to disagree with this   yes between the 60s and 80s married women started staying in the paid workforce   but this only increased the employment to population ratio from to about in 2000 it has since dropped down to   also since work that had previously been unpaid such as child minding house cleaning nursing of elders and food preparation increasingly became part of the paid economy   much of that extra labor was occupied in these new positions and so would n't have increased the overall competition for jobs   the idea that extra bodies competing for jobs would drive down the price of labor also needs to be justified   in a theoretically ideal market the actual number of players in the market does n't influence the price   only by assuming that the increase in supply increased the job seeker 's desperation for a job do we lower the price at which they are willing to sell their labor   but why should we assume job seekers became more desperate between the 60s and the 90s when the unemployment rate was about the same in both those periods

first make sure you have some money in a savings account that you can use instead of credit cards for making future purchases that go beyond what you have in your checking account $ 1000 is a good amount to start with so just take that out of the $ 5000 then pay off the best buy card you should n't be worried about the minimum payment determine what you can pay per month say $ 400 and take the minimum payments out of that then choose one card to get the rest of your $ 400 plus the remaining $ 1500 of your $ 5000 this should be the highest interest card mathematically but it may or may not be your best choice it depends on your personality some people get a psychological lift out of seeing debts disappear and it gives them more motivation to keep going those people may be better served by paying off the smallest debts first to get them out of the way i 'm an so it bothers me more to think that i 'll be paying a little more in interest over the long term by taking that route

the only party that can pay back a government bond is the government that issued it itself in the case of argentina us vulture funds have won cases against it but it has yet to pay   the best one can do to collect is to sue in a jurisdiction that permits and hope to seize the defaulted government 's assets held in such jurisdiction one could encourage another state to go to war to collect but this is highly unlikely since a state that does n't repay is probably a poor state with nothing much to loot besides most modern governments do not loot the conquered anymore   such a specific eventuality has n't happened in at least a lifetime anyways   it is highly unlikely that any nation would be foolish enough to challenge the united states considering its present military dominance it is rare for nations with medium to large economies to their government obligations for long with argentina as the notable exception   even russia became current when they their government debt during the oil collapse of 1998 countries with very small economies such as zimbabwe are the only remaining nations that try to use their central banks to fund debt repayments if they even repay at all but they quickly see that the destruction caused by hyperinflation neither helps with government debt nor excessive government expenditure nevertheless it could be dangerous to assume that no nation would default on its debt for any period of time and the effects upon countries with defaulted government debt show that it has far reaching negative consequences if the us were to use its central bank to repay its government obligations the law governing the federal reserve would have to be changed since it is currently mandated to maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy 's long run potential to increase production so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates the united states treasury has no power over the federal reserve thus can not force the federal reserve to betray its mandate by purchasing government debt it should be noted that while japan has a government debt twice its gdp it also has a persistent slight deflation which has produced incredibly low interest rates allowing it to finance government debt more easily a situation the us does not enjoy for now the united states seems to be able to pay expenditures and finance at low interest rates   at what ratio of government debt to gdp that would cause interest rates to climb thus put pressure on the us 's ability to repay does not seem to be well known

do you know if you were approached by a carrier or a tower vendor   edit addendum   as someone in the telecommunications industry i will say that you should not lease to a vendor who will the space to the phone companies for a profit   depending on the availability of space the population of the area and the value of the location and the amount and size of hardware to be installed the rental pricing can vary wildly   a cell site on a choice tall building in chicago nyc boston la etc can go for over $ 25000 per year more in the case of rental of inside equipment room   on the other hand renting space on a church in the middle of a low population rural town with the equipment installed in a at ground level may only net around $ 1500 per month   a small cell site which is actually small enough to put on a lamp post or utility pole can go for around $ 250 750 per month   a turf contractor tower vendor actually leasing a chunk of land to build a structure whose space will be leased out to telecoms should be expected to pay between $ 2500 and 8000 per month depending on the value of your site   this value is determined by land form details like nearby tall forests can the tower see over the tree line terrain and need local population tourist traveler numbers   carriers prefer to lease from vendors rather than building their own structures but roof top sites are a different story   carriers are generally more than happy to work with you to lease a portion of your tall building 's roof   fyi   if they offer to compensate you for the electrical requirements if they can not get their own meter in do n't worry   a cell site uses less than 1000 watts which translates to about $ .10 15 per hour in most locations

anyone with a background in finance should have been well aware that the government would swoop in with a bailout of the major banks such a scenario was even discussed in money and banking textbooks pre financial crisis    since i have no excess cash   and wad in senior year of college i was unable to capitalize on that but i did invest in the banks in market simulating games

you can avoid companies that might go bankrupt by not buying the stock of companies with debt every quarter a public company must file financials with the edgar system called a this filing includes financial statements and provides a continuing view of the company 's financial position during the year any debt the company has acquired will appear on this filing and their annual report if servicing the debt is costing the company a substantial fraction of their income then the company is a bankruptcy risk

incorrect as a given product or service becomes more complex to manufacture or support the cost of entry into that marketplace increases    any aspect of technology automatically tends towards increased barrier to entry even without regulation   increased barrier to entry requires larger investment means more risk means increased difficulty finding investment   consider computer processors in the 80s creating a processor that can compete in the fledgling marketplace against similarly available chips would cost maybe a few million   today creating a processor thousands of times more complex requiring much more complex chip of which there are a mere handful and bringing it to market to compete against that already have the infrastructure and programming history to support them would be nearly impossible and require billions   or you know you could look at the whole microsoft and intel locking out their competition from pc manufacturers by means of economic incentives or disincentives leading to a de facto monopoly that they can then abuse to force pc manufacturers to deal on their terms all possible without regulation

does location of ea or cpa matter   not in particular the ftb has field offices all over the state so if a meeting needs to be arranged it will be in the nearest office when you interview the potential candidates you can ask them how they would deal the case if there 's a need of an in person visit to the ftb and if it is even an option you should be worrying about likely not since as you mentioned before you 're in a mail audit process are there websites that rate eas or cpas for example on how many audits they have won or should i simply rely on ratings there 's no winning in audits ideally given the same data any ea or cpa would reach the same result in the discussion re audits with the ftb obviously some are more experienced and some are less and some are specializing on specific types of audits entities etc yelp is a place to start but take the reviews there with a grain of salt since most reviewers are probably there to rant if you see a repetitive pattern in the reviews take that into consideration for example you probably do n't want to hire someone who 's been repeatedly to their clients not returning calls not answering questions being late etc are all eas and cpas equal   no some are some specialize in a specific area some build practice on representation irs or ftb or both some provide a wide range of services from bookkeeping to tax court representation i suggest looking for those who prominently advertise themselves as specializing in your area whatever your type of business is and representation in front of the ftb specialists especially experienced cost much more keep in mind you 'll be getting what you paid for also when you hire a big shot ea cpa check who 's actually going to do the work and how much oversight the big shot is going to provide anything else that i potentially missed any specific questions that i should ask ea or cpa on initial interview for example if my ea cpa could also talk with auditor in case ftb would want to talk directly with taxpayer if possible well that 's the point of representation to represent they should be talking to the ftb in your name you should verify credentials irs for eas ca cba for cpas make sure their license is current you can ask them about their continued education and how much of it is dedicated to the ca state law and ftb regulations ask them about their experience with similar cases overall a decently qualified tax professional should be able to handle a mail audit without an issue in person representation may be harder since it does not only require being competent in the tax law but also have some people skills

i think the main question is whether the 1.5 quarterly fee is so bad that it warrants losing $ 60,000 immediately suppose they pull it out now so they have 60000 = $ 160,000   they then invest this in a low cost index fund earning say 6 per year on average over 10 years   the result alternatively they leave the $ 220,000 in but tell the manager to invest it in the same index fund now   they earn nothing because the manager 's fees eat up all the gains 4 1.5 = 6 not perfectly accurate due to compounding but close enough since 6 is only an estimate anyway   the result the same $ 220,000 they started with this back of the envelope calculation suggests they will actually come out ahead by biting the bullet and taking the money out   however i would definitely not advise them to take this major step just based on this simple calculation   many other factors are relevant e.g. taxes when selling the existing investment to buy the index fund how much of their savings was this $ 300,000   also i do n't know anything about how investment works in hong kong so there could be some wrinkles that modify or invalidate this simple calculation   but it is a starting point based on what you say here i 'd say they should take the earliest opportunity to tell everyone they know never to work with this investment manager   i would go so far as to say they should look at his credentials e.g. see what kind of financial advisor certification he has if any look up the ethical standards of their issuers and consider filing a complaint   this is not because of the performance of the investments losing 25 of your money due to market swings is a risk you have to accept but because of the exorbitant fees   unless hong kong has got some crazy kind of investment management market charging 1.5 quarterly is highway robbery charging a for withdrawal is   personally i would seriously consider withdrawing the money even if the manager 's investments had outperformed the market

while i do not have an issue with treating customers clients well the whole mentality of the customer is always right needs to be re evaluated    in a case where a customer has unreasonable demands or is treating an employee poorly by no fault of the employee their privilege to be right ends in situations like that it is more important to stand up for your employees then it is to side with the customer if you do side with the customer in that situation it not only reinforces that behavior from the customer but makes the employee feel undervalued and will lead to morale issues if your workplace has consistent morale issues you will have a high turnover rate this will end up costing you considerably more not just in human capital but in workplace knowledge time and most prominently money chances are if a customer is being a huge drain of your resources they are likely not worth too much to your company to begin with see below    another reason why this mentality of every customer is valuable is a bad idea is found within the 80/20 principle simply put 80 of your revenue will come from 20 of your customer base and usually the 20 tend to be the lowest maintenance and have the lowest resource demand another application of this principle shows that 20 of your customer base accounts for 80 of the resource usage within your company the principle itself is not limited to 80/20 but the of a majority of x is provided by the minority of y is something that remains consistent across economies and cultures    in short not all customers are created equal and as a result do not deserve the same resources as one another in addition to this workforce integrity is more important in the long run than possibly losing a customer average firms provide good service excellent firms provide smart service

most of the reason is due to infrastructure costs in the suburbs being hidden in general taxes    suburban governments do n't make enough property tax revenue to maintain infrastructure    new suburban homes do n't pay affordable housing ordinance taxes of 10 20 which new chicago apartments must pay         schools is the first reason people leave chicago   an awful public school system forces the middle class to flee for the burbs even if they would have preferred city living

actually making money as an uber driver is pretty difficult doing it over the long term can cost more than you realize because of vehicle maintenance and gas very very few uber or lyft drivers i ve met have been doing it for 2 + years only one i ve met has been doing it from the beginning   in the beginning it was a much better deal for drivers rates were much better they have steadily declined to the point where it is challenging to actually come out ahead in the long run   i think that s what they were saying at least

great writing brown i wish the all the best in the vulture funds and doing a successful end run on the imf clearly argentina is not the bad guy in all this despite some people trying to make them appear as such by regurgitating the convenient spin    on a different note there is an interesting history lesson concerning the bank economic crisis of 1890 related to or rather caused by poor bank investments in argentina which were so massive that the debts had to be bank rolled by the british government since as is has become usual ever since it threatened to bring down the hole british financial system which was then the world 's debtor of last resort plus change plus la chose etc

i believe the reason is because society and the economy is set up a certain way and re enforced by the government your options are so people usually go with the most attractive of their limited options getting a mortgage if you want to dig deeper do some research as to why housing is expensive some things to consider you need the government 's permission to build houses thus limiting the competition in the home building market the housing bubble artificially setting house prices etc to summarize people need mortgages because houses are expensive and houses are expensive for many reasons big ones having to do with the government

gt;i nowhere mentioned equal amount of assets the point of my argument was wealth disparity and unless the rich pay more in taxes that disparity will grow   do you know what these words mean the wealth disparity is literally the difference in amount of assets   in fact you literally need a 100 marginal tax rate to prevent a divergence in disparity using your models

at least in the us a cashier 's check is just like a regular personal check only it 's guaranteed by the bank itself so the person accepting it can be pretty certain the check wo n't be returned for insufficient funds if the check is genuine most banks therefore have a policy for cashier 's checks that is very similar to their policies on regular checks and money orders if you are a member with an account in good standing they 'll make all or part of the money available to you according to their fund availability policy which is usually anywhere from immediately to 7 10 days with amounts over $ 5,000 banks will tend to put a hold on the funds to ensure it clears and they get their money if you are not a member then many banks will refuse to cash the check at all unless the cashier 's check is drawn on on that brand of bank so if the cashier 's check is issued by say chase bank chase banks will usually be willing to cash out the entire check to you immediately with properly provided id because the bank is guaranteed by them they are able to check their system and ensure the check is real and can clear the check instantly this policy is n't just up to individual banks entirely as it is defined by united states federal banking policies and federal regulations on availability of funds if you really must cash the check without a holding period and won't can't have a bank account of your own to perform this then you will generally need to go into a branch of the bank that is guaranteeing the check to be able to cash it out fully right away note that since the check might be issued by a bank with no branch near you you should have a back up plan generally banks will allow you to setup a special limited savings only account to deposit your check even if you do n't have a checking account so if no other option works you might try that as well the funds availability policies are the same but at least you 'll be able to cash it generally in 10 days time and then close the account and withdraw your money
