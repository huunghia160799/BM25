no securities brokers dealers in the united states are licensed to broker debt and equity in corporations there are additional commodities licenses to broker derivatives $ 20 american eagle coins or any other type of physical currency or physical precious metals can be traded or by anyone without a specific license except maybe a sales tax registration the only situation where a securities license would be required is if a legal entity is holding the coins and you deal broker an interest in that legal entity for example dealing in spdr gold shares or a similar structure holding either physical assets or the right to purchase those assets like a commodity pool would require a securities and/or commodities dealing license

just looking at the practicality because the total value of outstanding mortgages in the us is about $ 10 trillion and the government ca n't afford it without printing enough money to cause hyperinflation the cost of saving the banks was actually much less than the hundreds of billions of dollars that is quoted because most of it was loans that have been or will be repaid not cash payments

hey just letting you know that i 've sort of felt the same as you before i 'm not 29 yet only a few years younger and i too am in alberta knowing that many trades can be quite lucrative here i too dipped my hand in them namely the hvac and plumbing trades and after a bit i felt that they were n't for me and this was after using a year looking for any ins during the recession since nobody was hiring first years during that whole year in the times i was n't looking for a job i was researching and looking up videos of the trades and was thinking how after some career counseling soul searching all that jazz i 'm about to head back to school next week if things go well by the time i graduate i will almost be 30 with my first and probably only degree     i would n't consider the years from the time i graduated high school to today where i think i 've figured out what i want to do a waste but instead i look at them as years where i grew as an adult and gaining real world experience in a few areas i 've in a future employer may look at them as wasted years but it is up to me to spin them in a positive way as my story just know that you are n't alone in this situation and i 'm sure there 's plenty of people worldwide in their 20 's and 30 's who are still trying to figure out what they want to do keep your head up and good luck

not exactly   my sewing needle example had nothing to do with population growth   population growth offsets nothing   unemployment percentages would go up as populations grow if there was a net loss in jobs   instead unemployment goes up and down just like it always has     how did population growth offset farmers using tractors to get you more food   africa also has seen explosive population growth without using nearly as many tractors as we use how are they doing   the fact of the matter is more things are being produced   this means more people are buying more things   not that there are more people being born buying more things but people have greater buying power because as more things hit the market their price goes down   what income class would you have to be in to buy a computer in 1985 compared to now   what was the capability of producing a computer between 1985 and now   automation simply this is one area we no longer have to focus on now we can focus on other areas    also where are you getting that we are approaching unsustainable levels of population growth   please look up atlanta vs year 2000   look at the difference in population per   how can you say we are quickly approaching that point

yes you can create a paypal business account without having formalized a business with government filings and whatnot at its simplest terms having a business is simply doing business as d b a a trade name   you can use the address of a private mail box such as those provided at the ups store   ask any kid with a lemonade stand or a box of girl scout cookies you only need to engage in government formalities like registering an llc or getting a tax ein when you cross certain thresholds of activity and paying for things is generally not it   also some of businesses for some relationships will require the business formalities like an ein which in turn will require creating a trade name and registering it with the state   for instance if you set up a traditional credit card merchant account they 'll probably want that

what happens to consumer debt if a    country defaults on its debt   nothing just as nothing happens to your debt when your neighbor defaults if you have debts that have floating interest rates those may and probably will hike how will a debt default by a country    affect government backed loans such as    mortgages and student loans those that are already closed will probably not be affected as you 've got the money already and signed the loan agreement those that are not closed will probably be delayed or not funded at all however if any of the debts allows the debtor to request an early collection which i think is rather rare on the consumer market someone else 's default may lead to the debtor 's request for the money earlier than expected

the quickest way to approach this question is to first understand that it compares flows vs. levels market size is usually stated as an annual or other period figure e.g. the market size of will be $ in 2019   this is a flow figure market capitalization is a level figure at any given point in time e.g. the market cap of the company was $ 20 million at the end of its last fiscal quarter confusion sometimes occurs when levels and flows are used loosely for comparisons   it is common for media to make statements such as joe billionaire is worth more than the gdp of   that is comparing a current level net worth with an annual flow gdp with this in mind there are a variety of conditions where a company 's equity market value will exceed its market size   the most extreme example is an innovating development stage enterprise say a biotech company developing a new market for a new product the current market size may be nil while the enterprise is worth something greater the primary reason however for situations where a company 's equity market cap is greater than its market size is usually that the financial market expects the enterprise and oftentimes its market though this is n't necessary to grow substantially over time and hence the discounted value of the company may be greater than the current or near future market size a final example   us annual gdp which comprises of much more than corporate incomes and profits for 2014 was about $ while the nation 's total equity market value in 2014 was $ both according to the world bank   that latter figure also does n't include the trillions of corporate debts these companies have issued so the total market cap of us inc. is substantially greater than $

this often occurs because of misrepresentation of the corporation income most of the income in the us is payed at or a little below the 35 rate but when the figure is calculated non us income is counted alongside us income   for some reason in the us it makes sense for corporations to pay income taxes in the countries they actually made the income in and the us mind you only usa and have this sort of backwards thinking   so yeah if they make $ 100 worldwide income out of which $ 50 is us income and the company reports $ 15 in us taxes they get represented as paying 15 effective tax rate when in reality they payed 30 on us taxes for their us income

there are ways to mitigate but since you 're not protected by a tax deferred advantaged account the realized income will be taxed but you can do any of the to reduce the burden prefer selling either short positions that are at loss or long positions that are at gain do not invest in stocks but rather in index funds that do the rebalancing for you without significant tax impact on you if you are rebalancing portfolio that includes assets that are not stocks real estate mainly consider performing 1031 exchanges instead of plain sale and re purchase maximize your ira contributions even if non deductible and convert them to roth ira hold your more volatile investments and individual stocks there you will not be taxed when rebalancing maximize your 401 k hsa sep ira and any other tax advantaged account you may be eligible for on some accounts you 'll pay taxes when withdrawing on others you wo n't for example roth ira/401k accounts are not taxed at all when withdrawing qualified distributions while traditional ira/401k are taxed as ordinary income during the low income years consider converting portions of traditional accounts to roth

basically speaking japanese bank accounts are identified by three numbers the four digit bank number   for example is mitsubishi tokyo bank the three digit branch number for example = main branch for mitsubishi the account number   this is your account number your atm cash card and passbook will have these numbers on it in the format xxxx    when you use an atm to send money to someone else like your landlord you but in these three numbers or use the search feature instead for the first two   this works the same whether you are talking about mitsubishi etc   the only thing to note is that while real banks use locations for the branch number i.e. branch branch etc online only banks like sony bank bank sbi etc use fake locations like colors etc   this does n't matter much though japan post bank is technically not a bank and uses a totally different system though recently they have come up with a strange formula to convert your jp bank account number into a normal bank account number so you can send payments to it as shown above all of this is basically for domestic transfers only though   if you want to transfer money internationally there are two basic ways the official way   go to your bank overseas and give them the swift code and account code for your bank likely the branch code will be necessary as well   the problem here is that they will likely charge a high fee for sending the money and your bank in japan may also charge a high fee for receiving it   in addition to any currency conversion fees   a second problem is that only the very major banks even have swift codes use a money transfer service that can handle both japan and your other country   for example you can use 2 paypal accounts only in the direction of from japan to overseas though or you can use something like either way iban is a european standard and is n't used in japan if you just want to spend some money in japan the most convenient way is probably a foreign visa debit card   or you can use a foreign atm card in japan to withdraw cash and then deposit it into your japanese account

all very good answers for the most part but i have a definition for good and bad debt which is a little bit different from those mentioned here so far the definitions come from robert kiyosaki in his book rich dad poor dad which i have applied to all my debts good debt good debt is debt used to fund a money making asset an asset which puts money into your pockets or bank account each month in other words the income produced by that asset is more than all the expenses including the interest repayments on the debt associated with the asset bad debt bad debt is debt used to fund both money losing assets and non assets where the interest repayments on the debt are more than any income if any at all produced by the goods or services the debt was used to purchase so that you need to take money out of your pockets or bank account each month to sustain the debt based on this definition a mortgage used to purchase the house you live in would be classed as bad debt why because you are making interest repayments on the mortgage and you have other expenses related to the house like rates and maintenance but you have no income being produced by the house even a mortgage on an investment or rental property where the rent is not enough to cover all the expenses is considered to be bad debt for the debt on an investment property to be considered as good debt the rent would have to cover the full interest payments and all other expenses in other words it would need to be a positively geared or a cashflow positive asset why is this definition important in distinguishing between good and bad debt because it looks at the cashflow associated with the debt and not the profit the main reason why most investors and businesses end up selling up or closing down is due to insufficient cashflow it may be a profitable business or the value of the property may have increased since you bought it but if you do n't have enough cash every month to pay the bills associated with the asset you will need to sell it if the asset produces enough cashflow to pay for all the expenses associated with the asset then you do n't have to fund the asset through other sources of income or savings this is important in two ways firstly if you are working and suddenly lose your job you do n't have to worry about paying for the asset as it is more than paying for itself secondly if you do n't have to dig into your other source s of income or savings to sustain the asset then theoretically you can buy an unlimited number of similar type assets just a note regarding the mortgage to buy a house you live in being classed as bad debt even though in this definition it is considered as bad debt there are usually other factors which still can make this kind of debt worthwhile firstly you have to live and the fact that you have to live means that if you did not buy the house you would probably be renting instead and still be stuck with a similar monthly payment secondly the house will still appreciate over the long term so in the end you will end up with an asset compared to nothing if you were renting just another note to mention the definition provided by john stern debt is a technology that allows borrower to bring forward their spending it 's a financial time machine that 's a clever way to think of it especially when it comes to good debt

i 'm not sure what raising your credit limit would do to your score in the short term   i do n't think it 's a clear win though   your percent utilization will go down more available credit for the same amount of debt but your available credit will also go up which may be a negative since potentially you can default on more debt if you 're interested in monitoring your score credit karma will let you do that for free

it depends on your bank and your mortgage contract details if they are willing to handle it that way but you are correct in your assumption that you should be able to save the interest for the twenty days which accumulates to significant savings a rough estimate for the overall saving is 20 years x 3 x of the days = one time 40 of your monthly payment

this essentially depends on how you prefer to measure your performance i will just give a few simple examples to start let me know if you 're looking for something more if you just want to achieve maximum $ return then you should always use maximum margin so long as your expected return is higher than your cost to borrow for example suppose you can use margin to double your investment and the cost to borrow is 7 if you 're investing in some security that expects to return 10 then your annual return on an account opened with $ 100 is 2 $ 100 10 $ 100 7 $ 100 = 13 so you see the expected return amount of leverage and cost to borrow will all factor in to your return suppose you want to also account for the additional risk you 're incurring then you could use the sharpe ratio for example suppose the same security has volatility of 20 and the risk free rate is 5 then the sharpe ratio without leverage is 10 5 20 = 0.25 the sharpe ratio using maximum margin is then 13 5 2 20 = 0.2 where the 13 comes from the above formula so on a risk adjusted basis it 's better not to utilize margin in this particular example

right as i stated i agree that it will cause greater variance from the true intrinsic value for individual equities to take this example to an extreme traders can throw darts at a board of ticker symbols purchase them and still diversify away most firm specific risk you 're correct in stating that such a strategy will eventually cause systematic market failures if everyone does it but the herd goes where they can make the most profit and right now that is with etfs    when fund managers prove they have foresight enough to exploit any systematic failures that this causes or can start beating etf returns the herd will flock back to them i only meant to point out the reasoning behind why this is happening not advocating one over the other and also to point out that paul singer should n't whine to re purpose an old saying do n't get mad get even by making your investors rich

yes more leverage increases the variance of your individual portfolio variance of your personal net worth the simple way to think about it is that if you only own only 50 of your risky assets then you can own twice as many risky assets that means they will move around twice as much in absolute terms expected returns and risk if risk is variance both go up if you lend rather than borrow then you might have only half your net worth in risky assets and then your expected returns and variation in returns will go down note the practice of using leverage differs from portfolio theory in a couple important ways

the essence of your question is whether it 's worth 1000 to you to spread the payments over half a year   the longer payment plan is just a loan and buying the loan costs you more money   the question is whether you think the loan is a good price   i suspect it 's over priced the classic financial analysis would be whether you could get a better return on the loan opportunity costs   but we are talking about what are presumably not terribly big sums of money so it may make more sense to analyze this amount of money in more personalized terms   in that case remember to consider the convenience is it significantly easier to budget with the 6-month plan   watch out for other costs to the loan such as late penalties and other loan fees if you find the periodic payments convenient or you have a short horizon high yield investment then the 6-month loan might work   otherwise if you can afford it it makes more sense to buy the phone upfront

if you want to spend all of your money in the next few years then a cd protects you from the risk of a bear market however if your time horizon is longer than 10 years then the stock market is a better bet since it is less effected by inflation risk also as you point out average stock returns are much higher ignoring volatility   on the whole cd 's appeal to people who would otherwise save their money in cash   generally it seems these people are simply afraid of stocks and bonds because those securities can lose nominal value as well as real value   i suspect this is largely because these people do n't understand inflation nor the historical long term index fund performance

gt;it 's tremendously more difficult to make large percentage gains on $ 1 billion than it is to make gains on $ 1 million   this is true however when you consider the 2 and 20 fee structure that is typical of hedge funds it becomes evident why managing more money is generally better with a fund with 1b under management they earn 20 million dollars for turning the lights on even if they only have a 3 return in a given year that 's another six million dollars    a fund managing a million in assets would have to have a return of 40 to net $ 100,000 so while the law of diminishing returns may be working in your favor if you are managing less money if your goal is to make money for yourself it 's pretty clear why managing more money is better

this is more of an interesting question then it looks on first sight in the usa there are some tax for mortgage payments which we do n’t have in the uk unless you are renting out the property with the mortgage   so firstly work out the interest rate on each loan taking into account any tax etc then you need to consider the charges for paying off a loan for example often there is a charge if you pay off a mortgage    these days in the uk most allow you to pay off at least 10 a year without hitting such a charge but check your mortgage offer document how interest is calculated when you make an early payment may be different between your loans so check then you need to consider what will happen if you need another loan    some mortgages allow you to take back any overpayments most do n’t   re mortgaging to increase the size of your mortgage often has high charges then there is the effect on your credit rating paying more of a loan each month then you need to often improves your credit rating you also need to consider how interest rates may change for example if you mortgage is a fixed rate but your car loan is not and you expect interest rates to rise do the calculations based on what you expect interest rates to be over the length of the loans however normally it is best to pay off the loan with the highest interest rate first   reasons for penalties for paying of some loans in the uk in the uk some short term loans normally under 3 years add on all the interest at the start of the loan so you do n’t save any interest if you pay of the loan quicker     this is due to the banks having to cover their admin costs and there being no admin charge to take out the loan fixed rate loans have penalties for overpayment as otherwise when interest rates go down people will change to other lenders so making it a one way bet that the banks will always loose    i believe in the usa the central bank will under right such loans so the banks do n’t take the risk

take some of the commentary on home buying forums with a grain of salt i too have read some of the commentary on these forums such as myfico or zillow and rarely is the right advice given or proper followup done typical 401k withdrawals for home purchase would not be considered a hardship however most employer 401k plans will allow you to take a loan for 401k as long as you provide suitable documentation statement real estate contract good faith estimate or some other form of suitable documentation as described by the plan administrator   for instance i just took a 401k loan to pay for closing costs and i had to provide only the real estate contract could i not follow through with the contract sure but what if i am found out for fraud then the plan administrator would probably end up turning the distribution into a taxable distribution i would n't go to jail in this hypothetical situation i am only stealing from myself but the law states that certain loan situations are not liable for tax as long as that situation still exists in the home loan situation my employer allows for a low interest 10 year loan my employer also allows for a pre approved loan for any purpose this would be a low interest 5 year loan   there is also the option to not do a loan at all but normally that is only allowed after you have exhausted all your loan options and the government makes it intentionally harsh 30 penalty at least to discourage people from dumping their tax free haven 401k accounts that all being said many plans offer no prepayment penalty so like my employer has for us i can pay it all back in full whenever i want or make micropayments every month otherwise it comes out of my pay stub biweekly so if it were to fall through i could just put it all back like it never happened though with my plan there is a cooling off period of 7 days before i can take another loan keep in mind that if you leave your employer then the full amount becomes a taxable distribution unless you pay it back within a certain period of time after leaving the employer   whether this fits your financial situation is up to you but a loan is definitely preferred over a partial or full withdrawal since you are paying yourself back for your rightly earned retirement which is just as important

you are going to need a lawyer anyway so check with him    but here is a path you might be able to go down    put the house in your name right from the get go   he gives you the money but you sign over a promissory note to him so that you net less than $ 14000 gift tax annual exclusion for the calendar year he can gift everyone in your household 14k per year tax free and he could gift it to you and your partner in less than 7 years   you can pay him back in anyway you like or not at all as the promissory note could be reduced by per year i think a cpa and lawyer in your state would be able to confirm that this would work for you

first of all it is absolutely not constitutional for any branch of the us government to outsource its primary functions to a private corporation   but more to your point the constitution provides that no state shall make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts   they will argue that federal reserve notes are that taxes are voluntary that washington d.c. is not a state that the fed is not private or even sometimes that the gold standard is still in force   but each of those is contradicted by their actions

for example started an animation studio and production developing company to produce something in the ballpark of $ and he had a $ 12k yearly salary i have no clue what you mean as others have mentioned i 'm not sure what the 12 million refers to   do you mean total cost of created by the company in a year or   if so 12 million would amount to say 5 to 20 major brand name tv commercials for example   do you mean the cost of plant so for a tv commercial production company you mean purchasing desks drawing pads and so on your specific example of a film or tv commercial production company is a bad example it 's not really a business that is to say it does not rely on capital and return on capital the way famous film or tv commercial production companies happens is precisely like this a young guy girl g perhaps a designer or is working just as you say for a menial wage at a film company g got that first job perhaps out of art school   g gets a chance at doing a photo shoot animation or helping direct a tv commercial   g does a fantastic job later that year a large important animation or commercial job arrives at the company due to the earlier excellent result g is allowed to work on the new one g again he does a fantastic job   soon within that company g is a highly regarded or director and has attracted fame amongst colleagues and clients eventually g hears of a company xyz hotel that needs a tv ad made or an animation or whatever g says to xyz look you could spend $ 230,000 with a production company and in reality they 'd have me direct it anyway i 'm leaving to work independently so i will do your job for only $ 190,000 in a word xyz says yes and hands over a cheque for $ 190,000   g spends $ 160,000 on the usual actors editing etc and uses 2 months of g 's own time and pockets $ 5000 after tax g then does n't get a job for a couple months and then gets three more in the new year because the commercial for xyz was so good xyz gave him another couple to do for another product line eventually g has just enough money coming in that he hires a few freelance people for a few weeks here and there a and so on   eventually g has enough tv ads solidly booked g can risk actually hiring long time friend p as a producer   p spends most of her time actually bringing in more work and it builds from there eventually you have a very busy well known in the industry tv commercial production company with many staff and endless clients example say it might be at some point in there say around year three g would like to borrow the odd million bucks to basically help with cashflow the answer to that is nothing more than through business contacts g knows a wealthy dentist whoever who is prepared to do that but note carefully that at that point g 's company is already very firmly established famous for doing 20 spectacular commercials and so on   note too that 999 times out of 1000 when this happens the money evaporates and the dentist d never sees a penny back in that case g only much much later once the company has many many staff and great cashflow could the production company actually borrow from a bank or perhaps from actual investors which is more what you have in mind regarding your four categories   numbers 1 and 3 are totally wrong they do not work at all like you are asking indeed the very simple answer is borrow money to start a category 1 or 3 type of business it 's totally the only exception would be if you literally just have an extremely rich uncle who loans you a few million to start an animation studio which would be completely   because in that example company xyz could not care less if you have an animation studio ie your uncle has given you a platinum card and you bought a building some drawing pads and a few dozen macs   xyz just could n't care less   all they care about is your folio of work   in this example rsa would get the job     my guess is you 're thinking people somehow magically go around borrowing money to get businesses like that started   your examples 1 and 3 the simple answer is they do n't and ca n't   your fears are

agreed but often it seems that gray area is exactly what these innovations are looking for   repeatedly pushing down onto the struggling individual the past responsibilities of the wealthy corporation     say this thing picks up steam and is walmart   john is walking out the door and critical deliveries need to be made   john was a bit short last month and could n't wait for the 2 week insurance reimbursement process   so despite the team lead 's did n't upgrade his insurance coverage this month   he did n't want to be that guy so did n't confirm deny getting modifying coverage to the lead   the team lead asks john to take the packages but does n't really follow through on the insurance check   john wrecks his car and his back   john 's insurance company rejects the claim   the team lead and john are fired because not checking having the insurance was against written policy but and away all the way back up to the 1 online retailer spot   so often obstacles are easily   i get the personal responsibility angle for all involved but social financial pressure can be brutal   the problem is that situations are left as is and the moneyed parties are ignorant   my guess is few compile stats on sol uber lyft drivers in similar situations

two things to consider when it comes to advice do n't be penny wise and pound foolish it is an ongoing debate whether active management vs passive indexes are a better choice and i am sure others can give good arguments for both sides i look at it as you are paying for advice if your adviser will teach you about investing and serve your interests having his advise will probably prevent you from making some dumb mistakes a few mistakes such as jumping in out of markets based on fear speculation can eliminate any savings in fees however if you feel confident that you have the resources and can make good decisions why pay for advise you do n't need edit in this case my opinion is that you do n't need a complex plan at this time the money you would spend on financial advise would not be the best use of the funds   that said to your main question i would delay making any long term decisions with these funds until you know you are done with your education and on an established career path this period of your life can be very volatile and you may find yourself halfway through college and wanting to change majors or start a different path give yourself the option to do that by deferring long term investment decisions until you have more stability for that reason i would avoid focusing on retirement savings as others point out you are limited in how much you can contribute per year if you want to start roth is your best bet but if you put it in do n't pull it out that is a bad habit to get into personal finance is as much about developing habits as it is doing math a low turnover index fund may be appropriate but you do n't want to end up where you want to buy a house or start a business and your investment has just lost 10   i would keep at least half in a liquid safe account until after graduation any debt you incur because you tied up this money will eliminate any investment gains if any good luck edited to clarify retirement savings

i am not sure how anyone is answering this unless they know what the loan was for   for instance if it is for a house you can put a lien on the house   if it is for the car in most states you can take over ownership of it    point being is that you need to go after the asset    if there is no asset you need to go after you friend   again we need more specifics to determine the best course of action which could range from you suing and wages from your friend to going to small claims court   part of this process is also getting a hold of the lending institution   by letting them know what is going on they may be able to help you they are good at tracking people down for free also the lender may be able to give you options   for example if it is for a car a bank may help you clear this out if you get the car back plus penalty   if a car is not in the red on the loan and it is in good condition the bank turns a profit on the default   if they can recover it for free they will be willing to work with you   i worked in repo when younger and on more than a few occasions we had the cosigner helping   it went down like this co signer gets pissed like you and calls bank bank works out a plan and tells cosigner to default cosigner defaults banks gives cosigner rights to repo vehicle cosigner helps or actually vehicle bank gets car back bank car bank asks cosigner for x amount sometimes nothing but not usually cosigner pays x bank does not hit credit bank releases loan and sells car   i am writing this like it is easy but it really requires that asset is still in good condition that cosigner can get to the asset and that the friend still is around and trusts cosigner   i have seen more than a few promise to deliver and come up short and couple conspiring with the friend    i basically think most of the advice you have gotten so far is crap and you have n't provided enough info to give perfect advice   seeking a lawyer is a joke   going after a fleeing party could eat up 40 50 billable hours   it is n't like you are suing a business or something   the lawyer could cost as much as repaying the loan and most lawyers will act like it is a snap of their fingers until they have you dry just really advice for the most part i would suggest talking to the bank and defaulting but again need 100 of the details    the other part is cosigning the loan   why the hell would you cosign a loan for a friend   most parents wo n't cosign a loan for their own kids   and if you are cosigning a loan you write up a simple contract and make the non payment penalties extremely costly for your friend   i have seen simple contracts that include 30 interests rates that were upheld by courts

i would suggest both as an investor and as someone who has some experience with a family run trust not my own that this is probably not something you should get involved with unless the money is money you 're not worried about money that otherwise would turn into trips to the movies or something like that   if you 're willing to treat it as such then i 'd say go for it first off this is not a short or medium term investment   this sort of thing will not be profitable right away and it will take quite a few years to become profitable to the point that you could take money out of it if ever   your money will be effectively if not actually locked up for years and be nearly entirely illiquid second it 's not necessarily a good investment even considering that   real estate is something people tend to feel like it should be an amazing investment that just makes you money and is better than risky things like the stock market except it 's really not   it 's quite risky vulnerable to things like the 2008 crash but also to things like a local market being a bit down or having several months with no renter    the amount your fund will have in it at most $ wo n't be enough to buy even one property for years $ 1500/month means you 're looking at what 100 150 months before you have enough and as such wo n't have enough to buy multiple properties for even longer which is where you reach some stability   having a washing machine break down or a roof leak is a big deal when you only have one property to manage having five or six properties spreads out the risk significantly you wo n't get tax breaks from this of course and that 's where the real issue is for you   you would be far better off putting your money in a roth ira or a regular ira but based on your career choice and current income i 'd strongly consider a roth   you 'll get tax free growth less risky than this fund and probably faster growing but regardless of both of those tax free   that 15 25 that uncle sam is giving you back is a huge huge deal greater than any return a fund is going to give you and if they promise that high run far and fast finally as someone who 's watched a family trust work at managing itself it 's a huge huge headache and not something i 'd recommend at least unless it comes with money in which case it 's of course a different story   you wo n't agree on investments inevitably and you 'll end up spending huge amounts of time trying to convince each other to go with your idea and it will likely end up being fairly stagnant and conservative because that 's what everyone will be able to at least not object to it might be something you all enjoy doing in which case good luck but definitely not my cup of tea

reading financial statements is important in the sense that it gives you a picture of whether revenues and profits are growing or shrinking and what management thinks the future will look like the challenge is there are firms that make computers read filings for them and inform their trading strategy if the computer thinks the stock price is below the growth model it 's likely to bid the stock up and since it 's automated it 's moving it faster than you can open your web browser does this mean you should n't read them in a sense no the only sensible trading strategy is to assume you hold things for as long as their fundamentals exceed market value financial statements are where you find those fundamentals so you should read them but your question is is it worth it for investors my answer is no the market generally factors information in quickly and efficiently you 're better off sticking to passive mutual funds than trying to trade the better reason to learn to read these filings is to get a better sense of your employer potential employers competitors and even suppliers knowing what your margins are what your suppliers margins and acquisitions are and what they 're planning can inform your own decision making

straight line depreciation is the easiest method of depreciation do n't over think it   straight line = assets cost assets salvage life   in this case the straight line is $ 2 m per year it is not unless you are looking at accumulated depreciation account on the balance sheet   here is a schedule of the depreciation   year 1 $ 2 m year 2 $ 2 m year 3 $ 2 m year 4 $ 2 m year 5 $ 2 m   see ca n't get much easier than that   once you get into more complicated questions they 'll throw tax rates at you and ask about cash flows or the npv of the cash flows   you need to take into account the fact that the depreciation is not a cash expense but it does affect cash flow by reducing the taxable income of the project   also you need to consider the fact that the asset will be sold in year 5 and the value will need to be part of your cash flow and npv calculations   i hope this was helpful if not i 'll try to do my best answering any other questions   good luck

sorry my response was supposed to be to the above comment not yours my main point was that in africa where there was already a large population did not require bringing in people which you would need to incentivize to move to hence offering the free carrot of property rights to settlers of na to extract resources instead the british and other european powers just used the local populace to extract the resources the main reason the us and canada are well off is that property rights were established very early on and this encouraged people to invest and produce more because the higher production accrued to the producer and the producer would have legal recourse should a negative externality be put upon them by someone else obviously there were other reasons as well but property rights are huge this is true globally now in encouraging people to grow their assets part of the reason africa is still so screwed up is that many of their institutions and governments are too corrupt to protect their citizens property rights thereby discouraging investment and production

credit cards are almost never closed for inactivity i have had dozens of cards for years on end and only one was ever closed on me for inactivity i would bet a single 1 $ transaction per calendar year would keep all your cards open   as such you could forget automating the process and just spend 20 minutes a year making manual 1 $ payments e.g. to your isp utility company google play etc   alternatively many charities will let you set up an automatic monthly donation for any amount e.g. 1 $ to wikipedia or perhaps you could treat yourself to an mp3 once a month arguably a charitable donation in the age of file sharing side note i use both of these strategies to get the 12 debit card transactions per month required by my checking account

news about a company is not the only thing that affects its stock 's price there is also supply and demand   that of course is influenced by news but it is not the only actor   an insider with a large position in their company 's stock may want to diversify his overall portfolio and thus need to sell a large amount of stock   that may be significant enough to increase supply and likely reduce the stock 's price somewhat that brings me to another influence on stock price perception   executives and other insiders with large positions in their company 's stock have to be careful about how and when they sell some of that stock as to not worry the markets   many investors watch insider selling to gauge the health of the company which brings me to another important point   there are many things that may be considered news which is material to a certain company and its stock   it is not just quarterly filings earnings reports and such   there is also news related to competitors news about the economy or a certain sector news about some weather event that affects a major supplier news about a major earthquake that will impact the economy of a nation which can then have knock on effects to other economies etc there are also a lot of investors with varying needs which will influence supply and demand   an institutional investor needing to diversify may reduce their position in a stock and thus increase supply enough that it impacts the stock 's price   meanwhile individual investors will make their transactions at varying times during the day   in the aggregate that may have significant impacts on supply and demand the overall point being that there are a lot of inputs and a lot of actors in a complicated system   even if you focus just on news there are many things that fall into that category news does not come out at regular intervals and it does not necessarily spread evenly   that alone could make for a highly variable environment

if your uncle is looking to maintain life insurance coverage for specific shorter period of time he may want to look into hybrid life insurance if you buy a hybrid universal life policy the premium and death benefit can be guaranteed to last until any age since most permanent policies focus on cash value accumulation it is hard for most people to find cheap whole life or affordable universal life consumers only looking for a longer duration have a more flexible choice with a new hybrid product that combines elements of both term life coverage and universal life hybrid universal   policies are much cheaper then other permanent coverage such as whole life coverage because they do not emphasize cash value accumulation however the premiums and death benefits can still be guaranteed to a specific age i.e. 85 90 95 100 so premiums can be scaled to coordinate with your desired budget and the face amount required for your family typical universal life and whole life insurance contracts only allow for lifetime coverage however hybrid universal life offers a much smaller premium because the coverage can be into a specific age if the does live beyond the originally selected age the death benefit will simply begin getting smaller while the original premium will   continue to remain the same

i made an investing mistake many eight years ago specifically i invested a very large sum of money in a certain triple leveraged etf the asset has not yet been sold but the value has decreased to maybe one 8th or 5th of the original amount i thought the risk involved was the volatility i did n't realize that due to the nature of the asset the value would be constantly decreasing towards zero anyhow my question is what to do next   i would advise you to sell it asap you did n't mention what etf it is but chances are you will continue to lose money the complicating factor is that i have since moved out of the united states and am living abroad i.e. japan i am permanent resident of my host country i have a steady salary that is paid by a company incorporated in my host country and pay taxes to the host government i file a tax return to the u.s. government each year but all my income is excluded so i do not pay any taxes in this way i do not think that i can write anything off on my u.s. tax return also i have absolutely no idea if i would be able to write off any losses on my japanese tax return i 've entrusted all the family tax issues to my wife would this be possible   i ca n't answer this question but you seem to be looking for information on cross border tax harvesting if google does n't yield useful results i 'd suggest you talk to an accountant who is familiar with the relevant tax codes are there any other available options that would not involve having to tell my wife about the loss which would be inevitable if i were to go the tax write off route in japan this is off topic but you should probably have an honest conversation with your wife regardless if i continue to hold onto this asset the value will decrease lower and lower any suggestions as to what to do see above close your position asap for more information on the pitfalls of leveraged etfs finra what happens if i hold longer than one trading day   while there may be trading and hedging strategies that justify holding these investments longer than a day buy and hold investors with an intermediate or long term time horizon should carefully consider whether these etfs are appropriate for their portfolio as discussed above because leveraged and inverse etfs reset each day their performance can quickly diverge from the performance of the underlying index or benchmark in other words it is possible that you could suffer significant losses even if the long term performance of the index showed a gain

many investors do n't invest for the short term and so a stock nose diving in the short run will not affect their long term strategy so they will simply hold on to it until it recovers additionally funds that track an index have to hold on to the constituents of that index no matter what happens to its value over the period within trading limits both of these kinds of investors will be able to lend stock in a company out and not trigger a forced buy in on a short term change if the underlying long term health of the company changes or it is removed from indices it is likely that this will change however employee stock plans and other investors who are linked directly to the company or who have a vested interest in the company other than in a financial way will also be unwilling or unable to sell on a down turn in the company they will similarly be able to lend their stock in the short term

since most of the answers are flawed in their logic i decided to respond here 1 what if you lose your job you ca n't pay back the loan the point of the question was to reduce the amount paid per month so obviously it would be easier to pay off the 401k loan rather than the 3 separate loans that are in place now also it 's stated in the question that there 's a mortgage a child with medical costs a car loan student loans other debt on the list of priorities the 401k loan does not make the top 10 concerns if they lost their job 2 consider stopping the 401k contribution this is such a terrible idea if you make the full contribution to the 401k and then just withdraw from the 401k rather than getting a loan you only pay a 10 penalty tax you still get 90 of the company match 3 you lose compound interest while currently the interest you get on a 401k depending on how that money is invested is higher than the interest you pay on your loans which means it would be advantageous to keep the loans and keep contributing to the 401k it 's very unreliable and might even go down i think you actually have a good case for getting a loan against the 401k if a you have your spending and budget under control b your income is consistent c you are certain that the loan will be paid back my suggestion would be to take a loan against the 401k but keep the current spending on the loans consistent if you do n't need the extra $ 150 per month you really should try to pay off the loans as fast as you can if you do need the $ 150 extra you are lowering the mental threshold for getting more loans in the future

there are some great answers on this site similar to what you asked with either a non or a us centric focus i would read those answers as well to give yourself more points of view on early investing there are a few differences between canada and the us from an investing perspective that you should also then consider namely tax rules healthcare and education i 'll get healthcare and education out of the way quickly just note the difference in perspective in canada of having government healthcare putting money into health savings plans or focusing on insurance as a workplace benefit is not a key motivating factor but more a nice to have for education it is more common in canada for a student to either pay for school while working summer part time jobs or at least taking on manageable levels of debt because it is typically not quite as expensive as private colleges in the us there is still somewhat of a culture of saving for your child 's education here but it is not as much of a necessity as it may be in the us from an investing perspective i will quickly note some common though not universal general advice before getting canadian specific i have blatantly stolen the meat of this section from ben miller 's great answer here oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing once you have a solid financial footing some of canadian investing are below for all the tax specific plans i 'm about to mention note that the banks do a very good job here of tricking you into believing they are complex and that you need your hand to be held i have gotten some criminally bad tax advice from banking reps so at the risk of sounding i recommend that you learn everything you can beforehand and only go into your bank when you already know the right answer the account types themselves just involve a few pages of paperwork to open and the banks will often do that for free they make up their fees in offering investment types that earn them management fees once the accounts are created be sure to separate the investments stocks vs bonds etc vs the investment vehicles canada has tax free savings accounts where you can contribute a certain amount of money every year and invest in just about anything you want from bonds to stocks to mutual funds any income you earn in this account is completely tax free you can withdraw these investments any time you want but you ca n't re contribute until january 1st of next year ie you invest $ 5k today in stocks held in a tfsa and they grow to $ 6k you withdraw $ 6k in july no tax is involved on january 1st next year you can re contribute a new $ 6 k and also any additional amounts added to your total limit annually tfsa 's are good for short term liquid investments if you do n't know for sure when you 'll need the money putting it in a tfsa saves you some tax but does n't commit you to any specific plan of action registered retirement savings plans allow you to contribute money based on your employment income accrued over your lifetime in canada the contributions are deducted from your taxable income in the year you make them when you withdraw money from your rrsp the amount you withdraw gets added as additional income in that year ie you invest $ 5k today in stocks held in an rrsp and get a $ 5k deduction from your taxable income this year the investments grow to $ 6k you withdraw $ 6k next year your taxable income increases by $ 6k note that if the investments were held normally outside of an rrsp you would have a taxable gain of only 50 of the total gain but withdrawing the amount from your rrsp makes the gain 100 taxable on january 1st next year you cannot this amount once withdrawn it can not be except for below items rrsp 's are good for long term investing for retirement there are a few factors at play here 1 you get an immediate tax deduction thus increasing the original size of investment by deferring tax to the withdrawal date 2 your investments compound tax free you only pay tax at the end when you withdraw not annually on earnings and 3 many people expect that they will have a lower tax rate when they retire than they do today some warnings about rrsp 's 1 they are less liquid than tfsa 's you ca n't put money in take it out and put it in again in general when you take it out it 's out and therefore useless unless you leave it in for a long time 2 income gets re characterized to be fully taxable no dividend tax credits no reduced capital gains tax rate and 3 there is no guarantee that your tax rate on retirement will be less than today if you contribute only when your tax rate is in the top bracket then this is a good bet but even still in 30 years tax rates might rise by 20 who knows meaning you could end up paying more tax on the back end than you saved in the short term home buyer plan rrsp withdrawals my single favourite piece of advice for young canadians is this if you contribute to an rrsp at least 3 months before you make a down payment on your first house you can withdraw up to $ 25k from your rrsp without paying tax to use for the down payment then over the next ~10 years you need to money back to your rrsp and you will ultimately be taxed when you finally take the money out at retirement this means that contributing up to 25k to an rrsp can multiply your savings available for a down payment by the amount of your tax rate so if you make you 'll save on your 25k deposited turning your down payment into $ getting immediate access to the tax savings while also having access to the cash for a downpayment makes the home buyer plan a solid way to make the most out of your rrsp as long as one of your near term goals is to own your own home registered pension plans are even less liquid than rrsps tax wise they basically work the same you get a deduction in the year you contribute and are taxed when you withdraw the big difference is that there are rules on when you are allowed to withdraw only in retirement barring specific circumstances typically your employer 's matching program if you have one will be inside of an note that 's and rrsp 's reduce your taxes on your employment immediately if you contribute through a work program that means you get the tax savings during the year instead of all at once a year later on april 30th note that i have attempted at all times to keep my advice current with applicable tax legislation but i do not guarantee accuracy research these things yourself because i may have missed something relevant to your situation i may be just plain wrong and tax law may have changed since i wrote this to when you read it

well first and foremost you 're out of luck if gamestop hits rough times and stops refunding cash or files bankruptcy it 's a really really really bad idea to use something other than an fdic insured bank as a bank this is a lot of administrative effort on your part when internet banking exists and most of the online checking accounts refund atm fees   this idea is also not funny or hilarious i would call it something but the mods here will just edit it out

the complicates things the traditional of a marriage is what 's mine is yours what 's yours is mine with such a traditional marriage it does n't matter too much which partner 's name something is in in the event of a divorce the assets of the couple would be considered as a whole and then split but you have a which is presumably intended to change this traditional arrangement and may or may not actually be enforceable i think you are as such right to be wary i think your only way forward long term is to amend the and/or the legal status of the house to recognize it as a shared asset that you will both be contributing to and that it 's value should be split in some way in the event of a divorce in exchange you should probably be contributing some or all of the cash pile you have from selling your house to the common pot another loan may seem like a good option in the short term but in the long term the appreciation on a house is likely to be worth more than any interest on the loan assuming you are using an interest rate comparable to commercial mortgage deals plus any interest may well end up being taxable

your argument is biased vastly in favor of the banks   does n't the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial real estate pricing bubbles undermines the case made by yourself that fannie and freddie were at the root of the problem   why does your explanation also leave out predatory lending or that during 2006 22 of homes purchased 1.65 million units were for investment purposes with an additional 14 1.07 million units purchased as vacation homes during 2005 these figures were 28 and 12 respectively in other words a record level of nearly 40 of homes purchased were not intended as primary residences    or that housing prices nearly doubled between 2000 and 2006 a vastly different trend from the historical appreciation at roughly the rate of inflation   or that the proportion of subprime arm loans made to people with credit scores high enough to qualify for conventional mortgages with better terms increased from 41 in 2000 to 61 by 2006    from wikipedia so why did lending standards decline in a award winning program npr argued that a giant pool of money represented by $ 70 trillion in worldwide fixed income investments sought higher yields than those offered by u.s. treasury bonds early in the decade further this pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007 yet the supply of relatively safe income generating investments had not grown as fast investment banks on wall street answered this demand with financial innovation such as the mortgage backed security mbs and collateralized debt obligation cdo which were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies in effect wall street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the u.s. with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage supply chain from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small banks that funded the brokers to the giant investment banks behind them by approximately 2003 the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted however continued strong demand for mbs and cdo began to drive down lending standards as long as mortgages could still be sold along the supply chain eventually this speculative bubble proved unsustainable

technically the difference between dividends and growth ought to be that dividends can be reinvested in stocks other than the one that paid them which is a definite advantage if you actually have a strategy   dividend stocks used to be preferred for exactly that reason back in the days when fewer people were directly playing in the market and more knew what they were doing unfortunately   getting a periodic dividend from a stock whose price is relatively steady is n't as exciting a game as watching your stock 's value bounce around and hopefully   creep upward on a second by second basis those who are thinking in gambling terms rather than investment terms or who think they can beat the pros at high frequency trading comment withheld want the latter and have been putting a lot of pressure on companies to operate in the latter mode that does n't make it better certainly not for the longer term investors just more fashionable and fashion often means getting stuck with something impractical because everyone else is doing it on this i second scrooge

i 'm glad that you feel like being fair and equitable to your party other are of course correct that being fair and equitable to your girlfriend is not in your best interests but that 's not what you 're trying to do here and i commend you for it there is nothing that stops you drawing up a simple legal contract giving your girlfriend a share of the value of your house in return for her payments just get it signed and witnessed and checked over by a legal representative you can include reasonable terms for the money to be paid back if you separate perhaps when you sell the property or within two years of the breakup that do n't put you in immediate danger of losing the property just make clear that this contract is between you and her for a sum of money linked to the value of your house it does not establish any legal claim on your house itself a reasonable level for her to claim the property would be one half of the change in equity between when you start joint paying and when you separate should that happen

welcome to the wonderful but oft confusing world of self employment your regular job will withhold income for you and give you a w2 which tells you and the government how much is withheld   at the end of the year uber will give you and the government a 1099-misc which will tell you how much they paid you but nothing will be withheld which means you will owe the government some taxes when it comes to taxes you will file a 1040 the big one not a 1040ez nor 1040a   in addition you will file a schedule c self employed income where you will report the gross paid to you deduct your expenses and come up with your profit which will be taxable   that profit goes into a line in the 1040    you need to file schedule se   this says how much self employment tax you will pay on your 1099 income and it will be more than you expect   self employment tax is ss medicare   there 's a line for this on the 1040 as well   you can also deduct half of your self employment tax on the 1040 there 's a line for it now you can pay quarterly taxes on your 1099 income by filing 1040-es   that avoids a penalty which usually is n't that large for not withholding enough   as an alternative you can have your regular w2 job withhold extra   as long as you do n't owe a bunch at tax time you wo n't be a fined when you are self employed your taxes are n't as simple   sorry   you can either spend some time becoming an expert by studying the instructions for the 1040 pay for the expensive version of tax programs or hire someone to do it for you self employed taxes are painful but take advantage of the upsides as well   you can start a solo 401(k or sep ira for example   make sure you are careful to deduct every relevant business expense and keep good records in case you get audited

if you 've already got emergency savings sufficient for your needs i agree that you 'd be better served by sending that $ 500 to your student i personally house the bulk of my emergency savings in cds because i 'm not planning to touch it and it yields a little better than a vanilla savings account to address the comment about liquidity   in addition to my emergency savings i keep plain vanilla savings accounts for sudden expenses   to me emergency means lost job not new water pump for my car i have other budgeted savings for that but would spend it on a credit card and reimburse myself anyway so liquidity there is n't even that important    the 18 month cds i use are barely less liquid than vanilla savings and the penalty is just a couple months of the accrued interest   when you compare a possible early distribution penalty against the years of increased yield you 're likely to come out ahead after years of never touching your emergency savings unless you 're budgeted such that a car insurance deductible is an emergency expense emergency funds should be guaranteed and non volatile   if i lose my job 90 days of accrued interest is n't a hindrance to breaking open some of my cds and the process is n't so daunting that i 'd meaningfully harm my finances liquidity in 2017 and liquidity in whatever year a text book was initially written are two totally different animals   my very illiquid brokerage account funds are only one transaction and 3 settlement days less liquid than my very liquid savings account   there 's no call the bank sell the security wait for it to clear my brokerage cuts a check mail the check cash the check etc   i can go from apple stock on monday to cash in my hand on like thursday   on the web portal for the bank that holds my cds i can instantly transfer the funds from a cd to my checking account there net of a negligible penalty for early distribution   to call cds illiquid in 2017 is silly

with all due respect to the david the $ 1000 is best put against 20%+ debt no sitting in checking as part of some emergency fund   i 'd agree with the decision to pay off the lower rate card why because we can do the math and can see the cost in doing so low enough that other factors come in namely a freed up card that card can function as the emergency one in the short term long term once these high rate cards are paid off you 'll build your proper emergency fund but the cost is too high right now   the $ 4000 is a nice start but the most important thing is to get your budget under control only you can decide how much you can cut back and go after this debt as if it were life or death

while it is true that if the federal reserve bank makes a change in their rate there is not an immediate change in the other rates that impact consumers there is some between the federal rate and the costs of banks and other lenders regarding borrowing money of course the cost of borrowing money does impact the costs for businesses looking to expand which does impact their ability to hire more workers and expand capacity a change in business expansion does impact employment and unemployment then changes in employment can cause a change in raises which can cause changes in prices which is inflation plus the lenders that lend to business see the flow of new loans change as the employment outlook change   if the costs of doing business for the bank changes or the flow of loans change they do adjust the rates they pay depositors and the rates they charge borrowers how long it will take to change the cost of an auto loan no way to tell   keep in mind that in complex systems change can be delayed and wo n't move in lock step for example the price of does n't always move the same way a price of a barrel of oil does

taxes are a tool for achieving social policy goals while americans consider socialism to be a curse the us is in fact quite socialistic mostly towards corporations but sometimes even the normal people not only the corporation are people my friend m. romney get some discounts the tax deduction on mortgage interest comes as a tool to encourage americans to own their homes it is important socially for people to own their home to be independent and in general contributes to the stability of the society as anything when taken to the extreme it in fact achieves exactly the opposite as we 've seen in 2008 but when balanced works well capital gain is taxed in the us because it is income generally any income is taxed however gain sourced from the sale of primary residence is excluded up to a certain quite large amount from this tax if lived in the residence long enough 3 of the last 5 years prior to sale this again to encourage americans to upgrade their houses and make it easier for americans to relocate when needed sell one house and buy another without losing cash on taxes as to asset producing income that is true in the us as well you can not deduct your personal expenses in general mortgage interest on primary residence is a notable exception because it serves a social cause similarly medical expenses are allowed as a deduction if they 're above certain limit and many other things for example if a us person totals his car and insurance does n't cover the loss it is tax deductible above certain limit the higher the income the higher the limit these are purely social policy breaks socialism something americans like to have and love to hate many anti socialists in the us are in fact taking advantage of these specific tax breaks the most because for rich folks these are limited or non existent mortgage interest limited up to 1 million medical expenses are allowed only above certain percentage of income etc

first bear in mind that you 're talking about having an average of saved up at any given time if you spend all your stipend every quarter at a steady rate you 'll start out with all of it and have none left at the end of the quarter along with any long term savings you manage to build up over time in today 's low interest rate environment of ~1 interest rates we 're talking about approximately £ interest so it 's not worth a huge amount of effort to this you mentioned a bonus but looking at the charter savings website i do n't actually see one listed for either the cash isa or the savings accounts you mention in general banks in the uk actually use bonus rates as a short term measure to suck in new customers and the bonuses typically expire after a while leaving you with a worse rate also i do n't think either of the rates you mention is guaranteed they are both listed as variable in reality i doubt they will go down too much more given that the likely next move in uk interest rates is upwards the typical main advantage of an isa is its tax free nature but from your question i assume you do n't have any other income so you wo n't need to pay tax on any interest you earn outside an isa either also given that your budget is quite tight and you expect to spend most or all of your stipend there 's no advantage to using an account where you can build up long term tax free savings even if you do have a few thousand pounds left over by the end of your phd you 'll easily be able to put those into an isa at that point given the annual limit of £ 20k. you 're right not to want to take any risks with the money and there are n't really any risk free investments other than savings accounts available at least on the you 're talking about so overall i 'd just go for the return edit as 's answer points out you will probably be able to find a loss leader current account that actually offers more interest than a savings account you 'll need to either use a single current account and manage your budgeting carefully or use a second current account as your savings account and make sure to set things up to satisfy the requirements of the account you choose such as incoming payments or outgoing direct debits

gt the 20 million people added to healthcare is a number they boast and brag about when they do nt realize from a study i m having a hard time so take it with a grain of salt roughly 65 of those people could afford health insurance prior to the aca just chose not to buy and because of the mandate were forced to    yes that is one of the reasons i supported the aca the problem of rising health care costs as one of the sources i linked to showed is the free rider problem too many people walk into the emergency room uninsured or they get emergent care that they are not covered for and the hospitals jack up the prices greatly in the hopes of getting a larger portion reimbursed by medicare now who pays for that medicare reimbursement you and i of course the taxpayers do and we pay a heavily artificially inflated version of that price this is the most jacked up form of universal health care but that is what the gop if fighting to    gt i also know that for me health insurance prior to the aca was significantly lower roughly 50 cheaper and that does nt even begin to touch the hikes a lot of people i know saw    i have no doubt this is true and another reason that i support the aca not because it equates to higher prices for you but because for the first time it made younger adults actually responsible for their medical bills when the aca was enacted we had a guy in our company who was about 23 years old he saw his insurance costs go up by 50 we covered is insurance increases because we supported him however what we found when we went back and compared the insurance that he had with the insurance that he has is that the first policy did n't cover anything but the most extreme circumstances it was a junk policy that left the taxpayer liable for a lot of stuff response x rays medicine etc there was nothing in there for preventative care which as the study i linked showed greatly impacted health for the worse    gt they have some of the lowest income tax rates in the world   again switzerland has lower tax rates than the us but they do n't even crack the top 20 when it comes to countries with low countries with the lowest tax rates in the edges out the regions other oil rich state to come in second place but still loses out to one other most of the countries in that list are relatively poor countries to the average citizen with weak infrastructure many of those countries are in which the ruling family controls the number one source of income oil so there is no taxes they just skim their money right off the top these are not countries that we would want to live retire in    switzerland succeeds with low taxes because they have a very efficient universal health care system and they have almost no military to fund    gt while i do not own my own company or have anything to do with r&amp;d i can for a fact disprove your theory   again speaking in this denotes that you can disprove every situation possible to show that government is worse than commercial as i said if you thought that before you entered my industry you quickly see the flip side of that coin    your example is a perfect example of that so you work in construction an industry in which commercial is notorious for a contract whether to government or to private and then running into unexpected that cause the job to go over schedule over budget these companies succeed because there are a very small number of providers that can accomplish certain jobs so they tend to stick around just like the big banks even though they are n't the best    its not like the government just sits around and takes it i know of at least one federal contractor who went to federal archive id for fraudulently winning contracts in my part of the country    gt the private sector will always have a need to innovate and that need will always be filled with or without the government the only difference is the private sector wo nt keep throwing money at an unsustainable rate like the government does because if they do nt see results its not worth funding   and this is why the government can succeed in areas that commercial can not this is why government

as the record date is 7th august you need to hold stocks on the 7th august closing you need not hold it till 2nd sept. the list as taken on 7th august would be processed and instructions given to bank and the dividends credited by 1st sept.   edit to clarify victor 's comment typically from the time one sells the stocks to the time it actually gets transferred has a clearing cycle most stock exchanges have 2 or 3 days cycles i.e. if i sell the stock today it is still in my name the money is still with the buyer on day 1 the positions are arrived at on day 2 the stock gets credited to the buyer and the funds gets credit to seller   as the question was specific whether to hold the stock till 7th or 22nd sept my initial answer was simple the illustration by victor is more accurate

as a rule of thumb go in the order of proximity to the transaction this would typically mean side note i own a website that provides an online service that accepts paypal and credit cards via paypal and i personally have experience with all 3 of the above options i can tell you from the merchant 's point of view that i would also prefer the same order i 've had people contact my customer service department asking for a refund and we always immediately comply some people never contact us and just file a dispute directly with paypal and although refunding through the paypal dispute is just as easy as refunding directly it always makes me ask why did n't they just contact us first one time we had a customer skip us and paypal and filed a dispute directly with their credit card the cc company contacted paypal and paypal contacted us the process was the same from my point of view i just clicked a button saying issue refund but my $ 5 refund cost me an additional $ 20 due to the cc dispute now that i know this i will never approve a cc dispute again anytime one happens i would just issue a refund directly and then notify the dispute that their cc has already been refunded which should end the dispute

although this has been touched upon in comments i think the following line from the currently accepted answer shows the biggest issue there is a clear difference between investing and gambling the reality is that the difference is n't that clear at all tens of comments have been written arguing in both directions and looking around the internet entire essays have been written arguing both positions the underlying emotion that seems to shape this discussion primarily is whether investing especially in the stock market is a form of gambling people who do invest in this way tend to get relatively emotional whenever someone argues that this is a form of gambling as gambling is considered a negative thing the simple reality of human communication is that words can be ambiguous and the way investors will use the words investments and gambles will differ from the way it is used by gamblers and once again different from the way it 's commonly used what i definitely think is made clear by all the different discussions however is that there is no single distinctive trait that allows us to differentiate investing and gambling the result of this is that when you take dictionary definitions for both terms you will likely end up including lottery tickets as a valid form of investment   that still however leaves us with a situation where we have two terms with a strong overlap which have a distinctive meaning in communication and the original question whether buying lottery tickets is an investment over on there is an absolutely amazing strongly recommended essay which explores countless of different traits in search of a difference between investing and gambling and they came up with the following two definitions investing any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit and which is characterized by some or most of the following in approximately descending order of importance sufficient research has been conducted the odds are favorable the behavior is risk averse a systematic approach is being taken emotions such as greed and fear play no role the activity is ongoing and done as part of a long term plan the activity is not motivated solely by entertainment or compulsion ownership of something tangible is involved a net positive economic effect results gambling any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit and which is characterized by some or most of the following in approximately descending order of importance little or no research has been conducted the odds are unfavorable the behavior is risk seeking an approach is being taken emotions such as greed and fear play a role the activity is a discrete event or series of discrete events not done as part of a long term plan the activity is significantly motivated by entertainment or compulsion ownership of something tangible is not involved no net economic effect results the very interesting thing about those definitions is that they capture very well the way those terms are used by most people and they even acknowledge that a lot of investors are gambling and that a few gamblers are investing read the essay for more on that and this fits well with the way those two concepts are understood by the public so in those definitions normally buying a lottery ticket would indeed not be an investment but if we take for example 's operation example if you have $ 1000 and need $ 2000 by next week or else you ca n't have an operation and you will die and you ca n't find anyone to give you a loan your optimal strategy is to gamble your $ 1000 at the best odds you can get with a possible outcome of $ 2000 so even if you only have a 1/3 chance of winning and getting that operation it 's still the right bet if you ca n't find a better one this can suddenly change the perception and turn gambling into high risk investing

while nothing is guaranteed any stock market or country could collapse tomorrow if you have a fairly long window 15 + years is certainly long etfs are likely to earn you well above inflation   looking at long term etfs you typically see close to 10 annual growth over almost any ten year period in the us and while i do n't know european indexes they 're probably well above inflation at least the downside of etfs is that your money is somewhat less liquid than in a savings account and any given year you might not earn anything you easily could lose money in a particular year   as such you should n't have money in etfs that you expect to use in the next few months or year or even a few years perhaps but as long as you 're willing to play the long game ie invest in etf do n't touch it for 15 years except to reinvest the dividends as long as you go with someone like vanguard and use a very low expense ratio fund mine are 0.06 and 0.10 i believe you are likely in the long term to come out ahead   you can diversify your holdings hold 10 to 20 in bond funds for example if you 're concerned about risk look at how some of the target retirement funds allocate their investments to see how diversification can work target retirement funds assume high risk tolerance far out and then as the age grows the risk tolerance drops do n't invest in them but it can be a good example of how to do it    all of this does require a tolerance of risk though and you have to be able to not touch your funds even if they go down studies have repeatedly shown that trying to time the market is a net loss for most people and the best thing you can do when your diverse investments go down is stay neutral talking about large funds here and not individual stocks i think this answers 3 and 4    for 1 share price and quantity matter assuming no splits   this depends somewhat on the fund but at minimum funds must dividend to you what they receive as dividends   there are dividend focused etfs which are an interesting topic in themselves but a regular etf does n't usually have all that large of dividends   for more information investopedia has an article on the subject   note that there are also capital gains distributions which are typically distributed to help offset capital gains taxes that may occur from time to time with an etf   those are n't really returns you may have to hand most or all over to the irs so do n't consider distributions the same way the share price tracks the total net asset value of the fund divided by the number of shares roughly assuming no supply demand split   this should go up as the stocks the etf owns go up overall this is for non dividend etfs more often the larger volatility both up and down for vanguard 's s&p500 etf which you can see here there were about $ 3.50 in dividends over 2014 which works out to about a 2 return $ share price   on the other hand the share price went from around $ at the beginning of 2014 to $ 190 at the end of 2014 for a return of 13    that was during a good year for the market of course there will be years where you get 2 3 in dividends and lose money in 2011 it opened at 116 and closed the year at 115 i do n't have the dividend for that year certainly lower than 3.5 i 'd think but likely nonzero the one caveat here is that you do have stock splits where they cut the price say in half and give you double the shares   that of course is revenue neutral you have the same value the day after the split as before net of market movements all of this is good from a tax point of view by the way changes in price do n't hit you until you sell the stock fund unless the fund has some capital gains while dividends and distributions do   etfs are seen as tax friendly for this reason for 2 vanguard is pretty good about this in the us i would n't necessarily invest monthly but quarterly should n't be a problem   just pay attention to the fees and figure out what the optimal frequency is ie assuming 10 return what is your break even point   you would want to have some liquid assets anyway so allow that liquid amount to rise over the quarter then invest what you do n't immediately see a need to use you can see here vanguard in the us has no fees for buying shares but has a minimum of one share so if you 're buying their s&p500 voo you 'd need to wait until you had $ 200 or so to invest in order to invest additional funds

why wo n't anyone just answer the original question the question was not about opportunity cost or flexibility or family expenses there are no right answers to any of those things and they all depend on individual circumstances i believe the answer to the question of whether paying off a 30-year mortgage in 15 years would cost the same amount as a 15-year mortgage of the same interest rate is yes but only if you pay it off on the exact same schedule as your supposed 15-year in reality the answer is no for two reasons the amortization schedule and the fact that the 30-year will always have a higher interest rate than the 15-year the way mortgages are amortized the interest is paid first essentially for most people the majority of the monthly payment is interest for the first half of the loan 's life this is good for most people because in reality most mortgages only last a couple years after which people refinance or move and for those first couple years the majority of one 's housing costs interest are tax deductible it is arguable whether this for one 's entire life is wise but that 's the reality of most mortgages so unless you pay off your 30-year on the exact same amortization schedule of your theoretical 15-year you will pay more in interest a common strategy people pursue is paying an extra monthly payment or more each year by the time you get around to chipping away at your principal in that way you will already have paid a lot more interest than you would have on a 15-year and really if you can afford to substantially pay down principal in the first year or two of your mortgage you probably should 've borrowed less money to begin with in theory if the rates were the same they 're not and if you paid the 30 off every month in the exact same way as you would've paid a 15 you wo n't you will pay the same amount in the end you have to decide if the flexibility is worth more to you than the cost savings   for example a 300k mortgage at 3.5 will have a monthly payment of for a 15-year and for a 30-year both will start with of that being in interest gradually declining with time what i think most people undervalue is the freedom and peace of mind that comes with a paid off or nearly paid off home and 15 years is a lot more tangible than 30 plus a lot cheaper over all if you can afford a 15-year mortgage without putting too much stress on your budget it is definitely the better option for financial security   and be careful of the index fund opportunity cost advice on average it may be a good idea when you look at the very long run historically but a lot of people get less than average returns depending on when they buy and what the market does in the short run there is no certainty around what returns you will get from the stock market but if you have a 30-year mortgage there is a lot of certainty around what you will owe every month for the next different mixes of investments make sense for different people and most people would be wise to get some exposure to the stock market for its returns and liquidity however if someone 's goal is borrowing more money for their house in order to invest more money in the stock market for their retirement they would actually be better served in achieving security and independence 15 years sooner

i had a similar situation a while ago and here 's what i learned what are our options here to ensure that this company ca n't to take our money again via ach close existing account and create a new one that has different account number yes as a temporary solution keep balance in the account so that their request for $ ca n't be fulfilled however would our bank incur any fees because of insufficient funds each time the other company tries to charge us again bad idea you may incur penalties for returned payment or the bank may honor the payment and charge you overdraft fees provide to our bank the service termination notice that proves that we    are not in business with the other company anymore and effectively    block them however termination notice has only our signature bank does n't care ach withdrawal is akin to a check the assumption is that the other side has entitlement you can put stop payment once its processed and try to reverse it claiming fraud but the end result will be 1 you 'll end up getting a new account set up while they try to recover the money this is one of the reasons i 'm reluctant allowing standing ach authorizations any more generally the american banking system is very much geared against the consumers and in many ways is very retarded in a more advanced countries which is almost any other country than the us the standing withdrawal authorization goes through your bank and can be revoked

you could buy shares of an exchange traded fund etf based on the price of gold like gld iau or you can invest in this fund through almost any brokerage firm e.g. fidelity etrade td ameritrade charles schwab sharebuilder etc keep in mind that you 'll still have to pay a commission and fees when purchasing an etf but it will almost certainly be less than paying the markup or storage fees of buying the physical commodity directly an etf trades exactly like a stock on an exchange with a ticker symbol as noted above the commission will apply the same as any stock trade and the price will reflect some fraction of an ounce of gold for the gld it started as .1 oz but fees have been applied over the years so it 's a bit less   you could also invest in which is a closed end mutual fund that allows investors to trade their shares for gold bars however because the fund is closed end it may trade at a significant premium or discount compared to the actual price of gold for supply and demand reasons also keep in mind that investing in gold will never be the same as depositing your money in the bank in the united states money stored in a bank is fdic insured up to $ 250,000 and there are several banks or financial institutions that deposit money in multiple banks to double or triple the effective insurance limit fidelity has an account like this for example if you invest in gold and the price plunges you 're left with the fair market value of that gold not your original deposit   yes you 're hoping the price of your gold investment will increase to at least match inflation but you 're hoping i.e. speculating which is n't the same as depositing your money in an insured bank account if you want to speculate and invest in something with the hope of outpacing inflation you 're likely better off investing in a low cost index fund of inflation protected securities or the s&p500 over the long term rather than gold   just to be clear i 'm using the laymen 's definition of a speculator which is someone who engages in risky financial transactions in an attempt to profit from short or medium term fluctuations this is similar to the definition used in some markets e.g. futures but in many cases economists and places like the cftc define speculators as anyone who does n't have a position in the underlying security for example a farmer selling corn futures is a while the trading firm purchasing the contracts is a speculator the trading firm does n't necessarily have to be actively trading the contract in the short run they merely have no position in the underlying commodity

why do these fees exist from a banks point of view they are operating in currency a currency b is a commodity similar to oil grains goods etc so they will only buy if they can sell it at a margin   currency conversion have inherent risks on small amount the bank generally does not hedge these risks as it is expensive but balances the position end of day or if the exposure becomes large the rate they may get then may be different and the margin covers it hence on highly traded currency pairs the spread is less   are there back end processes and requirements that require financial institutions to pass off the loss to consumers as a fee the processes are to ensure bank does not make loss is it just to make money on the convenience of international transactions banks do make money on such transactions however they also take some risks the forex market is not single market but is a collective hybrid market place there are costs a bank incurs to carry and square off positions and some of it is reflected in fees   if you see some of the remittance banks have optimized a remittance service say usd to inr there is a huge flow often in small amounts the remittance service aggregates such amounts to make it a large amount to get a better deal for themselves and passes on the benefits to individuals such volume of scale is not available for other pairs

you do n't have to use an agent broker as you call it but it is strongly advised in some counties lawyers are required in some not check your local requirements similarly the escrow companies that usually deal with recording and of money you will probably not be able to get a title insurance without using an escrow service i 'm guessing here but it makes sense to me you will not be able to secure financing through a bank or a mortgage broker without an escrow company and it might be hard without an agent agents required by law to know all the details of the process and they can guide you through what to do and what to look into they have experience reading and understanding the inspection reports they know what to demand from the seller disclosures information etc they know how and from where to get the hoa docs and disclosures and can help you negotiate the price knowing the market information comparable sales comparable listings list vs sales statistics etc it is hard to do all that alone but if you do you should definitely get a discount over the market price of the property of about 5 the agents fees are up to 5 mostly i bought several properties in california and in other states and i would n't do it without an agent on my side but if you trust the other side entirely and willing to take the risk of missing a step and having problems later with title mortgage insurance or resale then you can definitely save some money and do it without an agent and there are people doing that

's answer is spot on with the advice to avoid repeated conversions but i 'd like to provide some specifics on the fees involved each time you round trip canadian dollars cad through a u.s dollar usd priced security at td waterhouse and leave your proceeds in cad you 're paying a total foreign exchange fee implied in their rate   spread of about 3 give or take that 's ~3 per buy sell combination or on each end you can imagine if you trade back forth frequently you can quickly lose a lot of money   do it back and forth ten times in a year and you 're out ~30 on the fees alone the td u.s. money market fund that td waterhouse is referring to has no direct commission to buy or sell but it does have a management expense ratio mer of 0.20 per year basically a fee which is deducted from the fund 's returns which today are also close to zero   practically speaking that 's a very slim fee to hold some usd in your canadian dollar tfsa while 0.20 is cheap a point to keep in mind is if you maintain a significant usd balance you are maintaining currency risk   you can lose money in cad terms if the cad appreciates vs. usd additional references canadian capitalist describes td waterhouse and the use of and wash trades at how to wash your trade   he 's referring to rrsps but the same applies to tfsas which came out after the post was written canadian couch potato has two relevant articles are us listed etfs really cheaper and lowering your currency exchange fees

you re assuming that gdp shows the amount of wealth created and is an indicator of the standard of living but it is not govt spending adds to gdp but takes away from the productive of the private sector which is the part of the economy that is making things that people want and need the govt can spend 1 trillion on building a to obama and that would increase gdp by 1 trillion but no wealth is created and the govt shift a trillion of tax revenues to the workers who built the if a company spends 1 trillion building building some new gadget then the people who spend money to buy i have something to show for it and the workers have their wages as well so now the company makes back 1.2 trillion and the consumers have their gadget ie real wealth has been created    the wealthy may be on of cash but its not just sitting under their mattress its spread out between investments and savings savings is to build up productive capabilities the money the rich have sitting in banks is being used to help other businesses grow not just collecting dust i wish it were as simple as giving every poor person 10 grand and watching the economy take off remember when bush gave everyone a 1000 tax refund it sure was fun blowing that on a ps3 i ca nt argue with that but prosperity can not be printed it must be earned through hard work and productive activity what we need is not monetary stimulus we need the govt to stop the private sector with burdensome regulations and taxes we need lower barriers to entry so we maximize competition in every industry we need the govt spending less and pushing more workers into the private sector making things that american can get some utility from its not going to be a smooth ride getting there there will be lots of lay offs in the short run as the economy but if the govt got out of the way and let the free market prosper our society would be far better off in the future

what explains the most of the future returns of a portfolio is the allocation between asset classes in the long term stock investments are almost certain to return more than any other kinds of investments for 40 + years i would choose a portfolio of 100 stocks how to construct the portfolio then diversification is the key you should diversify in time do n't put a large sum of money into your stock portfolio immediately if you have a large sum to invest spread it around several years you should diversify based on company size invest in both large and small companies you should also diversify internationally do n't invest in just us companies if you prefer to pick individual stocks 20 very carefully selected stocks may provide enough diversification if you keep diversification in mind during stock picking however careful stock picking can not be expected to yield excess returns and if you pick stocks manually you need to rebalance your portfolio occasionally thus if you 're lazy i would recommend a mutual fund or many mutual funds if you have difficulty finding a low cost one that is internationally diversified the most important consideration is the cost you can not expect careful fund selection to yield excess returns before expenses however the expenses are certain costs so prefer low cost funds almost always this means picking index funds avoid funds that have a small number of stocks because they typically invest only in the largest companies which means you fail to get diversification in company size so instead of euro stoxx 50 select stoxx 600 when investing to the european market etfs may have lower costs than traditional mutual funds so keep etfs in mind when selecting the mutual funds in which to invest for international diversification do not forget emerging markets it is not excessive to invest e.g. 20 to emerging markets emerging markets have a higher risk but they also have a higher return a portfolio that does not include emerging markets is not in my opinion well diversified when getting close to retirement age i would consider increasing the percentage of bonds in the portfolio this should be done primarily by putting additional money to bonds instead of selling existing investments to avoid additional taxes not sure if this applies to other taxation systems than the finnish one bond investments are best made though low cost mutual funds as well keep bond investments in your local currency and risk free assets i.e. select us government bonds whatever you do remember that historical return is no guarantee of future return actually the opposite may be true there is a mean reversion law if a particular investment has returned well in the past it often means its price has gone up making it more likely that the price goes down in the future so do n't select a fund based on its historical return instead select a fund based on low costs however i 'm 99 certain that over a period of 40 years stocks will return better than other investments in addition to fund costs taxes are the other certain thing that will be deducted from your returns research what options you have to reduce the taxes you need to pay 401-k was explained in another answer this may be a good option some things recommended in other answers that i would avoid

as long as your total does n't exceed the per year limit you should be able to deposit after tax money into your health savings account contact the hsa administrator for details note that unless your employer sets this up you 'd be sending them after tax money which goes in the same category as other non reimbursed health expenses so you may not get any immediate tax savings by doing this vs. just spending the money out of pocket however once there us enough reserve money in your hsa for you to invest it in the same way a 401k can be invested it will grow tax free so if you 're putting in significantly more than you expect to withdraw any time soon this may still be a worthwhile thing to do definitely talk to hr about whether you can still get it set up pre tax though most employers do n't allow changes unless there has been a significant change in your family new wife new kids that sort of thing

the answer from littleadv perfectly explains that the mere exchange ratio does n't say anything still it might be worth adding why some currencies are weak and some strong here 's the reason to buy goods of a certain country you have to exchange your money for currency of that country especially when you want to buy treasuries of stocks from that country so if you feel that for example japanese stocks are going to pick up soon you will exchange dollars for yen so you can buy japanese stocks by the laws of supply and demand this drives up the price in contrast if investors lose faith in a country and withdraw their funds they will seek their luck elsewhere and thus they increase the supply of that currency this happened most dramatically in recent time with the icelandic

evidence for the second scenario can banks individually create money out of nothing the theories and the empirical evidence excerpt it was examined whether in the process of making money available to    the borrower the bank transfers these funds from other accounts    within or outside the bank in the process of making loaned money    available in the borrower 's bank account it was found that the bank    did not transfer the money away from other internal or external    accounts resulting in a rejection of both the fractional reserve    theory and the financial theory instead it was found    that the bank newly the funds by crediting the borrower 's    account with a deposit although no such deposit had taken place this    is in line with the claims of the credit creation theory thus it can now be said with confidence for the first time possibly    in the 5000 years history of banking that it has been empirically    demonstrated that each individual bank creates credit and money out of    nothing when it extends what is called a bank the bank does    not loan any existing money but instead creates new money the money    supply is created as fairy produced by the banks out of thin    air

bitcoin can facilitate this despite the risks associated with using bitcoin exchanges and the price volatility at any given time the speed of bitcoin can limit your exposure to the bitcoin network to one hour   cyprus has a more advanced infrastructure than most countries to support bitcoin transactions with neo bee opening as a regulated bank financial entity in cyprus just two months ago and atm vending machines existing for that asset anyway you acquire bitcoin from an individual locally in exchange for cash or an exchange that does not require the same level of reporting as a bank account in cyprus or russia no matter how you acquire the bitcoin you transfer it to the exchange sell bitcoin on the exchange for your desired currency usd euro etc you instruct the exchange to wire the euro to your cyprus bank account using your cyprus account 's swift code the end   depending on the combination of countries involved the exchange may still encounter similar withdrawal limitations until certain regulatory requirements are resolved   also i 'm unsure of the attitude toward bitcoin related answers on this site so i tried to add a disclaimer about bitcoin 's risks at the top but that does n't make this answer incorrect

first is population density you did n't say where exactly but for example here in tampa wells fargo has 25 branches in the area   though that is a bit larger then what i would think of the tampa area as a local second we can mix in service expectation i expect that in addition to good online service great phone service great email service that when i have a problem do n't understand something or want to talk about my options for investing or choosing account types that i am able to go into a branch that i can walk in and see someone quickly or schedule an appointment and see some one right away at my appointment time   together these two options means that on a busy day the nearest wells fargo branch to me has at any one time 50 60 people in it smaller branches of course have less and larger branches exist so it just takes that many branches to address the number of people and their expected needs   as to why there are so many different brands banks well that 's just the usa we believe in capitalism we have believed in it much stronger in the past but banks are the central to capitalism so why should n't they serve as an example   at it 's core a very simplistic look capitalism and a free market means that we as customers are better served by having lots of different brands fighting for our business it should drive more consumer desired features   like lower prices higher interest rates better fee schedules etc while forcing those brands to operate better just ignore the bail out that 's a loaded topic so for some of us we want a big bank like wells fargo because we want the rates structure and service they can provide as a big bank for others they want the more personal touch of a small bank there are benefits both ways   for example there may be a bank that only allows people with excellent credit to open accounts that allows they to have lower over all mortgage rates but means their checking accounts have higher minimums while the next bank may be more inclusive and have smaller minimum balances but as a result charge more for loans   we like our options and rest assured all those brands offer products that have differences that attract customers

the problem above is actually a pretty good list of the concerns around life insurance   while there is no correct answer to the question as posed this will vary among different there is a simpler way to think about insurance in general that may make finding what is right answer for you easier buying life insurance like almost all insurance is on average a money losing purchase   this is simply because the companies selling would n't offer it if they could n't expect to make money on it   think about buying insurance a warranty on a new cell phone maybe if you are particularly prone to damaging cell phones it can be in your favor but for most of the people that buy it will lose money on average people of course still buy insurance anyway to protect themselves from unlikely but very bad consequences   the big reason to make this trade off is if the loss will have big lasting consequences   to stay with our cell phone example having to replace a cell phone at least for me would be annoying but not a catastrophic event   for myself the protection is not worth the warranty cost but that is not true for everyone life insurance is a pretty extreme case of this but i find the best question to ask is if you you and your spouse were to die will your dependents lives become so much worse that you really dislike the idea of not being insured for some working seniors they already have enough saved to bridge their kids spouse to adulthood old age that insurance makes no sense   for some their children husband wife would be destitute and insurance is an obvious choice and an easy price to pay even if it is very high   the example you suggest seems on the border and good questions to ask are thinking about those questions may help you understand if the protection offers is worth the cost

in this equation the withdrawal rate is the percent you must pull from your savings to meet your expenses for example if your savings is $ 100,000 and you need $ 10,000 annually for your living expenses then your withdrawal rate would be 10 where 10k is 10 of 100k   to complete this formula you need to know how much savings you need to be financially independent before you can use this formula to find out how long it will take you

you can move money from a 403b to a 401k plan but the question you should ask yourself is whether it is a wise decision unless there are specific reasons for wanting to invest in your new employer 's 401k e.g. you can buy your employer 's stock at discounted rates within the 401k and this is a good investment according to your friends neighbors and brothers in law you would be much better off moving the 403b money into an ira where you have many more choices for investment and usually can manage to find investments with lower investment costs e.g. mutual fund fees than in a typical employer 's 401k plan on the other hand 401k assets are better protected than ira assets in case you are sued and a court finds you to be liable for damages the plaintiff can not come after the 401k assets if you can not pay   to answer the question of how you need to talk to the hr people at your current employer to make sure that they are willing to accept a roll over from another tax deferred plan not all plans are agreeable to do this and get any paperwork from them especially making sure that you find out where the check is to be sent and to whom it should be payable then talk to your previous employer 's hr people and tell them that you want to roll over your 403b money into the 401k plan of your new employer fill out the paperwork make sure they know to whom to cut the check to and where it is to be sent etc in my personal experience i was sent the check payable to the custodian of my new ira account and i had to send it on to the custodian my 403b people refused to send the check directly to the new custodian the following january you will receive a 1099-r form from your 403b plan showing the amount transferred to the new custodian with hopefully the correct code letter indicating that the money was rolled over into another tax deferred account

in a cap weighted fund the fund itself is n't buying or selling at all except to support redemptions or purchases of the fund as the value of a stock in the index goes up then its value in the fund goes up naturally this is the advantage of a cap weighted fund that it does n't have to trade buy and sell it just sits on the stocks that makes a cap weighted fund inexpensive low trading costs and tax efficient does n't trigger capital gains due to sales the buying high and selling low referred to by fundamental indexation advocates like wisdom tree is buying high and selling low on the part of the investor that is when you purchase the market cap weighted fund at that time that you purchase you will spend more on the higher priced stocks just because they account for more of the value of the fund and less money goes to the cheaper stocks which account for less of the value of the fund in the prospectus for a fund they should tell you which index they use and if the prospectus does n't describe the weighting of the index you could do a web search for the index name and find out how that index is constructed a market cap weighted fund is the standard kind of weighting which is what you get if you buy the stocks in the index and then hold them without buying or selling most of the famous indexes e.g. s&p500 are cap weighted with the notable exception of the dow jones industrial average which is price weighted price weighting is just an archaic tradition not something one would use for a new index design today a fund weighted by fundamentals or equal weighted rather than cap weighted is effectively doing a kind of rebalancing selling what 's gone up to buy more of what 's gone down rather than buying an exotic fund you could get a similar effect by buying a balanced fund one that mixes stocks and bonds then when stocks go up your fund would sell them and buy bonds and the fund would sell the most of the highest market cap stocks that make up more of the index and vice versa of course but the fundamental weighted funds are fine the more important considerations include your stocks vs. bonds percentages asset allocation and whether you make irrational trades instead of sticking to a plan

to be fair kodak has always been at the forefront of digital technology this article seems to paint a picture of a company which has taken its foot off the accelerator as opposed to a much more typical scenario of the company that develops   the technology almost never being the one which successfully exploits   it   20 years ago kodak invented the photo cd ahead of its time in many ways it basically as the mass market was not really technically prepared to be able to use the format it ended up gaining at least a fair level of acceptance among professional photographers   in 1975 the first digital camera as noted was built using then new ccd image sensor technology at kodak by engineer steven a decade later kodak scientists developed the world 's first sensor capable of producing a photo quality print in 1986   the first camera to use compact flash a format still popular today was the kodak in 1996   in 2000 kodak up with qualcomm to develop the core technologies for the creation of high quality digital cinema systems to give credit where it is due sony has largely been the driving force behind digital cinema for the last ten years   in 2001 kodak introduced the digital camera and in 2003 printer dock allowing many households to finally enter the digital age kodak had promised a decade earlier with the photo cd solid state storage technology such as compact flash by now basically replacing the cd as the preferred medium   it also launched the first digital photo frame around the same time the smart frame licensed to kodak by innovations it could download images from 's online story box network or you could load images onto it via compact flash   in 2005 kodak launched the photo printer 500 for use with virtually any brand of digital camera and recently introduced camera phones and in 2006 it entered into partnership with motorola for purposes of global cross licensing and marketing around mobile imaging products in 2007 it had a similar arrangement with sony and in 2008 introduced the world 's first 5 sensor developed specifically for mobile phones   i think it is a mistake to kodak as a company which could n't foresee a future in which film had no role in image capture or as an early of internet and online distribution one that is dependent on outdated distribution technologies and while it is true that consumer demand for kodak 's traditional products has evaporated it is also equally true that kodak has expanded its interests far beyond those traditional products from printing and long lasting dye technologies to photo frames and the development and patenting of technology through to the philosophy of connecting cameras and phones and printers and even those frames to share your digital photos even to being involved in the mars project and developing ccd technology for space this is a company which may not be pulling in the major profits of days gone by   but it is not   from a lack of foresight   either way it is rather sad they became such a minor player in a market they helped create

note that we do not comment on specific stocks here and have no place doing so if your question is only about that specific stock then it is off topic i have not tried to answer that part below the key to valuation is predicting the net present value of all of a company 's cash flows i.e. of their future profits and losses through a number of methods to long to explain here investment banks and hedge funds work out what they expect the company 's cash flows to be and trade so that these future profits losses etc are priced into the stock price since future cash flows profits or whatever you want to call them are priced in the price of a stock should n't move at all on an earnings statement this begs the question why do some stock prices move violently when they announce earnings the models that the institutional investors use are not perfect and can not take into account everything an unexpected craze for a product or a supply chain agreement breaking down on not being as good as it seems will not be factored into this pricing and so the price will move based on the degree to which expectation is missed or exceeded since penny socks are speculative their value is based far more on the long term expected cash flows and less on the short run cash flows this goes a long way to explaining why some of the highest market capitalisation penny stocks are those making consistent losses this means that they can be far less susceptible to price movements after an earnings announcement even if it is well out of the consensus range higher potential future value comes with the higher risks of penny stocks which discounts current value in the end if people 's expectation of the company 's performance reflects reality then the profitability is priced in and there will be no price movement if the actuality is outside of the expected range then there will be a price movement

put options are contracts to sell you pay me a fee for the right to put the stock or other underlying security in my hands if you want to that happens on a specific date the strike date and a specified price the strike price you can decide not to exercise that right but i must follow through and let you sell it to me if you want to put options can be used by the purchaser to cap losses for example you purchase a put option for ge from me on october 19th you can make me let you sell your ge stock to me for $ a share if the price for ge has fallen to $ that would be a good idea if its now at $ 15.00 a share you will probably keep the ge or sell it at the current market price call options are contracts to buy the same idea only in the other direction you pay me a fee for the right to call the stock away from me calls also have a strike date and strike price like a put you can choose not to exercises it you can choose to buy the stock from me on the strike date for the strike price but i have to let you buy it from me if you want to   for example you purchase a call option for ge 16.00 option from me on october 19th you can buy my ge stock from me for $ 16.00 a share if the current price is $ you should make me let you buy if from me for $ 16.00 if its less than $ 16.00 you could by it at the current market price for less commonly options are for a block of 100 shares of the underlying security note this is a general description options can be very complicated the fee you pay for the option and the transaction fees associated with the shares affects whether or not exercising is financially beneficial options can be very risky you can loose all your money as there is no innate value in the option only how it relates to the underlying security before your brokerage will let you trade there are disclosures you must read and affirm that you understand the risk

it 's a really big stretch to assume that a particular 10q release will have the exact same impact on trading volume trading price and volatility as a prior release in a different quarter under a different set of circumstances and a different set of results which is what you seem to be implying when you suggest that a lack of volume in response to one quarter 's results should therefore be used as a benchmark    i think traders and the hft firms are a lot smarter than you think

what you 're asking about is called a distribution when it comes to an llc   it 's basically you paying yourself some or all of the proceeds of the business depending on how you 're set up   you can pay yourself distributions on a regular schedule say monthly or you can do it at the end of the year whatever you do in this regard what you take out as distributions is reported on your personal income tax as taxable income   llcs in the u.s. use pass through taxation unless you intentionally elect to have the llc treated as a corporation for tax purposes which some people do so whatever the principals receive in distribution is personally taxable keep in mind that you 'll have to pay all of the taxes normally covered by an employer such as self employment tax usually about 15 social security tax and so on   this is in addition to income tax so remember that i hope this helps good luck

in addition to the possibility of buying gold etfs or tradable certificates there are also firms specializing in providing bank accounts of sorts which are denominated in units of weight of precious metal while these usually charge some fees they do meet your criteria of being able to buy and sell precious metals without needing to store them yourself also these fees are likely lower than similar storage arranged by yourself depending on the specifics they may also make buying small amounts practical buying small amounts of physical precious metals usually comes with a large mark up over the spot price sometimes to the tune of a 50 or so immediate loss if you buy and then immediately sell do note that as pointed out by john bensin buying gold gets you an amount of metal the local currency value of which will vary over time sometimes wildly so it is not the same thing as depositing the original amount of money in a bank account since 2006 the price of an ounce about grams of gold has gone from under $ 500 us to over $ 1800 us to under $ 1100 us few other investment classes are anywhere near this volatile if you are interested in this type of service you might want to check out not the same thing at all as bitcoin or i am not affiliated with either make sure to do your research thoroughly as these may or may not be covered by the same regulations as regular banks particularly if you choose a company based outside of or a storage location outside of your own country

what you 've described is the norm in australia where it 's rare for anyone under sixty to use cheques assuming they 're transferring the funds using internet banking i would have the following suggestions you make it clear that the the funds must reach your account by the due date for rent it is their the tenant 's responsibility to allow for the normal transfer delay from their account to yours this will save unpleasant arguments later if the rent is late if you 're not comfortable with your tenant knowing your banking details set up another account specifically for receiving rental income payments and paying your costs associated with the property this may have the added benefit of simplifying things at tax time another alternative which i think others have mentioned is to use an escrow service like paypal but be aware that these kinds of services will usually charge a small percentage when you withdraw your funds

you could not have two stocks both at $ 40 both with p e 2 but one an eps of $ 5 and the other $ 10   eps = earnings per share p e = price per share earnings per share so in your example the stock with eps of $ 5 has a p e of 8 and the stock with an eps of $ 10 has a p e of 4   so no it 's not valid way of looking at things because your understanding of eps and p e is incorrect update ok with that fixed i think i understand your question better this is n't a valid way of looking at p e. you nailed one problem yourself at the end of the post the tricky part is that you have to assume certain values remain    constant i suppose but besides that it still does n't work it seems to make sense in the context of investor psychology if a stock is supposed to trade at a low p e like a utility that it would stay at that low p e and thus a $ 1 worth of eps increase would result in lower $ $ price increase than a stock that was supposed to have a high p e. and that would be true but let 's game it out scenario say you have two stocks abc and xyz both have $ 5 eps abc is a utility so it has a low p e of 5 and thus trades at $ xyz is a high flying tech company so it has a p e of 10 thus trading at $ 50/share if both companies increase their eps by $ 1 to $ 6 and the p es remain the same that means company abc rises to $ 30 and company xyz rises to $ 60 hey one went up $ 5 and the other $ 10 twice as much that means xyz was the better investment right nope you see shares are not tokens and you do n't get an identical arbitrary number of them you make an investment and that 's in dollars so say you 'd invested $ 1,000 in each $ 1,000 in abc buys you 40 shares $ 1,000 in xyz buys you 20 shares their eps adds that buck the shares rise to maintain p e and you have abc $ 6 eps at p e 5 = $ 30/share position value = 40 shares x $ 30/share = $ 1,200 xyz $ 6 eps at p e 10 = $ position value = 20 shares x $ = $ 1,200 they both make you the exact same 20 profit it makes sense when you think about it this way a 20 increase in eps is going to give you a 20 increase in price if the p e is to remain constant it does n't matter what the dollar amount of the eps or the share price is

as i understand it if the borrower puts a down payment of 20 and the bank puts down 80 then the bank and the borrower own the home jointly as   tenants in common with a split of the asset amongst them the   borrower moves into the home and pays the bank 80 of the fair rental   value of the home each month   material added changed in edit for the purposes of illustration suppose that the borrower and the bank agree that the fair rental per month is 0.5 of the purchase cost the   borrower pays 80 of that amount i.e. 0.4 of the purchase cost   to the bank on a monthly basis   the borrower is not required to do   so but may choose to pay more money than this 0.4 of the purchase cost each month or pay some amount in a lump sum if he does so he will own a larger percentage of the house and so future monthly payments will be a smaller fraction of the agreed upon fair rental per month so there is an incentive to pay off the bank if and when the house is sold the sale price is divided between borrower and bank according to the percentage of ownership as of the date of sale so the bank gets to share in the profits if any on the other hand if the house is sold for less than the original purchase price then the bank also suffers in the loss it is not a case of a mortgage being paid off from the proceeds and the home owner gets whatever is left or even suffering a loss when the dust has settled the bank gets only its percentage of the sale price even if this amount is less than what it put up in the first place minus any additional payments made by the borrower i have no idea how other costs of home ownership property taxes insurance repair and maintenance or improvements additions etc are handled ditto what happens on schedule a if   such a loan is made to a us taxpayer

yes they 're using it as a currency   what they actually have demand for is houses and and if bitcoin was n't available they 'd be happy to do it in any other currency   when any other currency goes up it 's because there 's overall higher demand than supply for it to buy things you can only buy in a particular currency     a very common example is government bonds of the issuing government for a currency   that 's why when the fed raises the interest rate the us dollar goes up   it is because at a bond auction the government will only take us dollars so anyone that wants to buy some bonds needs to first buy us dollars   if the interest rate goes up all things being equal those bonds are relatively more attractive than other countries bonds and that change in demand increases the demand for the currency which raises it 's price   note the key thing here it needs to be something you can only buy or at least buy for the cheapest price in a particular currency   if it 's something you can buy with any currency than that event generally does n't impact the currency price   although it 's a very important food crop if the price of rice goes up it does n't really impact the usd even though you can buy rice with usd   here 's the tricky part what can you buy with bitcoin that you ca n't buy with any other currency

there should be no affect on your taxes if you profit on the sale of a home it does not matter whether you own the home fully or not selling a house with a mortgage on it will usually incur fees like mortgage processing fees paying off the mortgage is preferable because that will make the sale easier when a bank is involved then they will function in the closing as a 3rd or 4th party making everything more complicated not only that they will charge you fees for making them sit through a closing the bank will require a lawyer guess who pays for their lawyer you do when you pay off a mortgage none of this happens you just pay the mortgage and the bank goes away there are no lawyers and no fees this makes it easier to sell the house and gives you full control over the sale

the difference is in the between the varied investments you make hedging is about specifically offsetting a possible loss in an investment by making another related investment that will increase in value for the same reasons that the original investment would lose value gold for instance is often regarded as the ultimate hedge its value is typically inversely correlated to the rest of the market as a whole because its status as a material durable store of value makes it a preferred safe haven to move money into in times of economic downturn when stock prices bond yields and similar investments are losing value that specific behavior makes investing in gold alongside stocks and bonds a hedge the increase in value of gold as stock prices and bond yields fall limits losses in those other areas investment of cash in gold is also specifically a hedge against currency inflation paper money account balances and even debt instruments like bonds and cds can lose real value over time in a hot economy where there 's more money than things to buy with it by keeping a store of value in something other than currency the price of that good will rise as the currencies used to buy it decrease in real value maintaining your level of real wealth other hedges are more localized one might for example trade oil futures as a hedge on a position in transportation stocks when oil prices rise trucking and airline companies suffer in the short term as their margins get squeezed due to fuel costs currency futures are another popular hedge a company in international business will often trade options on the currencies of the companies it does business in to limit the seen in the forex spot market caused by speculation and other transient changes in market demand diversification by contrast is about choosing multiple unrelated investments the idea being to limit losses due to a localized change in the market companies stocks gain and lose value every day and those companies can also go out of business without bringing the entire economy to its knees by spreading your wealth among investments in multiple industries and companies of various sizes and global locations you insulate yourself against the risk that any one of them will fail   if tomorrow kroger grocery stores went bankrupt and all its stores people in the regions it serves might be but the market as a whole will move on you however would have lost everything if you 'd bet your retirement on that one stock nobody does that in the real world instead you put some of your money in kroger some in microsoft some in home depot some in some in pg&e etc etc by investing in stocks that would be more or less unaffected by a downturn in another if kroger went bankrupt tomorrow you would still have say 95 of your investment next egg still alive well and continuing to pay you dividends the flip side is that if tomorrow kroger announced an exclusive deal with the girl scouts to sell their cookies making them the only place in the country you can get them you would miss out on the full possible amount of gains you 'd get from the price spike if you had bet everything on kroger   hindsight 's always 20/20 i could have spent some beer money to buy bitcoins when they were changing hands for pennies and i 'd be a multi millionaire right now you ca n't think that way when investing because it 's survivor bias you see the successes topping the index charts not the failures you could just as easily have invested in any of the hundreds of internet startups that do n't last a year

there are different ways to determine the value of a company when an entrepreneur starts a new company himself and owns 100 of the company the fair market value is unknown he has put his own money into the company so it has a high investment value to him meaning he has a lot at stake in the company the asset value is probably less than the investment value meaning if he closed the company he would lose some of the money he invested   now using your example a venture capitalist comes along and takes a look at the company she believes that the company has a great future potential to make money which means that she believes that the intrinsic value is very high she decides to invest $ 1 million in the company for a 10 stake and the founder agrees the fair market value of the company at that moment is $ 10 million the vc believes that the intrinsic value of the company is more than $ 10 million and that she is making a good investment the asset value of the company just went up by $ 1 million   to answer your question the $ 1 million is not the founder 's to spend on a new house it is the company 's money however the founder owns 90 of the company the new capital will allow the company to buy whatever assets the company needs to meet the potential that the founder and the vc see in it and make the company grow and earn money for the two investors   a crooked founder could theoretically close down the company immediately and pocket 90 of the new cash but there are certainly legal protections in the contract they signed when the investment was made that prevent him from doing that

a stock is an ownership interest in a company   there can be multiple classes of shares but to simplify assuming only one class of shares a company issues some number of shares let 's say 1,000,000 shares and you can buy shares of the company if you own 1,000 shares in this example you would own one one of the company   public companies have their shares traded on the open market and the price varies as demand for the stock comes and goes relative to people willing to sell their shares you typically buy stock in a company because you believe the company is going to prosper into the future and thus the value of its stock should rise in the open market a bond is an indebted interest in a company   a company issues bonds to borrow money at an interest rate specified in the bond issuance and makes periodic payments of principal and interest   you buy bonds in a company to lend the company money at an interest rate specified in the bond because you believe the company will be able to repay the debt per the terms of the bond   the value of a bond as traded on the open exchange varies as the prevailing interest rates vary   if you buy a bond for $ 1,000 yielding 5 interest and interest rates go up to 10 the value of your bond in the open market goes down so that the payment terms of 5 on $ 1,000 matches hypothetical terms of 10 on a lesser principal amount   whatever lesser principal amount at the new rate would lead to the same payment terms determines the new market value    alternatively if interest rates go down the current value of your bond increases on the open market to make it appear as if it is yielding a lower rate regardless of the market value the company continues to pay interest on the original debt per its terms so you can always hold onto a bond and get the original promised interest as long as the company does not go bankrupt so in summary bonds tend to be a safer investment that offers less potential return   however this is not always the case since if interest rates skyrocket your bond 's value will plummet although you could just hold onto them and get the low rate originally promised

1- wells fargo does not own our current mortgage   they have bundled it and sold it as an investment 2- they make their money from servicing the loan   even if they only get $ 50 per month to service it 3 of our monthly payment that adds up to $ per month if they have a million homes under management   that is $ 600 million per year for each million homes being serviced 3- managing the escrow gets them additional profit because they can invest it and earn 2 3   if 1,000,000 homes have an average balance of $ 2,000 in their escrow accounts they can earn up to $ 60 per year or $ annually they make $ 1,000 every time they refinance the home   this is the approximate profit after paying real closing costs   refinance those million homes and you make a cool billion in profit 5- they also want to be sure that they keep us as a customer   by lowering our payment they decrease the likelyhood that we will refinance with someone else and we are less likely to default   not that they lose if we default because they do n't own the loan they make additional profit by paying off the old loan they do n't own it remember then packaging and selling the new mortgage   since they are selling it as a security they sell for future value meaning they sell our $ 200,000 loan for a valuation of $   this means that they sell for $ 200,000 plus some fraction of the additional $ 160,000   let 's say they only want a 10 premium of the $ valuation   that means they sell our $ 200,000 loan for $   they pocket $ 36,000   if they make a million of these transactions every year that is $ 36 billion dollars in profit so wells fargo refinances one million homes every year and they make $ initial profit for selling the loan with absolutely no risk plus $ for doing the loan $ annually to service the loan very little risk since it is being paid by the owner of the loan as a service fee if they can retain the loans for their entire life keep us from refinancing with someone else they can make $ that is billion dollars in servicing fees the profit they make in a refinance is much greater than the money then can make by holding the loan for 30 years
