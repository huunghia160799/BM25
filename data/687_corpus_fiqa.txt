if i understand correctly the traditional ira if you have 401k with an employer already has the following features actually 1 and 2 are characteristics of roth iras not traditional iras only 3 is a characteristic of a traditional ira whether you have a 401(k with your employer or not makes absolutely no difference in how your iras are taxed for the vast majority of people the rules for iras are different if you have a very high income though you 're allowed to have and contribute to both kinds of accounts in fact i personally have both traditional iras are tax deferred not tax free as people sometimes mistakenly call them they 're very different meaning that you do n't have to pay taxes on the contributions or profits you make inside the account e.g. from dividends interest profits from stock you sell etc rather you pay taxes on any money you withdraw for roth iras the contributions are taxed but you never have to pay taxes on the money inside the account again that means that any money you get over and above the contributions e.g. through interest trading profits dividends etc are genuinely tax free also if you leave any of the money to people they do n't have to pay any taxes either important point there are no tax free retirement accounts in the u.s. the distinction between different kinds of iras basically boils down to pay now or pay later many people make expensive mistakes in their retirement strategy by not understanding that point please note that this applies equally to traditional and roth 401(k)s as well you can have roth 401(k)s and traditional 401(k)s just like you can have roth iras and traditional iras the same terminology and logic applies to both kinds of accounts as far as i know there are n't major differences tax wise between them with two exceptions you 're allowed to contribute more money to a 401(k per year and you 're allowed to have a 401(k even if you have a high income by way of contrast people with very high incomes generally are n't allowed to open iras a primary advantage of a traditional ira is that you can in theory at least afford to contribute more money to it due to the tax break you 're getting also you can defer taxes on any profits you make e.g. through dividends or selling stock at a profit so you can grow your money faster

gt they can be taxed at the long term capital gains rate whereas dividends are subject to a higher tax rate   that 's not true is it i 'm fairly sure they 're taxed at the same rate now buybacks are still better for shareholders though because those who do n't want to sell have the option of just holding the stock with dividends everyone gets a dividend and the associated tax hit whether they want it or not   edit oh right ordinary dividends are taxed as ordinary income qualified dividends are not but are n't qualified dividends the modal type

gt 1 funny how you picked the highest estimate for the us and the lowest estimate for the uk   mea it appears average cost for the us is $ blog guides coronary cost my personal family experience with it is $ 50 k though this means the us costs would have to come down by only 80 to be affordable by us families i still strongly disagree that this could be accomplished by deregulation of any kind and that 's not even considering the loss in quality that would likely accompany such a move   if anyone expresses wishful thinking it 's you   sources man sources there is no argument without facts    gt;i live in a country with uh    well then we 're both operating from a position of ignorance i do n't know what it 's like with uh and you do n't know what it 's like without it in that case all i can do is look at the money the us spends vs everyone else and then look at our national health outcomes vs. everyone else e.g. heart health maternity health life span etc america sucks at both    still have the same problems except that you get a hefty tax increase on top and end up shoving 50 60 of your income down the state 's throat in addition   there are a handful of countries that charge that much income tax but the bottom line is that those countries on the whole still spend less on healthcare than the so while that 10 or 15 of your check that goes towards uh sucks remember that if you were in the us you 'd be paying 20 to 30 to an outside company for insurance plus you 'd have to deal with pre existing conditions and finding doctors in network and jumping all the bullshit hurdles americans do on a daily basis without any of the convenience of having one single system to coordinate those resources    so you 're either paying down the government 's throat or your paying twice that down a private company 's throat it sucks either way but uh mitigates how bad it sucks   and one interesting note i thought you were full of shit about paying 60 in taxes but some places actually do charge that articles countries with the highest taxes in the so you could be right but two interesting correlations about those countries is that they all have uh and they all dominate the top spots in the un 's happiest places in the denmark as worlds happiest country un report    do n't underestimate the stress of living as a regular citizen without the benefit of a strong social safety net

i got started by reading the following two books you could probably get by with just the first of those two i have n't been a big fan of the for dummies series in the past but i found both of these were quite good particularly for people who have little understanding of investing i also rather like the site canadian couch potato that has a wealth of information on passive investing using mutual funds and etfs it 's a good next step after reading one or the other of the books above in your specific case you are investing for the fairly short term and your tolerance for risk seems to be quite low gold is a high risk investment and in my opinion is ill suited to your investment goals i 'd say you are looking at a money market account very low risk low return such as e.g. the td canadian money market fund you may also want to take a look at e.g. the td canadian bond index which is only slightly higher risk however for someone just starting out and without a whack of knowledge i rather like pointing people at the ing direct funds they offer three options balancing risk vs reward you can fill in their online fund and it 'll point you in the right direction you can pay less by buying individual stock and bond funds through your bank following e.g. one of the canadian couch potato 's model portfolios but ing direct makes things nice and simple and is a good option for people who do n't care to spend a lot of time on this note that i am not a financial adviser and i have only a limited understanding of your needs you may want to consult one though you 'll want to be careful when doing so to avoid just talking to a salesperson also note that i am biased toward passive index investing other people may recommend that you invest in gold or real estate or specific stocks i think that 's a bad idea and believe i have the science to back this up but i may be wrong

a firm is a separate legal person from its shareholders or owners but does n't get invited to parties much owners invest capital to get shares in the firm or may get shares for investing time effort etc but those shares are on a limited liability basis that means that shareholders are only liable up to the value of their shares and that the firm itself is responsible for any expenses or liabilities the firm will have working capital from its initial investors i.e. any capital invested to get shares and can borrow money on the bond market or issue new shares to cover outgoings share ownership simply entitles the owner to a proportion of the residual equity of the company and voting rights for non equity in a firm that i previously worked for for example one of the partners owned 51 of the firm but put up 100 of the firm 's equity capital the other partner owned 49 and provided 90 of the intellectual capital of the firm they both took decisions equally the distribution of ownership should therefore have no bearing on who finances deals the owners or managers in larger firms should decide together how to use the company 's capital for spending because it is exactly that the company 's capital not any one of the investor 's limited liability of owners is one of the major benefits of forming a company

yes you must file north carolina and south carolina income tax if you live in one state and work in another the income is potentially taxed twice most states give a credit for taxes paid to the other state often you pay the tax in the state where you worked and then if the tax rate in the state where you live is higher you pay the difference but the details depend on the tax laws of the two states involved i 'm not an expert on either carolina 's tax laws start by getting the forms and instructions from both states and see what they say or if you 're using tax software see if it handles this case if someone else on here knows the specifics of the tax laws for the i gladly yield many states establish reciprocity agreements with other states usually the neighboring states that generally say that if the state you live in and the state you work in are both party to the agreement then you only pay tax in the state you live in this simplifies things a lot unfortunately neither north carolina nor south carolina have such agreements with each other or with any other state

i would agree with the other answers about it being a bad idea to invest in stocks in the short term however do consider also long term repairs for example you should be prepared to a repair happening in 20 years in addition to repairs happening in a couple of months so if it is at all possible for you to save a bit more put 2 of the construction cost of a typical new house just a house not the land the house is standing on aside every year into a long term repair fund and invest it into stocks i would recommend a low cost index fund or passive etf instead of manually picking stocks when you have a long term repair that requires large amounts of money but will be good for decades to come you will take some money out of the long term repair fund where i live houses cost about 4000 eur per square meter but most of that is the land and building permit cost the actual construction cost is about 2500 eur per square meter so i would put away 50 eur per square meter every year so for example for a relatively small 50 square meter apartment that would mean 2500 eur per year there are quite many repairs that are long term repairs for example in apartment buildings plumbing needs to be every 40 years or so given such a long time period it makes sense to invest the money into stocks so my recommendation would be to have two repair funds short term repairs and long term repairs only the long term repair fund should be invested into stocks

sounds to me like you 're describing just how it should work   ask is at 30 bid is at 20 you offer a new bid at 25   either depending on liquidity one or the other may be more likely this article on the subject describes what you 're seeing and recommends the strategy you 're describing precisely instead of a market order take advantage of the fact that the options world truly is a marketplace one where you can possibly get a better price just by asking how does that work if you use a limit order instead of a market order when opening a position you can tell your broker how much you are willing to pay to enter a trade for example if you enter a limit price of $ 1.15 you can see whether the market maker will bite you will be surprised at how many times you will get your price i.e. $ 1.15 instead of the ask price of $ 1.30 if your order at $ 1.15 is not filled after a few minutes you can modify your order and pay the ask price by entering a market order or limit order at the ask price that is you can tell your broker to pay no more than $ 1.30

you do not need to inform your employer of your additional activity but it is your responsibility not to work for more than 48 hours per week as long as you are an employee so if you are working 38 hours for your employer you may not work for yourself for more than 10 hours it is however not so easy in practice to draw the line between work and a hobby as long as you are not being paid by the hour the main reason to present your employer with an addition to your work contract is to make it legally very clear that he holds no intentions to claim copyright to your work he may attempt to do something funky like claim your home computer is in fact a work computer because you used it once a month to work from home and your work contract may contain a paragraph that all work performed on a work computer results in copyright ownership for your employer i have no idea how likely this is in practice but this is the reason i know is commonly given as legal advice to have a contract so the normal contract you present your employer with says in order to earn user contribution money from a website you need to register as a sole proprietor and pay trade tax and sales tax alternatively you claim small trade exception which also makes a tax return mandatory i would guess however and this is not legal advice in any way just my guess that a couple of contributions towards server cost in a strictly non profit endeavor is not commercial at all but private in the same way that you may write an invoice to someone you sold your old bike to or a kid may get paid to mow someone 's lawn based on that guess my non legal advice recommendation is to take the contributions and do nothing else as long as the amount is nowhere near breaking even if you count your work input

maybe i am a bit jaded but i do n't spend a lot of time trying to convince friends or family members to avoid mlm schemes even though i personally see them as scams if they specifically ask for my advice i will walk them through the economics of the particular mlm that they are interested in i have found that if you get to pushy in showing your friends or family members that their new business is actually a fraud they tend to get defensive and it becomes counter productive to continue trying to convince them of their mistake you waste your time and anger your friend or family member it 's just not worth it there are a few key questions i like to ask people about their mlm business   what does the business do how do you make money how do they make money you would be amazed at the number of people that sign up and pay money to get into a business and they do n't even have the slightest clue what the business actually does even fewer have an idea about how they can actually make money because the entire sales presentation focuses on what they could with all of the money they are going to make why does this business need you what do you bring to the table that the business does n't already have skills contacts money most mlm 's and especially the pyramid schemes focus more on recruiting people than selling products because they make their money on over priced initiation fees and their products are mediocre at best

when businesses use arbitration only clauses they essentially force any enforcement action for wrong doing onto government no matter how egregious are the actions of the business it is not financially feasible to for small dollar issues and it is thus up to government to litigate   this allows businesses to act with impunity as they know that the risks of government action are slim and there is no chance of getting sued by private parties     remember all of those unauthorized bank accounts that wells fargo opened   when sued by private parties they successfully argued that it must go to arbitration the bank committed fraud against their customers and they still get to pick the venue and terms of any litigation

most companies that have employee discounts have policies to prevent exactly this sometimes they will say that you can only use the company discount for products that you intend to use yourself they 'll specifically ban buying things for friends of course enforcing such a rule can be difficult but a car is a big enough purchase that if they have such a rule they 're likely to pay attention other times they try to discourage letting friends use your discount by having rules that make it awkward like i used to work for a furniture company that said you had to pick up the furniture personally at the office where you worked so if you wanted to buy a for your brother who lived in another state you 'd have to pay to ship it and probably wipe out most of the savings from the employee discount my daughter 's employer says you have to show your employee id when you make the purchase and then they deduct it from your next paycheck so you 'd have to get your friend to pay you back maybe loan them your id if they want to pick it out which would get awkward etc assuming the company does n't care if you buy with an employee discount and re sell or their rules are lax enough that you can get away with it i 'm not aware of any law that would stop you in general there are n't any laws against you re selling things you 've bought people have garage sales and sell used cars and the like all the time there are specific exceptions like you ca n't re sell prescription drugs

if you have a great technical trading system that gets you winning trading 80 85 of the time in backtesting the question should be why are you not trading it to get a better idea of how good your trading system is you should work out your expectancy per trade this will tell you how much you should make on average for every trade you take expectancy not only considers your win rate but also you win size to loss size ratio for example if you are getting winning trades 80 of the time but your average win size is $ 100 and your 20 of losses average $ 500 then you will still be losing money you should be aiming for an average win size of at least 2.5 to 3 times you average loss size this will provide you a profitable trading system even if your win rate is 50 if your trading system is really that good and provides a win size of at least 2.5 times your loss size then you should be actively trading it also if you put your trading system out there in the public domain together with your trading results you will actually find that quite opposite to what the consensus above is your results from your trading plan should actually improve further the more people acting on the outcome of a signal in the same direction the higher the probability that the movement in the desired direction will actually occur if you are looking to make money from your trading ideas no one will pay anything unless you have real results to back it up so if you are so confident about your system you should start trading it with real money of course you should start off small and build it up over time as your results as per your simulations

can i pay $ 12,000 extra once a year or $ 1000 every month which option is better depends when if you mean 12 k now vs 1 k a month over the next 12 months repeating this each year now wins if you mean saving 1 k a month for 12 months then doing a the 1 k a month wins basically a sooner payment saves you more money than a later payment the first option does sound better but for a 30 year mortgage is it that significant your number one issue is that you have a thirty year mortgage the interest you pay on it is monstrous for the 30 year term you pay around 500 k in interest a 15-year mortgage is 300 k cheaper only 200 k in interest will be paid the monthly payment would be 1250 more how much money and years on a mortgage can i save when is the best time to pay at the end of each year you can knock off about a dozen years save i think you can find mortgage calculators online or talk to your mortgage advisor to play around with the numbers

you mention only two debts mortgage and student loan but you mention $ 19 k in savings which suggests that you are a saver and likely do not have other debts you did not mention your net income and expenses income statement but since you have substantial savings you likely live within your means income > expenses   since you mention $ 38 k in retirement we might conclude you are regularly saving for retirement are you saving 10 toward retirement you did not mention any medical condition or other debts that might require a large savings so i would suggest having 6 months savings $ 2.5 k x 6 = $ 15 k but should your net expenses be less you might reduce this $ 2 k x 6 = $ 12 k you do not mention any investment you might want to make but since you did not mention any candidate investments we can assume you have no specific investments you find particularly attractive   you did not mention anything you were saving to purchase that you might want to purchase you have combined $ 19 k + $ 50 k = $ 69 k savings and $ 15 k would be a comfortable emergency savings leaving $ 54 k you could use to reduce mortgage or student loan debt the mortgage debt interest is higher so paying that debt off would be like earning 4.5 guaranteed return on your money tax free   at your income your marginal tax rate is low enough that the mortgage interest deduction if you do itemize would not reduce this return much 15 if you itemize the student loan debt interest would be like earning 2.8 guaranteed return on your money tax free clearly the higher return on your investment in paying off debt would be reducing your mortgage balance over 50 higher return on investment compared to the student loan debt you did not mention any circumstance that might cause the student loan rate to increase the mortgage rate to increase nor did you mention any difficulty making both the mortgage and student loan payments the amounts of either payment nor the number of years remaining to pay on either should you need or desire to reduce your payments you could choose to payoff the student loan to eliminate one payment and thus decrease your expenses   or you could choose to pay down the mortgage and refinance or the mortgage to obtain a smaller payment   another strategy assuming you have had your house for 5 7 years might be to pay the mortgage down enough to refinance into a 15 year loan and assuming you have a good credit score obtain a lower 3 rate but i am going to suggest you consider a blended approach   combine the dave ramsey debt snowball approach with the reduce the interest rate approach   take the $ 54 k $ 57 k available after reserving 6 months emergency fund and split between both   you pay your mortgage down by $ 27 k and your student loan debt down by $   your blended return on investment is 2.8 + = and you have the following balance sheet assets debts the next steps would be to there are two great reasons for paying off the student loan debt one is the dave ramsey debt snowball approach which is that this is the smaller debt and thus represents a psychological win and the other is that student loan debt has special treatment even in bankruptcy

what you have is usually called a pre paid credit card   you pay some money indian rupees to the credit card company and then you can use the card to pay for purchases etc in foreign non indian currencies upto the remaining balance on the card if a proposed charge exceeds the remaining balance the transaction will be declined when you try to use the card   there might be multiple ways that the card is set up e.g. it might be restricted to charge purchases denominated in us dollars alone or you might be able to use it anywhere in the world except india   the balance on the card might be denominated in inr or in us$ say in the latter case the exchange rate at which your inr payment was converted into the $ us balance is fixed and agreed to at the time of the original payment you paid inr 70 k say and the balance was set to us$ 1000 even though the exchange rate on the open market would have given you a few more us dollars in the former case with the balance denominated in inr a charge of us$ 100 say would be converted to inr at a fixed agreed upon rate or at the current exchange rate that the visa or mastercard network is using plus typically a 3 fee currency exchange fee and your balance in inr will decrease accordingly with all that as if you made a purchase from walmart usa and later returned it for a credit it should increase your credit card balance   appropriately you may be with currency conversion fees along the way depending on how your card is set up but with a us$ card a credit of us$ 100 should increase your card balance by us$ 100 so that $ us 100 can be spent on something else instead   in short the card is    your bank account you can not spend more than the remaining balance on the card just like you can not withdraw more money from your bank account than you have in the account and you can recharge your card by making more inr payments into it so as to increase the available balance but it is like a current account in that you are unlikely to earn interest on the balance the way you do with a savings account so what if you are back in india and have no further use of this card can you get your balance back as cash or deposit into your regular bank account call the customer help line or read the card agreement you signed

this answer is to supplement the answers about what cd laddering is and what its benefits are i 'm going to talk about its risks cd ladders are subject to risk they are not subject to very much credit risk and investment risk they 're federally insured barring the dissolution of the united states government as we know it you will get all your money back however they are subject to inflation risk and a little bit of interest rate risk a cd is basically a promise for a certain amount of money after a certain amount of time inflation risk happens when there 's inflation and the money that you 've been promised is n't worth as much anymore because everything 's gotten more expensive interest rate risk happens when you buy a cd in a very low interest rate environment like oh the year 2010 and rates subsequently rise you might have been somewhat better off waiting for rates to rise before buying the cd also if you were to try and re sell it you would get an inferior price enough to make up for the interest rate difference note that interest rates tend to rise if there is a significant amount of inflation so these two risks go together interest rate risk and inflation risk are higher for longer term cds at least right now because there 's more opportunity for inflation and interest rates to rise 2010 has been marked by the extraordinarily low interest rate environment which prevails and the federal reserve has announced that it is trying to bring about a higher rate of inflation you may have heard something about a second round of quantitative easing a quick look at interest rates show that 2 5 year cds yield about 1.50 these days you could alternatively get a savings account that yields 1.4 preserves your liquidity and will raise the rate it pays you on savings in the event that inflation and interest rates rise or if they do n't raise it you can move the account unlike a cd in summary as of right now october 2010 fixed income investments like cds do n't pay you very much and have elevated levels of risk especially for long term investment this is one of the worst times possible to invest in a cd ladder

it depends on the size of the payroll not on the number of employees   probably you need to file form 941 quarterly under this scenario   you may or may not need to deposit taxes more frequently   if you must deposit then you need to do it electronically i this from the instructions for form 941 if your total taxes line 10 are less than $ 2,500 for    the current quarter or the preceding quarter and you    did not incur a $ 100,000 next day deposit obligation    during the current quarter you do not have to make a deposit to avoid a penalty you must pay the amount in full with a timely filed return or you must deposit the amount timely if you are not sure your total tax liability for the current quarter will be less than $ 2,500 and your liability for the preceding quarter was not less than $ 2,500 make deposits using the or monthly rules so you wo n't be subject to failure to deposit penalties if your total taxes line 10 are $ 2,500 or more for the    current quarter and the preceding quarter   you must    make deposits according to your deposit schedule see    section 11 of pub 15 circular e for information and rules    about federal tax deposits i would say that probably for two employees you need to deposit by the 15th of each month for the prior month but you really need to check the limits above and the deposit schedule in pub 15 as referenced above based on your actual payroll size note that if you have a requirement to deposit that must be done either through or by wire transfer   the former is free but requires registration in advance of your first payment they mail you a pin that you need to log in and it requires that you get your payment in by the night before   the latter does not incur a charge from the irs but your bank will likely charge you a fee   you can do the wire transfer on the due date however so it 's handy if do n't get into in time this is all for federal   you may also need to deposit for your state and then you 'll need to check the state 's rules

from a purely financial standpoint psychology aside the choice between paying off debt and investing on risky investments boils down to a comparison of risk and reward   yes on average the stock market has risen an average of 10 give or take per year but the yearly returns on the s&p 500 have ranged from a high of in 1995 to a low of in 2008   so there 's a good chance that your investment in index funds will get a better return than the guaranteed return of paying off the loan but it 's not certain and you might end up much worse   you could even calculate a rough probability of coming out better with some reasonable assumptions e.g. if you assume that returns are normally distributed which historically they 're not but your chances are probably around 30 that you 'll end up worse off in one year your odds are better the longer your investment horizon is   if you can tolerate meaning you have both the desire and the ability to take that risk then you might come out ahead    the non financial factors however the psychology of debt the drain on discretionary cash flow etc can not be dismissed as irrational   paying off debt feels good   yes finance disagree with dave ramsey and his approaches but you can not deny the problems that debt causes millions of households both consumer debt and student loan debt as well   if that makes them mindless because they follow a plan that worked for them then so be it disclosure i am a and a fan but do n't agree 100 with him

while on the surface it may seem that the warrant you described is trading below intrinsic value there are many reasons why that might not be the case it 's more likely that you are lacking information than having identified a derivative instrument that the market has failed to reasonably price for instance might there be a conversion ratio on the warrants other than the 1:1 ratio that you seem to be assuming sometimes warrant terms are such that multiple warrants are required to buy one share of stock consider the conversion ratio is the number of warrants needed in order to buy    or sell one investment unit therefore if the conversion ratio to    buy stock xyz is this means that the holder needs three warrants    in order to purchase one share usually if the conversion ratio is    high the price of the share will be low and vice versa source conversion ratios are sometimes used so that warrants can be issued on a 1:1 basis to existing stockholders but where the potential number of new shares to be issued is much less conversion ratio is just one such example that could lead to perceived mispricing and there may be other restrictions on exercise warrants are not issued by an options exchange using standardized option contract terms and so warrant terms vary considerably from issuer to issuer even series of warrants from the same issuer may have differing terms always look beyond any warrant quote to find a definitive source of the warrant 's precise terms and read those terms carefully before taking any position

your best course of action is to gather your paperwork ask around your personal network for a recommendation for a good cpa and pay that person to do your taxes business and personal   read through the completed package and have them walk you through every item you do not understand   i would continue doing this until you feel confident that you can file for yourself   even then the first couple of times i did my own i 'd pay them to review my work   assuming you find a cpa with reasonable fees they will likely point out tax inefficiencies in the way you do your business which will more than pay for their fees    it can be like a point of honor for cpas to ensure that their customers get their money 's worth in this way   not saying all cpas work this way but to me this would be a criteria for one that i would recommend

maybe but electricity is used for countless devices already   if people stopped driving entirely overall electricity usage would most likely stay right where it is   however if people stopped driving gasoline consumption would plummet because its primary use is fuel for an internal combustion engine   given how much electricity we use already i 'm not convinced a full switch to electric cars would cause the cost of charging an electric car to jump to $ 30

yes you do have to pay taxes in the uk as well but it depends on how much you have already been taxed in the us say you have to pay 20 tax in the uk for your earnings here you are required to pay the same percentage on your foreign income as well now if your home country already taxed you at 10 for the sake of example then you only need to pay the remaining 10 in the uk however the tax law in the uk does allow you to choose between arising basis and remittance basis on your income from the country you are domiciled in what i have explained above is based on when income arises but the laws are complicated and you are almost always better off by paying it on arising basis

well perhaps have a dedicated tax advisor is an answer then i    would n't have thought of this as it 's not specifically about    taxation is it or more broadly consult with a dedicated    professional for the situation in detail yes that is the only real answer you can get anything else will vary between highly localized to entirely incorrect pensions are rarely defined benefit anymore and not many countries still keep state sponsored defined benefit pension plans for most what 's left is social security system which is in no way a pension this is an insurance and is paid as tax which is rarely refundable but you wo n't always have to pay it if you 're a foreigner in the country usually social security benefits are only available to citizens and in some rare cases residents of that country so it is unlikely although possible that you 'll benefit from social security payments of more than one country some countries have treaties that make your social security payments in one count in the other if you 're in a country that has such an agreement with the netherlands you 're lucky your personal pension savings are basically tax deferred investment accounts but tax deferral in one country does n't necessarily work in another in the us you have 401k or ira accounts but in your own country they may very well be taxable so you gain the tax deferral in the us but if your own country taxes them you lost the benefit and you will still have to abide by the us tax rules when taking the money out if you do n't plan properly you can easily be hit by double taxation in such cases bottom line you need to plan your pension savings on your own privately with a good and solid tax advice and pension planning advice that would be relevant to all the countries that you are tax resident at at any given time you can easily be resident for tax purposes in more than one country these advisers have to take into account the laws of the countries involved the tax treaties between themselves and between them and the country of your citizenship   and the future countries you 're planning on visiting or getting old at its complicated and most likely you wo n't be able to predict everything especially because the laws and treaties tend to change over time

it does n't make rational sense if you think the goal of having money is to have more money   on the other hand imagine you are someone for whom the goal of having money is to feel powerful successful and to be able to tell the world in no uncertain terms to fuck itself imagine on top of that you already have enough money that your money alone is earning you enough to keep you in the good life and will likely continue to do so for a long time   in that position being able to hold a cheque for $ 300 m and not cash it would be the ultimate validation of all the things you got rich for in the first place

so the key factor here imho is the amount we are talking about   $ 2 k is just not a lot of money   if you lose every penny you can recover   on the other hand it is unlikely to make you wealthy   so if i was you i would buy in more for the fun of it all now if it was a large amount of money that we were talking about it would be about a percentage of my net worth   for example lets say the minimum was 20 k and you really believed in the company   if i had a net worth of less than 200 k i would not do it   if i had a larger net worth i would consider it unless i was near retirement so if i was 30 hand a net worth of 300 k i would probably invest as even if i did lose it all i could recover     having said all that it does not sound like you completely agree that the company will be profitable   so in that case do n't buy also i have the opportunity to buy my own company 's stock at a discount   however i do not for two reasons   the first is i do n't like investing in the company i work for   secondly they require you to hold the stock for a year

how can this possibly be profitable for both parties if the theater is getting paid in full for each movie at $ 10 a month they basically have cut even on a single movie so every movie someone watched after that would be a loss unless there 's something i 'm missing a movie is $ 10 where i 'm at if i pay this company $ 10 and watch 4 movies 1 a per week how can everyone make a profit the margins are n't that great for them to be giving super discounted bulk rates either and most theaters make money off of concessions anyways so it would end up being the movie   productions that gets stiffed

i 'm not saying they should n't try and perhaps in the very long run it might be a good idea in fact if they were able to fix some of their own problems it would be a great idea here is my understanding of a few points to suggest as of now it 's not ukraine is still very corrupt ukraine does n't really have an economy that can support itself ukraine had traditional ties to russia and these ties included economic ties   to join the eu a country should be in a position to foremost support itself not only will joining mean having huge inflation but you 're substituting one creditor and buyer for another problem is you 're right beside russia so you should be extra prepared for hard times most i 've spoken to do n't necessarily agree on what 's right or wrong but economically sticking with russia and cleaning up the government would be the ideal problem is russia a less than clean influence this is a problem and where many people are stuck because just switching to eu will probably be harder on average people

if you want a ~12 rate of return on your investments too bad for returns which even begin to approach that you need to be looking at some of the riskiest stuff think emerging markets even funds like vanguard emerging markets etf mutual fund or fidelity advisor emerging markets income trust seem to have yields which only push 11 or so   but inflation is about nil so if you 're used to normal 2 inflation or so these yields are like 13 or so and there 's no tax on that last 2 yay remember that these investments are very risky they go up lots because they can go down lots too do n't put any money in there unless you can afford to have it go missing because sooner or later you 're likely to lose something half your money and it might not come back for a decade or ever investments like these should only be a small part of your overall portfolio so that said sites which make investing in these risky markets easy there are a good number but you should probably just go with their funds have low fees which wo n't erode your returns you can actually get lower expense ratios by using their brokerage account to trade the etf versions of their funds commission free though you 'll have to worry more about the actual number of shares you want to buy instead of just in and out dollar amounts you can also trade vanguard etfs and other etfs at almost any brokerage just like stocks and most brokerages will also offer you access to a variety of mutual funds as well though often for a hefty fee of $ which you should avoid or you can sign up for another fund providers account but remember that the fund fees add up quickly   and the better plan just stuff most of your money in something like vti vanguard total stock market index instead

the key idea he should focus on is that every debt includes interest the money he did n't borrow but now owes the interest goes straight to the lender pocket and the debtor has to get money somewhere for that interest that 's the key reason of why getting another loan only increases pressure on the debtor with the new loan he owes new interest in addition to what he already owed

the interest rate offered by a bond is called the nominal interest rate   the so called real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation if inflation is equal to or greater than the nominal rate at any given time the real interest rate is zero or negative we 're talking about a ten year bond it 's possible for the real interest rate to be negative for one or two years of the bond 's life and positive for eight or nine   on the other hand if we have a period of rising inflation as in the 1970s the inflation rate will exceed the original interest rate in most years meaning that the real interest rate on the ten year bond will be negative over its whole life people lost serious money on bonds and loans in the 1970s in such situations the borrowers make out that is they borrow money at low rates earn inflation plus a little more pay back inflated dollars and pocket the difference for them the money is free

i ca n't say specifically about charities to help greece if someone on here has specific knowledge please chime in the only shortcut i know to tell if a charity is legitimate is to consult one of the ratings type groups that monitor charities for example for explicitly christian charities there 's a group called the council for financial accountability to be a member in good standing a charity has to meet a bunch of criteria like having an independent board of directors i.e. you ca n't start a charity make yourself the president and your brother in law the vice president and you 're not answerable to anyone else their fund raising and administrative costs ca n't be more than a certain percentage of total income etc there are similar groups with similar standards for more general charities i 'm not naming any of those groups because there 's a potential catch how reputable is the group that rates other people 's reputations and i do n't want to recommend someone without knowing years ago i came across a news story about an organization that rated colleges and that had given one particular college their top rating but the news story said investigators found that that one college was the only college they ever gave a rating to and that their address was the same as the college 's address it turned out of course that the college was a scam the other method is to take some time to investigate the charity   for starters get a copy of their annual report or their newsletter if they 're total frauds often they do n't have an annual report or a newsletter of course a fraud could make up beautiful flyers describing all the wonderful work they do with pictures of people they helped and detailed case histories and it 's all complete fiction but that 's more work than most con men go to i 've gotten lots of for contributions from people who call on the phone or come to my door or send an email if the message does not have a logo a mailing address and phone number reasonably coherent english and a fair amount of text describing what they do i do n't give them anything they could be a new start up that has n't had time to prepare these things they could believe that pretty flyers are a waste of money and they want to put all their resources into helping the needy but more likely it 's a scam that somebody through together in his basement of course the best thing is if you personally know people who are officers in the organization well assuming you personally know them and you know that they are honest people if you know the president and you know he 's a sleazy con man you might want to stay away from that group see if you can find information about the charity in the news or on line if they 're being investigated for fraud by the justice department you might want to avoid them etc maybe you 've thought this through but you also might want to think about exactly who in greece you want to help and what your philosophy of charity is do you want to help people who lost their jobs because of the economic problems there and who are now unemployed do you want to donate to the government to help them balance the budget do you want to help support an or a homeless shelter or give money directly to needy people etc and one piece of unsolicited advice unless you have millions to give and i 'm assuming you do n't as you said your first gift would be $ 50 i 'd pick one or two charities and give regularly to them i think you can do more good by giving $ x per month to a single charity than to give to a different charity every month you make more difference

simple answer yes   a better question to ask might be should i invest all my savings to buy 4 shares of a single stock my answer to that would be probably not if this is your first venture into the world of owning publicly traded companies then you 're better off starting with some sort of mutual fund or etf this will start your portfolio with some amount of diversification so you do n't have all your eggs in one basket if you really want to get into the world of picking individual stocks a good rule of thumb to follow is to invest $ 1 in some sort of indexed fund for every $ 1 you invest in an individual stock this gives you some diversification while still enabling you to scratch that itch of owning a part of apple or whatever other company you think is going in the right direction

note that after 15 years the tax exemption is € per person which includes both the principal you and the accumulated interest   it 's possible that you will have a higher balance than this in your savings account at this point and would still owe tax on the interest accumulated above the exempted amount   after 20 years you get the full tax exemption the lesser of your portion of the mortgage debt and € per person in direct answer to your questions i 'm not aware of any exceptions to the 15 year rule for allowing the accumulated interest to be tax free when selling your house   if your accumulated interest is low enough you might consider just paying the tax on it as it would give you the most flexibility in choosing a new mortgage   this is why i asked about more details about your interest rate and how long the mortgage has been running it may however possible to couple the savings account to a new abn mortgage when you buy a new house   you should check your mortgage terms and conditions   for example section in abn 's terms and conditions from 2010 describes this   see here   it is probably best however to speak directly with either your mortgage broker or with a mortgage adviser with abn   if your mortgage broker still worked on commission when you closed your mortgage then they are obligated to assist you with this type of question in order to qualify for the tax exemption you must use the saved value to pay off debt on your primary residence   the savings account entirely from a mortgage will disqualify you from the tax advantages   you will owe tax on all accumulated interest

there are no dividends from s corp there are distributions big difference s corps fill form 1120s and schedule k-1 per shareholder in the schedule all the income of your s corp will be assigned to various categories that you will later copy to your personal tax return as your personal income it is not dividend income the reason people prefer to take distributions from their s corps instead of salary is because you do n't pay se taxes on the distributions that is also the reason why the irs forces you to pay yourself a reasonable salary but the tax rate on the income all of it is your regular income tax rate unless the s corp income is categorized in a preferred category the fact that its an s corp income does n't by itself allow any preferential treatment if you 're learning the stuff as you go you should probably get in touch with a tax professional to advise you all the s corp income must be distributed its not a matter of avoiding paying the tax its the matter of you must do it not a choice my answer was not intended or written to be used and it can not be used by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer 230 disclaimer

it 's incredibly foolish because it fails to use the investments as collateral to secure the loan so instead of paying 5 or less for a loan secured by liquid assets you 'll be paying 10 or more for an unsecured loan i do leveraged investments all the time and make a reasonable amount of money doing it at high risk i concede i always use the investment to secure the loan and as a result pay a very low interest rate since the lender can sell of my investments if i fail to repay the loan reducing their risk dramatically an unsecured loan would cost several times more

this chart summarizes the fed 's balance sheet things the fed has purchased us treasuries mortgage backed securities etc nicely   it shows the massive level of printing the fed has done in the past two years   the fed prints new money to buy these assets as has pointed out the fractional reserve banking process also expands the money supply   when the fed buys something from bank a then bank a can take the money and start lending it out   this process continues as the recipients of the money deposit the newly printed money in other fractional reserve banks fyi it took 95 years for the fed to print the first $ 900 billion   it took one year to print the next $ 900 billion

many of these products are similar in nature and often depend on the issuing bank    cashier 's check are checks signed and guaranteed by the bank   this means the funds are coming from the bank instead of your account which usually means they immediately take the money from your account   this is usually the most secure of the options and usually does n't have many restrictions   certified check are checks signed by the customer certified by the bank that you have enough funds and that your signature is genuine   usually but not always the bank will set aside the funds    bank draft similar to a certified check but the bank will set aside the funds until the bank draft is used   generally used in transactions involving larger sums money order it 's a payment order similar to a certified check however it needs to be prepaid   also money orders may have maximum face values allowed

if you read joel greenblatt 's the little book that beats the market he says owning two stocks eliminates 46 of the non market risk of owning just one stock     this risk is reduced by 72 with 4 stocks by 81 with 8 stocks by 93 with 16 stocks by 96 with 32 stocks and by 99 with 500 stocks   conclusion after purchasing 6 8 stocks benefits of adding stocks to decrease risk are small    overall market risk wo n't be eliminated merely by adding more stocks   and that 's just specific stocks so you 're very right that allocating a 1 share to a specific type of fund is not going to offset your other funds by much you are correct that you can emulate the lifecycle fund by simply buying all the underlying funds but there are two caveats generally these funds are supposed to be cheaper than buying the separate funds individually check over your math and make sure everything is in order call the fund manager and tell him about your findings and see what they have to say if you are going to emulate the lifecycle fund be sure to stay on top of rebalancing one advantage of buying the actual fund is that the portfolio distributions are managed for you so if you 're going to buy separate etfs make sure you 're rebalancing as for whether you need all those funds my answer is a definite no consider mark cuban 's blog post wall street 's new lie to main street asset allocation although there are some highly questionable points in the article one portion is clear   let me translate this all for you i want you to invest in cash and the rest in 10 different funds about which you know absolutely nothing i want you to make this investment knowing that even if there were 128 hours in a day and you had a year long vacation you could not possibly begin to understand all of these products in fact i do n’t understand them either but because i know it sounds good and everyone is making the same kind of recommendations we all can pretend we are smart and going to make a lot of money until we do n’t standard theory says that you want to invest in low cost funds like those provided by vanguard and you want to have enough variety to protect against risk although i ca n't give a specific allocation recommendation because i do n't know your personal circumstances you should ideally have some in us equities us fixed income international equities commodities of varying sizes to have adequate diversification as defined by theory you can either do your own research to establish a distribution or speak to an investment advisor to get help on what your target allocation should be

do not borrow to invest in real estate   the interest payments will eat up most of your profit the property management fees might eat up the rest and you will have significant risk with tenant issues property value etc   many people have made it work many also lose everything real estate can be a great investment but you ca n't even afford a house of your own yet let alone investment property   keep saving up until you have 20 down to buy a house of your own ideally that you can put on a 15 fixed mortgage and pay it off as quickly as you can   then you can start saving for your first rental property if that process is n't fast enough for you you have two options   increase your income or reduce your expenses   there 's no shortcut to wealth building without taking significant risks at most i would scale back the 401(k to the 5 match you get but you should scale that back up once you have enough for a down payment

   operations organized and by foreign governments have played a substantial role in the political and economic development of poorer countries around the world we look at cia backed against governments which had nationalized a considerable amount of foreign investment using an event study methodology we find that private information regarding coup authorizations and planning increased the stock prices of multinationals that stood to benefit from the regime change the presence of these abnormal returns suggests that there were leaks of classified information to asset traders consistent with theories of asset price determination under private information this information often took some time to be fully reflected in the stock price we find that coup authorizations on net contributed substantially more to stock price rises of highly exposed companies than the coup events themselves    gt;this suggests that most of the value of the coup to the affected companies had already been anticipated and incorporated into the asset price before the operation was undertaken

a stock market is just that a market place where buyers and sellers come together to buy and sell shares in companies listed on that stock market there is no global stock price the price relates to the last price a stock was traded at on a particular stock market however a company can be listed on more than one stock exchange for example some australian companies are listed both on the australian stock exchange asx and the nyse and they usually trade at different prices on the different exchanges also there is no formula to determine a stock price in your example where c wants to buy at 110 and b wants to sell at 120 there will be no sale until one or both of them decides to change their bid or offer to match the opposite or until new buyers and/or sellers come into the market closing the gap between the buy and sell prices and creating more liquidity it is all to do with supply and demand and peoples emotions

the danger to your savings depends on how much sovereign debt your bank is holding   if the government defaults then the bank if it is holding a lot of sovereign debt could be short funds and not able to meet its obligations i believe default is the best option for the euro long term but it will be painful in the short term   yes historically governments have shut down banks to prevent people from withdrawing their money in times of crisis   see argentina circa 2001 or us during great depression   the government prevented people from withdrawing their money and people could do nothing while their money rapidly lost value see the emergency banking act where title i section 4 authorizes the us make it illegal for a bank to do business during a national emergency per section 2 without the approval of the president   fdr declared a banking holiday four days before the act was approved by congress   this documentary on the crisis in argentina follows a woman as she tries to withdraw her savings from her bank but the government has prevented her from withdrawing her money if the printing press is chosen to avoid default then this will allow banks and governments to meet their obligations   this however comes at the cost of a seriously debased euro i.e. higher prices   the euro could then soon become a hot potato as everyone tries to get rid of them before the ecb prints more   the us dollar could meet the same fate what can you do to avert these risks   yes you could exchange into another currency   unfortunately the printing presses of most of the major central banks today are in   this may preserve your savings temporarily i would purchase some gold or silver coins and keep them in your possession   this you from the banking system and gold and silver have value anywhere you go   the coins are also portable in case things really start to get interesting   attempt to purchase the coins with cash so there is no record of the purchase   this may not be possible

i asked a followup question on the islam site the issue with islam seems to be that exchanging money for other money is roughly speaking usury there are different opinions but it seems that in general exchanging money for something else is fine but exchanging money for other money is forbidden the of either the things or the money is not relevant though again opinions may differ it 's allowed to buy a piece of software for download even though nothing physical is ever bought speculating on currency is therefore forbidden and that 's true whether or not a pile of banknotes gets moved around at any point but that 's my interpretation of what was said on the islam site i 'm sure they would answer more detailed questions

yes but also note each exchange have rules that states various conditions when the market maker can the bid ask e.g. for situations such as freely falling markets etc and when the market makers need to give a normal bid ask in normal markets the bid asks are usually within exchange dictated bounds   mm 's price spread can be larger than bid ask spread only when there are multiple market makers and different market makers are providing different bid asks as long as the mm under question gives bid and ask within exchange 's rules it can be fine these are usually rare situations one advice please carefully check the time stamps i have seen many occasions when tick data time stamps between different vendors are in databases whereas in real life it is n't   mm 's profits not just from spreads but also from short term mean reversion if a large order comes in suddenly the mm increases the prices in one direction takes the opposite side and once the order is done the prices comes down and the mm off loads his imbalance at lower prices etc

why then did ford and the auto industry in general suddenly decide to court such buyers   clearly when they felt they had a viable solution to the financing and could open up the market of buyers they were previously ignoring if more sales are desired surely the same can be accomplished with simply lowering prices millions of people have bad credit   apparently ford thinks adding millions of people to the pool of potential buyers is more effective to boosting sales than discounting product for the pool of existing potential buyers

what could the tax issues with the irs be i thought but not totally certain that the tax treatment of an iso option was based on difference between exercise price and fmv at the time of the sale   this is an accounting issue there were times not so long ago that companies actually did these things on purpose to boost the stock grant values for their employees especially senior employees they would give a grant but date it with an earlier date with a more favorable valuation this is called and it brought companies down and ceos into criminal courts in addition only reasonable compensation is allowed as a deduction for the company and incorrectly set strike price may be deemed unreasonable thus the deduction the company would take for your compensation can be denied leading to loss of tax benefit this was also a weapon used by the irs at the time against companies doing last but not least company that has intentions of going public can not allow itself such a blatant disregard of the accounting rules even if the mistake was not made on purpose as it sounds it is a mistake that has to be corrected what should i take into consideration to determine whether a 27 increase in shares is a fair exchange for an increase in 270 increase in strike price did you know the strike price when you signed the contract was it a consideration for you for most people the strike price is determined at the board approval since the valuations are not public and are not disclosed before you actually join which is already after you 've agreed to the terms so basically you agreed to get 100 sheets of toilet paper and instead getting sheets so you 're getting 27 sheets more than you initially agreed to why are you complaining in other words options are essentially random numbers which are quite useless by the time you get to exercise them they 'll be diluted through a bunch of additional financing rounds and their value will be determined for real only after the ipo or at least when your company 's stocks are trading otc with some reasonable volume until then it 's just a number with not much of a meaning the fmv does matter for early exercise and 83(b election if that is an option but even then i doubt you can actually negotiate anything

ignoring any ethical considerations of defaulting on a mortgage obligation if your credit score fell future costs of borrowing would be greater if you could borrow money at all the true financial cost of these penalties would depend on your own intentions and circumstances the value of a credit score can not be quantified in any absolute sense because of these circumstances which will vary from person to person suppose a decision would result in your score falling from 700 to 600 as a result a future car loan would cost something like 2 more in interest per year let 's also suppose you would not be able to find a bank to give you money to buy a new home   the difficulties caused by this situation would depend on the person some people have no intention of taking out another mortgage or buying another car and to them a lowered credit score might make no difference to others it would be desirable to avoid these penalties the value of credit score would be equal to how much you would be willing to pay in the present to avoid these future penalties   if you intend to borrow money in the near future and somehow know how much more interest you will pay as a result of your lower score then you could approximate the value of the credit drop by summing all of the additional interest costs discounted into the present something a little like this year 's additional cost in interest 1 + your personal opportunity cost of funds ^ years in the future this extra interest will be paid   see time value of money explanation can you explain time value of money and compound interest and provide examples of each it could also be the case that you miss out on valuable financial opportunities as a result which could be added to the present value of the credit score drop   for example if the drop made you totally unable to purchase an investment property that would net you $ 10,000 in cash flows which would yield cash flows immediately the value of that investment would have been $ 10,000 1 + your personal opportunity cost of funds since you would not be able to make that investment in this example as a result of the decreased score the present value of the investment would be an opportunity cost of the lower score there are other hard to quantify costs of low credit to consider as well ranging from housing to employment to bragging rights   hopefully this has helped

month to date for the month to date the price on feb 28th is $ and the price on march 16th is $ so the return is which can be written more simply as the position is 1000 shares valued at $ on feb 28th so the profit on the month to date is calendar year to date for the calendar year to date ytd the price on dec 31st is $ and the price on feb 28th is $ so the return to feb 28th is the return from feb 28th to march 16th is so the year to date return is or more directly so the 2011 ytd profit on 1000 shares valued at $ 4600 on dec 31st is year to date starting dec 10th for the year to date starting dec 10th the starting value is and the value on dec 31st is 1000 $ = $ 4600 so the return is $ 4600 $ 1 = = the year to date profit is therefore note ytd is often understood to mean calendar year to date   to cover all the bases state both ie calendar ytd 2011 and ytd starting dec 10th 2010 edit further to comment for the calendar year to date with 200 shares sold on jan 10th with the share price at $ the return from dec 31st to jan 10th is the return from jan 10th to feb 28th is the return from feb 28th to march 16th is the profit on 1000 shares from dec 31st to jan 10th is $ 4600 = the profit on 800 shares from jan 10th to feb 28th is zero the profit on 800 shares from feb 28th to march 16th is so the year to date profit is $ 4

gt the solution now that is difficult i would say that the solution now would be to raise revenues through corporate taxes and similarly increase government spending on investments aimed at stimulating the economy use this time to invest in the much needed infrastructure maintenance and upgrades that the usa needs these need to be fast tracked into action and i would therefore consider fixing infrastructure as more important than installing new infrastructure    that s fine and dandy but it would never ever pass congress   i m canadian myself but i know australia as a strong economy and at least you do nt count on usa for of your exports like us

buyouts are usually for more than the original value of a stock that 's because the price premium represents an incentive for holders to tender their shares to the would be buyer sometimes in these situations the stock price rises above the proposed buyout price in anticipation of a higher takeover bid from a second party that may or may not materialize to answer the other part of the question does a bidder have a chance of taking over a dying company for less than the market price that is a strategy sometimes referred to as a take under and it has not been a notably successful strategy that 's because it goes against human nature of the seller where there is life there is hope they would seldom accept a lower price for sure survival when the market is telling them that they are worth a higher price very few people realize that the market may disappear tomorrow think of all the homeowners who wo n't cut their price but insist on bids that meet recent comps and if the company is really dying the prospective buyer may be best served by waiting until it does and then pick up the individual pieces at auction

if you have enough earned income to cover this amount you should be all set if i understand you correctly you proposed two transactions the first a withdrawal from the beneficiary ira some of which is an rmd the rest is an extra withdrawal of funds   next you propose to make a deposit to a combination of your ira and your wife 's ira as long as there 's earned income to cover this deposit your plan is fine   to be clear you ca n't take a ira and deposit the rmd to an ira but money is fungible the dollars you deposit are n't traceable only need to be justified by enough earned income a ira is a great way to get the money to increase your own ira or 401(k deposits   further details the 2016 contribution limit is $ 5,500 per person so i did make the assumption you knew the $ 9000 deposit need to be split between the 2 iras with no more than $ 5500 going into either one

edited to incorporate the comments elsewhere of assuming apparently incorrectly that duration is time to maturity first note that the question does not mention the coupon rate the size of the regular payments that the bond holder will get each year   so let 's calculate that consider the cash flow described   you pay out 1015 at the start of year 1 to buy the bond   at the end of years 1 to 5 you receive a coupon payment of x.   also at the end of year 5 you receive the face value of the bond 1000   and you are told that the pay out equals the money received using a time value of money of 4.69 so if we use the date of maturity of the bond as our valuation date we have the equation maturity + future value of coupons = future value of bond purchase price 1000 + x 1 + = 1015 ^ 5 solving this for x we obtain   the coupon rate is   you will receive at the end of each of the five years    now we can take this fixed schedule of payments and apply the new yield rate to the same formula above   only now the unknown is the price paid for the bond y. 1000 + 1 + 1 = y ^ 5 solving this equation for y we obtain y =

it sounds like the postage amount was paid to you rather than returned   if it had been returned and the payment originated on the card they would have to return it to the card   if it was processed as a payment it looks like someone is giving you money   paypal ca n't credit it to the card as the sender could request a refund   if paypal put the money on the card against a previous payment then they would n't be able to refund    if they add money to your bank account then they can withdraw it if a refund is required    one reason that you might get a payment is if you were being reimbursed for spending money outside of paypal   if the amount is more than you originally paid they ca n't put it on your card   they can only refund to the card   they ca n't deposit to it    if you do n't want to give them your bank account information you can just wait until the next time you use paypal and use your balance to pay   then you can bill the remainder to your credit card    if you do n't normally use paypal and just want your money back you can process a chargeback through your credit card   note that this would probably annoy paypal as it costs them and potentially money   to do this you must have paid the postage with your credit card originally   if you spent money outside paypal and were reimbursed through paypal then there 's nothing to chargeback   in that circumstance you 'd have to accept one of their options   pay with balance or deposit to bank account

the primary advantage of hfts is their speed to act upon opportunities that exist for only fractions of a second the reason why they are able to do this is because they invest heavily in hardware custom software and custom algorithms   most of the fleeting advantage as they all manage to top each other 's hardware seemingly every other day is from the hardware investment   to see the extremes that hfts will go to invest in hardware one might view this it is highly likely that the trader with the market making algorithm could have been ignorant of the hide not slide order and missed out on many more opportunities while still being successful   who is very much against this order type was not so lucky if it was truly an investment bank then it was unlikely that they were actually front running which is very illegal and easily possible with much more low tech means since companies like citadel handle most orders now and they have not been successful in investment banking the reality of hft is slowly coming to light that while hft can provide extremely consistent returns with enormous sharpe ratios the capital investment is equally enormous and the amount of capital that can be employed is also as enormously limited   after all the richest people on the planet are not hft owners also when it comes to time periods longer than their results become very human

first of all dilip 's answer explains well how the business deductions generally work for most big expenses you depreciate it however in some cases you need to capitalize it which is another accounting method when you capitalize your expense it becomes part of the basis of the product you 're creating since you 're an engineer this might be relevant for you talk to your tax adviser how exactly you deduct depreciate capitalize things and what expense goes which way depends greatly on the laws and jurisdictions even in the us different states have different laws and the irs and state laws do n't have to conform unfortunately for example the limitations on sec 179 deduction in 2010 2011 were 20 times higher on federal level than in the state of california this could have lead to cases where you fully deducted your expense on your federal tax return but need to continue and depreciate it on your state return or vice versa good tax adviser is crucial to avoid or manage these cases

this is ridiculous of course some companies do n't pay taxes each year off the top of my head nol 's net operating losses can be carried forward 20 years and will definitely reduce tax liability for that matter a loss during any year prevents paying income tax though sales property ad and other taxes may apply other companies may get capital credits green credits or other subsidies that might prevent a tax liability none of these indicate that a corporation is getting away with anything the irs is a lot better at its job than most people think   the point is you ca n't look at any individual year and make an accurate assessment of a company 's or even an individual 's tax burden it 's completely dishonest reporting   source i 'm a state tax auditor and my job is to make sure corporations pay what they are supposed to   edit additionally 2010 was the heart of the recession for a lot of companies there were a lot of corporations that took losses that year so to say that ge took in billion and paid no taxes is misleading you have to say why they paid no taxes or you 're just blowing hot air taxes are assessed on income not there is a big difference

do n't use a credit repair agency they are scams one of the myriad of ways in which they work is by setting you up with a bogus loan which they will report you as paying on time they 'll pretend to be a used car dealer or some other credit based merchant for a time this will actually work this is called false reporting the problem is the data clearinghouses are not stupid and eventually realize some hole in the wall car dealer with no cars on the lot yes they do physical inspections as part of the process just sometimes they 're a little slow about it is reporting trade lines worth millions of dollars per year it 's a major problem in the industry but eventually that business loses its fraudulent reporting ability those trade lines get revoked and your account gets flagged for a fraud investigation the repair agency has your money and you still do n't have good credit bad news if this all goes down while you 're trying to close on a house you 're better off trying to settle your debts usually for 50 or declaring bankruptcy altogether the latter is n't so bad if you 're in a stable home because you wo n't be able to get an apartment for a while credit cards or a good deal on auto financing   ed i just saw what one agency was charging and can tell you declaring bankruptcy costs only a few hundred dollars more than the repair agency and is 100 guaranteed to get you predictable results as long as you name all your debts up front and are n't getting by student loans and considering you ca n't stomach well guess what now you 'll have a lawyer to deal with them for you anything you accomplish through an agency will eventually be reversed because it 's fraudulent but through bankruptcy your credit will start improving within two years the tradeoff being that you wo n't be able to get a mortgage at all or apartment easily during that so find a place to down for a few years before you declare

well the thing to understand about hft is that the volume levels heavily affect not just the earnings but also the ecosystem hft is almost always liquidity constrained so the volume and volatility is going to affect the overall profitability of the strategy since less of these things means fewer and smaller trading opportunities   since 2008 volume and volatility have been heavily negatively correlated with risk on risk off during risk off periods investors seem to panic and trading hits a pace this describes late 2008 and more recently august 2011 even in 2012 the highest volume volatility period was in may when the euro deals were in danger risk on environments tend to be marked be calm orderly buying   second the dark pool issue is bringing liquidity out of the lit markets where hft normally makes its money the primary reason for this trend is that dark pools are allowed to offer sub penny quotes whereas lit exchanges are not because of this arbitrary regulatory constraint most of the time dark pools are going to offer better prices especially on thick book securities   but beyond that the level of volume effects some hft players more heavily then others imagine all the hft firms as a pride of lions when volume is high and liquidity is flowing it 's like the pride has brought in a giant water buffalo the biggest cats eat first but there 's still food left for the after they 're finished feeding   but if the pride only brings in say a baby the alpha cats will eat everything and the will go hungry that basically describes what 's happening now a firm like or will make less money in a low volume environment but still do fine marginal firms like will lose the ability to make any money   since the marginal firms need the press and the dominant firms tend to be more secretive than the nsa you 'll tend to read more about the former than the latter

i am not sure how anyone is answering this unless they know what the loan was for   for instance if it is for a house you can put a lien on the house   if it is for the car in most states you can take over ownership of it    point being is that you need to go after the asset    if there is no asset you need to go after you friend   again we need more specifics to determine the best course of action which could range from you suing and wages from your friend to going to small claims court   part of this process is also getting a hold of the lending institution   by letting them know what is going on they may be able to help you they are good at tracking people down for free also the lender may be able to give you options   for example if it is for a car a bank may help you clear this out if you get the car back plus penalty   if a car is not in the red on the loan and it is in good condition the bank turns a profit on the default   if they can recover it for free they will be willing to work with you   i worked in repo when younger and on more than a few occasions we had the cosigner helping   it went down like this co signer gets pissed like you and calls bank bank works out a plan and tells cosigner to default cosigner defaults banks gives cosigner rights to repo vehicle cosigner helps or actually vehicle bank gets car back bank car bank asks cosigner for x amount sometimes nothing but not usually cosigner pays x bank does not hit credit bank releases loan and sells car   i am writing this like it is easy but it really requires that asset is still in good condition that cosigner can get to the asset and that the friend still is around and trusts cosigner   i have seen more than a few promise to deliver and come up short and couple conspiring with the friend    i basically think most of the advice you have gotten so far is crap and you have n't provided enough info to give perfect advice   seeking a lawyer is a joke   going after a fleeing party could eat up 40 50 billable hours   it is n't like you are suing a business or something   the lawyer could cost as much as repaying the loan and most lawyers will act like it is a snap of their fingers until they have you dry just really advice for the most part i would suggest talking to the bank and defaulting but again need 100 of the details    the other part is cosigning the loan   why the hell would you cosign a loan for a friend   most parents wo n't cosign a loan for their own kids   and if you are cosigning a loan you write up a simple contract and make the non payment penalties extremely costly for your friend   i have seen simple contracts that include 30 interests rates that were upheld by courts

it is important to distinguish between cause and effect as well as the supply saving versus demand borrowing side of money to understand the relationship between interest rates bond yields and inflation what is mean by interest rates is usually based on the officially published rates determined by the central bank and is referenced to the overnight lending rate for meeting reserve requirements   in practice what the means is for example in the united states the federal reserve will have periodic meetings to determine whether to leave this rate alone or to raise or lower the rate   the new rate is generally determined by their assessment of current and forecast national and global economic conditions and factors in the votes of the various regional federal reserve presidents   if the fed economic weakness they will tend to lower and keep rates lower while when the economy seems to be overheated the tendency will be to raise rates bond yields are also based on the expectation of future economic conditions but as determined by market participants   at times the market will actually lead the fed in bidding bond prices up or down while at other times it will react after the fed does   however ignoring the varying time lag the two generally will track each other because they are really the same thing   the only difference is the participants which are collectively determining what the rates yields are the inverse relationship between interest rates and inflation is the main reason for fluctuating rates in the first place   the fed will tend to raise rates to try to slow inflation and lower rates when it feels inflation is too low and economic growth should be stimulated   likewise when the economy is doing poorly there is both little inflationary pressure driving interest rates down both in terms of what savers can accept to keep ahead of inflation and at and depressed levels of borrowing reduced demand for money driving down rates to try to balance supply and demand and the opposite is true when the economy is booming bond yields are thus positively correlated to inflation because during periods of high inflation savers wo n't want to invest in bonds that do n't provide them with an acceptable inflation adjusted yield   but high interest rates tend to have the effect or in inflation because it gets more costly for borrowers and thus puts a on new economic activity so to summarize

the optimal down payment is 0 if your interest rate is also 0 as the interest rate increases so does the likelihood of the better option being to pay for the car outright note that this is probably a binary choice in other words depending on the rate you will pay you should either put 0 down or 100 down the interesting question is what formula should you use to determine which way to go obviously if you can invest at a higher return than the rate you pay on the car you would still want to put 0 down the same goes for inflation and you can add these two numbers together for example if you estimate 2 inflation plus 1 guaranteed investment then as long as the rate on your car is less than 3 you would want to minimize the amount you put down the key here is you must actually invest it other possible reasons to minimize the down payment would be if you have other loans with higher then obviously use that money to pay down those loans before the car loan all that being said some dealers will give you cash back if you pay for the car outright if you have this option do the math and see where it lands most likely taking the cash back is going to be more attractive so you do n't even have to hedge inflation at all tip make sure to negotiate the price of the car before you tell them how you are going to pay for it and during this process you can hint that you 'll pay cash for it

there is no need to get an auto loan just to try and affect your credit score it is possible to have a score over 800 without any sort of auto loan if you can afford to pay for the vehicle up front that is the better option even with special financing incentives it is better to pay up front if you can yes it is possible to use the funds to make more if you finance with a silly low interest rate however it 's also possible to lose a job or have some other financial disaster happen and need that money for something else making it more difficult to make the payment   it may be just me but i find the peace of mind not having the payment to be worth a lot

vesting typically stops after you quit    so if your plan vests 20 per year for 5 years and you received a one time stock grant as part of this plan i.e. ignoring the fact that these often involve new grants each year that vest separately and you were hired in 2014 and leave at the end of 2016 then you vested 20 in 2015 and 20 in 2016 so would have 40 of the stock vested when you quit and would never have more than that

treasury stock is not really represented in the balance sheet as a treasury stock line item in the assets   some companies will break out treasury shares as a line item in the shareholders equity heading of the balance sheet but apple it in the shares issued and outstanding counts under the shareholders equity heading   as of the most recent q2 2017 quarterly report there are shares issued against shares outstanding   this indicates that apple is retaining about shares in treasury on the q1 10-q you can see that apple had shares issued which indicates roughly 49 mm shares were repurchased by the end of q2   you can roughly verify this by looking at page 18 of the q2 filing in the summary of the share repurchase program   repurchased as part of an accelerated share repurchase arrangement between quarters but from february 2017 through may 2017 there have been 17.5 mm shares repurchased   31 mm shares were also repurchased on the open market in q2     the shares issued total is on a downward trend as part of apple 's share repurchase initiative that has been underway for the last couple of years

the simplest answer would be because they can why charge less for something if people will pay more one example are apple products while there the price number is not exactly the same in eur and usd they are so close that effectively the eur product is more expensive many things go into a price there might be reasons for products in the eu being more expensive to produce or distribute or people in the eu might be in general more willing to pay more for a certain product in that case a company would forgo profits when they offered it cheaper also prices are relative is the usd price the correct one and the exchange rate should dictate what the eur price is or vice versa

i think that all else being equal if more people have solar panels on our roof we keep our military in fewer countries instead of planning on ramping up the number see nigeria furthermore the initial question was n't whether installing solar panels is going to stop the action the conversation started by being about whether solar is actually cheaper when you factor in the amount used to subsidize both sources of energy not whether switching to solar would stop subsidies to oil what you did is called moving the goalposts   the word 2016 does n't show up in the article or in the study it cites that was a typo i understand it was about 2013 i was trying to saying that it was about the same year as yours that was my bad i read the whole thing originally and i even read the study i accept responsibility for the typo though   anyways neither set of data is manipulated my study just includes more things like foreign tax credits cleanup subsidies for both coal and oil tar sands exemption from cleanup funds power africa a five year 7 billion dollar program that was only announced in 2013 that overseas stuff that goes on is a huge part of the equation    and okay so they are n't equivalent then your point is moot yes both sides have off the book subsidies but one side 's off the book subsidies are so bigger that it 's laughable to even put them in the same category not to mention the costs of war in the middle east stretch beyond money think lives and recycling programs actually come with benefits think smaller

diversifying but is n't that what mutual funds already do they diversify and reduce stock specific risk by moving from individual stocks to many stocks but you can diversify even further by selecting different fund types e.g. large cal small cap income bond funds international etc   your target date fund probably includes a few different types already and will automatically reallocate to less risky investments as you get close to the target date i would look at the fees of different types of funds and compare them to the historical returns of those funds   you can also use things like morningstar and other ratings as guides but they are generally very large buckets and may not be much help distinguishing between individual funds so to answer the question yes you can diversify further and probably get better returns and lower fees that a target date fund   the question is is it worth your time and effort to do so   you 're obviously comfortable investing for the long term so you might get some benefit by spending a little time looking for different funds to increase your diversification note that etfs do n't really diversify any differently than mutual funds they are just a different mechanism to invest in funds and allow different trading strategies trading during the day derivatives selling short etc

it should be pretty obvious that without knowing what sort of assets the company owns and what sort of net earnings are being generated it 's impossible to say what a $ 20k equity investment should get you in terms of ownership percentage    with that said you want to look at a few to several years of books look for trends   some things to understand that might be subtle red flags it 's extremely common for early stage investors to essentially make loans rather than strictly buying shares   in the worst case scenario creditors get to participate in liquidation proceedings before shareholders do   you may be better off investing in this business via a loan that 's convertible to equity at your discretion    single owner service companies are difficult because all of the net earnings go to the proprietor and that person maintains all of the relationships   so taking something like 5 years of net earnings as the value of the company does n't make much sense because you or someone else could n't just step in and replace the owner   granted you are n't contemplating taking over the business but it negates using an x years of net earnings valuation method   when you read about valuation there is a sort of overriding assumption that no single person could topple the operation which could n't be farther from the truth in single employee service companies   additionally understand that your investment in a single owner company hinges completely on one person 's ability and willingness to work it 's really vital to understand the purpose of the funds   someone will be hired   $ 20,000 could n't be even six months of wages put things in to perspective with a pad pen and calculator   do n't invest in the pipe dream of a friend of yours and definitely do n't hand this person the downpayment for their new house   the first rule of investing is do n't lose money this is n't emotional this is a dollars and cents pragmatic process why does the business need this money   how will you be paid back    personally i think it would be more to put $ 20k in a blender and watch it blend this is probably a horrible investment   the risk should just be left to credit card companies

let me make sure i understand the point of what adam smith is going on about in discussion of relative poverty he relates the idea that an individual can be considered in poverty if they do not meet the customary amount of goods considered by their society to be the minimum to be polite in public you have thus transferred his meaning of what poor means to be what is considered   basic living you have then taken this concept and tied the cost of basic living which you still have n't actually narrowed down towards the tax rate on income for a citizen of a community this is all in the context that you 're concerned with the community level of price for basic living and whether its too high however you also have n't said what too high is nor why you 're concerned with the literal price which is why i 've said you can only control the price of a good through central authority   i never made the assertion you wanted to invoke a centrally planned economy i simply stated that the only way to control prices across a community is through central authority you 've stated that we collect taxes on local state and federal levels this is true however it does not mean that they control the price they simply modify the price set by the market and only serve to increase the price from the base set by market participants    when i want to buy beer i do n't just pay for the cost of the beer i pay the cost of the beer + the city tax + county tax + state tax + state sales tax on the beer which raises the price also these taxes are not income taxes which is what was being discussed    i still do n't know what your point is because you can not seem to define phrases you 've used that i have stated i do not know if you can not define what you 're talking about how it relates to the actual discussion and why its relevant then please stop as its simply a

i 'm going to guess that you found this because of a stock screener   this company went through a reverse split on june 30 so every 20 shares outstanding became a single share   where before you had 20 shares worth $ 100 you now have 1 share worth $ 100 the value of the company does n't change because of a split   this company was never trading for $ 30 + per share   reverse splits are typical of a company trading on an exchange that has a minimum share price requirement   while reverse splits do n't change the value of the company just the number of shares outstanding and the price per share no healthy company performs a reverse split   reverse splits are generally a massive signal to jump ship the company seems to be trading for $ 1 right now why the value fell from a pre split $ 1.65 $ to $ 1 is anyone 's guess how the company ever got to $ 1.65 is also anyone 's guess but looking at the most recent 10-q there are numerous causes for concern   note 2 capital stock on march 6 2017 the company issued as compensation for services provided a total of common shares with a fair value of $ to a third party the fair value of the shares was based on the price quoted on the otc pink sheets on the grant date this indicates a share price of $ $ as of just to reinforce that the google price chart does n't show the true past but a past adjusted for the split results of operations the three months ended march 31 2017 compared to the three months ended march 31 2016 for the three months ended march 31 2017 compared to the three months ended march 31 2016 total revenues were $ 0 and $ 0 respectively and net losses from operations were $ and $ respectively the net losses were attributable to costs attributable to operating as a public company in particular common stock with a valuation of $ that was issued to an investor relations firm in the first quarter of 2017 going concern as of march 31 2017 there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as we have not generated sufficient cash flow to fund our proposed business we have suffered recurring losses from operations since our inception in addition we have yet to generate an internal cash flow from our business operations or successfully raised the financing required to develop our proposed business as a result of these and other factors our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern     liquidity and capital resources we had no cash as of the date of march 31 2017 additionally since there is no balance sheet in the last 10-q another bad sign the last annual report 10-k has this balance sheet so the company so why did the stock value plummet it 's guess but there is no shortage of ways to justify it    in fact it 's reasonable to ask how is this company still worth $ 3 mm $ 1 3 mm shares outstanding

if you can afford to max out an hsa and cover out of pocket expenses without withdrawing from it it makes sense to do so   it might sound initially risky to tie too much money to healthcare expenses perhaps you 'll enjoy exceptional health and not need those funds however the annual contribution limit $ for an individual is low enough that it 's unlikely you 'd your hsa but even if you did n't need it all for healthcare after 65 you can withdraw hsa funds without the 20 withdrawal penalty that you 're hit with if under 65 so best case it 's tax free worst case it 's like an ira   from a tax perspective your contributions are a tax deduction like a traditional ira there 's no tax on the gains and you withdraw it tax free as well so long as you have healthcare expenses the tricky bit is you can get reimbursed for your expenses at any time if you pay out of pocket now in 20 years you can get a reimbursement from your hsa from hsa bank 's faq can i use my tax free hsa savings to pay for or reimburse myself for    irs qualified medical expenses from a previous year     yes as long as    the irs qualified medical expenses were incurred after your hsa was    established you can pay them or reimburse yourself with hsa funds at    any time just be sure to keep sufficient records to show that these    expenses were not previously paid for by another source or taken as an    itemized deduction in any prior tax year

gt sweden is on the verge of a housing bubble    so now we are not taking about economy but real estate    i am think you might be getting tax policy confused with real estate stability after all your caribbean bahamas price history is not exactly real estate stable right now   look i get the fact you do n't like taxes if i were to guess you are living at the edge of your budget and really feel those income taxes you are angry and think this liberal agenda is what is holding you back    the problem is that the opposite holds true it is no coincidence that many liberal countries do well economically when people 's basic needs are taken care of they have much more freedom to create and innovate    and they opposite is true too kansas just a huge tax experiment and had one of the biggest business friendly tax cuts in recent history instead of spring growth it actually hurt the economy they were n't from a hundred million surplus in their budget to an almost $ 2b defecit overnight the economy did n't explode either it lagged    meanwhile it 's close but more liberal neighbor missouri better even though they did n't change their tax policy what is the difference people tend to do better when they know their basic needs are going to be covered   i would recommend you take some time to actually go visit these countries that you look down on for their stringent tax policy go talk to their people in their country i think you are forming opinions based on our experiences which do n't exactly reflect all experiences

basic arbitrage is the purchasing and selling of things that are convertible    the classic example is the international trading of equities if someone in london wants to purchase a hundred shares of shell for 40 gbp ea and someone in new york wants to sell you a hundred shares of shell for 61 usd ea you can buy the shares from the guy in new york sell them to the guy in london and convert your gbp back in to usd for a profit of $ minus fees   now if after you buy the shares in new york the price in london goes down you 'll be left holding 100 shares of shell that you do n't want so instead you should borrow 100 shares in london and sell them at the exact same time that you buy the shares in new york thus keeping your net position at 0 in fact you should also borrow and convert them to usd at the same time so that exchange rate changes do n't get you

banks are currently a lot less open to creative financing than they were a few years ago but you may still be able to take advantage of the tactic of splitting the loan into two parts a smaller second mortgage sometimes called a purchase money second at a slightly higher interest rate for around 15 20 of the value and the remaining in a conventional mortgage   since this tactic has been around for a long time it 's not quite in the category of the they were pulling a few years back so has a lot more potential to still be an option   i did this in for my first house in 93 and again in 99 when i moved to a larger home after getting married   it allowed me to get into both houses with less than 20 down and not pay pmi this way neither loan is above 80 so you do n't have to pay pmi   the interest on the second loan will be higher but usually only a few percent and is thus usually a fraction of what you were paying for the pmi and it 's deductible from your taxes if you 've been making your payments on time and have a good credit rating then you might be able to find someone who would offer you such a deal   you might even be able to get a rate for your primary that is down in the low 4 's depending on where rates are today and what your credit rating is like    if you can get the main loan low enough even if the other is like say 7 your blended rate may still be right around 5 if you can find a deal like this it 's also great material to use to negotiate with your current lender either help me get the pmi off this loan or i 'm going to refinance   then you can compare what they will offer you with what you can get in a refinance and decide what makes the most sense for you   on word of warning when refinancing do not get sucked into an adjustable rate mortgage   if you are finding life tight right now with house payments and all the an arm could be highly since they often offer a very low initial rate however then invariably adjust upwards and you could suddenly find yourself with a monster payment far larger than what you have now   with low rates where they are getting a conventional fixed rate loan or loans in the case of the tactic being discussed here is the way to go

i think for this a picture is worth a thousand words   this is a depth chart that i pulled from google images specifically because it does n't name any security   on the left you have all of the bids to buy this security on the right you have the asks to sell the security   in the middle you have the bid ask spread this is the space between the highest bid and the lowest ask   as you can see you are free to place you order to the market to buy for and someone else is free to place their order to the market to sell for   when the bid and the ask match there 's a transaction for the maximum number of available shares   alternatively someone can place a market order to buy or sell and they 'll just take the current market price retail investors do n't really get access to this kind of chart from their brokers because for the most part the information is n't terribly relevant at the retail level

can you elaborate more on what you are referring too no where near an economic expert but by demand side subsidization are you referring to the fed gov giving people money for their health care costs excluding the erroneous spending such as a patient only willing to take a brand name pharmaceutical drug instead of a generic that health care will be needed regardless correct so if taxes fit the bill why would costs for the care received go up is it just because the provider knows they 'll get the $ $ almost no matter what if it 's gov $ $ or something else besides to put it bluntly greed that would directly increase those costs   serious question btw

part 1 quite a few or rather most countries allow usd account so there is no conversion    just to in india its allowed to have a usd account the funds can be transfered as usd and withdrawn as usd the interest is in usd there no conversion at any point in time typically the rates for cd on usd account was central bank regulated rate of 5 recently this was deregulated and some banks offer around 7 interest    why is the rate high on usd in india there is a trade deficit which means india gets less usd and has to pay more usd to buy stuff oil and other essential items the balance is typically borrowed say from imf or other countries etc allowing banks to offer high interest rate is one way to attract more usd into the country in short term because in time they may take back the usd out of india so why is n't everyone jumping and making usd in india the non residents who eventually plan to come back have invested in usd in india there is a risk of regulation changes ie if the central bank country comes up pressure for forex reserves they may make it to take back the usd ie they may impose charges taxes or force conversion on such accounts the kyc norms make it difficult for indian bank to attract us citizens except non resident indians certain countries would have explicit regulations to prevent other nationals from investing in such products as they may lead to volatility ie all of them suddenly pull out the funds there would be no insurance to foreign nationals    part 2 the fdic insurance is not the reason for lower rates most countires have similar insurance for bank deposits for account    the reason for lower rate is all the china etc park the excess funds in us treasuries because 1 it is safe 2 it is required for any international purchase 3 it is very liquid    now if the us fed started giving higher interest rates to bonds say 5 it essentially paying more to other countries so its keeping the interest rates low even at 1 there are enough people institutions who would keep the money with us treasury    so the us treasury has to make some revenue from the funds kept at it it lends at lower interest rates to bank who in turn lend it to borrowers both corporate and retail    now if they can borrow cheaply from fed why would they pay more to individual retail on cd they will pay less because the lending rates are low as well    part 3 check out the regulations

say the rate is 6 and the payment is $ 500/mo if the bank credits on the day received the .5 per month is $ 2.50 for the whole month in other words pulling in the payment by the full 30 days will save you about $ 2.50 the whole loan may be costing $ but you can only impact the amount one payment at a time   to be clear you need to find out exactly how they credit you some loans do not accept partial payments separate from the normal payment if a $ 500 payment is due that 's the time to prepay principal but they might not accept say $ 200 each week   as a side note mortgages typically do n't credit the way you 'd hope i have a standard 30 year mortgage and whether i send the payment a full 15 days early or 14 days late the next month shows a balance that i can pull from an amortization table assuming all payments are on the 1st of the month if i were you i 'd make a full payment 2 weeks early then check your balance and see what the impact was just to be sure

a company start with say $ 100 lets say the max it can borrow from bank is $ 100 $ 10 a year as interest after a years say on the $ 200 the company made a profit of $ 110 so it now has total $ 310 option 1 company pays back the bank $ 100 + $ 10 it further gave away the $ 100 back to shareholders as dividends the balance with company $ 100 it can again start the second year borrow from bank $ 100 10 interest and restart    option 2 company pays back the bank $ 100 + $ 10 it now has $ 200 it can now borrow $ 200 from bank $ 20 after a year it makes a profit of $ 250 economics of scale result $ 30 more quite a few companies in growth phase use option 2 as they can grow faster achieve economies of scale keep competition at bay etc now if i had a share of this company say 1 $ 1 by end of first year its value would be $ 2 at the end of year 2 it would be $ 3.3 now there is someone else who wants to buy this share at end of year 1 i would say this share gives me 100 returns every year so i will not sell at $ 2 give me $ 3 at the end of first year the buyer would think well if i buy this at $ 3 first year i would notionally get $ .3 and from then on $ 1 every year not bad this is still better than other stocks and better than bank cd etc so as long as the company is doing well and expected to do well in future its price keeps on increasing as there is someone who want to buy why would someone want to sell and not hold one 1 needs cash for buying house or other purposes close to retirement etc 2 is balancing the portfolio to make is less risk based 3 quite a few similar reasons    why would someone feel its right to buy 1 has cash and is young is open to small risk 2 believes the value will still go up further 3 quite a few similar reasons

there are many technical answers above but the short story to me is that very few active fund managers consistently beat the market look at the results of actively managed funds depending on whose analysis you read you will find out that somewhere between 80 90 of fund managers in a given year do not beat passive index funds so go figure how you will do compared to a mutual fund manager who has way more experience than you likely have so that in itself is moderately interesting but if you look at same manager performance over several consecutive years it is rare to find anyone that goes beats the market for more than a few years in a row there are exceptions but go pick one of these guys good luck getting in and out of the market is a loser this is because there is no way to see market spikes and down turns there are many behavioral studies that have been done that show people do the wrong thing they sell after losses have occurred and they buy after the market has gone up missing an up spike and not being in before the spike is as devastating as missing a down turn and not getting out in time there is another down side if you are trading in a personal account rather than a tax deferred account going in and out of stocks has tax complications in short a broad based equity index will over time beat about anything out there and it will do it in a tax efficient manner   exchange traded funds etfs are a wonderful way to obtain diversification immediately at very low cost

i 'd agree that this can seem a little unfair but it 's an unavoidable consequence of the necessary practicality of paying out dividends periodically rather than continuously and differential taxation of income and capital gains to see more clearly what 's going on here consider buying stock in a company with extremely simple economics it generates a certain constant earnings stream equivalent to $ 10 per share per annum and all of that profit as periodic dividends let 's say once annually assume there 's no intrinsic growth and that the firm 's value which we 'll say is $ 90 per share is completely neutral to any other market factors under these economics this stock price will show a evolution accruing from $ 90 to $ 100 over the course of a year and resetting back down to $ 90 after each dividend payment now if i am invested in this stock for some period of time the fair outcome would be that i receive an appropriately time weighted share of the $ 10 annual earnings per share less my tax if i am invested for an exact calendar year this works as i 'd expect the stock price on any given day in the year will be the same as it was exactly one year earlier so i 'll realise zero capital gain but i 'll have collected a $ 10 taxed dividend along the way on the other hand what if i am invested for exactly half a year spanning a dividend payment i receive a dividend payment of $ 10 less tax but i make a capital loss of overall pre tax i 'm up $ 5 per share as expected however the respective tax treatment of the dividend payment which is classed as income and the capital gains is likely to be different in particular to benefit from the negative taxation of the capital loss i need to have some positive capital gain elsewhere to offset it if i ca n't do that i 'm much worse off compared to half the full year return further even if i can offset against a gain elsewhere the effective taxation rates are likely to be different but note that this could work for or against me if my capital gains rate is greater than my income tax rate i 'd actually benefit and if i 'm invested for half a year but not spanning a dividend i make $ 5 of pure capital gains and realise a different effective taxation rate again in an ideal world i 'd agree that the effective taxation rate would n't depend on the exact timing of my transactions like this but in reality it 's unavoidable in the interests of practicality and so long as the rules are clear i would n't say it 's unfair per se it just adds a bit of complexity

many companies actually just issue new shares for employee compensation instead of buying back existing ones so actually the share price should go down because the same value is now diluted over more shares in addition this would not necessarily affect companies with many employees than those with fewer employees because companies with more employees tend to be bigger and thus have more shares among which the change in demand would be distributed also i think many companies do not issue shares to employees every pay day but just e.g. once every quarter

my wife and i set up a shared bank account we knew the monthly costs of the mortgage and estimated the cost of utilities each month we transferred enough to cover these plus about 20 so we could make an extra mortgage payment each year and build up an emergency fund and did so using automatic transactions other shared expenses such as groceries we handled on an ad hoc basis settling up every month or three we initially just split everything 50 50 because we both earned roughly the same income when that changed we ended up going with a 60 40 split we maintained our separate bank accounts though this may have changed in the future a system like this may work for you or may at least provide a starting point for a discussion and i do strongly advise having a frank and open discussion on these points dealing with money can be tricky in the bounds of a marriage

yes your basic math is correct if your tax bracket never changes then either type of retirement account will end up in the same place assuming that there are no income restrictions that will limit your ability to contribute to the type of account you want now your job is to guess what your tax bracket will be each and every year for the next 3 or 4 decades events that will influence your bracket getting married having children buying a house selling a house paying for college the cost of medical care moving to a state with a different state tax structure of course that assumes that you do n't get a big bonus one year or that congress changes the tax brackets that is why many people have both types of retirement accounts roth and non roth

if you are going to be a long term investor you are only going to buy and hold you will not sell thus future price is not relevant only dividend payout is relevant divide the dividend by the price you paid to get the yeald   edit   once again the will not allow me to add a comment so i have to edit a previous post   what you call active investor is not really investing it is speculating when you try to buy low sell high you have at best a 50 50 chance of picking the low you then pay a commission on that buy after you buy then you have a 50 50 chance at best of picking the high you also have to pay the commission on the sell 50 times 50 is you have at best a 25 chance of buying low and selling high you are churning your account which makes money for the broker whether you make money or not if instead you buy and hold a dividend paying security then the going price is irrelevant you paid for the security once and do not have to pay for it again meanwhile the dividends roll in forever buy low sell high is a fools game warren buffet does not do it he buys and holds

a smaller spread indicates a flat yield curve which means banks and investors are uncertain about future economic conditions like the current environment    when the spread widens and the curve becomes upward sloping considered a normal yield curve investors expect future growth and minimal inflation longer term rates increase as investors demand a higher yield in return for lending their money for a longer period of time increase demand for credit industries expanding also drive up longer term rates    a negative spread indicates an inverted yield curve and investors believe the economy is overheating and interest rates will fall investors pull money out of the stock market and into long term bonds raising the price lowering the yield while companies stop borrowing reducing the demand for credit and lower the cost or interest rate on a loan    keep in mind central banks determine short term rates so inverted curves are rare in the sense the market perceives uncertainty and rushes to safety bonds before the central bank reacts and lowers short term rates

there are basically two ways to get value out of an appreciating asset such as a home a sell it and take the profit in the case of a home you presumably still have to live somewhere so unless you buy a cheaper home to replace it this does n't get you anywhere if you can get another house that is just as nice and in just as nice a location whatever you consider nice to be than this sounds like a winning option if it means moving to a less desirable home then you are getting the cash but losing the nice home you 'll have to decide if it 's worth it b use it as collateral for a loan in this case that means a second mortgage home equity loan or a home equity line of credit but this can be dangerous house prices are very volatile these days if the value of the house falls you could be stuck with debts greater than your assets in my humble opinion you should be very careful about doing this borrowing against your house to send the kids to college or pay for your spouse 's life saving operation may be reasonable borrowing against your house to go on a fancy vacation is almost surely a bad idea the vacation will be over within a couple of weeks but you could be paying off the debt for decades

whether you can establish an hsa has nothing to do with your employment status or your retirement plan it has to do with the type of medical insurance you have   the insurance company should be able to tell you if your plan is hsa compatible to be hsa compatible a plan must have a high deductible in 2014 $ 1250 for an individual plan or $ 2500 for a family plan it must not cover any expenses before the deductible that is you can not have any first dollar coverage for doctor 's visits prescription drug coverage etc there are some exceptions for services considered preventive care there are also limits on the out of pocket max i think that 's it but the insurance company should know if their plans qualify or not if you have a plan that is hsa compatible but also have another plan that is not hsa compatible then you do n't qualify and all that said if you are covered under your husband 's medical insurance and your husband already has an hsa why do you want to open a second one there 's no gain there is a family limit on contributions to an hsa $ in 2014 you do n't get double the limit by each opening your own hsa if you have two hsa 's the combined total of your contributions to both accounts must be within the limit if you have some administrative reason for wanting to keep separate accounts yes you can open your own and in that case you and your husband are each allowed to contribute half the limit or you can agree to some other division   i suppose you might want to have an account in your own name so that you control it especially if you and your husband have different ideas about managing finances though how to resolve such problems would be an entirely different question personally i do n't think the solution is to get into power struggles over who controls what but whatever maybe there 's some advantage to having assets in your own name if you and your husband were to divorce probably not though i think a divorce court pretty much ignores whose name assets are in when dividing up property   see irs publication 969 for lots and lots of details

you have plenty of good answers but i want to add something that might help you grow your intuition on stocks there are a lot of differences between the example i am going to give and how the stock market actually runs but the basic concepts are the same lets say your friend asks you if he can borrow some money to start up a company in exchange you will have some ownership in this company you have essentially just bought yourself some stock now as your friend starts to grow he is doing well but he needs more cash to buy assets in order to grow the company more he is forced with an option either give you some of the profits or buy these assets sooner you decide you do n't really need the money right now and think he can do a lot better with spending the money to buy stuff this is essentially the same as a company electing to not pay dividends but instead invest into the future you as a stock holder are fine with it since you know the money is going toward investing in the future even if you never get paid a dividend as a company grows you can then turn around and sell the stock to someone else for more money then you gave originally of course you always take the risk of having the company failing and loosing some if not all of your investment but that is just the risk of the market

the bank secrecy act of 1970 requires that banks assist the u.s. gov't in identifying and preventing money laundering this means they 're required to keep records of cash transactions of negotiable instruments and report any such transactions with a daily aggregate limit of a value greater than or equal to $ 10,000 because of this the business which is issuing the money order is also required to record this transaction to report it to the bank who then holds the records in case fincen wants to review the transactions edited added clarification on the $ 10,000 rule

brendan the short answer is no there is no need to get into any other funds for all intents and purposes the s&p 500 is the stock market the news media may quote the dow when the market reaches new highs or crashes but all of the dow 30 stocks are included in the s&p 500   the s&p is also weighted which means that it owns in higher proportion the big blue chip stocks more than the smaller less known companies to explain the top 10 holdings in the s&p represent 18 of the total index while the bottom 10 only represent 0.17 less than 1 percent they do have an equal weighted s&p in which all 500 companies represent only of the index and that is technically even more diversified but in actuality it makes it more volatile because it has a higher concentration of those smaller less known companies so it will tend to perform better during up markets and worse during down markets as far as diversification into different asset classes or other countries that 's non sense the s&p 500 has companies in it that give you that exposure for example it includes companies that directly benefit from rising oil prices rising gold prices etc known as the energy and materials sector it also includes companies that own malls apartment complexes etc known as the real estate sector and as far as other countries most of the companies in the s&p are multi national companies meaning that they do business over seas in many parts of the world apple and facebook for example sell their products in many different countries so you do n't need to invest any of your money into an emerging market fund or an asia fund because most of our companies are already doing business in those parts of the world likewise you do n't need to specifically invest into a real estate or gold fund   as far as bonds go if you 're in your twenties you have no need for them either why because the s&p 500 also pays you dividends and these dividends grow over time so for example if microsoft increases its dividend payment by 100 over a ten year period all of the shares you buy today at a 2.5 yield will in 10 years have a higher 5 yield a bond on the other hand will never increase its yield over time if it pays out 4 that 's all it will ever pay you want to invest because you want to grow your money and if you want to invest passively the fastest way to do that is through index etfs like the $ spy $ ivv and $ rsp also look into the $ xiv it 's an inverse vix etf it moves 5x faster than the s&p in the same direction if you want to actively trade your money you can grow it even faster by getting into things like options highly volatile penny stocks shorting stocks and futures do n't get involved in fx or currency trading unless it through futures

make sure you are hitting the actual max of the 401k most think it is 18 k but that is the amount you can contribute into either pre tax or roth on top of this you can also contribute using an after tax contribution treated differently from roth total amounts up to since you are under 50   one thing i would look into for ways to beat interest rates in bank accounts and cds is municipal bond funds given your high income i have seen some earning almost 6 tax free ytd these also give you liquidity definitely keep your 3 mo salary in the bank but once you get over that while maxing out your 401k this is a pretty good way to make your money work for you without crushing you come tax time    building that muni bond fund account gradually you can eventually use that account to pay for things like car payments mortgage rent vacation etc just be sure if you go with a mutual fund that you are aware of any surrender charge schedules i have seen this done with c shares where you can withdraw your investment without penalty after 1 year    let me know if this is unclear or you would like any additional information best of luck

i dug up an old article on motley fool and one approach they mention is to get the stock certificates and then sell them to a friend if the company was liquidated you should receive a 1099-div form at     year 's end showing a liquidating distribution treat this as if you    sold the stock for the amount of the distribution the date of sale    is the date that the distribution took place using your original cost    basis in the shares you can now compute your loss if the company has n't actually been liquidated you 'll need to make    sure it 's totally worthless before you claim a loss if you have    worthless stock that 's not worth the hassle of selling through your    broker you can sell it to a friend or cousin aunt or uncle for    pennies however you ca n't sell the stock to a spouse siblings    parents grandparents or lineal descendants here 's one way to do    it send the certificate to your stock transfer agent explain that the shares have been sold and ask to cancel the old shares and issue    a new certificate to the new owner some brokerages will offer you a quicker alternative by buying all of your shares of the stock for a penny they do it to help out    their customers in addition over time some of the shares may    actually become worth more than the penny the brokers paid for them by selling the shares you have a closed transaction with the stock and can declare a tax loss meanwhile your friend relative or    broker for a pittance has just bought a or liner

as mentioned before you 're over thinking the hard pull issue but do try to make the preapproval as close to the actual bidding as possible because it costs money at least from my experience you 'll get charged the application fee for preapproval while pre qualification is usually free if you 're seriously shopping i find it hard to believe that you ca n't find a house within 3 months if you 're already in the process and your offer has been accepted and you opened the escrow i believe the preapproval will be extended if it expires before closing i 've just had a similar case from the other side as a buyer and the seller had a short sale approval that expired before closing it was extended to make the deal happen and that 's when the bank is actually loosing money so do n't worry about that if you have n't even started the process and the preapproval expired you might have to start it all over again from scratch including all the fees the credit score is a minor issue unless you do it every 2 3 months

this question and your other one indicate you 're a bit unclear on how capital gains taxes work so here 's the deal you buy an asset like shares of stock or a mutual fund   you later sell it for more than you bought it for   you pay taxes on your profit the difference between what you sold it for and what you bought it for   what matters is not the amount of money you withdraw but the prices at which assets are bought and sold in fact often you will be able to choose which individual shares you sell which means you have some control over the tax you pay   for a simple example suppose you buy 10 shares of stock for $ 100 each in january an investment of $ 1000 we 'll call these the early shares   the stock goes up to $ 200 in july and you buy 10 more shares investing an additional $ 2000 we 'll call these the late shares   then the stock drops to $ 150   suppose you want $ 1500 in cash so you are going to sell 10 shares the 10 early shares you bought have increased in value because you bought then for $ 100 but can now sell them for $ 150   the 10 late shares have decreased in value because you bought them for $ 200 but can now only sell them for $ 150   if you choose to sell the early shares you will have a capital gain of $ 500 $ 1500 sale price minus $ 1000 purchase price on which you may owe taxes   if you sell the late shares you will have a capital loss of $ 500 $ 1500 sale price minus $ 2000 purchase price is which you can potentially use to reduce your taxes   or you could sell 5 of each and have no gain or loss selling five early shares for $ 150 gives you a gain of $ 250 but selling five late shares for $ 150 gives you a loss of $ 250 and they cancel out the point of all this is to say that the tax is not determined by the amount of cash you get but by the difference between the sale price and the price you purchased for known as the cost basis and this in turn depends on which specific assets you sell   it is not enough to know the total amount you invested and the total gain   you need to know the specific cost basis i.e. original purchase price of the specific shares you 're selling   this is also the answer to your question about long term versus short term gains   it does n't matter how much money you make on the sale   what matters is how long you hold the asset before selling it that said many brokers will automatically sell your shares in a certain order unless you tell them otherwise and some wo n't let you tell them otherwise   often they will use the first in first out rule which means they will always sell the earliest purchased shares first to finally get to your specific question about betterment they have a page here that says they use a different method   essentially they try to sell your shares in a way that minimizes taxes   they do this by first selling shares that have a loss and only then selling shares that have a gain   this basically means that if you want to cash out $ x and it is possible to do it in a way that incurs no tax liability they will do that what gets me very confused is if i continue to invest random amounts of money each month using betterment then i need to withdraw some cash what are the tax implications   as my long answer above should indicate there is no simple answer to this   the answer is it depends   it depends on exactly when you bought the shares exactly how much you paid for them exactly when and how much the price rose or fell and exactly how much you sell them for   betterment is more or less saying do n't worry about any of this trust us we will handle everything so that your tax is minimized a final note if you really do want to track the details of your cost basis betterment may not be for you because it is an automated platform that may do a lot of individual trades that a human would n't do and that can make tracking the cost basis yourself very difficult   almost the whole point of something like betterment is that you are supposed to give them your money and forget about these details

in the us there 's no significant difference between what a business can deduct and what an individual can deduct however you can only deduct what is an expense to produce income businesses are allowed to write off salaries but individuals ca n't    write off what they pay their or maid at least in the us if you 're a sole proprietor in the business of managing properties you can definitely deduct payments to gardeners or maids business paying for a on a private property not related to producing the income like ceo 's daughter 's house can not deduct that expense for tax purposes although it is still recorded in the business accounting books as an expense with no tax benefit businesses are allowed to deduct utility expenses as overhead individuals can not same thing exactly i can deduct utility expenses for my rental property but not for my primary residence food shelter clothing and medical care are fundamental human needs    but we still pay for them with after tax money and pay additional    sales tax only interest and not principal on a mortgage is    deductible in the us which is great for people who take out mortgages    and helps banks get more business i 'm sure but you 're out of luck    if you pay cash for your house or are renting sales taxes are deductible you can deduct sales taxes you paid during the year if you itemize your deduction you can chose you either deduct the sales taxes or the state income taxes whatever is more beneficial for you btw in many states food and medicine are exempt from sales tax medical expenses are deductible if they 're significant compared to your total income you can deduct medical expenses in excess of 10 of your agi with the aca kicking in i do n't see how would people even get to that if your agi is low you get subsidies for insurance and the insurance keeps your expenses capped for self employed and employed insurance premiums are pre tax i.e. not even added to your agi principle for mortgage is not deductible because it is not an expense it is equity you own an asset do n't you you do get the standard deduction even if your itemized real deductions are less business do n't get that you also get an exemption amount for your basic living needs which businesses do n't get you can argue about the amounts but it is there in some states like california renters get tax breaks for renting depending on the agi ca renters credit is phasing out at agi of about $ 60 k which is pretty high

let p denote the amount of the investment r the rate of return and i the rate of inflation   for simplicity assume that the payment p is made annually right after the return has been earned   thus at the end if the year the investment p has increased to and p is returned as the annuity payment if i = 0 the entire return can be paid out as the payment and thus p = that is at the end of the year when the dust settles after the return has been collected and paid out as the annuity payment p is again available at the beginning of the next year to earn return at rate r. we have p = p if i > 0 then at the end of the year after the dust settles we can not afford to have only p available as the investment for next year next year 's payment must be p*(1+i and so we need a larger investment since the rate of return is fixed   how much larger   well if the investment at the beginning of next year is p*(1+i it will earn exactly enough additional money to pay out the increased payment for next year and have enough left over to help towards future increases in payments note   that we are assuming that r > i. if r < i a perpetuity can not be created   thus suppose that we choose p such that p = p*(1+i    multiplying this equation by we have p*(1+i = in words at the start of next year the investment is p*(1+i and the return less the increased payout of p*(1+i leaves an investment of for the following year   each year the payment and the amount to be invested for the following year increase by a factor of solving p = p*(1+i for p we get   p = i   as the initial perpetuity payment and the payment increases by a factor each year   the initial investment is p and it also increases by a factor of each year in later years the investment is at the start of the year the payment is and the amount invested for the next year is this is the same result as obtained by the op but written in terms that i can understand that is without the financial jargon about discount rates pv fv and the like

ulip insurance plan ulip is unit linked insurance plan the premium you pay a small part goes towards covering life insurance the balance is invested into stock markets most ulip would give you an option to choose from debt funds 100 safe buy low returns 5 7 or equity high risks returns can be around 15 or a mix of both ulip are not a good way to save money there are quite a few hidden fees that actually reduce the return so notionally even if returns shown are great in effect it is quite less for example the premium you pay in first year say rs 10,000/- rs goes towards commission and say rs 100 goes towards insurance balance rs units are purchased in your account even if these grow by 20 you are still in loss the commissions go down year after year and stop at 5 then there is fund management fees that you do n't get to see there is maintenance fee that is from your balance   thus the entire method of charging is not transparent life insurance from there are broadly 2 types of life insurance plans money back endowment plan the concept here is again same you pay a premium and part of it goes toward insurance the balance invests in safe bonds every year a bonus is declared generally less than bank rate at the end of the plan you get more than what you paid in premium however if you had kept the same in bank fd you would have got more money back so if you die your nominee would get insurance plus bonus if you survive you get all the accumulated bonus pure term plan here the premium is quite less for the sum insured here if you die your nominee would get insurance if you survive you do n't get anything
