i am not a lawyer or a tax accountant but from the description provided it sounds to me like you have created two partnerships one in which you share 50 of bob 's revenue and another in which you share 50 of the revenue from the first partnership if this is the case then each partnership would need to file form k-1 and issue a copy to the partners of that partnership i think but i 'm not sure that each partnership would need an employer identification number ein you can apply for and receive these online with the irs you would only pay tax on the portion of profits that are assigned to you on the k-1 if you 've accidentally created a partnership without thinking through all the ramifications you probably want to straighten this out you can be held liable for the actions of your partners on the other hand if your contract with bob explicitly makes you a contractor and not a partner then bob should probably be issuing a 1099 to you similarly for you and joe if your contract with joe makes him a subcontractor then you may need to get an ein and issue him a 1099 at the end of the year the money you pay to joe is a business expense and would be deducted from the profits you show on your schedule c. in my opinion it would be worth the $ 200 fee paid to a good cpa to make sure you get this right

you need to clarify with bob what your agreement is if you and bob are working together on these jobs as partners you should get a written partnership agreement done by a lawyer who works with software industry entity formation you can legally be considered a partnership if you are operating a business together even if there is nothing in writing the partnership will have its own tax return and you each will be allocated 50 of the profits losses if that 's what you agree to this amount will be reported on your own individual 1040 as self employment income since you have now lost all the expense deductions you would have taken on your schedule c and any home office deduction it 's a good idea to put language in the partnership agreement stating that the partnership will reimburse partners for their out of pocket expenses if bob is just hiring you as a contractor you give him your ssn and he issues you a 1099 like any other client this should be a situation where you invoice him for the amount you are charging same thing with joe figure out if you 're hiring him as an independent contractor or if you have a partnership either way you will owe income and self employment tax on your profits in the case of a partnership the amount will be on the k-1 from the partnership return for an independent contractor who 's operating as a sole proprietor you report the income you invoiced for and received and deduct your expenses including independent contractors that you hired on your schedule c. talk to your tax guy about quarterly estimated payments if you do n't have a tax guy go get one find somebody people in your city working in your industry recommend a good tax person will save you more money than they cost irs circular 230 notice please note that any tax advice contained in this communication is not intended to be used and can not be used by anyone to avoid penalties that may be imposed under federal tax law

in general yes if interest rates go higher then any existing fixed rate bonds and hence etfs holding those bonds become less valuable the further each bond is from maturity the larger the impact as you suggest once the bonds do mature the fund can replace them at a market price so the effect tails off the bond market has a concept known as duration that helps reason about this effect roughly it measures the average time from now to each payout of the bond weighted by the payout the longer the duration the more the price will change for a given change in interest rates the concept is just an approximation and there are various slightly different ways of calculating it but very roughly the price of a bond will reduce by a percentage equal to the duration times the increase in interest rates so a bond with a duration of 5 years will lose 5 of its value for a 1 rise in interest rates and of course vice versa for your second question it really depends on what you 're trying to achieve by diversifying this might be best as a different question that gives more detail as it 's not very related to your first question short term bonds are less risky but both will lose value if the underlying company is in trouble gilts government bonds are less risky than corporate bonds

something to note is that when a company announces a share buyback program there is usually a time frame and amount of shares that are important details as it is n't like the company will make one big buy back of stock generally   rather it may take months or even years as noted in the wikipedia article about share repurchases wikipedia covers some of the technical details here but to give a specific set of answers when a company announces a share buyback program who do they actually    buy back the shares from   from the wikipedia link under us corporate law there are five primary methods of stock repurchase open market private negotiations repurchase put rights and two variants of self tender repurchase a fixed price tender offer and a dutch auction thus there are open market and a couple of other possibilities openly traded shares on a stock exchange   possibly though there are other options is there a fixed price that    they buy back at sometimes   i 'd think a fixed price tender offer would imply a fixed price though the open market way may take various prices if i own shares in that company can i get them to buy back my shares selective buy backs is noted in wikipedia as in broad terms a selective buy back is one in which identical offers are not made to every shareholder for example if offers are made to only some of the shareholders in the company in the us no special shareholder approval of a selective buy back is required in the uk the scheme must first be approved by all shareholders or by a special resolution requiring a 75 majority of the members in which no vote is cast by selling shareholders or their associates selling shareholders may not vote in favor of a special resolution to approve a selective buy back the notice to shareholders the meeting to vote on a selective buy back must include a statement setting out all material information that is relevant to the proposal although it is not necessary for the company to provide information already disclosed to the shareholders if that would be unreasonable thus it is possible though how probable is another question while not in the question something to consider is how the buybacks can be done as a result of offsetting the dilution of employees who have stock options that may exercise them and spread the earnings over more shares but this is more on understanding the employee stock option scenario that various big companies use when it comes to giving employees an incentive to help the stock price

i was wondering how do we calculate the total capital of a company which items should i look for in the financial statements total capital usually refers to the sum of long term debt and total shareholder equity both of these items can be found on the company 's balance sheet this is one of the calculations that 's traditionally used when determining a company 's return on capital   i 'll use the balance sheet from gilead sciences 2012 10-k form as an example net long term debt was $ and total stockholder equity was $ which should give a grand total of $ for total capital i know you can do the math but i always find an example helpful if it uses realistic numbers   you may sometimes hear the term total capital referring to total capital stock or total capital assets in which case it may be referring to physical capital i.e. assets like inventory etc instead of financial capital leverage and how do i calculate notes payable is the same as accounts payable as the word payable suggests both are liabilities however i 've always been taught that accounts payable are debts a business owes to its suppliers while notes payable are debts a business owes to banks and other institutions with which it has signed a formal agreement and which use formal debt instruments e.g. a loan contract this definition seems to match various articles i found online   on a balance sheet you can usually determine notes payable by combining the short term debt of the company with the current portion of the long term debt these pieces comprise the debt that is due within the fiscal year in the balance sheet for gilead sciences i would only include the $ categorized as current portion of long term debt and other obligations net term since the other current liabilities do n't look like they would involve formal debt contracts   since the notes payable section of 's balance sheet does n't seem that diverse and therefore might not make the best example i 'll include the most recent balance sheet monsanto as monsanto 's balance sheet lists a term called short term debt including current portion of long term debt with a value of $ 36 million this looks like almost the exact definition of notes payable 1 note that this financial statement is called a statement of consolidated financial position on monsanto 's

i am a small time zopa user in the uk and have been for over a year the rates that loans are accepted at on zopa seem to me to be 0.5 1 higher than the best deals in the commercial market the rates did used to be up at 8 even for a short term but now that bracket is getting about 5.5 that 's just talking about the rate offered to borrowers my own return will be lower as there is a fee levied from zopa naturally and there is the risk of default in 13 months on the site with ~20 borrowers and payments i have not had any defaults the total interest returned for 13 months on a investment of £ 150 with all repayments re loaned out has been £ so maybe 5.7 return i expect that to go down a bit as i 'm now loaning out at lower rates bear in mind also that interest from p2p lending is taxable income

you will owe tax on all but the deposit that was not taxed   e.g. you deposited $ for 3 years and deducted $ 5 k for each of 2 years the third $ 5 k   deposit was a nondeductible ira contribution which you reported to the irs by filing form 8606 with your tax return for that year now you convert the total balance of $ 18 k $ 15 k of contributions plus $ 3 k of interest gains in this case $ 5 k is not taxable income while the $ 13 k is taxable income this calculation is done on form 8606 for the year of the rollover edit in response to op 's comment the roth conversion is text based on the value of a day it was   converted one thing to be aware of is that you can re characterize up until the time you file your taxes for 2017 in april 2018 or with extension up until october   this offers you the opportunity to undo the conversion if for whatever reason the value is lower at the time you do your taxes or if the converted amount will put you into a higher tax bracket you do n't need to give the irs a reason it 's up to your discretion as dave note in a comment the conversion is n't all or none the recharacterization along with this fact help you to fine tune exactly how much in converted in hindsight

thinking about the business overall your profit would be since this is a sole proprietorship the taxes are going to depend on your marginal tax rate if you file jointly your income will determine what your marginal tax rate is   if you file separately there likely would n't be any tax on that income since it 's less than the standard deduction but you lose benefits of filing jointly combined exemptions etc so think about how much she would charge what expenses are involved before taxes what the taxes would be on that profit and what the opportunity costs are is it worth time away from the kids hobbies etc for that hobby how much should a hobby business make to make it worth the effort of charging for such services that would fall in the expense section   are you talking about the actual costs tax prep etc or just the hassle of collecting accounting etc   certainly those are a consideration but it 's harder to quantify that   if you can come up with some sort of cost then certainly it would fit in the overall value equation i 'm not sure using additional social security benefits as a gauge is helpful since you would n't see those benefits until you 're of retirement age according to ss and a lot can happen between now and then

your answer will need loads of information and clarification so i will ask you to visit the vat and have a 1 obligation is for you to find out the correct rate of vat charge and pay tax accordingly you can call up the hmrc vat helpline for help which they will be happy to oblige normally everybody pays vat every 3 months or you can pay once in a year 2 depends on your annual turnover including vat less than £ you join the flat rate scheme there are schemes for cultural activities might be good to check here on gov.uk 3 if you pay vat in eu countries you can reclaim vat in uk you need to reclaim vat while filing in your vat returns but be careful about your receipts which can be checked to verify you are not defrauding hmrc   the basic rule is that b2b services are as the name suggests supplies from one business to another and subject to some exceptions are treated as made where the customer belongs no vat is chargeable on b2b supplies to an overseas customer but where you make a b2c supply vat depends on where your customer is located 1 if they are outside the eu you do n’t need to charge vat 2 if they are located in an eu country then you must charge vat source all in all keep all records of vat charged and paid to satisfy the taxman if the rules get complicated get an accountant to help you out don take chances of interpreting the law yourself the fines you might pay for wrong interpretation might be a deal breaker

an investment in knowledge always pays the best interest as ben franklin said however this is not a question i can answer for you as it depends on the opportunities that are specifically available to you as an individual sometimes opportunities will knock on your door and you can take advantage other times you have to create that door to allow opportunities to knock maybe you have a friend that is opening a side business maybe there is a class you can get into at a trivial cost what i suggest is to start investing just to get into the habit of it not so much for the returns before you do however any financial advisor will advise you to begin with a emergency fund worth about 3 6 months of your expenses for that time i wanted to hit the ground running and start investing in stocks but first things first i guess millionaire next door will help you get into a saving mindset i will teach you to be rich is ok plenty of other books my advice is keep doing what you 're doing learn to start saving and once you have obtained an emergency fund of the amount of your choosing start looking to invest in index funds or etfs through any platform that has low fees i use betterment but vanguard is good too as they allow you to get your feet wet and it 's passive hope this helps

first you are not exactly giving the brokerage $ 2000 that money is the margin requirement to protect them in the case the stock price rises if you short 200 shares as in your example and they are holding $ 6000 from you then they are protected in the event of the stock price increasing to $ 30/share sometime before it gets there the brokerage will require you to deposit more money or they will cover your position by repurchasing the shares for your account the way you make money on the short sale is if the stock price declines it is a buy low sell high idea but in reverse if you believe that prices are going to drop then you could sell now when it is high and buy back later when it is lower in your example you are selling 200 shares at $ 20 and later buying those at $ 19 thus your profit is $ 200 not counting any interest or fees you have paid it 's a bit confusing because you are selling something you 'll buy in the future selling short is usually considered quite risky as your gain is limited to the amount that you sold at initially if i sell at $ 20/share the most i can make is if the stock declines to $ 0   your potential to lose is unlimited in theory there is no limit to how high the stock could go in theory so i could end up buying it back at an infinitely high price neither of these extremes are likely but they do show the limits of your potential gain and loss   i used $ 20/share for simplicity assuming you are shorting with a market order vs a limit order if you are shorting it would be better for you to sell at 20 instead of 19 anyway if someone says i would like to give you $ 20 for that item you are selling you are n't likely to tell them no i 'd really only like $ 19 for it

what would happen if you was to cash a check did n’t realize it was    to you and your finance company take it to a local business that has    a money center they cash the check without even having you sign let    alone having the finance companies endorsement on it the money    cleared my account like a couple months ago and it was just brought up    now the reason why the check was made out the owner and the lender is to make sure the repairs were done on the car the lender wants to make sure that their investment is protected   for example you get a six year loan on a new car in the second year you get hit by another driver the damage estimate is $ 1,000 and you decide it does n't look that bad so you decide to skip the repair and spend the money on paying off debts what you do n't know is that if they had done the repair they would have found hidden damage and the repair would have cost $ 3,000 and would have been covered by the other persons insurance   jump ahead 2 years the rust from the skipped repair causes other issues now it will cost $ 5,000 to fix the insurance wo n't cover it and now a car with an outstanding loan balance of $ 4,000 and a value of $ 10,000 if the damage did n't exist needs $ 5,000 to fix   the lender wants the repairs done they would have not signed the check before seeing the proof the repairs were done to their satisfaction but because the check was cashed without their involvement they will be looking for a detailed receipt showing that all the work was done they may require that the repair be done at a certified repair shop with manufacturer parts   if you do n't have a detailed bill ask the repair shop for a copy of the original one

i think a labor management issue explains the high cost of popcorn some weeks theaters are loaded with patrons and other weeks there are many fewer patrons if popcorn were priced so that most patrons bought some the theater manager would have to have lots of employees to sell popcorn on the really busy days the manager would have to cover the cost of wages on the slow days a simple solution would be to adjust employee hours to a certain extent i suspect this is done if you look at the situation from the standpoint of the employee being sent home early or being told not to work tomorrow or perhaps for the next week because the theater has a bunch of bombs is not a good situation a job in popcorn sales is probably not a high paying job so the employees may just quit and they may do this not by giving notice but rather by not showing up for a scheduled shift the result of this is that managers determine the maximum number of employees they can hire if there theater has low drawing movies and they set the price of popcorn so that when the theater is filled this number of employees will not be overwhelmed by patron buying popcorn at least not to the extent that the start of the movie has to be delayed

activists generally take stakes larger than 2 and have a lot of experience in influencing boards there 's also a self fulfilling prophecy where successful activists are known to be successful and so other investors tend to support their suggestions   furthermore activist investors often fail to advance their policies and give up   in any case making shareholders happy only matters as far as preventing them from actually putting together a solid proxy challenge professional activist investors with solid economic arguments can make a credible threat of that whereas activists with non economic goals present a much less credible threat   additionally you say the demand is so low but imo trump using twitter keeps it in the news and prevents it from sliding even further into irrelevance   i suspect the value of that one account is greater than their whole marketing budget   think not just of trump but of people arguing etc that whole ecosystem is huge   i 'd imagine that if trump announced tomorrow that he 's no longer using twitter and instead will post on facebook or instagram or whatever twitter 's stock would slide by 10 at least

i agree with the previous comments one thing that got brought up a while back when i was looking into purchasing a prius was the battery replacement someone once told me it was very expensive in the event it failed and needed to be changed i 'm not talking about the 12 volt but the big nickel metal one another thing to factor is the gas that you will save normally the prius get double the gas milage of that of civic or a corolla but unless you drive a bunch of miles per day you really do n't see the pay off   also if you can pull a on the car the 20 dollar investment is worth it because you can find out if it was in an accident or if it 's a lemon i once bought a bmw and did n't do a and later ended up finding out that the car had more owners than a taxi had customers   also just like said above 200k car vs 100k always mean the 100k is better off especially if the previous owner never services it well get the car checkout before you make the deal to buy

the general answer to any is it worth it insurance question is no because the insurance company is making a profit on the insurance to decide if you want the insurance you need to figure out how much you can afford to pay if something happens how much they cover and how badly you want to transfer your risk to them   if you wo n't have trouble coming up with the $ 4000 deductible should you need to then do n't get this extra insurance   i did not mean to imply that insurance is always a bad idea or that insurance companies are cheating their customers please let me explain further   when you buy any product from a business that business is making a profit and there is nothing wrong with that at all they are providing a service and should be compensated for their efforts   insurance companies also provide a service but unlike other types of businesses their product is monetary you pay them money now and they might pay you money later if they pay you more money then you spent you came out ahead and if you spend more money then they give you it was a loss for you   in order for the insurance company to make a profit they need to bring in more money than they pay out in fact they need to bring in a lot more money then they pay out because in addition to their profit they have all the overhead of running a business   as a result on average you will come out behind when you purchase insurance this means that when you are on the fence about whether or not to purchase any insurance product the default choice should be no   on average you are financially better off without insurance   now that does n't mean you should never buy insurance as mentioned by commenter insurance companies spread risk across all of their customers if i am in a situation where i have a risk of financial ruin in a certain circumstance i can eliminate that risk by purchasing insurance for example i have term life insurance because if i were to pass away it would be financially catastrophic for my family i 'm hoping that the insurance company makes 100 profit on that deal i also continue to buy expensive health insurance because an unexpected medical event would be financially devastating however i always decline the extended warranty when i buy a $ 300 appliance because i do n't have any trouble coming up with another $ 300 in the unlikely event that it breaks and i would rather keep the money than contribute to the profits of an insurance company unnecessarily   in my original answer above i pointed out how you would determine whether or not to purchase this particular insurance product this product pays out a bunch of relatively small amounts for certain events up to a limit of $ 4000 would this $ 4000 be hard for you to come up with if you needed to if so get the insurance but if you are like me and have an emergency fund in place to handle things like this then you are financially better off declining this policy

did he say why he wants double your asking price did you explain to him how you came up with the offer you made sometimes exploring interests why people make their decisions is more helpful than bargaining over positions if you understand why he wants double your offer and he understands why you 're offering a lower price you might get closer to an agreement another option is to defer to a disinterested third party who will pick a valuation for the company and you can agree to abide by their decision and pick a payout schedule if necessary think about what you 'll do if you ca n't come to an agreement is walking away from the business an option and going out on your own what would happen to him if you simply walk away it might be in his best interest to negotiate or will you pay his asking price or can you sell the business to him one option when partners need to split up is to have one of them set a value for the company and the other decides if he wants to be the buyer or seller it 's like the trick with kids where one cuts the cake and the other selects which slice he wants maybe you can come up with a fair way of valuing the company a lawyer will be needed to draw it all up but you can agree on the framework of the deal ahead of time and save some money and stress last thought when a win win agreement is n't possible sometimes the next best compromise is where everyone feels like he got equally screwed that 's ok too

how is it possible that long term treasury bonds which the government has never defaulted on can hold more risk as an etf then the stock market index the risk from long term bonds is n't that the government defaults but that interest rates go up before you get paid so investors want bonds issued more recently at higher interest rates rather than your older bonds that pay at a lower rate so the price for your bonds goes down this is usually caused by higher inflation rates which reduce the value of the interest that you will be paid do you assume more risk investing in bond etfs than you would investing in individual bonds if you are choosing the right etfs there should be a lower amount of risk because the etfs are taking care of the difficult work of buying a variety of bonds   are bond etfs an appropriate investment vehicle for risk diversification yes if you are investing in bonds exchange traded funds are an appropriate way to buy them the markets for etfs are usually very liquid

the whole point of buying puts is cheaper cost and lower downside risk if you short the box you are assuming he already holds gold holdings to short against it 's not the same as short selling where you borrow shares   either way you are far more vulnerable to downside risk if you are short the stock whether you borrowed or shorted already owned shares if gold suddenly has a 20 pop over the next year which could be possible given the volatility and uncertainty in the marketplace you have big trouble whereas if you buy puts you only lose your costs for the contracts the amount that you miss by in your bet is n't going to factor into anything

as discusses tax bracket without any refers to a single jurisdiction 's marginal tax rate   in your case this is either your california 's tax bracket or your federal tax bracket not including marginal social security and medicare taxes   but if someone says combined state and federal tax bracket they probably mean the combination of your state and federal income tax brackets again lot including sales taxes business and occupational taxes social security taxes and medicare taxes   the math to combine the state and federal marginal tax rates is a bit tricky because most people can deduct either their state and local income taxes or their state and local general sales taxes when computing their income for federal income tax purposes   the federal alternative minimum tax restricts this deduction for some people for a single person earning $ 100,000 of salaries and wages in california whose state income taxes are close to their standard deduction the calculations for the combined marginal income tax rate look something like this as mentioned above this the tax bite on marginal earned income   to find the true marginal rate we need to add in social security taxes medicare taxes sales taxes and business occupation taxes   the social security and medicare taxes are sometimes called self employment taxes   this math unemployment insurance and workers compensation insurance because those taxes are typically capped well below $ 100,000 per year of income   this math also b o taxes because this question is california specific if an employer wishes to increase an employee 's pay by $ the first $ will go to the employer 's share of social security and medicare taxes   the remaining $ 1,000.00 will be subject to the combined marginal income tax rate discussed above plus will have $ go to the employee 's share of social security and medicare taxes   the employee might buy some extra things with some of their extra money and pay sales tax on them in 2016 a 9 sales tax rate was common in california 's largest cities the irs estimated that for a single person with no dependents making $ 100,000 per year who did not buy a boat rv motor vehicle or major home construction about 9 of their marginal gross income was subject to sales tax

personal finances are not intuitive for everyone and it can be a challenge to know what to do when you have n't been taught   congratulations on recognizing that you need to make a change the first step that i would recommend is what you 've already done assemble your bank statements so you can get an accurate picture of what money you currently have   keep organized folders so you can find your bank statements when you need them in addition to the bank statements for your checking and savings accounts you also need to assess any debt that you have   have you taken out any loans that need to be paid back   do you have any credit card debt   make a list of all your debts and make sure that you have folders for these statements as well hopefully you do n't have any debts   but if you are like most people you owe money to someone and you may even owe more money than you currently have in your bank accounts   if you have debts fixing this problem will be one of your goals no matter what your debt is you need to make sure that from now on you do n't spend more money than you take in as income   to do this you need to make a budget a budget is a plan for spending your money   to get started with a budget make a list of all the income you will receive this month   add it up and write that amount at the top of a page   next you want to make a list of all the expenses you will have this month   some of these expenses are more or less fixed rent utility bills etc   write those down first   some of the expenses you have more control over such as food and entertainment   give yourself some money to spend on each of these   you may also have some larger expenses that will happen in the future such as a tuition or insurance payment   allocate some money to those so that by the time that payment comes around you will have saved enough to pay for those expenses if you find that you do n't have enough income to cover all of your expenses in a month you need to either reduce your expenses somewhere or increase your income until your budget is at a point where you have money left over at the end of each month after you 've gotten to this point the next step is figuring out what to do with that extra money left over   this is where your goals come into play   if you have debt i recommend that one of your first goals is to eliminate that debt as fast as possible   if you have no money saved you should make one of your goals saving some money as an emergency fund   see the question oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing for some ideas on what order you should place your goals doing the budget and tracking all of your spending on paper is possible but many people find that using the right software to help you do this is much easier   i have written before on choosing budgeting software   all of the budgeting software packages i mentioned in that post are from the u.s. but many of them can successfully be used in europe   ynab the program i use even has an unofficial german users community that you might find useful one of the things that budgeting software will help you with is the process of reconciling your bank statements   this is where you go through the bank statement each month and compare it to your own record of spending transactions in your budget   if there are any transactions that appear in the statement that you do n't have recorded you need to figure out why   either it is an expense that you forgot to record or it is a charge that you did not make   record it if it is legitimate or dispute the expense if it is fraudulent for more information look around at some of the questions tagged budget   i also recommend the book the total money makeover by dave ramsey which will provide more help in making a budget and getting out of debt

if you are off by coins how can you be sure that you only made a typo and did n't miss a transaction   to start off i would strongly you find a way to be precise   it does n't matter so much in the accounting but the habit of doing a thorough job will pay off in other dividends down the line basically do the pennies now   some free online software to save the headache of data entry but since my primary goal is to get you to do the budgeting and if you really hate the coins just be consistent in how you fudge the debits and the credits always round down to the nearest whole in income and always round up on expenses   you wo n't overspend this way and your back account should have a little bit of padding because you will assume less money in and more money out honestly i do tracking in both quicken and mint.com so the transaction size is no big deal to me   if i did it all in excel i would round to whole notes   you did n't tag your question with a country so i do n't know if or similar is available to you

the two questions inherent in any decision to purchase an insurance plan is how likely am i to need it and what 's the worst case scenario if i do n't have it the actuary that works for the insurance company is asking these same questions from the other end with the second question thus being what would we be expected to have to pay out for a claim using a lot of data about you and people like you to arrive at an answer it really boils down to little more than a bet between you and the insurance company and like any casino the insurer has a house edge the question is whether you think you 'll beat that edge if you 're more likely than the insurer thinks you are to have to file a claim then additional insurance is a good bet so the reasons you might decide against getting umbrella insurance include your everyday liability is low most people do n't live in an environment where the normal insurance they carry wo n't pay for their occasional mistakes or acts of god the one for most is a car accident but when you think of all the mistakes that have to be made by both sides in order for you to burn through the average policy 's liability limits and still be ruined for life you start feeling better for instance in texas minimum insurance coverage levels are assuming neither party is hurt but the car is a total loss your insurer will pay the fair market value of the car up to $ 50,000 that 's a really nice car to have a curbside value of 50 grand remember that most cars take an initial hit of up to 25 of their sticker value and a first year depreciation of up to 50 that 50 grand would cover an $ 80k porsche 911 or top end lexus es and the owner of that car in the u.s. at least can not sue to recover replacement value his damages are only the fair market value of the car plus medical lost wages etc which are covered under your two personal injury liability buckets if that 's a problem it 's the other guy 's job to buy his own supplemental insurance such as gap insurance which covers the remaining payoff balance of a loan or lease above total loss value beyond that level up into the like the a ms etc the drivers of these cars know full well that they will never get the blue book value of the car from you or your insurer and take steps to protect their investment the guys who sell these cars also know this and so they do n't sell these cars outright they require buyers to sign ownership contracts and one of the stipulations of such a contract is that the buyer must maintain a gold plated insurance policy on the car that 's usually not the only stipulation the total yearly cost to own a according to some estimates is around $ 300,000 of which insurance is only 10 the other 90 is obligatory routine maintenance including a $ 50,000 tire replacement every 10,000 miles obligatory yearly detailing at $ 10k fuel costs that 's a engine under that hood the car requires high and only gets 3 mpg city 8 highway and secure parking and storage the in lower manhattan who own one of these could expect to pay almost as much just for the parking space as for the car with a monthly service contract payment to boot you do n't have a lot to lose you ca n't get blood from a bankruptcy laws typically prevent creditors from taking things you need to live or do your job including your home your car wardrobe etc for someone just starting out that may be all you have it could still be bad for you but comparing that to say a small business owner with a net worth in the millions who 's found liable for a slip and fall in his store there 's a lot more to be lost in the latter case and in a hurry for the same reason litigious people and their legal representation look for deep pockets who can pay big sums quickly instead of $ 100 a month for the rest of their life and so very few lawyers will target you as an individual unless you 're the only one to blame rare or their client insists on making it personal most of your liability is already covered one way or the other when something happens to someone else in your home your homeowner 's policy includes a personal liability rider the first two buckets of state mandated auto liability insurance are for personal injury liability the third is for property car house mailbox health insurance covers your own emergency care no matter who sent you to the er and life and insurance covers your own death or permanent disability no matter who caused it depending on who 's offering it sometimes the rider is for your employer 's benefit and only applies on the job 99 times out of 100 people just want to be made whole when it 's another average joe on the other side who caused them harm and that 's what normal insurance is designed to cover it 's fashionable to go after big business for big money when they do wrong and big business knows this and spends a lot of money insuring against it but when it 's another little guy on the short end of the stick pursuing them for everything they 're worth is frowned on by society and the lawyer virtually always walks away with the lion 's share so this strategy is self defeating for those who choose it no money and no friends now if you are the deep pockets that people look for when they get out of the hospital then a or other supplemental liability insurance is definitely in order you now think as you should that you 're more likely to be sued for more than your normal insurance will cover and even if the insurance company thinks the same as you and will only offer a rather expensive policy it becomes a rather easy decision of lose a little every month or lose it all at once

context my parents overseas japan sent me a little over $ 100,000 to    cover an expensive tuition payment and moderate living expenses in    2014 they are not us residents green card holders or citizens they did not remit the tuition payment directly to the school i am a    resident for tax this is enough to answer yes that 's basically the set of requirements for filing you received > $ 100 k from a non us person and you yourself are a us person you have to report it and unless it is taxable income it is a gift taxable income is reported on the form 1040 gifts are reported on the form 3520 the fact that in japan it is not considered a gift is irrelevant gift tax laws vary between countries some many do n't have gift taxes at all but the reporting requirement is based on the us law and the us definition of gift as i said above if it is not a gift per the us law then it is taxable income and then you report all of it regardless of the amount and pay taxes had they paid directly to the institution you would n't need to count it as income gift to you because you did n't actually receive the money so no income and it went directly to cover your qualified education expenses so no gift but this is not the case in your situation whether or not this will be reported by the irs back to japan i do n't know but it was probably already reported to the authorities in japan by the banks through which the transfers went through as to whether it will trigger an audit does n't really matter it was most likely reported to the irs already by the receiving banks in the us so not reporting it on your tax return either as income or on form 3520 may indeed raise some flags
# 118449
as for income tax purposes 's answer is correct the entire amount that is converted is post tax you had to pay tax on any pre tax amounts upon conversion so you do not pay tax on it when you withdraw it in a non qualified distribution similar to with contributions however there 's another perhaps more important consideration here the early withdrawal penalty for non qualified distributions from roth ira for non qualified distributions of contributions there is never an early withdrawal penalty for non qualified distributions of rollovers and conversions there is an early withdrawal penalty if withdrawn within 5 years of the rollover or conversion but only on the part of the rollover or conversion that was taxable during the conversion so if you want to withdraw within 5 years of the conversion then it works differently from direct contributions because contributions and conversions have different treatment for the penalty the ordering between them matters too contributions are always withdrawn before rollovers and conversions a later contribution still comes before an earlier rollover or conversion but within rollovers and conversions they are ordered by year an earlier rollover or conversion comes before a later one and within a year the taxable part is ordered before the non taxable part

drips come to mind as something that may be worth examining if you take the microsoft example consider what would happen if you bought additional shares each year by re investing the dividends and the stock also went up over the years a combination of capital appreciation in the share price plus the additional shares purchased over time can produce a good income stream over time the key is to consider how long are you contributing how much are you contributing and what end result are you expecting as some companies can have larger dividends if you look at reits for example

at first i thought this might be too broad   there are of course thousands of things that you can do with your money to help the economy   but i think that there is room to discuss some broad strokes without trying to list a thousand details    regular investing as you are now helps the economy in that companies obtain money by selling their stock   they can then use that money to fund expansion etc   these things can help the economy permanently   of course they can also use the money to pay executive bonuses which do n't help the economy so much    similarly just spending money does not normally help the economy   unless we are in a recession it is mildly harmful to spend   money that could be going to support long term improvements in production instead is used to buy a luxury that does n't terribly interest you   i.e. if you do n't want a bigger house or a more luxurious car do n't buy it to stimulate the economy    many charitable donations have the same problem   they help short term consumption somewhere   and of course the charity starts asking you for more money   many charities waste most of a donation trying to get another one from the same person or family    sir john maynard keynes proposed that the best thing that people could do to help the economy is to invest in things that cause economic activity in turn   he was mostly talking about things like roads bridges and dams that are out of the investing range of most people so he wanted governments to do it particularly during a recession    so we are looking for ways to invest in durable improvements that will support economic activity in the future   a million dollars is a small amount for many things but there are some activities that work   i 'm going to list a few examples but there are certainly others    fund   basically loan your million dollars to people who need a small amount of money   these programs often allow you to determine the initial recipient and then that person determines the next recipient   a million dollars can finance hundreds if not thousands of these loans   they may be in the united states or in a developing country    set up a scholarship   my recommendation would be to find an existing scholarship with a few recipients and ask them to add one a year for the million dollars   a million dollars should typically produce about a scholarship a year in returns after inflation   of course that 's just regular inflation   education inflation is higher    solar prize   fund a program that gives out one solar installation every year or five to a family that owns a house is struggling to pay utilities and makes a compelling case   basically whenever the investment grows enough to support it make a new prize    buy something that will help other people make money    this is just six ideas off the top of my head   the goal here is to create something lasting that will promote economic activity   so a program that loans money forward   or a scholarship or free textbook particularly in a stem field   a small piece of infrastructure that helps people move around to work or spend their money   solar is a bit of a stretch here but it can be justified if you believe that an investment now is an investment in moving towards the future    the key thing here is to make your money do double duty   by spending your money during a recession or investing during the rest of the business cycle you can get some value for your money   but even better is if that spending has a societal return as well   scholarships and infrastructure do that   there is the immediate spending plus there is the effect of the spending   a business is established   a mind is trained and working at a high income job   people can move work and spend their own money

may result in more taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable    account when the fund manager decides to sell shares of a stock and those shares have grown in value that growth is a capital gain if that fund is part of a taxable account then the investors in the fund will have to declare that income gain on their tax forms that could require the investors to have to pay taxes on those gains   of course if the investors are holding the fund shares in a ira or 401 k then there are no taxes due in the near term a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction    costs   these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating    expenses or in the previous expense examples reduce the fund ’s    performance the annual fund operating expenses are the expenses that they can assume will happen every year they include salaries the cost of producing statements paperwork required by the government research it does n't include transaction costs which they ca n't estimate what they will be in advance if the fund invests in a particular segment of the market and there is a disruption in that segment they may need to make many new investments if on the other hand last year they made great choices the turnover may be small this year during the most recent fiscal year the fund ’s portfolio turnover rate    was 3 of the average value of its portfolio that may be your best indicator

whole life is life insurance that lasts your whole life   seriously since the insurance company must make a profit and since they know they will always pay out on a whole life policy whole life tends to be very expensive and has lower death benefits than a term policy some of these policies are paid up policies meaning that they are structured so that you do n't have to pay premiums forever   but what it amounts to is that the insurance company invests your premiums and then pays you a smaller dividend much like banks do with savings accounts unless you are especially risk averse it is almost always a better decision to get an inexpensive term policy and invest the money you save yourself rather than letting the insurance company invest it for you and reap most of the benefits if you are doing things properly you wo n't need life insurance your whole life as retirement investments will eventually replace your working income

market makers are essentially just there to process the buys and sells of traders so just like you and i buy and sell at the ask and bid prices they do to they are just completing the process of making our orders a reality market makers are just representative of brokers meaning that when you place your order at ask or bid you are placing that particular brokers order at ask or bid people often say that certain brokers have too many shares and claim that they are games when really that just means that there happen to be a lot of people using a particular broker all at once or more troubling perhaps even company execs using a broker to sell a large amount of shares

if the company 's ownership is structured similarly to a typical start up then an 1 employee ownership in a company which sells for 1 million will yield far less than 10k due to various liquidation preferences of the investors different share classes etc   it 's pretty hard to get a specific number because it depends a lot on the details of earlier fundraising and stock grants     that said unless the company is circling the drain and the sale was just to avoid bk the share price you get should be higher unless the share class structure and acquisition deal are completely unfair

the history of the jews even outside germany is not a very nice on nevertheless it does not excuse your views on muslims nor should or are the muslims excluded when it comes to hate speech and crimes this year alone there were several raids against the radical muslim the hat speech law is a very good instrument to not have racist group rally against minority 's   muslim jews or otherwise and to go back to the topic which facebook has to respect as well if someone broke the law you have to act and pull that comment which they currently not do nearly fast enough my opinion stays your views are highly racial and not based on facts you are part of the problem because bot everyone is as smart as you i m sincere here a moron heres your speech translates it to beat up all muslims because they are the terrorists and will do so you talked about freedom tolerance and same rights for all if you truly want that you have to forgive and not fight with the same weapons we have something in common regarding our views of the muslim population they actually do have a big problem with antisemitism and this problem needs to be addressed but as you said same rights for everyone so we can not talk shit about them either in germany at the moment the anti islam problem has taken over and reached dangerous proportions that is why i defend this group so much and can not let half truths spread i think we are both a bit tired of this conversation so here is my proposal we say each other a final statement what we wish for the other to consider in the future so i try                  i really would want you to not succumb to simple prejudice please listen to the facts out there and look at the whole picture you said and posted a lot of things which are well known to be right propaganda the sweden thing is a 1a example or half truths like the rise if crimes of germany which us overall true but the rise does not come from rape or violence from immigrants but migration related topics while the right wing attacks against muslims and refugees rose considerably   as it stands i can only describe you as a jewish nazi which i really do not want to but have no choice considering your views sorry that this was not too friendly   i await your reply

the formula you are looking for is pretty complicated it 's given here you might prefer to let somebody else do the grunt work for you this page will calculate the probability for you in your case you 'd enter standard and standard oh you did n't say what you 're paying on your debt let 's say it 's 6 i.e. .06 note that this page will give you the probability that the actual number will be less than or equal to the standard score enter all that and click the magic button and the probability that the investment will produce less than 6 is or 34 the handy rule of thumb is that the probability is about 68 that the actual number will be within 1 standard deviation of the mean 95 that it will be within 2 standard deviations and that it will be within 3 which is n't exactly what you want because you do n't want within but less than but you could get that by just adding half the difference from 100 for each of the above i.e. instead of 68 95 it would be 84 98 99.9 oh i missed that in a follow up comment you say you are paying 4 on a mortgage which you are adjusting to 3 because of tax implications probability based on mean and sd you gave of getting less than 3 is 26 i did n't read the article you cite i assume the standard deviation given is for the rate of return for one year if you stretch that over many years the sd goes down as many factors tend to even out so while the probability that money in a given say mutual fund will grow by less than 3 in one year is fairly high the 25 35 we 're talking here sounds plausible to me the probability that it will grow by an average of less than 3 over a period of 10 or 15 or 20 years is much less further thought there is of course no provably true formula for what makes a reasonable risk suppose i offered you an investment that had a 99 chance of showing a $ 5,000 profit and a 1 chance of a $ loss would you take it i would n't even though the chance of a loss is small if it happened i 'd lose everything i have is it worth that risk for the modest potential profit i 'd say no of course to someone who has a billion dollars this might be a very reasonable risk if it fails oh well that could really cut in to what he can spend on lunch tomorrow

it looks like with the sale of your current home you have enough liquidity to obtain credit on the best terms without tapping your wife 's ira the biggest factor to consider is the deduction on mortgage interest which reduces the effective interest on your mortgage significantly particularly as you jump into a higher tax bracket along these lines deferred retirement savings should have a higher priority than paying down the mortgage or your student loans student loans should probably be your biggest priority to pay down with the mortgage deduction a 4 rate becomes effectively a 3.4 rate if you are in the 15 bracket but as low as 2.6 effective rate if you are in the 35 bracket both of these are lower than the 3.5 rate that you can get on the student loans after refinancing   this also assumes you are n't hit with the amt this is probably worth the cost of a quick consultation with a tax professional to go over these options and how they affect your taxes

how you answer is actually dependent on when they ask if it is early in the process the question answer is to determine the type of loan you are looking for auto loan home loan home improvement loans education loans all have products that are geared to those uses in many cases they will use the item you are purchasing as collateral for the loan in return for this they will offer you a low interest rate because they know they can protect their money be the collateral   for these standard loans they will ask for more specifics before they give a check for the money because they need to know exactly what you are spending the money on and they will need to file legal paperwork to protect their money if it is n't one of those standard loans then you are looking at a loan that is only backed by your signature that loan could have a high interest rate they are asking as part of the process of assessing their risk unless you are putting a lie on a form i am not sure being puts you in jeopardy   in some cases they do n't care people get lines of credit without knowing exactly what they are going to spend the money on

for those who are looking to improve credit for the sake of being able to obtain future credit on better terms i think a rewards credit card is the best way to do that i recommend that you only use as many cards as you need to gain the best rewards i have one card that gives 6 back on grocery purchases and i have another card that gives 4 back on petrol and 2 back on dining out both of those cards give only 1 back on all other purchases so i use a third card that gives 1.5 back across the board for my other purchases i pay all of the cards in full each month if there was a card that did n't give me an advantage in making my purchases i would n't own it i 'm generally frugal so i know that there is no psychological disadvantage to paying with a card you have to consider your own spending discipline when deciding whether paying with cards is an advantage for you in the end you should only use debt when you can pay low interest rates or as in the case of the cards above no interest at all in the case of the low interest debt it should be allowing you to make an investment that will pay you more by having it sooner than the cost of interest you might need a car to get to work but you probably do n't need a new car borrow as little as you can and repay your loans as quickly as you can debt can be a tool for your advantage but only if used wisely do n't be in by the temptation of something new and shiny now that you can pay for later

here 's the best explanation i found relating to why your t4 box 39 might not have an amount filled in even when box 38 has one department of finance explanatory notes relating to the income tax act it 's a long document but here 's the part i believe relevant with my emphasis employee stock options       paragraph is amended to include a requirement that the    employee exercise the employee ’s rights under the stock    option agreement and acquire the securities underlying the agreement    in order for the deduction in computing taxable income to be    available ensures that    only one deduction is available in respect of an employment benefit in other words if employee stock option rights are to an    employer for cash or an in kind payment then subject to new    and 1.2 the employer may deduct the payment    but the employee can not claim the stock option deduction conversely    where an employer issues securities pursuant to an employee ’s exercise    of stock options the employer can not deduct an amount in respect of    the issuance but the employee may be eligible to claim a deduction    under paragraph did you receive real shares based on your participation in the espp or did you get a cash payment for the net value of shares you would have been issued under the plan from what i can tell if you opted for a cash payment or if your plan only allows for such then the part i emphasized comes into play essentially if conditions were such that your employer could claim a deduction on their corporate income tax return for the compensation paid to you as part of the plan then you are not also able to claim a similar deduction on your personal income tax return the money received in that manner is effectively taxed in your hands the same as any bonus employment income would be i.e. it is n't afforded tax treatment equivalent to capital gains income your employer and/or espp administrator are best able to confirm the conditions which led to no amount in your box 39 but at least based on above you can see there are legitimate cases where box 38 would have an amount while box 39 does n't

what you have to remember is that options are derivatives of another asset like stocks for example   the price of the option is derived from the price of the underlying if the underlying is a stock for example as the price of the stock moves up and down during the trading day so will the market maker 's fair value for the option   as options are usually less liquid than the underlying stock market makers are usually more active in providing a market with options thus if you place a limit order half way between the current bid and ask and the underlying stock price moves towards your limit order the market maker will do their job and provide a market at that price thus executing your order

i would go with the family route if i was you and i think many other people would if they were fortunate to have such a great option   this will allow you to move faster when your trying to buy a new house because you can easily get a mortage if you see a stellar deal also you can establish credit in much cheaper ways than paying the 4 or so on a mortgage finance a car that you have the money to buy because the interest rates are much lower and you build the credit while paying less interest or even better try and make most of your purchases on a 0 fee credit card and every 6 8 months get a new credit card to have multiple lines of ongoing credit   to use the mortage to establish credit is nt worth the 4 hit in wealth that it offers now mind you if your options were to buy the house with your own money outright or get a mortgage i would say get the mortgage because the added leverage would help your investments beat the market most years figure if you get 6 an average portfolio each year and you can write off the taxes on your mortgage you will be ahead by more than 2

or you know going from to 50k because i got my degree was 100 worth the of debt i took out to fund myself spending 100k overall to get my wife and me through school bumped our pay by 40k a year    in honesty even a lot of risk averse people look at school and think it 's a great plan because by and large in demand degrees pay for themselves quickly when the economy is n't in a recession    edit to further clarify a lot of our debt was used for daycare and paying our mortgage and bills while we did school the tuition itself was almost entirely paid for through grants and scholarships it was n't like playing the lottery it was a and logical approach to handling our finances that led us both to agree that quitting work for a couple years was worthwhile and we had the credit and fico score to pull it off

i 'm not too familiar with the bank of england 's objectives but it seems similar to the fed 's qe program the interest rate the boe sets similar to the fed rate affects mainly the short term the left side of the interest rate statistics pages however in order to bring down intermediate and long term rates central banks will buy intermediate and long dated government and corporate bonds the government 's added demand will drive those bond prices up which will drive yields down   but like i said i 'm not too familiar with the boe 's bond purchasing program so i could be way off base here

let me make sure i understand the point of what adam smith is going on about in discussion of relative poverty he relates the idea that an individual can be considered in poverty if they do not meet the customary amount of goods considered by their society to be the minimum to be polite in public you have thus transferred his meaning of what poor means to be what is considered   basic living you have then taken this concept and tied the cost of basic living which you still have n't actually narrowed down towards the tax rate on income for a citizen of a community this is all in the context that you 're concerned with the community level of price for basic living and whether its too high however you also have n't said what too high is nor why you 're concerned with the literal price which is why i 've said you can only control the price of a good through central authority   i never made the assertion you wanted to invoke a centrally planned economy i simply stated that the only way to control prices across a community is through central authority you 've stated that we collect taxes on local state and federal levels this is true however it does not mean that they control the price they simply modify the price set by the market and only serve to increase the price from the base set by market participants    when i want to buy beer i do n't just pay for the cost of the beer i pay the cost of the beer + the city tax + county tax + state tax + state sales tax on the beer which raises the price also these taxes are not income taxes which is what was being discussed    i still do n't know what your point is because you can not seem to define phrases you 've used that i have stated i do not know if you can not define what you 're talking about how it relates to the actual discussion and why its relevant then please stop as its simply a

the is per year not per month so you will be getting about 1 k per year just for sitting around on your some important things it is almost certain that you can earn a better interest rate elsewhere if you are prepared to leave your 100 k untouched for example even in natwest you can earn 3.2 over the next year if you buy a fixed rate bond for 100 k that is certainly worth looking at or maybe put 90 k in a fixed rate bond and leave 10 k in an instant access account taxes should not be a problem since you can earn around 7 k before you start paying taxes however be aware that in the uk most bank accounts deduct tax at source that means they send the tax they think you should have paid to the government and you then have to claim it back from them accounts for young people may work differently ask your bank

you can rollover money from a 401(k to traditional ira and back to a 401(k there are likely account closure fees associated with this so it 's not completely free as long as you 're rolling from one tax deferred account to another there are no penalties the irs has a handy chart showing what accounts can roll where note starting next year you can only do one ira rollover per year the irs has additional general information on retirement account rollovers one additional comment on the concept of your money being locked into an ira generally you have far more options with an ira than a 401(k if you go with a large low cost provider like vanguard you 're likely to be much better off than in a small company 401(k that only offers costly funds that are likely selected primarily to benefit the administrator of the plan choose your ira provider and the investments with them wisely and leave that money there for a very long time

i have been a landlord in texas for just over 3 years now i still feel like a novice but i will give you the benefit of my experience if you are relying on rental properties for current income versus a long term return you are going to have to do a good job at shopping for bargains to get monthly cash flow versus equity growth that is locked up in the property until you sell it   if you want to pull a lot of cash out of a property on a regular basis you probably are going to have to get into flipping them which is decidedly not passive investing also it is easy to underestimate the expenses associated with rental properties texas is pretty landlord friendly legally however it does have higher than usual property taxes which will eat into your return also you need to factor in maintenance vacancy tenant turnover costs etc it can add up to a lot more than you would expect if you are handy and can do a lot of repairs yourself you can increase your return but that makes it less of a passive investment the two most common rules i have heard for initially evaluating whether an investment property is likely to be cash flow positive are the 1 and 50 rules the 1 rule says the expected monthly rent needs to be 1 or greater of the purchase price of the house so your hypothetical $ k scenario does n't pass that test some people say this rule is 2 for new landlords but in my experience you 'd have to get lucky in texas to find a house priced that competitively that did n't need a lot of work to get rents that high the 50 rule says that the rent needs to be double your mortgage payment to account for expenses you also have to factor in the hassle of dealing with tenants the following are not going to happen when you own a mutual fund but are almost inevitable if you are a landlord long enough for whatever reason you have to go to court and evict a tenant a tenant that probably lost their job or had major medical issues the tenant you ever met with the kids in the world that you are threatening to make homeless every fiber of your being wants to cut them some slack but you have a mortgage to pay and ca n't set an expectation that paying the rent on time is a suggestion not a rule or the tenant who seemed nice at first but now considers you the man decides to fight the eviction and wo n't move out you have to go through a court process then eventually get the sheriff to come out and forcibly remove them from the property which they are treating like crap because they are mad at you all the while not paying rent or letting you re let the place the tenant is n't maintaining the lawn and the hoa is getting on your butt about it do you pay someone to mow the grass for them and then try to squeeze the money out of the tenant who never agreed to pay for that   you rent to a college kid who has never lived on their own and has adopted you as their new parent figure the light in the closet went out can you come replace the bulb tenants flat out lying to your face of course i do n't have any pets that i did n't pay the deposit for pics all over facebook of their kids playing with a dog in the pet free house

surprisingly accurate are you in the industry i usually see wildly incorrect info about processing online i work in processing   only part not quite correct    gt;at the end of the day week whatever the processor collects money from the issuing financial institution and is responsible for giving the right amount less fees to the merchant   the acquiring bank processor actually fronts money to the merchant typically within 1 2 days the issuing bank later reimburses the acquiring bank processor less interchange fees the processor then deducts the interchange fee amount and their markup from the merchant 's account making themselves whole from the original money fronting and getting their profit   that 's why there 's risk to processors when it comes to chargebacks if a transaction is fraudulent the issuing bank is n't going to give them money for it but they 've already given money to the merchant so they need to be able to recoup it from the merchant or they 'll be out that money   but yeah definitely a service and it 's odd that people often argue that it is n't

first to mention one thing better analysis calls for analyzing a range of outcomes not just one assigning a probability on each and comparing the expected values then the choice based on risk tolerance but now just look at the outcome or scenario of 3 and time frame of 2 days let 's assume your investable capital is exactly $ 1000 multiply everything by 5 for $ 5,000 etc a. buy stock the value goes to 103 your investment goes to $ net return is $ 30 minus let 's say $ 20 commission you should compare these between brokers i use one that charges 9.99 plus a trivial government fee b. buy an call option at 100 for $ 0.40 per share with an expiration 30 days away december 23 this is a more complicated to evaluate this you need to estimate the movement of the value of a 100 call $ 0 in and out of the money 30 days remaining to the value of a 100 call $ 3 in the money 28 days remaining that movement will vary based on the volatility of the underlying stock an advanced topic but there are techniques to estimate that which become simple to use after you get the hang of it at any rate let 's say that the expected movement of the option price in this scenario is from $ 0.40 to $ 3.20 since you bought 2500 share options for $ 1000 the gain would be 2500 times 2.8 = 7000 c. buy an call option at 102 for $ per share with an expiration 30 days away december 23 to evaluate this you need to estimate the movement of the value of a 102 call $ 2 out of the money 30 days remaining to the value of a 102 call $ 1 in the money 28 days remaining that movement will vary based on the volatility of the underlying stock an advanced topic but there are techniques to estimate that which become simple to use after you get the hang of it at any rate let 's say that the expected movement of the option price in this scenario is from $ to $ 1.50 since you bought 8000 share options for $ 1000 the gain would be 8000 times = d. same thing but starting with a 98 call e. same thing but starting with a 101 call expiring 60 days out f. etc other option choices again getting the numbers right for the above is an advanced topic one reason why brokerages warn you that options are risky if you do your math wrong you can lose even doing that math right with a bad outcome loses anyway you need to score as many options as needed to find the optimal point but back to the first paragraph you should then run the whole analysis on a 2 gain or 5 or 5 in 4 days instead of 2 days do as many as are fruitful assess then pull the trigger and buy it try these techniques in simulation before diving in please one last point you do n't have to understand how to evaluate projected option price movements if you have software that   does that for you i 'll on that process except to mention it get the general idea edit p.s. i forgot to mention that brokers need love for handling options too check those commission rates in your analysis as well

yeah i mean it 's natural economics that jobs go to low wage countries so i guess i ca n't be mad at that but in addition there 's also a shift in debt from what was usually mortgages to student loan debt it 's not good because you 're no longer paying yourself as you did with a mortgage so money just gets burned you ca n't shed that debt ever    people frame it like a bubble but it 's more like a long term hamper on consumer spending imo if the fed wants to help the economy this would be the most effective bailout for lifting long term growth i do n't have any student debt and i still think this is probably one of the better answers

can everybody just sit back and grasp the concepts flying around this topic for a moment   the federal government wants to tell broadcasting networks what kind of compression chain to use for their commercials how the flying fuck does one comply with this kind of regulation will networks need to abandon hard limiting in favor of volume meaning the government will require networks to favor one brand of compression product creating an unfair competitive disadvantage for those companies who make simpler more reliable compression gear sans the algorithmic audio engines what constitutes a breach of said regulation how does the federal government measure compliance   if anybody could provide a source for the actual regulations from the fcc itself that would be great we should really be picking that apart as opposed to the dumbed down today show version of the regulation    but right now i see no way to combat the claim that this is a fucking idiotic and completely impractical legislation that no networks will actually comply with there 's just no way from my experience as a audio broadcasting engineer that this can be enforced if networks do comply voluntarily it will end up being an enormous burden both cost wise and to implement effectively    this seems like a gradual step towards regulating the dynamic levels on the side of the commercial developers themselves after the voting public forgets that the fcc implemented this regulation they 're going to say now that this is a matter of the federal government we need to control the commercial producers themselves because the previous efforts failed

a mutual fund could make two different kinds of distributions to you capital gains when the fund liquidates positions that it holds it may realize a gain if it sells the assets for a greater price than the fund purchased them for as an example for an index fund assets may get liquidated if the underlying index changes in composition thus requiring the manager to sell some stocks and purchase others mutual funds are required to distribute most of their income that they generate in this way back to its shareholders many often do this near the end of the calendar year   when you receive the distribution the gains will be categorized as either short term the asset was held for less than one year or long term vice versa based upon the holding period the gain is taxed differently currently in the united states long term capital gains are only taxed at 15 regardless of your income tax bracket you only pay the capital gains tax not the income tax short term capital gains are treated as ordinary income so you will pay your probably higher tax rate on any cash that you are given by your mutual fund you may also be subject to capital gains taxes when you decide to sell your holdings in the fund any profit that you made based on the difference between your purchase and sale price is treated as a capital gain based upon the period of time that you held the mutual fund shares it is categorized as a short- or long term gain and is taxed accordingly in the tax year that you sell the shares dividends many companies pay dividends to their stockholders as a way of returning a portion of their profits to their collective owners when you invest in a mutual fund that owns dividend paying stocks the fund is the owner that receives the dividend payments as with capital gains mutual funds will redistribute these dividends to you periodically often quarterly or annually the main difference with dividends is that they are always taxed as ordinary income no matter how long you or the fund have held the asset i 'm not aware of texas state tax laws so i ca n't comment on your other question

what 's the present value of using the payment plan in all common sense the present value of a loan is the value that you can pay in the present to avoid taking a loan which in this case is the lump sum payment of $   that rather the question is a trick providing irrelevant information about the stock market however if some strange interpretation is required which ignores the lump sum and wants to know how much you need in the present to pay the loan while being able to make 8 on the stock market that can be done i will initially assume that since the lender 's apr works out about 9.6 per month that the 8 from the stock market is also per month but will also calculate for 8 annual effective and an 8 annual nominal rate the calculation if you have $ x in hand present value and it is exactly enough to take the loan while investing in the stock market the value in successive months is $ x plus the market return less the loan payment   in the third month the loan is paid down so the balance is zero i.e. so the present value of using the payment plan while investing is $ you would need $ to cover the loan while investing which is more than the $ lump sum payment requires   therefore it would be advisable to make the lump sum payment because it is less expensive if you have $ in hand it would be best to pay the lump sum and invest the remaining $ in the stock market   otherwise you invest $ initially pay the loan and end up with $ 0 in three months one might ask what rate of return would the stock market need to yield to make it worth taking the loan the apr proposed by the loan can be calculated    the present value of a loan is equal to the sum of the payments discounted to present value   i.e. with   by induction   so by comparing the $ lump sum payment with $ 997 over 3 x monthly instalments the interest rate implied by the loan can be found solving for r if you could obtain per month on the stock market the $ x cash in hand required would be calculated by this is equal to the lump sum payment so the calculated interest is comparable to the stock market rate of return   if you could gain more than per month on the stock market it would be better to invest and take the loan recurrence form solving the recurrence form shows the calculation is equivalent to the loan formula e.g. becomes + 1 = 1 + y p where = pv where in the final month = 0 i.e. when m = 3 compare with the earlier loan formula s = d d 1 + r they are exactly equivalent which is quite interesting because it was n't immediately obvious to me that what the lender charges is the mirror opposite of what you gain by investing the present value can be now be calculated using the formula still assuming the 8 stock market return is per month if the stock market yield is 8 per annum effective rate and if it is given as a nominal annual yield 8 compounded monthly

you have a couple of options auto investing in an open end mutual fund   some companies may waive a minimum if you sign up for an automatic investing e.g. t. rowe price will waive its minimum if you agree to invest $ 100/month   there may be some lower ones out there as well some brokers like sharebuilder have programs where someone could auto invest getting fractional shares with each purchase   however something to consider is what percentage is it costing you to buy each time as it may be quite a bit of friction if you are paying $ 4 a purchase and only buying $ 40 this is 10 of your investment being eaten up in costs that i 'd highly advise taking the first option

except for one thing right now there is a large amount of speculation lots of numbers are inflated and then we have the high frequency traders this tax would make it harder to make money on nothing which is what they are doing currently personally i would be fine with it if the tax became exempt after say holding the stock for 3 6 12 months this tax also is n't about making money its about making the market more secure one of the downsides is that if all the major markets do n't commit to it it likely will hurt anyone that does

i think that a prepaid card would have more risk for loss than a traditional credit card   i 've had a various credit cards for about the last 20 years in all that time i have n't lost a penny due to fraud of course i 've had some fraudulent charges show up i 've had merchants charge too much and i 've had my card number stolen in every case my bank has been able to undo any damage and issue me a new card number if necessary i really do n't spend any time worrying about credit card security other than checking my statement each month security is the bank 's problem not mine   prepaid cards are often anonymous if you are using an anonymous card how can the bank verify that you are the owner of the card and that you did not make a certain charge i think with this type of card you are very much at risk for losing whatever you have loaded on the card to fraudulent charges

often you are right and the current information is priced in but i would say in times of market boom like this that the market can definitely price is driven by trades last trade someone may be willing to pay x and do so making the price now x but that does not mean it is worth x. you could very well be paying a premium for it 's perceived desirability this is why investors analysts spend time and energy on valuations they want to compare the markets current price to what the price theoretically should would be if it were purely driven by the data in effect trying to remove sentiment from the equation to gain a more realistic idea of what a company is worth   side note adding on that do n't mistake this as saying one should pay a lot of attention to analysts or their price targets though analysts do have insightful things to say

i think i may have figured this out but if someone could double check my reasoning i 'd appreciate it so if my company makes $ and i decide to pay myself a $ 30000 salary then the quarterly payment break down would be like this 1040es would pay income tax on non salary dividend $ 941 would pay income tax ss medicare on salary $ 30000 i 'm the only person on payroll so i think this answers my question in that after switching from filing as llc to s corp i wo n't have to pay as much on 1040es because some of it will now be covered on payroll

first off learn from this   never cosign again   there are plenty of other tales of woe outlined on this site that started and ended similarly secondly do what you can to get off of the loan   first i 'd go back to her dad and offer him $ 1000 to take you off the loan and sign over the car   maybe go up to $ 3000 if you have that much cash   if that does n't work go to the bank and offer them half of the loan balance to take you off   you can sign a personal loan for that amount maybe   whatever it takes to get off the loan   if she has a new bf offer him the same deal as the dad why do you have to do this   because you owned an asset that was once valued at 13 k and is valued at probably less than 4k.   given that you have a loan on it the leverage works against you causing you to lose more money   the goal now is to cut your losses and learn from your mistakes      i feel like the goal of your post was to make your ex gf look bad   it 's more important to do some self examination   if she was such a bad person why did you date her   why did you enter a business transaction with her   i 'd recommend seeking counseling on why you make such poor choices and to help you avoid them in the future along these lines i 'd also examine your goals in life   if your desire is to be a wealthy person then why would you borrow money to buy a car   seek to imitate rich people to become rich   picking the right friends and mates is an important part of this    if you do not have a desire to be a wealthy person what does it matter   losing 13 k over seven months is a small step in the right direction

thanks for your reply i had heard of utilitarian principles used to justify slavery and felt like a dick so i spent some time on wikipedia myself with it before replying   following quotes are from wikipedia unless stated otherwise   link gt is a theory in ethics holding that the proper course of action is the one that maximizes overall happiness   sounds reasonable   seems there are two schools of thought    maintains that an action is right if it utility   maintains that an action is right if it conforms to a rule that utility   it is something that has been criticized by both karl marx as well as pope john paul ii so it ca n't be all bad   and rule differ in how they treat human rights themselves under rule a human right can easily be considered a moral rule act on the other hand do not accept human rights as moral principles in and of themselves but that does not mean that they reject them altogether first most act as explained above would agree that acts such as and genocide always cause great and very little happiness second human rights could be considered rules of thumb so that although torture might be acceptable under some circumstances as a rule it is immoral and finally act often support human rights in a legal sense because support laws that cause more good than harm   i think the above means i would be a rule utilitarian if i was one   however the page linked to something else which is what i use in my decisions most of the time     theory in economics psychology philosophy mathematics and statistics is concerned with identifying the values uncertainties and other issues relevant in a given decision its rationality and the resulting optimal decision it is closely related to the field of game theory as to interactions of agents with at least partially conflicting interests whose decisions affect each other   however you brought up an excellent point if every relation is reduced to a balance sheet the world would be a sad place indeed i will think more deeply about the moral consequences of my thinking especially on the topic of healthcare since obviously i have not thought enough   your comment deeply appreciated

bargaining existed before the government officially granted people that right    collective bargaining is an ambiguous term that could refer to many concepts there is voluntarily agreed to collective bargaining which has nothing wrong with it and then there are laws that force the employer to collectively bargain with a union if a union requests it which is a mandate and violates the employer 's contract liberty   gt;however we 've been through that in this country and child labor unsafe working conditions and 80 hour weeks    i r business to this claim made by another redditor as well   gt;the prevalence of child labor was decreasing long before any law was created prohibiting it child labor is necessary in poor countries because people are far less productive per hour worked as productivity increases parents can afford to send their children off to school instead of working since their own work is enough to support the family   labor is something that needs to disappear on its own in response to changing economic conditions if you introduced a law prohibiting child labor in a poor country like cambodia right now it would lead to widespread hardship and an increase in mortality   gt;in other words no government mandate created due to union pressure can possibly lead to beneficial change since laws that limit people 's economic rights under the assumption that 51 knows what 's better for the minority than they themselves do generally do much more harm than good   nothing good comes for the country from using the threat of violence as all laws do to deny people a right to manage their own property how they see fit   gt;like all laws there is a balance to be struck between individual rights and the common good and what can be seen as a right for one can often be seen as a right to violate another 's rights for someone else   there is no game reason to assume or empirical evidence that suggests that violating people 's property ownership rights leads to a greater betterment of the common good than would have happened with property ownership rights intact   gt;&gt;the mighty is those who use the force of government or the threat of violence e.g. violent strikes to prevent another party from exercising their contract liberty and firing them   gt;this is some pretty extreme hyperbole and hard to take seriously   as history over the last century has shown it 's no hyperbole labor unions backed regulations soft socialism has succeeded in spite of the resistance of employers   membership in this country has dwindled to around 10 down from around 50 during the middle of the century and the erosion of the middle class has been the undeniable result   because unions have destroyed nearly every major industry where they had a natural tendency to form large scale capital intensive manufacturing operations where large numbers of workers were concentrated in one place    in no union dominated industries did unions fade due to greater power by employers vehicle manufacturing low value high volume consumer goods manufacturing ship building passenger rail service us steel in all of these industries the number of unionized employees declined because the industries themselves contracted in the us   the force of government you know we may have the right to strike in this country but there 's no law that says a company ca n't hire replacement workers indefinitely   the force of government prevents companies from refusing to collectively bargain with a labor union   of violence violent strikes this is a straw man if i 've ever seen one who is threatening violence here   this existed before government laws were created that made legal threats on behalf of employees that want to keep unionized employees employed and force companies to collectively bargain with a union   now of course the themselves are not directly threatening violence since they are backed by the force of government   when you look at the wealth disparity in this country it 's pretty hard to argue that the right to collective bargaining has resulted in an unfair advantage for workers   collectively bargaining does n't benefit workers in general it benefits in the short term those workers who are employed and unionized at the expense of long term wage growth and employment opportunities for the unemployed and non unionized employees

you can charge a fee to accept checks although i think the better solution might be to offer a small discount for early payment of your invoices   as some people here have suggested why not add a small bit to your fees to begin with to cover your inconvenience in the case they choose to pay by check    i often will give clients a small discount of 1.5 for paying my invoices within 10 days which does motivate some to pay sooner depending on the client and the amount of the invoice   if you 've already added a small amount to your fees in the first place then providing the discount is good public relations that does n't actually cost you anything you can always add a convenience fee for accepting checks but this is a more negative approach as though you 're penalizing the client for paying by check rather than electronically   some people do see it this way despite any efforts you make to explain otherwise as to your question about adding fees for accepting credit cards be very careful   there are sometimes state or local laws on this and you could find yourself in trouble very quickly if you run afoul of one   here 's a good article to read on the subject adding fees for accepting credit cards from site i hope this is helpful good luck

gt there are more types of ads than banner ads you see in the margins of websites and they ca n't be blocked by ad blockers its a huge industry saying it 's going to die is pretty naive   it 's difficult to formulate a polite response my message inbox is flooded with people who obviously have no idea what they 're talking about telling me about how my ad blockers are n't blocking the ads which i know they are blocking and this account is new which means i ca n't respond to everyone without waiting unreasonable numbers of minutes so i want to make one response that 's really good instead   i am willing to bet that i have more knowledge and experience with the internet technology and computers than everyone in this thread combined so you go on thinking i 'm naive or whatever but really you are the naive one for underestimating my expertise on the subject   i am absolutely aware of what sort of ads are blocked by my ad blockers and what sorts are nt i belong to the class of people who taught you all how to use this stuff all of the advertising that google and facebook use for their revenue is blocked when you pay for ads on reddit i do n't see those when you pay for adwords links on search engines i do n't see those when you pay for video ads on youtube content i do n't see those the only things that get through are things which can not be detected such as spam posts posing as real content but because i am a smart person i am capable of recognizing when an article is trying to sell me something that is what you are getting at unless you 're completely wrong and just being stupid but i 'm giving you the benefit of the doubt and while that tangent is true it 's irrelevant to the meat of the conversation which is that the traditional methods of advertising things like pay per click and number of impressions things like adwords and facebook 's boosted posts all of that is going away if you rely on those things for your revenue stream you better start looking for other sources of income today because in a few years those streams will be completely dried up   you can listen to me because i am an expert on this technology and this culture which i have been using for 26 years or you can convince yourself that you know better even tho we both know you do not i do n't know why it hurts your pride to get advice from someone who knows better than you but that 's my guess at why you and others are so defensive about this particular subject that and because it 's your bread and butter i 'm warning you now is the time to look for other income generators not 5 years from now when the entire advertising model is dead 5 years is a guess it could be sooner it could be later it will be   i suspect you 're also afraid that you wo n't be able to find a new revenue model but i think that fear is unfounded people are creative and have been inventing new ways to make money since money was invented i 'm telling you now is the time to do that you should be thanking me

did a great job highlighting the primary pros and cons of hsas so i wo n't go into detail there however i did want to point out another pro hsas are or can be easy to manage you said is this a better way to approach health care costs instead of itemizing health care expenses on yearly federal taxes i 'm not sure which company you are looking at establishing your hsa with but with mine i have a debit card that i use when paying for medical care and then at the end of the year i get a 1099-sa that provides the amount of money spent on qualified purchases that calendar year yes there are a few extra boxes i need to fill in for my 1040 come tax time but i do n't need to itemize my healthcare costs over the year it really is pretty simple and straightforward also one con that is worth noting is that you become much more sensitive to healthcare costs due to the high deductible healthcare plan an hsa requires for example in all the years we 've had an hsa we 've not yet met our deductible which means we pay out of pocket for any non routine doctor visits the health insurer pays 100 of routine visits like my wife 's annual well baby check ups for the little one and so on so when you 're feeling really sick and think a doctor 's visit would be warranted you have to make a decision after being faced with this decision a time or two you will start to envy those who have just a $ 20 copay of course that 's just an emotional con each year i run the numbers on how much we spent per year on out of pocket plus premiums and compare it to what it would cost in premiums for an type plan and the hsa plan always comes ahead in part because we are a pretty healthy family and i work for myself so do not get to enjoy group discount rates but i thought it worth mentioning because there are certainly times when i know i need to see a doctor or specialist and i cringe because i know i am going to be slapped with a big bill in the not too distant future

there are two obvious cases in which your return is lower with a heavily leveraged investment if a $ 100,000 investment of your own cash yields $ 1000 that 's a 1 return if you put in $ 50,000 of your own money and borrow $ 50,000 at 2 you get a 0 return after factoring in the interest as above if you buy an investment for $ 100,000 and it loses $ 1000 that 's a -1 return if you borrow $ 100,000 and buy two investments and they both lose $ 1000 that 's a -2 return

bull means the investor is betting on a rising market puts are a type of stock option where the seller of a put option promises to buy 100 shares of stock from the buyer of the put option at a pre agreed price called the strike price on any day before expiration day   the buyer of the put option does not have to sell it is optional that s why it is called buying an option   however the seller of the put is required to make good on their promise to the buyer the broker can require the seller of the put option to have a deposit called margin to help make sure that they can make good on the promise    profit the buyer can profit from the put option if the stock price moves down substantially    the buyer of the put option does not need to own the stock he can sell the option to someone else   if the buyer of the put option also owns the stock the put option can be thought of like an insurance policy on the value of the stock   the seller of the put option profits if the stock price stays the same or rises   basically the seller comes out best if they can sell put options that no one ends up using by expiration day a spread is an investment consisting of buying one option and selling another let 's put bull and put and spread together with an example from apple so if you believed apple inc. aapl currently was going up or staying the same through jan you could sell the 600 jan put and buy the 550 put   if the price rises beyond 600 your profit would be the difference in price of the puts   let 's explore this a little deeper prices from google finance 31 oct 2012 worst case   aapl drops below 550   the bull put spread investor owes 600 shares = $ 5000 in jan but received $ for taking this risk edit 2016 the worst case was the outcome in this example the aapl stock price on options expiry jan 18 2013 was about $ net profit = $ $ 5,000 = = loss of $ best case   aapl stays above 600 on expiration day in jan net profit = $ 0 = $ break even   if aapl drops to the value of the 600 jan aapl put sold will equal the $ collected and the bull put spread investor will break even commissions have been ignored in this example

assuming you are referring to macro corrections and crashes as opposed to technical crashes like the flash crash it is certainly possible to sell stocks during a market drop by definition the market is dropping not only because there are a larger number of sellers but more importantly because there are a large number of transactions that are driving prices down in fact volumes are strongly correlated with volatility so volumes are actually higher when the market is going down dramatically you can verify this on yahoo or google finance pick a liquid stock like spy and look at 2008 vs recent years that does n't say anything about the kind of selling that occurs though with respect to your question what s the best strategy for selling stocks during a drop it really depends on your objective you can generally always sell at some price that price will be worse during market crashes beyond the obvious fact that prices are declining spreads in the market will be wider due to heightened volatility many people are forced to sell during crashes due to external and or psychological pressures and sometimes selling is the right thing to do but the best strategy for long term investors is often to just hold on

a subsidy is a payment made by a group usually the state to individuals or corporations in order to shift the balance if the rational economic decision for the individual would be detrimental to the group as a whole otherwise for example if there are different quality kinds of crops that can be planted for example a gm that brings in high yields but can only be processed to high corn syrup or a naturally bred corn that brings lower yields but tastes well enough for direct consumption then if demand for both exceeds supply the economic choice for the individual farmer is to plant the former if the claims that contribute to obesity are founded then it is in the public interest to produce less of it and more alternative foods given that a market rather than a planned economy is desired this can not be achieved by decree but rather money is used as an incentive in the long term this investment may very well pay off through reduced health care costs so it is a rational economic decision from the state 's point of view in a world where all actors make decisions that are fully in their self interest in principle subsidies would not be needed as consumers would demand healthy rather than cheap foods and market mechanisms would provide these

i think swenson 's insight was that the traditional recommendation of 60 stocks plus 40 bonds has two serious flaws 1 you are exposed to way too much risk by having a portfolio that is so strongly tied to us equities especially in the way it has historically been recommend 2 you have too little reward by investing so much of your portfolio in bonds if you can mix a decent number of asset classes that all have equity like returns and those asset classes have a low correlation with each other then you can achieve equity like returns without the equity like risk this improvement can be explicitly measured in the sharpe ratio of you portfolio the vanguard risk factor looks pretty and lame to me the book the the ivy portfolio does a great job at covering the swenson model and explains how to reasonably replicate it yourself using low fee etfs

it can be difficult when all your disposable income is spoken for   your options depend on how good your credit is and how flexible your expenses are   i do n't have all the answers without more details possibly not then   however couple of points of advice paying off that credit card debt and not adding any more to it is your 1 priority   you should make minimum payments to every other debt until you have done that because the interest on it will kill you in the mean time   it is always optimal to pay the maximum to your highest interest debt and minimum to all other debts 11 does n't sound very good on your house loan   you may want to consider refinancing   that is if you can get a lower rate   you may also want to get a longer term loan if you have enough discipline to use the extra income to actually pay off your credit card and then the put it toward the house when the cards are paid off look at options to increase your income at least temporarily   second jobs and such   when your finances are more in order you can back off the debt trap is behavioral   we humans tend to increase our spending until we ca n't any more   but the reason we ca n't spend any more is that we have increased our debt until we have no flexible income   then we are stuck for a long time and have few options the only way out long term is to change our habits so that we do n't increase spending each time we pay down a debt or get an increase to our income   financial discipline is the only way to have financial security   almost always the first step is to pay off credit cards and stop maintaining a balance always pay off every card at the end of each month   then start paying off other debts from highest interest rate to lowest this is a hard challenge and one most of us face at some point in our lives   good luck

in this case she had claimed that remaining in would result in from because her husband had hidden in rather than join the army in fact he had served in the army   but the point here is that this was a lie made during the immigration process not the naturalization process during the naturalization process she claimed that she had never given false information to a government official during immigration proceedings of course this was also a lie and hence a crime under 18 u. s. c. 1015   but now there ’s a question does having lied about lying constitute procuring naturalization contrary to law   the supreme court says not on its own specifically   u. s. c. most naturally read strips a person of citizenship not when she committed any illegal act during the naturalization process but only when that act played some role in her naturalization   gt   gt;when the underlying illegality alleged in a prosecution is a false statement to government officials a jury must decide whether the false statement so altered the naturalization process as to have influenced an award of citizenship    now it ’s entirely possible that the lie in this case meets that requirement the court ’s decision however is based on the fact that the jury did not make such a determination rather they were instructed that any lie would be grounds for a guilty verdict hence the court determined that   was not convicted by a properly instructed jury of contrary to law her naturalization

i 'm going to answer your questions out of order emergency fund depending on how conservative you are and how much insurance you have you may want anywhere from 3 12 months of your expenses on hand i like to keep 6 months worth liquid in a high yield savings account for your current expenses that would be $ 24k but when this transaction completes you will have a mortgage payment which usually includes home owners insurance and property taxes in addition to your other expenses so a conservative guess might be an additional $ 3k month or a total of $ 42k for six months of expenses so $ for an emergency fund depending on how conservative you are personally down payment you should pay no less than 20 down $ 150k on a loan that size particularly since you can afford it my own philosophy is to pay as much as i can and pay the loan off as soon as possible but there are valid reasons not to do that if you can get a higher rate of return from that money invested elsewhere you may wish to keep a mortgage longer and invest the other money elsewhere mortgage term a 15-year loan will generally get you the best interest rate available if you paid $ 400k down financing $ 350k at a 3.5 rate your payment would be about $ 2500 on a 15-year loan that does n't include property taxes and home owners insurance but without knowing precisely where you live i have no idea whether those would keep you inside the $ 3000 of additional monthly home expenses i mentioned above when discussing the emergency fund that 's how i would divide it up i 'd also pay more than the $ 2500 toward the mortgage if i could afford to though i 've always made that decision on a monthly basis when drawing up the budget for the next month

in double entry bookkeeping no transaction is ever negative you only deal in positive numbers we simulate negative numbers by calling numbers debits and credits where one is the negative of the other only a balance can be negative in this case income is a credit account that means that things that increase your balance are credits and things that reduce your balance are debits so a gift from grandma is a credit it 's a positive number and you write it in the credit column you pretty much never subtract from income except to correct a mistake assets like a checking account are debit accounts increases are debits and decreases are credits you routinely have both debits and credits on a checking account i.e. you put money in and you take money out every transaction affects at least two accounts one with a debit and one with a credit so in this case the gift from grandma credits income and debits checking buying food credits checking and debits expenses

for cross border transactions like this you should really take advice from an accountant or lawyer who specialises in them because there may be tax treaties between the two that complicate the situation however in general borrowing money does n't have tax implications in itself and there 's no limit as such you do need to consider the following points if this is zero or less than you could plausibly get commercially your friend is effectively giving you the difference between the interest rates if your friend in korea has a connection to the us she or he may be subject to the gift tax in practice this only matters if the total amount of gifts they give to anyone over their lifetime plus the size of their estate over their lifetime is large non us persons are exempt though if the amounts are large enough they may need to be reported financial institutions are generally required to report large international transactions typical thresholds are around $ 10,000 for scrutiny by the government in case the transaction is related to something illegal this should n't be a problem in itself but you should be aware it 'll happen it should n't make any difference how you transfer the money but it would be wise to get as much documentation as possible in case of later questions the best place to get further advice would be the us bank you 'll be transferring the money into initially this is really a question for a lawyer given the cross border nature of the transaction but you and your friend should sign a contract specifying how and when the loan will be repaid your friend should also consider setting up the loan as a mortgage and taking a charge on your home even if your friend trusts you a charge on the home will protect him or her in the event of you having financial problems and another creditor laying claim to the home

what are pivot points pivot points indicate price levels that are of significance in technical analysis of securities pivot points are used to provide clarity for a trader as they are a predictive indicator of where a security might go there are at least 6 different types of pivot points pivot point fibonacci pivot etc and they are different based on their formulas but generally serve the same concept i will be answering your question using the pivot point formula pivot point formula generally any pivot point formula uses a combination of the open high low and close of the previous timeframe since you are technically a swing trader indicated by   say between a couple of days to a couple of weeks as i do n't want to    do day trading you should use a weekly 5 to 30 minute chart but you can also use a daily chart as well so for example if you use a daily chart you would use the open high low and close of the previous day example of fictitious stock money stack exchange open high low close 11.50 on level level r2 level level pivot point s1 level s2 level s3 level s4 level r = resistance s = support   how to identify these pivot points most charting software already have built in that will identify the pivot points for you but you can always find and draw them yourself with an tool since we are using the pivot point formula the important pivot point levels are the which is considered as the breakout pivot the s4 which is considered as the breakdown pivot and s3 are reversal pivot points once identify the pivot points how should you proceed in a trade this is the million dollar question and without spoon feeding you requires you to come up with your own strategy to distinguish yourself from being a novice and pro trader is to have a strategy in a trade now i do n't really have the time to look for actual charts to provide examples with but generally this is what you should look for to proceed in a trade potential buy short signals potential sell signals if a stock moves above the level but then crosses below it this would be a sell signal this is confirmed when their is a lower lower then the candle that first crosses below it sell a stock when s4 level is confirmed see above for the confirmation other useful tips use the pivot point as your support or resistance the pivot point levels can be used for your stop loss for example with an s3 reversal buy signal the s4 should be used as a stop loss conversely the pivot point levels can also be used for your target prices for example with an s3 reversal buy signal you should take some profits at level you should also use a combination of other indicators to give you more information to confirm if a signal is correct examples of a good combination is the rsi macd and moving averages read that book in my comment above

another disadvantage is the inability to value commodities in an accounting sense in contrast with stocks bonds and real estate commodities do n't generate cash flows and so any valuation methodology is by definition speculative but as notes there are diversification advantages the returns for gold for instance tend to exhibit low negative correlation with the performance of stocks the question is whether the diversification advantage which is the primary reason to hold commodities in a multi asset class portfolio through time the disadvantages the answer maybe

policy aimed at promoting economic opportunity for poor children must be framed within three stark realities    first many poor children come from families that do not give them the kind of support that middle class children get from their families   second as a result these children enter far behind their more advantaged peers and on average never catch up and even fall further behind    third in addition to the education deficit poor children are more likely to make bad decisions that lead them to drop out of school become teen parents join gangs and break the law   let politicians and administrators community leaders ministers and parents drill into children the message that in a free society they enter adulthood with three major responsibilities at least finish high school get a full time job and wait until age 21 to get married and have children

i was told if i moved my 401k into a roth ira that school purposes is one reasons you can withdraw money without having to pay a tax incorrect   you will need to pay tax on the amount converted since a 401(k is pre tax and a roth ira is after tax   it will be added to your regular income so you will pay tax at your marginal tax rate is there any hidden tax or fee at all for withdrawing money from a roth ira for educational purposes   you still will need to pay the tax on the amount converted but you 'll avoid the 10 penalty for early withdrawal i know that tuition books and fees are covered for educational purposes can i take out of my roth ira for living expenses while i 'm attending school rent gas food etc room and board yes so long as you are half time but not gas food   possibly only room and board for staying on campus but i 'm not certain although i doubt you could call your normal house payment education expense with my 401k being smaller would it just be better to go ahead and cash the whole thing and just pay the tax and use it for whatever i need it for what is the tax if i just decide to cash the whole thing in   you pay your marginal tax rate plus a 10 penalty for early withdrawal   so no this is probably not a wise move financially unless you 're on the verge of bankruptcy or foreclosure where distress costs are much higher then the 10 penalty i ca n't answer the other questions regarding grants i would talk to the financial aid department at your school bottom line transferring your 401(k is very likely a bad idea unless you can afford to pay the tax in cash meaning without borrowing   my advice would be to leave your 401(k alone it 's meant for retirement not for school or living expenses ideally you should pay for as much as you can out of cash flow and do n't take out more student loans that may mean taking fewer classes getting another part time job finding a different cheaper school applying for more grants and scholarships etc   i would not in any circumstance cash out your 401(k to pay for school   you 'll be much worse off in the long run and there are much cheaper ways to get money

banks are businesses and as such should have the right to refuse service so they should probably be able to choose one customer over another at will    i say should because business owners protecting themselves against litigation related to discrimination could restrict their freedom as business owners however banks are businesses and if the customers are identical both will be approved or not according to credit records   does not make sense to approve one person with a given credit record and refuse someone with a similar record   unless they barely qualify   since no two credit histories are identical there are surely edge cases finally if a customer is a long term customer with large deposits and/or significant amounts of business with the bank the bankers will likely be inclined to do more business

a loan from a bank with no real purpose could be a bad idea and end up costing you more money than it needs to as someone with a loan and credit card debts accrued over university i would say avoid it if at all possible certainly do n't sign up to a large loan if you have no current plans for the money car house repair etc it sounds as though you 're fairly careful with your money but just want a bit of extra security in case a purchase you did n't account for slips by if this is the case and you 're set on obtaining a source of credit i 'd suggest getting an overdraft if you have n't already overdrafts are a lot more flexible and are better for short term debt that you plan to pay off immediately such as unexpected charges coming in at the end of the month   it 's worth mentioning that this is from the perspective of a uk banking customer overdraft conditions will vary depending on the country

another suggestion i heard on the radio was to give the child the difference between the name brand they want and the store brand they settle on   then that money can be accumulated as savings saving money is as important a feature of the family economy as earning money be careful with what you have a child do for reward vs what you have them do as a responsibility   do n't set a dangerous precedent that certain work does not need to be done unless compensation is on the table   you might have a child who relies on external motivations only to do things which can make school work and future employment hard i would instead have my child do yard work but while doing it explain opportunity costs of doing the work yourself vs hiring out   i would show my kid how saving money earns interest and how that is essentially free money

insert usual disclaimer that i 'm just a random guy on the internet not any kind of certified tax professional but once i withdraw the money how is that money taxable if i 'm understanding your situation correctly you want to look at the instructions for form 8889 under excess employer contributions it simply says if the excess was not included in income on form w-2 you must report it as other income on your tax return there does n't look to be any particular wording beyond that so i 'd just put it on form 1040 line 21 other income and label the line really specifically like excess employer contributions distributed from hsa also there is no mention of whether any fica taxes social security and medicare apply to these amounts you say that this was entirely contributed by the employer but even for cases where one contributes directly through payroll with an optional pre tax deduction this is usually implemented as a salary reduction agreement where the company is actually paying less money in salary and thus less showing up on the w-2 and just contributing to the hsa account instead it 's listed on the 8889 as an employer contribution even if in fact one sees it as a deduction on one 's pay stub in either case since the company did n't pay you the money as salary and merely contributed to the hsa instead i would n't expect any fica taxes to be owed on it the fact that the irs wants it listed under other income instead of wages also implies to me that it does n't count as salary that needs fica taxes presumably if people abused this in some way like getting their employer to deliberately over contribute each year and getting a refund in some sort of crazy scheme to try to reduce their ss taxes the government would get rather upset and probably call it some sort of tax evasion but for the amounts involved here particularly as you 're following the instructions listed i just would n't worry about it assuming that i withdraw excess contribution and report everything on form 8889 and form 1040 is there any further action required from my previous employer it 's your hsa so i would n't think so since the eligibility for hsas is based on what you do and not what they do you could for instance get covered by a different hdhp and they would n't be notified nor really care i do n't think they have anything more to do with it also i am not sure how to calculate amount of interest attributable to excess contribution i have only around $ 0.20 of total interest this year the bank holding the hsa could probably help with that as i 'd expect it to be a normal part of the excess contribution withdrawal process if not i 'd just make a reasonable effort based on the interest rate amount involved and number of days that the excess was in the account also keep in mind that in general when filing taxes anything under $ can round to $ 0 at some point one can only be as honest as the law allows

the same applies if you were looking for a business to buy would you pay more for a business that is doing well making increasing profits year after year or for a business that is not doing so well and is losing money a share in a company is basically a small part of a company which a shareholder can own so would you rather own a part of a company that is increasing profits year after year or one that is continuously losing money someone would buy shares in a company in order to make a better return than they could make elsewhere they can make a profit through two ways first a share of the company 's profits through dividends and second capital gains from the price of the shares going up why does the price of the shares go up over the long term when a company does well and increases profits because when a company increases profits they are making more and more money which increases the net worth of the company more investors would prefer to buy shares in a company that makes increasing profits because this will increase the net worth of the company and in turn will drive the share price higher over the long term a company 's increase in profits creates higher demand for the company 's shares think about it if interest rates are so low like they are now where it is hard to get a return higher than inflation why would n't investors then search for higher returns in good performing companies in the stock market more investors and traders wanting some of the pie creates higher demand for good performing stocks driving the share price higher the demand for these companies is there primarily because the companies are increasing their profits and net worth so over the long term the share price will increase in line with the net worth over the short to medium term other factors can also affect the share price sometime opposite to how the company is actually performing however this is a whole different answer to a whole different question

there are two types of 529 programs   one where you put money aside each month the one offered by your state may give you a tax break on you deposits you can pick the one from any state if you like their options better during the next 18 years the focus the investment changes from risky to less risky to no risk this happens automatically the money can be used for tuition room board books fees the 2nd type of 529 is also offered by a state but it is geared for a big lump sum payment when the child is young this will cover full tuition and fees not room and board or books at a state school the deal is not as great if they child wants to go out of state or you move or they want to go to a private school you do n't lose everything but you will have to make up the shortfall at the last minute there are provisions for scholarship money if you kid goes to west point you have n't wasted the money in the 529 the money in either plan is ignored while calculating financial aid other options such as the coverdell education savings account also exist but they do n't have the options and state tax breaks accounts in the child 's name can impact the amount of financial aid offered plus they could decide to spend the money on a car the automatic investment shift for most of the state 529 plans does cover your question of how much risk to take there are also ways to transfer the money to other siblings if one decides not to go to college keep in mind that the funds do n't have to be spent as soon as they turn 18 they can wait a few years before enrolling in college

stop order is shorter term for stop loss order   the point being that is intended as a protective measure   a buy stop order would be used to limit losses when an investor has sold a stock short   meaning that they have borrowed stock and sold it in hopes that they can take advantage of a decline in the stock 's price by replacing the borrowed stock later at a cheaper price   the idea is to limit losses due to a rising stock price   meanwhile a sell stop order would be used to limit losses on a stock that an investor actually owns by selling it before the price declines further the important thing to keep in mind about stop orders is that they turn into market orders when the stop price is reached   this means that they will be filled at the best available price when the order is actually executed   in fast moving markets this can be a price that is quite different from the stop price a limit order allows an investor to ensure that they do not buy sell a stock at more less than the specified amount the thing to keep in mind is that a limit order is not guaranteed to execute a stop limit order is a combination of a stop loss order and limit order in that it becomes a limit order instead of a market order when the stop price is reached links to definitions stop order stop limit order limit order market order

generally i would say that you should pay it off if you have the money available why pay interest if you have the money that is of course if your money can earn you more than the interest you pay which can happen if you got a very low apr for your car loan but then you probably have excellent credit already and should n't care about the history of the loan on your report re the 7 years vs 2 years to the best of my knowledge its not true it will stay 7 years even if its closed during the first year

you 're on the right track with buying but letting your current cars get repossessed is a bad idea for the reasons you specified first find an insurance broker instead of an insurance agent a broker works with dozens of companies many of which you may not have heard of he is in a better position to find you the best deal than you are because he is familiar with more insurance company products than you are he does n't charge you extra for this service second ask your insurance broker if he can find any insurers offering discounts for persons who have passed a driver training course find an accredited course and determine pricing if the savings exceed the cost of the course take the course   third if you have outstanding loans on your vehicles pay them off and sell the cars replace them with vehicles you can purchase outright with cash make sure you have enough money to replace them again should another accident happen    once you have vehicles that are free there is no longer a requirement by the lender for you to have insurance for the replacement value of the vehicle which is what 's killing your rates right now find out what the minimum legal requirement for auto insurance is in your state in canada the minimum requirement is $ 100,000 liability anything else is either a sales job or a lender requirement getting your wife to insure her own vehicle may help getting your insurance under her name may also be something to look into since you seem to have issues with people bumping into you and there have been no medical issues $ 100,000 liability may be all you need note tactic 3 is not without risk if you are in an at fault accident you will have to pay for any damages exceeding your insured limit out of your own pocket any damages to your own vehicle whether at fault or not will have to be paid out of your own pocket if you are sued for medical expenses incurred by other parties you 'll have to pay anything over and above your insured limit out of your own pocket   if there is anything you are unclear about on your insurance policy ask your agent broker to explain until you do understand buying auto insurance without fully understanding what you are paying for is another risk

the 200 k vehicle is likely the better deal   get your own mechanic to check it out   if it does n't have major issues it will likely cost you less why   because you 've wisely included $ 6000 in expected maintenance   yet it has the possibility of not needing more than $ 500 of maintenance during the 4 years you plan on owning it   it 's a gamble but you have the chance to save $ 5500 of that estimated cost with that vehicle note that you will also need to factor in tires for either vehicle unless that is included in your maintenance estimate

credit risk and insurance risk are highly correlated for a single legal party   trouble with one could indicate trouble with another any increase in credit risk such as new borrowing will be perceived to be an increased likelihood of insurance risk manifested as a fraudulent or subconsciously induced claim   any claim of insurance will be perceived to be an increased likelihood of default manifested as a default voluntary or not to a creditor insurer only the law applies therefore private arrangements between the borrower insured and third parties do not factor because the creditor insurer has no hope of recourse against such third parties in most places around the world regardless of whether there is a price ceiling on compensation for damages to assets limiting an insurers costs if a risk is realized then it can be presumed through sequential sampling as well as other reliable statistical techniques that future risk has risen   the aforementioned risk dominoes subsequently fall generally speaking the lower one 's financial variance the lower the financial costs   in other words uncertainty can be mostly quantified with variance and other mathematical moments as well   any uncertainty is a cost to a producer thus a cost to the consumer   a consumer who is perfectly predictable with good outcomes will pay much lower costs on average than not so one who keeps a tight financial ship not exposing oneself to financial risks and better yet not realizing financial risks will see less financial variance thus will enjoy lower costs to financing which includes insuring

that 's because ford like many other managers of large defined benefit plans decided that instead of its obligations through an effective wiki they would just put less money into equities and pray for the equity risk premium to carry the day for them   lo and behold it did n't work for a lot of them   in the meantime their liabilities began to far outstrip the assets meant to offset them to the point where even a one for one asset liability match would n't help   so now guess what   they tell you shit we fucked this up so here 's your payout good luck   as if the worker is going to have a clue as to how to effectively manage his money so as to minimize longevity and savings risk   let me make something clear   it is not beyond the means of modern finance to effectively implement and administer a defined benefit program   it involves doing the right thing by employees which in some cases involves not taking risks with equity and instead simply ensuring that assets meant to offset liabilities are appropriate in both timing and magnitude

couple of points about being a consultant in the us it sounds like the rules for what you can deduct may be more lax in italy   for example you can deduct a certain percentage of your home for work but the rules are relatively strict on your use of that space and how much is deductible   also things like clothes restaurants phones car use etc must follow irs guidelines to be deductible   this often means they are used exclusively for work and are required for work   a meal you eat by yourself is not generally deductible for example   any expense you would have had anyway if you were not working is generally not deductible a contractor in the us can organize in various ways including sole proprietorship an s corp and a c corp   each has different tax and regulatory implications   in the simple case of a sole proprietorship one must pay not only regular income tax but also self employment tax which is the part of social security and medicare tax normally paid for by one 's employer   estimated taxes must be paid to the government quarterly and then the actual amount due up at the end of the year with the government sending you the difference or vice versa generally speaking contractors may set aside more money pre tax for retirement and have better investment options   this is because solo 401(k retirement accounts are cost effective and flexible and the contractor can set aside the full $ 18 k pre tax as well as having the company contribute generously pre tax to the retirement account   contractors can also easily employ spouses and set aside even more the details of how frequently you are paid as a contractor and how much notice if any the company must give you before terminating your relationship are negotiated between you and the company and are generally pretty flexible   you could get paid your whole year salary in a lump sum if you wanted   the company that is paying you will not normally give you any benefits whatsoever in this way it is the same situation as it is in italy by the way the three points you mention in your edit are definitely not true in the us

when you want to short a stock you are trying to sell shares that you are borrowing from your broker therefore you need buyers for the shares you are selling   the ask prices represent people who are trying to sell shares and the bid prices represent people who are trying to buy shares using your example you could put in a limit order to short sell 1000 shares at $ meaning that your order would become the ask price at $   there is an ask price ahead of you for 500 shares at $ 3.00   so people would have to buy those 500 shares at $ 3.00 before anyone could buy your 1000 shares at $ but it 's possible that your order to sell 1000 shares at $ never gets filled if the buyers do n't buy all the shares ahead of you   the price could drop to $ 1.00 without hitting $ and you will have missed out on the trade if you really wanted to short 1000 shares you could use a market order   let 's say there 's a bid for 750 shares at $ 2.50 and another bid for 250 shares at $   if you entered a market order to sell 1000 shares your order would get filled at the best bid prices so first you would sell 750 shares at $ 2.50 and then you would sell 250 shares at $ i was just using your example to explain things   in reality there wo n't be such a wide spread between the bid and ask prices   a stock might have a bid price of $ 10.50 and an ask price of $ so there would only be a 1 cent difference between putting in a limit order to sell 1000 shares at $ and just using a market order to sell 1000 shares and getting them filled at $ 10.50 also your example probably would n't work in real life because brokers typically do n't allow people to short stocks that are trading under $ 5 per share as for your question about how often you are unable to make a short sale it can sometimes happen with stocks that are heavily shorted and your broker may not be able to find any more shares to borrow also remember that you can only short stocks with a margin account you can not short stocks with a cash account

i 'm not a big fan of tax advantaged retirement accounts the rules on tax advantages accounts can change at any time   it 's already painful to get money out before retirement earnings or possibly contributions taxed as current income plus 10 penalty   the rules could get worse there 's also the assumption that your taxes will be lower when you retire   i think this is a poor assumption if you get free money from your employer for contribution to a 401(k contribute up to what will get you all of the free money you can   otherwise pay your taxes and keep control of your assets so short answer keep as much as you can out of tax advantaged accounts unless you 're turning down free money to do so

over time gold has mainly a hedge against inflation based on its scarcity value that is unless finds some killer app for it that would also make it a good investment the usual ones electronic medicine dental do n't really do the trick it should be noted that gold performs its inflation hedge function over a long period of time say $ 50-$100 years   over shorter periods of time it will spike for other reasons the latest classic example was in 1979 80 and the main reason in my opinion was the iranian hostage crisis inflation was secondary this was a political risk situation but one that was not an attack on 52 u.s. no less was an attack on the u.s. dollar but gold got so pricey that it lost its inflation hedge function for some two decades until about 2000 inflation has not been a notable factor in 2011 but political risk has been witness egypt libya and potentially syria and other countries put another way gold is less of an investment that a hedge and not just against inflation

the gramm leach bliley act was not repealed it was approved i think you mean that the gramm leach bliley act among other things repealed what was left of the act of 1933 there was another by the same name on   the issue is that regulations are enacted and some are repealed the result during each of the last decades and by a big margin has been an increase of the regulations and as i said by a big big margin the of de regulation is just political it has not happened just check the government data   now it can happen that some regulations do nt matter much and some others matter a lot so checking the number or size of the regulations while it describes a tendency can also be deceiving but again since the debate over de regulation is political they only focus on slogans and not on real   so going back to the particular regulation you mention the removal of glass act was positive if it had not been removed the crisis would have been far worse if you are interested we can discuss why i already wrote enough for one comment

there is now a large body of evidence to support the persistence of neurocognitive impairment lasting from hours to weeks it is important to note that in repeated studies subjects who reported a marijuana high were most likely or most profoundly affected by the drug this supports the link between thc concentration and neurocognitive dysfunction residual effects however continued in subjects who no longer felt the drug 's effect thus subjective return to baseline mental status may not ensure full return of neurocognitive     considerable research into the functional and judgment effects of marijuana smoking has been conducted in the context of transportation safety research demonstrates that acute cannabis consumption is associated with an increased risk of a motor vehicle crash and especially for fatal

i would like to add that from my own research a pro to leasing over buying a new vehicle would be that with the lease the entire 7,500 federal incentive is applied directly to the lease or so they say if you buy a new car you get a 7,500 federal tax incentive also but if you do nt have 7,500 bucks in taxes this wo nt be as much value it does n't sense to me to buy used since you do nt get the tax incentive and also if you 're in california the 2,500 rebate only applies to buying new or leasing 30 month or longer

conservative = on the side of a higher ev to the business because if you 're someone looking to acquire the business for example and let 's say we 're talking about a business that has debt which trades at a discount it 's more conservative to assume that the debt ca n't necessarily be restructured   to use an extreme example as you 're valuing the business would it be conservative or aggressive to assume that the debt got magically wiped out altogether so that 's why i 'm saying that it 's more conservative to use the book value of the debt

diversifying but is n't that what mutual funds already do they diversify and reduce stock specific risk by moving from individual stocks to many stocks but you can diversify even further by selecting different fund types e.g. large cal small cap income bond funds international etc   your target date fund probably includes a few different types already and will automatically reallocate to less risky investments as you get close to the target date i would look at the fees of different types of funds and compare them to the historical returns of those funds   you can also use things like morningstar and other ratings as guides but they are generally very large buckets and may not be much help distinguishing between individual funds so to answer the question yes you can diversify further and probably get better returns and lower fees that a target date fund   the question is is it worth your time and effort to do so   you 're obviously comfortable investing for the long term so you might get some benefit by spending a little time looking for different funds to increase your diversification note that etfs do n't really diversify any differently than mutual funds they are just a different mechanism to invest in funds and allow different trading strategies trading during the day derivatives selling short etc

one way to look at insurance is that it replaces an unpredictable expenses with a predictable fees that is you pay a set monthly amount premium instead of the sudden costs associated with a collision or other covered event insurance works as a business which means they intend to make a substantial profit for providing that service they put a lot of effort in to measuring probabilities and carefully set the premiums to get make a steady the odds are in their favor you have to ask yourself if x happened tomorrow how would i feel about the financial impact also how much will it cost me to buy insurance to cover x if you have a lot of savings plenty of available credit a bright financial future and you take the bus to work anyway then totaling your car may not be a big deal money wise skip the insurance if you have no savings plenty of debt little prospects for that improving and you depend on your car to get to work just so you can pay what you already owe then totaling your car would probably be a big problem for you stick with insurance there is a middle ground you can adjust your deductible raise it as high as you can comfortably handle you cover the small stuff out of pocket and save the insurance for the big ticket items insurance companies also invest the money they take as premiums until they pay out a claim that 's not relevant to this discussion though

almost all companies in the us have changed from formal pension programs to 401k plans and most companies that still have pension programs do n't allow new employees to   enroll in the new program only the previous participants who are vested in the pension plan will get benefits while new employees get enrolled in the 401k plan if this is the case with   your prospective employer then demanding that you be allowed to enroll in the pension plan is likely to be futile in fact the likely response may well be here is our offer take it or leave it or we are withdrawing   the offer we made especially if you are in a field where there are plenty of other people who could do the job instead of you so be sure that you understand what your worth is to the company and how much leverage you have before starting to make counter offers with regard to money that you might have vested in your current employer 's pension plan your options are to leave it there until you retire and start getting a pension generally not advisable in these times when the company might not even exist by then roll it over into an ira or into your new employer 's 401k plan this last is the only matter that concerns your prospective employer and where you might need to ask the new employer 's 401k plan might not be structured to accept rollovers if the money in your current employer 's retirement plan is in a pension plan what is paid out for rolling over might be different and smaller than what has been credited to you thus far for example my state government pension plan credited 8 interest per annum on the amounts i contributed but this was fake money because had i resigned and withdrawn the pension contributions for the purpose of rolling over into an ira or even just taking it as cash i would have received only my contributions plus only 4.5 interest per annum the 8 interest credited is available only for the purpose of the purchase of an immediate annuity upon retirement it is not something that is portable to a new plan and if i want a lump sum payout upon retirement instead of a pension in the form of an annuity it would be the 4.5 rate again

they all basically mean the same thing a type of debt than can be exchanged for converted into equity at some point it 's only the mechanics that can be different a convertible bond is structured just like a regular bond it usually pays periodic interest and has a face value that 's due at maturity the difference is that the bond holder has the option to exchange the debt for equity at some point during the life of the bond   there can be restrictions on when that conversion is possible and they typically define a quantity of equity number of shares that the bond can be converted into   if the market price of the shares goes above a price that would make the shares more valuable than the bond it 's in the best interest of the bond holder to convert a convertible note is typically used to describe a kind of startup financing that does not pay interest or have a face value that 's redeemed but instead is redeemed for equity as part of a later financing round   rather than specifying a specific number of shares the bond holder receives equity at a certain discount to the rest of the market so they both are debt instruments that can turn into equity investments just through different mechanisms a debenture is a fancy word for unsecured debt and convertible debt could be used to described either structure above so those terms could mean either type of structure

stock issuing and dilution is legal because there must be some mechanism for small companies to grow into big companies a company sees a great investment opportunity   it would be a perfect extension of their activities but they can not afford it to get the necessary money they can either take out a loan or issue shares taking a loan basically means that this is temporary but the company will go back to being small when the loan is paid back issuing new shares basically means that the board means that this growth is permanent and the company will be big for the foreseeable future it is utterly necessary that companies have this option for raising cash and therefore it is legal as detailed in the other answers you end up with a smaller percentage of a larger company usually ending up with more or less the same value

look for jobs you can do pro re nada or as the need arises   basically very part time work where you are free to decide whether or not you want to work given shift offered   it 's pretty common in medicine and in education   if you want to work a whole week you probably can   if you do n't they just call the next person on the list   obviously you 'll need some extra education but i 'm assuming that is n't a problem   beyond that as far as leisure pursuits try to write a book   fiction does n't matter   you 'll suck at that for long enough to take up a few years of your life   you could get a pilot 's license also pretty time intensive and could lead to some interesting part time gigs as a charter pilot down the line   general kind of tour guide leisure activity instructor work seems to be very rewarding   i 'm active in my local community and i 've never met an instructor who did n't love his job   msf instructor is a 12 hour per week gig   good luck

also you have to be aware that there 's an academic finance which is very nice and clean and mathematical and then there is finance how it works in the real world which is chaotic and unpredictable   cfa books as mentioned by another poster would be good for learning the former but do n't expect that knowledge to be of any practical value unless you are trying to get a degree or certification   if you do want to go that route focus more on information about individual financial products and less on financial market behavior    if you want to learn more about how the markets actually work i would have to say that it 's going to be very hard without any industry experience   when i started my first job after getting my finance degree i knew absolutely nothing about how things worked   there are some good books though more of a good story than teaching material   try michael lewis

not all miles carry the same amount of risk a survey by progressive indicated that accidents are most likely to occur within 5 miles of home and 77 of accidents occur within 15 miles of home only 1 of accidents occurred 50 or more miles from home that 's from 2002 but it seems unlikely to have changed much since the miles closest to your home carry more risk they cost more and low mileage discounts reflect that there are per mile insurance options in a few states which could save you money but they do constant monitoring via that device and other insurers offer discounts if you accept their monitoring either in perpetuity or for a limited period of time   without monitoring insurers do n't know if that 4,000 miles of driving is spread into a few mid day trips each week or maybe you 're doing all that driving from midnight to 4 am on weekends far more likely or from 5 during accidents far more likely personally i save ~10 by being a low mileage driver and am currently in the middle of a 90-day monitoring so might go lower but given that accidents are far more likely close to home 10 feels pretty significant and appropriate

other than being reduced to clear as others have suggested quite a few get sold to large motor stores you can often go in and find last years model with around delivery mileage at a very knocked down rate because most people would prefer the latest model direct from the dealer doing this allows dealers to clear old stock incredibly quickly so they can promote the newest model exclusively

the wikipedia page for repurchase agreement has two relevant pointers on this topic   the legal title for any securities used in a repo actually pass from seller to buyer during the term of the agreement in basic terms this means that if one sells a bond on repo with a promise to buy it back then the ownership actually transfers to the buyer for that period of time   if a coupon is paid during this time period it can either go to the buyer or the seller usually the coupon payment goes to the initial owner of the security pre repo our seller but sometimes the repurchase agreement will specify otherwise so again in basic terms usually the repo seller initial security owner receives any payments made during the term of the repurchase agreement both points are in the first paragraph of the section structure and terminology

month to date for the month to date the price on feb 28th is $ and the price on march 16th is $ so the return is which can be written more simply as the position is 1000 shares valued at $ on feb 28th so the profit on the month to date is calendar year to date for the calendar year to date ytd the price on dec 31st is $ and the price on feb 28th is $ so the return to feb 28th is the return from feb 28th to march 16th is so the year to date return is or more directly so the 2011 ytd profit on 1000 shares valued at $ 4600 on dec 31st is year to date starting dec 10th for the year to date starting dec 10th the starting value is and the value on dec 31st is 1000 $ = $ 4600 so the return is $ 4600 $ 1 = = the year to date profit is therefore note ytd is often understood to mean calendar year to date   to cover all the bases state both ie calendar ytd 2011 and ytd starting dec 10th 2010 edit further to comment for the calendar year to date with 200 shares sold on jan 10th with the share price at $ the return from dec 31st to jan 10th is the return from jan 10th to feb 28th is the return from feb 28th to march 16th is the profit on 1000 shares from dec 31st to jan 10th is $ 4600 = the profit on 800 shares from jan 10th to feb 28th is zero the profit on 800 shares from feb 28th to march 16th is so the year to date profit is $ 4

gt he seemed to be pointing out that the fed may accidentally make things worse by looking at averages instead of drilling down into the quintiles   i think this is exactly what he 's saying but he does n't provide what his solution would be if he was running the fed he 's spoken about it in some recent interviews there 's one with bloomberg that was 60 + minutes long and he 's basically under the impression that we made our bed there 's no going back now nothing the fed can do at this point but let the markets do what they need to do tightening too fast now might cause the next recession starting with the high yield credit market imo on the other hand no tightening really ties their hands when the recession comes and they 're left with either another round of qe which may have the opposite effect of what is intended or just sit back and watch the fire

i 'm going to assume that you will spend the money to fix the mold problem correctly   using your numbers after that is done the home is worth perhaps $ 280k to evaluate whether or not to sell the amount you have spent on the house is irrelevant the only thing you need to ask yourself is this would i spend $ 280k to buy this house today you might if you were happy with the rental income that you were getting if the house is fully rented it earns you $ 24k year which is an 8.6 return if you had purchased the house today at $ 280k of course you will have vacancies taxes and other expenses bringing that return number down figure out what that is and see if you are happy with the return based on those numbers   if you decide it would be a bad investment for you at $ 280k then sell the house   by the way this question works for any investment not just real estate when deciding whether or not to sell stock the same thing applies it is irrelevant what your cost basis is you only need to ask yourself if the stock would be a good buy for you at the current price

they can sell a lower price call if they expect the stock to plummet in the near term but they are bullish on the longer term what they are looking to do is collect the call premium and hope it expires worthless   and then again hope that the stock will ultimately turn around so yes a lot of hoping   but can you explain what you mean by my brokerage gives premiums for prices lower than the current price do you mean you pay less in commissions for itm calls

i 'm not in a mlm or anything but i 'm a business owner and i 'm wondering why people keep saying it 's a scam because people lose money any opportunity has risk and the ratio of success to fail is pretty similar for normal businesses    these seem like sales jobs with commission only exotic compensation plans it 's normal that people fail at this are they not compensating people that meet their targets   at any rate i feel like the business itself is n't a scam but a lot of the salespeople are scummy by not really explaining the odds i also do n't like the cult like vibe i get from some people in those groups
