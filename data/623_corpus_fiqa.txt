if you sell your shares for more than their value at the time you received them i.e. you make a profit then you will be liable for capital gains tax but only if the profit exceeds your annual allowance £ in tax year 2015 16 this is unrelated to how you came by the shares in the first place note that there are certain exemptions to this which includes some employer share schemes

taking the last case first this works out exactly note the bank of england interest rate has nothing to do with the calculation the standard loan formula for an ordinary annuity can be used as described by but the periodic interest rate has to be calculated from an effective apr not a nominal rate   for details see apr in the eu and uk where the definition is only valid for effective apr as shown below 2003 bmw £ typical apr 60 monthly payments £ how does this work see the section calculating the present value of an ordinary annuity   the payment formula is derived from the sum of the payments each discounted to present value i.e. the example relates to the eu apr definition like so   next the second case does n't make much sense unless there is a downpayment 2004 honda civic 1.6 i se 5 door £ £ per month at apr as quoted in advert 58 monthly payments 58 monthly payments at only amount to £ which is £ less than the price of the car finally the first case is approximate 2005 toyota corolla 1.4 5 door £ from £ 38 per week apr typical a 60 month payment 260 weekly payments a weekly payment of £ 38 would imply an apr of

if you have a great technical trading system that gets you winning trading 80 85 of the time in backtesting the question should be why are you not trading it to get a better idea of how good your trading system is you should work out your expectancy per trade this will tell you how much you should make on average for every trade you take expectancy not only considers your win rate but also you win size to loss size ratio for example if you are getting winning trades 80 of the time but your average win size is $ 100 and your 20 of losses average $ 500 then you will still be losing money you should be aiming for an average win size of at least 2.5 to 3 times you average loss size this will provide you a profitable trading system even if your win rate is 50 if your trading system is really that good and provides a win size of at least 2.5 times your loss size then you should be actively trading it also if you put your trading system out there in the public domain together with your trading results you will actually find that quite opposite to what the consensus above is your results from your trading plan should actually improve further the more people acting on the outcome of a signal in the same direction the higher the probability that the movement in the desired direction will actually occur if you are looking to make money from your trading ideas no one will pay anything unless you have real results to back it up so if you are so confident about your system you should start trading it with real money of course you should start off small and build it up over time as your results as per your simulations

i 've seen target stores with some strange layouts in buildings that they did n't build themselves and those stores have succeeded so i would n't necessarily blame the reuse of existing buildings in and of itself as a factor   my local target is a former ward store and has a somewhat bi level layout because of this especially when compared to two bi level stores that target built themselves in nearby towns   but all three stores are successful   target 's problem with buying out the leases was that they had too large of a store footprint before they were ready to service it   if they had started small with one or two locations and then built up gradually they would have probably been fine working the bugs out on a few stores vs. 100 + stores   a acquisition could have happened later on

i 'm going to ignore your numbers to avoid spending the time to understand them   i 'm just going to go over the basic moving parts of trading an upside down car against another financed car because i think you 're conflating price and value   i 'm also going to ignore taxes and fees and depreciation the car has an acquisition cost price then it has a value   you pay the price to obtain this thing then in the future it is worth what someone else will pay you when you finance a car you agree to your $ 10,000 price then you call up mr. bank and agree to pay 10 per year for 5 years on that $ 10,000   mr. banker wires over $ 10,000 and you drive home in your car    say in a year you want a different car   this new car has a price of $ 20,000 and would n't you know it they 'll even buy your current car from you   they 'll give you $ 7,000 to trade in your current car your current car has a value of $ 7,000   you 've made 12 payments of $   of those payments about $ 460 was interest you now owe about $ to mr. banker the new dealership needs to send payment to mr. banker to get the title for your current car   they 'll send the $ 7,000 they agreed to pay for your car   then they 'll loan you the additional $ $ owed on the car minus $ 7,000 trade in value    your loan on the new car will be for $ $ 20,000 for the new car and $ for the amount you still owed on the old car after the dealership paid you $ 7,000 for your old car it does n't matter what your down payment was on the old car it does n't matter what your payment was before it does n't matter what you bought your old car for   all that matters is how much you owe on it today and how much the buyer the dealership is willing to pay you for it how much of this is loss is an extremely vague number to derive primarily because your utility of the car has a value   but it could be argued that the $ added on to your new car loan to pay for the old car is lost

i actually just did that with my chase freedom card they rotate categories every 3 months and from april june it was 5 back at grocery stores   so i bought a ton of gas cards and got my 5 back   next i figured out i would be clever and buy a ton of store gift cards grocery gift cards right at the end of the quarter then use those in the future to purchase gas cards   well i just tried that a couple days ago and discovered the store refuses to sell a gift card if you 're paying with a gift card   so now i 'm stuck with $ 1,000 in grocery cards until i use them in actual grocery purchases haha one of the things about this grocery store is they partner with a gas station on their rewards program   they offer 10 cents off a gallon with every $ 100 spent in store and they double it to 20 cents off a gallon if you buy $ 100 in gift cards   then on the back of the receipt is a coupon for 10 cents off per gallon which they double on   unfortunately i think i 'm one of the only people that takes this much advantage of the program   side note i actually just changed the billing cycle of my chase freedom card to end on the 24th of the month   that way i can charge a bunch of rewards in the final 6 7 days of the quarter   and if i have a $ 0 balance on the 24th my bill is n't due for 7 weeks interest free   and chase freedom has never cared if you purchase gift cards with their quarterly rewards program   i also gave them a courtesy email giving the specific store and $ $ $ amount that was going to be charged and of course they still called me with a fraud alert

please refer to this question to understand the basics of how an order is matched how do exchanges match limit orders   now most of the times even block orders follow the same matching criteria i think you are assuming that for every large buy order there is a matching large sell order this is not true      so on the buy side at various point in times there were buy orders with single order more than 10,000 shares on the sell side to fulfil these orders there may or may not be a single order of 10,000 more often there will be quite a few smaller orders or 500 1000 or whatever amount that are present in the queue based on the amount time sort order or even partially matching out of a sell order of 10,000 similarly when there is a large sell order of more than 10,000 these may not have got filled in by a large buy order but by smaller buy orders etc    so if you average out the amounts on the buy side and the sell side there would definately be a difference the analysis of this difference is as indicated in your question buy price is more than sell price and hence people are bullish

there are a number of ways trading stocks is easier than commodities but the main and most important reason is that over long periods stocks in general will tend to outperform inflation as you are investing money in enterprises that generally try to become more productive over time   whereas commodities in the long term tend to rise only at the pace of inflation this is kind of the definition of inflation actually   so even uninformed investors that pick stocks at random will generally do better than someone doing the same in commodities even before the higher commodities trading fees are taken into account also your orange example may be harder than you think   once the news that a drought is an issue the price of oranges will almost immediately change well before the oranges come to market   so unless you can predict the drought before anyone else can you wo n't be able to make money this way

you have a good thing going one of the luxuries of being invested in an index fund for the long term is that you do n't have to sweat the inevitable short term dips in the market instead look at the opportunity that presents itself on market dips now your monthly investment is getting in at a lower price buy low sell high do n't lose money these are common for long term investment mentality 5 8 years is plenty of time i 'd call it medium term as you get closer to your goals ~2 3 years out you should start slowly moving money out of your index fund and start dollar cost averaging out into cash or short term bonds but that 's another question keep putting money in wait and sell high if it 's not high wait another year or two to buy the house a lot of people do the opposite for their entire lives buying high panic selling on the dips then buying again when it goes up that 's bad i recommend a search on dollar cost averaging which is exactly what you are doing right now with your monthly investments

tl dr version   what you propose to do might not save you taxes and may well be illegal since you mention your wife i assume that the inherited ira has been inherited from someone other than your spouse your mother maybe who passed away in fall 2015 as mentioned in your other question cf the comment by ben miller above if so you must take at least the required minimum distribution rmd from the inherited ira each year and pay   taxes on the distribution what the rmd is depends on how old the owner of the ira was when the owner passed away but in most cases it works out to be the rmd for you the beneficiary considered   to be a single person see publication 590b available on the irs web site for details so have you taken the at least the rmd amount for 2016 from this inherited ira if not you will owe a 50 penalty of the difference    between the amount withdrawn and the rmd amount no it is not a typo    the penalty it is called an excise tax is indeed 50 assuming that the total amount that you have taken as   a distribution from the inherited ira during 2016 is the   rmd for 2016 plus possibly some extra amount $ x then that amount is included in your taxable income for that year   you can not rollover any part of the total amount distributed into   your own ira and thereby avoid taxation on the money note that it does not matter whether you will be rolling over the money into an existing ira in your name or will be establishing a new rollover ira account in your name with the money the prohibition applies to both ways of handling the matter if you wish you can roll over up to $ x the amount over and above the rmd into a new inherited ira account titled exactly the same as the existing inherited ira account with a different custodian if you choose to do so then the amount that you roll over into the new inherited ira account will not included in your taxable income for 2016 to my mind there is no point to doing such a rollover unless you are unhappy with the current custodian of your inherited ira but the option is included for completeness note that the rmd amount can not be rolled over in this fashion only the excess over the rmd if you do n't really need to spend the money distributed from your inherited ira for your household expenses your opening statement that your income for 2016 is low might make this unlikely and i you and/or your spouse received compensation earned income such as wages salary self employment income commissions for sales nontaxable combat pay for us military personnel etc in 2016 and ii you were not 70.5 years of age by december 2016   then you and your wife can make   contributions to existing iras in your names   or establish new iras in your names   the amount that can be contributed for each ira is limited to the smaller of $ 5500 $ 6500 for people over 50 and that person 's compensation for 2016 but if a joint tax return is filed for 2016 then both can make contributions to their iras as long as the sum of the amounts contributed to the iras does not exceed   the total compensation reported on the joint return   the deadline for making such ira contributions is the due date for your 2016 federal income tax return since your income for 2016 is less than $ 98 k you can deduct the entire ira contribution even if you or your wife are covered by an employer plan such as a 401(k plan   thus your taxable income will be reduced by the ira contributions up to a maximum of $ 11 k or $ 12 k or $ 13 k depending on ages and this can offset the increase in taxable income due to the   distribution from the inherited ira       since money is fungible is n't this last bullet point achieving the same result as rolling over the entire $ 9.6 k including the rmd into an ira in your name the very thing that the first bullet point above says can not be done the answer is that it really is n't the same result and differs from what you wanted to do in several different ways first the $ 9.6 k is being put into iras for two different people   you and your wife and not just you alone should there god forbid be an end to the marriage that part of your inheritance is gone second you might not even be entitled to make contributions to iras no compensation or over 70.5 years old in 2016 which would make the whole thing moot third the amount that can be contributed to an ira is limited to $ for each person while this does not affect the present case if the distribution had been $ 15 k instead of $ 9.6 k   not all of that money could be contributed to iras for you and your wife finally the contribution to a traditional ira might be non deductible for income tax purposes because the adjusted gross income is too high   once again not an issue for you for 2016 but something to keep in mind for future years in contrast rollovers from one ira into another ira both titled the same can be in any amount and they can be done at any time regardless of whether there is compensation for that year or not or what the adjusted gross income is or whether there is coverage by a 401(k plan there are no   tax consequences to rollovers unless the rollover is from a traditional ira to a roth ira in which case the distribution is included in taxable   income for that year   what is prohibited is taking the entire amount of the $ 9.6 k distribution from an inherited ira and rolling it over   into your existing ira or establishing a rollover ira in your name with that $ 9.6 k ditto for some money going into your ira and some into your wife 's ira i expect that any ira custodian will   likely refuse to allow you to carry out such a rollover transaction but will be glad to accept 2016 contributions in amounts of up to $ from you into existing iras or open a new ira for you the custodian will not ask whether you have compensation for 2016 or not but will check your age it is your responsibility to ensure that you do not contribute more than the compensation etc incidentally subject to the $ maximum limit you can if you choose to do so contribute the entire amount of your compensation to an ira not just the take home pay amount which will be smaller than your compensation because of withholding for social security and medicare tax state and federal income tax etc

one reason a company might choose to pay a dividend is because of the desire of influential stockholders to receive the dividend    in the case of ford for example there are 70 million shares of class b stock which receive the same dividend per share as do the common stock holders   even though there are 3.8 billion shares of common stock the class b owners which are ford family hold 40 of the voting power and so their desires are given much weight    the class b owners prefer regular dividends because if enough were to sell their class b shares all class b shares as a block would have their voting power drop from 40 to 30 and with further sales all special voting would be lost and each class b share would be equivalent to a common share in voting power hence the class b owners both for themselves and for all of the family members holding class b avoid selling shares and prefer receiving dividends

there should be no problem getting a mortgage from a bank with 3 years in business they are going to use the average of the last 2 years of taxable profits to determine your income though i think the key words here are taxable profits and this is where the problem typically comes in for most self employed folks many times self employed people will have soft losses and deductions that make their income seem lower than it really is or unreported income   it has nothing to do with your business plan or your relationship with the bank unless it is a small community bank or credit union

the bottom line is that you are kind of a terrible customer for them    granted you are far better than one that does not pay his bills but you are probably in the tier right above that rewards cards are used to lure the unorganized into out of control interest rates and late payments   these people are capital one 's and others best customers   they have traded hundreds of dollars in interest payments for a couple of dollars in rewards   the cc company says   you on the other hand cut into their meager profits from fees collected from your transactions   why should they help you make more money   why should they further cut into your profits response to comment given your comment i think the bottom line is a matter of perspective   you seem like a logical altruistic type person who probably seeks a win win situation in business dealings   this differs from cc companies they operate to seek one thing   btw the terrible customer remark should be taken as a compliment    after you get past the marketing lies you begin to see what reward programs and zero percent financing is all about   how do most people end up with interest rates   they started with a zero percent balance loan and was late for a payment reward cards work a bit differently   studies show that people tend to spend about 17 more when they use a reward card   i 've caught myself ordering an extra or beer and have subsequently stopped using a reward card for things i can make a decision at the time of purchase   for people with tight budgets this leads to debt my meager profits paragraph makes sense when you understand the onerous nature of cc companies   they are not interested in earning 2 on purchases charge 3 and give back 1 for basically free money   you rightly see this as what should be a win win for all parties involved   thus the meager in quotation marks   cc companies are willing to give back 1 and charge 3 if you then pay 15 or more on your balance some may disagree with me on the extracting nature of cc companies but they are wrong   i like him as an actor but i do n't believe samuel jackson 's lines

without knowing the details of your financial situation i can only offer general advice   it might be worth having a financial counselor look at your finances and offer some custom advice   you might be able to find someone that will do this for free by asking at your local church i would advise you not to try to get another loan and certainly not to start charging things to a credit card   you are correct when you called it a nightmare   you are currently struggling with your finances and getting further into debt will not help   it would only be a very short term fix and have long lasting consequences    what you need to do is look at the income that you have and prioritize your spending   for example your list of basic needs includes if you have other things that you are spending money on such as medical debt or other old debt that you are trying to pay off those are not as important as funding your basic needs above if there is anything you can do to reduce the cost of the basic needs do it   for example finding a cheaper place to live or a place closer to your job might save you money   perhaps accepting nutrition assistance from a local food bank or the salvation army is an option for you now about your car your transportation to your job is very much one of your basic needs as it will enable you to pay for your other needs   if you can use public transportation until you can get a working car again or you can find someone that will give you a ride that will solve this problem   if not you 'll need to get a working car you definitely do n't want to take out another loan for a car as you are already having trouble paying the first loan   i 'm guessing that it will be less expensive to get the engine repaired than it will be to buy a new car at this point   but that is just a guess   you 'll need to find out how much it will cost to fix the car and see if you can swing it by perhaps eliminating expenses that are n't necessary even for a short time   for example if you are paying installments on medical debt you might have to skip a payment to fix your car   it 's not ideal but if you are short on cash it is a better option than losing your job or taking out even more debt for your car alternatively buying another functional car if it costs less than fixing your current car is an option   if you do n't have the money to pay your current car loan payments you 'll lose your current car just to be clear many of these options will mess up your credit score   however borrowing more in an attempt to save your credit score will probably only put off the inevitable as it will make paying everything off that much harder   if you do n't have enough income to pay your debts you might be better off to just take the credit score ding get back on your feet and then work to eliminate the debt once you 've got your basic needs covered sorry to hear about your situation   again this advice is just general and might not all apply to your financial details   i recommend talking to the pastor of a local church and see if they have someone that can sit down with you and discuss your options

i regularly transfer money from the us to europe and have found a simple us check a pretty useful way if you are not in a hurry you write a us dollar based check to yourself and deposit it to a bank in your new location which implies you open an account in france yes it takes some days 7 days and then the money will be deposited the local bank will convert it so you can walk around and pick a bank that has a rate concept that pleases you before you open the account and there will be no fees on the us side which means you can get every last dollar out of the account also you have the control over how much you pull when you can write yourself as many checks as you like assuming you took your checkbook this was the best rate i could get considering that wire transfers cost significant fees there are probably other options if you are talking serious money like 100 or more there will better ways but most banks will be eager to help you with that note that as long as you make interest income in the us you are required to file taxes in the us your visa status and location do n't matter

the nature of options requires you to understand that they are essentially a bet in one sense so is investing in stocks we imagine a bell curve first mistake with a median return at 10%/yr and a standard deviation of about 14 then we say that odds are that over some period of time a monte carlo simulation can give us the picture of the likely returns   now when you buy short term options say one month or so you are hoping the outcome is a rise in price that will yield some pretty high return right   there was a time i noticed a particular stock would move a large percent based on earnings and earnings were a day before options expiration so i 'd buy the call that was just out of the money and if the surprise was up i 'd make 3 4x my money but i was always prepared to lose it all and often did i never called this investing   i know of no recovery strategy sorry

plus you already have money in a 529 plan that is meant for college expenses and can not be used to pay student loans use that money for what it 's for i disagree with as a current college student i would say to take out loans most of the time i am against loans though   so why there are very few times you will receive loans at 0 interest for 4 + years you have money saved currently but you do not know what the future entails if you expend all of your money on tuition and your car breaks down what do you do you can not used student loans to pay for your broken car student loans as long as they are subsidized serve as a wonderful risk buffer you can pay off your loans with summer internships and retain the initial cash you had for additional activities that make college enjoyable i.e clubs dinners and social nights another benefit to taking these loans would assist in building credit with an additional caveat being to get a credit card in general debt loans credit cards are non beneficial but you have to establish debt to allow others to know that you can repay establishing this credit rating earlier than later is critical to cheaper interest rates on say a mortgage   you have made it through you have watched your expenses and you can pay your debt finish it if you do it right you will not have loans when you graduate you will have a stunning credit rating and you will have enjoyed college to its fullest potential remember you only really go through it once but this is contingent on   good luck   edit i did not realize the implication of this penalty which made me edit the line above to include to the extent you can per year for now student loan repayment is n't considered a qualified educational expense this means that if you withdraw from a 529 to pay your debts you may be subject to income taxes and penalties source furthermore   currently taxpayers who use 529 plan money for anything other than qualified education expenses are subject to a 10 federal tax penalty source my advice with this new knowledge save your 529 if you plan on continuing higher education at a more prestigious school if you do not use it later in your undergraduate years

if i buy property when the market is in a downtrend the property loses    value but i would lose money on rent anyway so as long i 'm viewing    the property as housing expense i would be ok this is a bit too rough an analysis   it all depends on the numbers you plug in   let 's say you live in the boston area and you buy a house during a downtrend at $   two years later you need to sell it and the best you can get is $   you are down $ 70k and you are also out two years of property taxes maintenance insurance mortgage interest maybe etc   say that 's another $ 10k a year so you are down $ 70k + $ 20k = $ 90k   it 's probably more than that but let 's go with it in those same two years you could have been living in a fairly nice apartment for $   in that scenario you are out $ 2k 24 months = $ 48k and that 's it   it 's a difference of $ 90k $ 48k = $ 42k in two years   that 's sizable if i wanted to sell and upgrade to a larger property the larger    property would also be cheaper in the downtrend yes the general rule is   if you have to spend your money on a purchase it 's best to buy when things are low so you maximize your value    however if the market is in an uptrend selling the property would    gain me more than what i paid but larger houses would also have    increased in price but it may not scale   when you jump to a much larger more expensive house you can think of it as buying 1.5 houses   that extra 0.5 of a house is a new purchase and if you buy when prices are high relative to other economic indicators like salaries and rents you are not doing as well as when you buy when they are low    do both of these scenarios negate the pro cons of buying in either    market i do n't think so   i think in general buying more house either going from an apartment to a house or from a small house to a bigger house when housing is cheaper is favorable   houses are goods like anything else and when supply is high after overproduction of them and demand is low during bad economic times deals can be found relative to other times when the opposite applies or during housing bubbles    the other point is as with any trend you only know the future of the trend after it passes   you do n't know if you are buying at anything close to the bottom of a trend though you can certainly see it is lower than it once was    in terms of practical matters if you are going to buy when it 's up you hope you sell when it 's up too this graph of historical inflation adjusted housing prices is helpful to that point   let me just say that if i bought in the latest boom i sure hope i sold during that boom too

the answer to almost all questions of this type is to draw a diagram   this will show you in graphical fashion the timing of all payments out and payments received   then if all these payments are brought to the same date and set equal to each other using the desired rate of return the equation to be solved is generated in this case taking the start of the bond 's life as the point of reference the various amounts are pay out = x received = a series of 15 annual payments of $ 70 the first coming in 1 year   this can be brought to the reference date using the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity plus received = a single payment of $ 1000 made 15 years in the future   this can be brought to the reference date using the simple interest formula set the pay out equal to the present value of the payments received and solve for x i am unaware of the difference if any between current rate and rate to maturity finding the rate for such a series of payments would start out the same as above but solving the resulting equation for the interest rate would be a daunting task

i may be underestimating your knowledge of how exchanges work if so i apologize   if not then i believe the answer is relatively straightforward lets say price of a stock at time t1 is 15 $   there are many types of price that an exchange reports to the public as discussed below let 's say that you 're referring to the most recent trade price   that is the last time a trade executed between a willing buyer and a willing seller was at $ 15.00 lets say a significant buy order of 1 m shares came in to the market here i believe might be a misunderstanding on your part   i think you 're assuming that the buy order must necessarily be requesting a price of $ 15.00 because that was the last published price at time t1   in fact orders can request any price they want   it 's totally okay for someone to request to buy at $ 10.00   presumably nobody will want to sell to him but it 's still a perfectly valid buy order but let 's continue under the assumptions that at t1 this makes the bid $ and the ask $ 15.00   nyse also publishes these prices there are n't enough people selling that stock it 's quite rare in major us equities for anyone to place a buy order that exceeds the total available shares listed for sale at all prices   what i think you mean is that 1 m is larger than the amount of currently listed sell requests at the ask of $ 15.00 so say of the 1 m only 100,000 had a matching sell order and others are waiting so this means that there were exactly 100,000 shares waiting to be sold at the ask of $ 15.00 and that all other sellers currently in the market told nyse they were only willing to sell for a price of $ 15.01 or higher   if there had been more shares available at $ 15.00 then nyse would have matched them this would be a trigger to the automated system to start increasing the price here is another point of misunderstanding i think   nyse 's automated system does not invent a new higher price to publish at this point   instead it simply reports the last trade price still $ 15.00 and now that all of the willing sellers at $ 15.00 have been matched nyse also publishes the new ask price of $ 15.01   it 's not that nyse has decided $ 15.01 is the new price for the stock it 's that $ 15.01 is now the lowest price at which anyone known to nyse is willing to sell   if nobody happened to be interested in selling at $ 15.01 at t1 but there were people interested in selling at $ then the new published ask would be $ instead of $ 15.01 not because nyse decided it but just because those happened to be the facts at the time similarly the new bid is most likely now $ 15.00 assuming the person who placed the order for 1 m shares did not cancel the remaining unmatched 900,000 shares of his her order   that is $ 15.00 is now the highest price at which anyone known to nyse is willing to buy how much time does the automated system wait to increment the price the frequency of the price change and by what percentage to increment etc so i think the answer to all these questions is that the automated system does none of these things   it merely publishes information about a the last trade price b the price that is currently the lowest price at which anyone has expressed a willingness to sell and c the price that is currently the highest price at which anyone has expressed a willingness to buy edit oh i forgot to answer your primary question can we estimate the impact of a large buy order on the share price not only can we estimate the impact but we can know it explicitly   because the exchange publishes information on all the orders it knows about anyone tracking that information can deduce that in this example there were exactly 100,000 shares waiting to be purchased at $ 15.00   so if a large buy order of 1 m shares comes in at $ 15.00 then we know that all of the people waiting to sell at $ 15.00 will be matched and the new lowest ask price will be $ 15.01 or whatever was the next lowest sell price that the exchange had previously published

to cut the cost of insurance in half you will have to cut the number of ambulance chasing attorneys in half and stop half of the hail storms i ’m of the belief that lawsuits and defense cost will still be a part of the insurance cost as well as all the current comprehensive risks    the reason tesla is doing this is because it ’s vehicles are significantly more expensive to repair the mainstream insurance companies are figuring out how to insure them and it will end up be much more expensive to insure a tesla than a toyota

my recommendation is simple   rent the fact that you have to ask the question is a clear sign that you have no business buying a home that 's not to say that it 's a bad question to ask though far more important then rather it 's wise for you to buy a home is the more important question of are you emotionally ready for the responsibility and of a home   at best you are tying your self to the same number of rooms same location and same set of circumstances for the next 5 7 years in that time it will be very unlikely that you will be able to sell the house for a profit get your minor equity back or even get a second loan for any reason   you mentioned getting married soon that means the possibility of more children divorce and who knows what else   you are in an emotionally and financially time in your life now is not the right time to buy anything large instead rent and focus on improving your credit rating in 5 years time you will have a much better credit rating get much better rates and fees and have a much better handle on where you want to be with your home family situation   buying a house is not something you do on a weekend for most people it 's the culmination of years of work searching researching and preparation   often times people that buy before they are ready will end up in foreclosure and generally have a crappy next 15 years as they try to work themselves out of the issue

lending is not a charitable contribution its an investment if the loan becomes a bad debt you 'll have to show that it had become a bad debt for example bankruptcy declaration you 'll have to show an arm 's length transaction for example real intention to repay evidenced by payments of principal and interest made otherwise if you have an intention for the loan to never be repaid it is in fact a gift which is not only not deductible its taxable bottom line be careful and talk to a ea cpa to get a proper advice with regards to a specific transaction edit to answer your revised question you 're not going to pay taxes if you 're not going to have gains however if you lose the principal in addition to the said above you would incur the loss as a personal bad debt and not business this is because it is not investment the difference is in tax treatment personal bad debt is a short term capital loss limited deduction business is an ordinary loss

i worked on a competing app a few back the primary use case is n't high wanting to save some money by selling off unused seats it 's the charter company wanting to recoup costs on completely empty planes if they fly someone from nyc to seattle and that person is n't returning to nyc for a week they are n't just going to leave the plane there for the duration so they need to the plane to the next pickup point and usually they 're doing that with no one on the plane which is a dead leg in industry parlance    the selection is pretty limited compared to commercial airlines and due to faa regulations they have limits on how far in advance they can advertise so it 's limited to basically 24 hours notice you 'll almost never be able to use any of these services to fly both ways on a trip all the existing services i 'm aware of also require the entire plane not just getting a seat which leaves you to try to find a large group of people to share the cost

fsemx has an annual expense ratio of 0.1 which is very low what that means is that each month the fsemx will pay itself one of 0.1 of   the total value of all the shares owned by the shareholders in the mutual fund   if the fund has cash on hand from its trading activities or dividends collected from companies   whose stock is owned by fsemx or interest on bonds owned by fsemx the   money comes out of that but if there is no such pot or the pot is not large enough then the fund manager has the authority to sell some shares of the stocks held by fsemx so that the employees can be paid etc if the total of cash generated by the trading and the dividend collection in a given year is say 3 of the share value of all the outstanding mutual fund   then only 2.9 will be paid out as dividend and capital gain distribution   income to the share holders the remaining 0.1 already having been paid to fsemx management for operating expenses    it is important to keep in mind that expenses are always paid even if there are no profits or even if there are losses that year so that no dividends or capital gains distributions are made   you do n't see the expenses explicitly on any statement that you receive   if fsemx sells shares of stocks that it holds to pay the expenses this reduces   the share value nav of the mutual fund shares that you hold   so if your mutual fund account lost 20 in value that year because the market was falling and you got no dividend or capital gains distributions either remember that only 19.9 of that loss can be blamed on the president or congress or wall street or public sector unions or your neighbor 's refusal to ditch his old pc in favor of a new mac and the rest 0.1 has gone to fsemx to pay for fees you agreed to when you bought fsemx shares if you invest directly in fsemx through fidelity 's web site there is no sales charge and you pay no expenses other than the 0.1 annual expense ratio   there is a fee for selling fsemx shares after owning them only for a short time since   the fund wants to discourage short term investors whatever other fees lists might be descriptive of the uses that fsemx puts its expense ratio income to in its internal management but are not of any importance to the prudent investor in fsemx who will never encounter them or have to pay them

i interned for about six months at a firm that employed a few technical analysts so i 'll try to provide what little information i can since the bulk of the intra day trading was decided technical analysts had two main functions this basically boils down to my answer to your question there are still enough people trading firms etc who believe in candlestick charting and other visually subjective patterns that if you notice a trend pattern etc before the majority of traders observing you may be able to time the market successfully and profit this is becoming increasingly dangerous however because of the steps i outlined above over time the charting patterns that have been proven effective often in many firms individually since the algorithms are all proprietary are incorporated into computer algorithms so the traders you 're competing with to see the pattern are increasingly low latency computer less than a few blocks from the exchange summary candlestick charting along with other forms of subjective technical analysis has its believers and assuming enough of these believers trade the standard strategies based on the standard patterns one could conceivably time the market with enough skill to anticipate these traders acting on the pattern and therefore profit however the marginal benefits of doing so are decreasing rapidly as computers take over more trading responsibility   caveats   i know you 're in australia where the market penetration of hf algo traders is n't as high as in the us so it might be a few more years before the marginal benefits cease to be profitable that being said if various forms of technical analysis proved wildly profitable in australia above and beyond profits available in other markets rest assured that large american or british trading firms would already have moved in   my experience is limited to one trading firm so i certainly ca n't speak for the industry as a whole i know i did n't address candlestick charts specifically but since they 're only one piece of visual technical analysis i tried to address the issue as a whole   this somewhat ties into the debate between fundamental or technical analysis which i wo n't get into investopedia has a short article on the subject as i said i wo n't get into this because while it 's a nice debate for small traders at large trading firms they do n't care they want to make profit and any strategy that can be vetted whether it 's fundamental technical or will be vetted   i want to add more information to my answer to clear up some of the misconceptions in the comments including those talking about biased studies and a lack of evidence for or against technical analysis and candlestick charts i 'll explore this relationship further down   it 's important to keep in mind that charting methods including candlestick charts are visually subjective ways of representing data and that any interpretations drawn from such charts should ideally represent objective technical indicators a charting method is only as good as the indicators it 's used to represent therefore an analysis of the underlying indicators provides a suitable analysis for the visual medium in which they 're presented   one important study that evaluates several of these indicators is foundations of technical analysis computational algorithms statistical inference and empirical implementation by lo and lest anyone accuse its authors of bias i should point out that not only is it published by the national bureau of economic research a highly reputable organization within economics and finance but also that the majority of its authors come from mit 's sloan school which holds a reputation second to none this study finds that several technical indicators e.g. head and shoulder double bottom and various rectangle techniques do provide marginal value they also find that although   human judgment is still superior to most computational algorithms in the area of visual pattern recognition technical analysis can be improved by using automated algorithms since this paper was published in 2000 computing power and statistical analysis have gained significant ground against human ability to identify and exploit for visual pattern detection like candlestick charts   second i suggest you look into david 's book evidence based technical analysis applying the scientific method and statistical inference to trading signals he finds similar results to the lo et al paper in that some technical indicators do add value to the investment process but those that do are those that can be represented mathematically and thus programmed directly into trading algorithms thus bypassing visual tools like candlestick charts   he describes how studies including lo et al have found that head and shoulders patterns are worse than random i.e. you would earn higher returns if you simply traded at random that point is worth than repeating if a day trader is using a candlestick chart and using head and shoulders patterns as part of their he 's rolling the dice when he uses that pattern and returns that come from its application come from chance this reminds me of that old story about a company that sends out predicting the results of sports games complete with strategies and data to back up the predictions the company sends out several versions of the every game each predicting a different winner given a large enough sample size by the end of the season there are a few people who have received a that accurately predicted the winner for every game and they 're convinced the system is perfect the others were n't so lucky however relying on candlestick charts and ta patterns that are from the pre computerized era is reassuring to some traders and gives them a sense of control and beating the market but how long will chance remain on your side this is why i maintain that visual tools like candlestick charts are a slowly dying medium they certainly still add value to some trading firms which is why bloomberg terminals still ship with this functionality built in but as more and more research shows automated algorithms and statistical indicators can provide more value it 's also important to think about whether the majority of the value added by visual tools like candlestick charts comes in the form of profit or a sense of security to traders who learned the field using them over the past few decades   finally it 's extremely important to realize that the actions of retail investors in the equities market can not begin to represent the behaviors of the market as a whole in the equities markets alone trading firms and institutional investors dwarf retail investors and the difference in scale is even more vastly pronounced in derivatives and currency markets the fact that some retail investors use candlestick charts and the technical indicators they hope them provides nothing but minor anecdotal evidence as to their effectiveness

good question   and it depends a bit on your current plan your future income and the plan you are moving too mostly you want to roll out of your existing 401k.   there will likely be a fee and your investment choices are limited   you will want to do a direct transfer and going with a quality company such as fidelity or vanguard   both of those have zero fees for accounts and pretty good customer service however if your future income is likely to be high there is something else to consider   if you are over the limits do a roth and are considering doing a backdoor roth a key success for this strategy is keeping your roll over ira balance low or zero    so you may want to either leave the 401 k where it is or roll it to your new 401 k plan   in that case you will have to call the two 401 k custodians and select the best choice as far as fees and fund choice

i 'm 39 and have been investing since my very early 20 's and the advice i 'd like to go back and give myself is the following 1 time is your friend compounding interest is a powerful force and is probably the most important factor to how much money you are going to wind up with in the end save as much as you possibly can as early as you can you have to run twice as hard to catch up if you start late and you will still probably wind up with less in the end for the extra effort 2 do n't invest 100 of your investment money it always me to let my cash sit idle in an investment account because the   notion of inflation eating up my money and i felt i was wasting opportunity cost by not being fully invested in something however not having enough investable cash around to buy into the fire sale dips in the market made me miss out on opportunities 3 diversify the bubble taught me this in a big hairy painful way i had this idea that as a i really understood the tech bubble and over invested in tech stocks i just knew that i was on top of things as an industry insider and would know when to jump yeah that did n't work out so well i lost more than 6 figures at least on paper diversification will the ups and downs somewhat and make the market a lot less scary in the long run 4 mind your expenses it took me years of paying huge full service broker fees to realize that those clowns do n't seem to do any better than anyone else at picking stocks even when they do the transaction costs are a lead weight on your returns the same holds true for mutual funds etfs shop for low expense ratios aggressively it is really hard for a fund manager to consistently beat the indexes especially when you burden the returns with expense ratios that skim an extra 1 or so off the top the expense ratio broker fees are among the very few things that you can predict reliably when it comes to investments take advantage of this knowledge 5 have an exit strategy for every investment people are emotional creatures it is hard to be logical when you have skin in the game and most people are n't disciplined enough to just admit when they have a loser and bail out while they are in the red or conversely admit when they have a winner and take profits before the party is over it helps to counteract this instinct to have an exit strategy for each investment you buy that is you will get out if it drops by x% or grows by y% in fact it is probably a good idea to just enter those sell limit orders right after you buy the investment so you do n't have to convince yourself to press the button in the heat of a big move in the price of that investment do n't try to predict tops or bottoms they are extremely hard to guess and things often turn so fast that you ca n't act on them in time anyway get out of an investment when it has met your goal or is going to far in the wrong direction if you find yourself saying it has to come back eventually slap yourself   when you are trying to decide whether to stay in the investment or bail the most important question is if i had the current cash value of the stock instead of shares would i buy it today because essentially that is what you are doing when you stick with an investment 6 do n't invest in fads when you are investing you become sensitive to everyone 's opinions on what investment is hot and what is not if everyone is talking about a particular investment avoid it the more enthusiastic people are about it even experts the more you should avoid it when everyone starts forming investment clubs at work and the stock market seems to be the preferred topic of conversation at every party you go to get out   i 'm a big fan of contrarian investing take profits when it feels like all the momentum is going into the market and buy in when everyone seems to be running for the doors

generally cashiers checks do not expire since they are like cash and fully funded at the time of issue however whether they can be cashed after a long period of time and also what the definition of long is depends on the bank eventually if left uncashed it probably would be to the state to wait for someone to claim it being that it 's been less than a year i expect it could be cashed by the payee written on the check without any issues if the payee is deceased then the check can be cashed by the estate as it should be considered the property of the estate the same way it would be if it had already been cashed and was now sitting in a bank account in your mother 's name under normal circumstances the estate in this case would go to your mother 's spouse first then to you and your siblings if you have any unless there is a will specifying otherwise the only way your aunt would be able to deposit the check on her own is if she was listed as an or on the check or if she is the executor of op 's mother 's estate it sounds like the second line of the check is indeed referring to your aunt however from your description of the check it sounds like the second line is simply a designation of what the check is for rather than an additional payee i bet a probate attorney in your state could easily tell by simply looking at the check

your question is based on a false premise   there is no standard for raises   some jobs in some years see huge raises other years those same jobs may see average pay rates drop if you want a benchmark you would be better off looking at typical pay rates for people in your job in your city with your experience sites like glassdoor can provide that type of information if you are at the low end of that range you can probably push for a raise if you are at the high end you may find it more difficult typically your employer will pay you just enough to keep you from leaving so they will offer you as little as they think you will accept   you can either accept it or find another job that pays more if you work in software then you can probably make more by switching jobs if you work in food service you might have more trouble finding higher pay elsewhere if you do find another employer you might be able to a counter offer from your current employer in fact even suggesting that you will look for another employer may prompt your current employer to be more generous   that said if your employer thinks you are on your way out they might cut your bonus or lay you off

the general answer to this is yes   when you 're dealing with single digit millionaires the answer is that their insurance habits and needs are basically the same as everyone else   when you get into the double digit and triple digit millionaires or people worth billions they have additional options but those basically boil down to using self insurance rather than paying a company for an insurance policy   the following is based on both what i 've read and a fair deal of personal experience working for or with various stripes of millionaire and even one billionaire addressing the types of insurance you mention this is generally used to provide survivors with a replacement for income you can no longer provide when dead in addition to paying for costs associated with dying funeral hospital bills etc   even millionaires and billionaires have this yes but the higher your net worth the less value it has   if you 're worth 9 or 10 figures you probably already have trust funds set up for your family members so an extra payout from an insurance policy is probably going to represent a small fraction of the wealth you 're leaving your survivors and as has been noted insurance makes a profit so the expectation by the insurance company is that they 'll make more money on the policy than they 'll have to pay out on death   that being said the members of the 9 + figure club i 've worked for all had multi million dollar life insurance policies on them which were paid for or heavily subsidized by the companies they owned or worked for   i doubt they would have held those policies if they had to pay the full cost but when it 's free or cheap why not absolutely   as health insurance in america is an untaxed employment benefit owing to regulations from world war ii all the wealthy folks i 've had contact with got outrageously good plans as part of the companies they work for or owned   having said that even their trust fund beneficiaries held health insurance because this type of insurance in america at least is actually not really insurance it 's more of a pre payment plan for medical expenses and as such it provides broader access to health care than you 'd get from simply having enough money to pay for whatever treatments you need   if you walk into a hospital as a millionaire and state that you 'll definitely be able to pay for your open heart surgery with cash you 'll get a very different response than if you walk in with your insurance card and your diamond level coverage   so in this case it 's not as much as about the monetary benefits although this is a type of insurance that 's generally free or heavily discounted to the individual so that 's a factor as it is about easier access to health care although this is required by law it 's one of the common forms of insurance that the very wealthy can and often do handle differently than the rest of us   most if not all us states have a provision to allow to self insure themselves which amount to putting up a bond to cover claims against them   basically you deposit the minimum amount the state determines is required for auto insurance with the responsible state organization get a certificate of self insurance and you 're good to go   all the high wealth individuals i know when this route for two reasons first of all they did n't have to deal with insurance companies or pay sky high rates on account of all the speeding tickets they picked up and secondly they made their deposit with government bonds they had in their portfolios anyway and they could still collect the interest on their self insurance deposits   of course this meant that if they wrecked or dinged up their or or whatever they 'd be out of pocket to repair or replace it but i guess if you can afford one $ 200,000 car you can afford to buy a second one if you wreck it or get by riding one of your other luxury automobiles instead since someone else mentioned insurance i 'll point out here that what robert did in casino when he put a couple million dollars into a safety deposit box for his wife to use if he was kidnapped or needed to pay off a government official is essentially the same thing as self insurance   putting money away somewhere for unexpected events in lieu of buying an insurance policy against them in real life the very wealthy will often do this with us treasuries government bonds and other interest bearing safe investments they make a little money diversify their portfolios and at the same time self insure against a potential big loss this is another insurance area where even the very wealthy are remarkably similar to the rest of us in that they all generally have it yes although the reason is a little different   for normal folks the home they own is generally the largest part of their net worth or at least a very substantial fraction for those older folks with retirement savings that exceed the value of their homes   so for us we have home owners insurance to prevent a catastrophic event from wiping out the lion 's share of our net worth if you 're an ultra wealthy individual who can afford an 8 figure home that 's not really the case at least with the ones i 've dealt with who made their fortunes in business and are good managing their wealth and diversifying their assets could be different for sports stars or the entertainment industry and these people generally own multiple homes anyway so it 's not as big a deal if they lose one however no one actually buys a multi million dollar home by writing a multi million dollar check   they get a mortgage just like the rest of us   and to get a mortgage insurance on the property is a requirement   so yes even the ultra wealthy generally have insurance on their   there is an element of not wanting to shell out another 20 million if the place burns down or someone breaks in and steals your valuables but the bigger part of the reason is that it 's required to get a mortgage in the first place which is generally done for financial reasons interest on your mortgage is a tax deduction and you do n't want to sink millions of dollars all at once into buying a property that 's not going to appreciate in value when you can get a mortgage and invest those millions of dollars to make more money instead

corporations exist to generate profit and reduce risk for investors   this is a socially good and useful function that benefits us all   a corporation that did n't seek to lower its tax bill to the lowest legally allowed would be breaking the law   rather than show up at random times and whatever they could grab ahold of governments have discovered through trail and error that having clear consistent rules about how much they demand nets them more revenue   thus tax law and why it is important   over time governments have used tax law for social engineering purposes and as a mechanism for attempting to control their local economy because of this tax law has tended towards higher and higher complexity   throw territorial into the mix and tax law can be also used as a sort of economic weapon   all of this yields a complex tax code which mandates that businesses pay more and more attention to following it 's arcane rules if they want to remain in business   gaming the system is n't morally wrong it is what governments expect businesses to do otherwise they would n't spend so much time setting up such complex rules for business to follow   i suspect that there will be public outcry for more rules making the tax system even more complex because evil businesses are attempting to follow the rules   in a sane world governments would step back refrain from social and economic manipulation which they have shown themselves to be incompetent at anyway and create as simple a tax code as possible so that the tax code is no longer where businesses seek to gain advantage but rather focus their time and energy into creating better products services every dollar spent on tax lawyers accountants is a dollar not spent on making the business better   creating more rules to punish people for following the rules is insanity

yes you 're right both sides should be considered however i have a gut feeling that although amazon has created opportunities for some people to sell on their platform it has taken far more opportunities away from other people   amazon runs $ billion of gross revenue through their system those are sales that would have been made somewhere else if not through amazon now a lot of those dollars likely came from other large retailers wal mart costco home depot etc let 's pretend that they did not though   let 's say that you want to own a bookstore and you want to earn about $ 40k per year let 's say that you can expect a 10 margin that would mean that you would have to sell $ 400k worth of goods to make your money   amazon runs the equivalent of such stores through their site $ billion $ 400,000 so those are opportunities for people to earn $ 40k per year from a retail store   of course it 's not that simple and as i mentioned a lot of amazon 's sales came from larger stores but i wanted to map it out that way to illustrate that amazon very likely takes away far more opportunities than it creates it had about $ 13 billion in profits in 2016 those are profits that did n't go to small business owners

the loss for b can be used to write off the gain for a.   you will fill out a schedule 3 with cost base and proceeds of disposition   this will give you a $ 0 capital gain for the year and an amount of $ 5 50 of the $ 10 loss you can carry forward to offset future capital gains   you can also file a and carry the losses back up to 3 years if you 're so inclined   it ca n't be used to offset other income unless you die your c and d trades ca n't be on income account except for very unusual circumstances   it 's not generally acceptable to the cra for you to use 2 separate accounting methods   there are some but you should probably just use capital gains    there is one caveat that if you do short sales of canadian listed securities they will be on income account unless you fill out form and elect to have them all treated as capital gains i just remembered one wrinkle in carrying forward capital losses   they do n't reduce your capital gains anymore but they reduce your taxable income   this means your net income wo n't be reduced and any benefits that are calculated from that line will not get an increase

# 467581
there are two things i can think of that might be different in other countries until 2013 american express visa and mastercard prevented businesses from charging extra for credit card usage and credit card surcharges still illegal in several states since credit card companies add a surcharge to credit card purchases and merchants ca n't pass that onto credit card users they just make everyone pay extra instead since everyone gets charged the credit card surcharge you might as well use a credit card and recoup some of that via rewards points almost all credit cards here have grace periods where you wo n't be charged interest if you pay back your loans in full within some period of time at least 21 days this makes credit cards attractive to people who do n't need a loan but like the convenience that credit cards provide not carrying cash extra insurance better fraud protection apparently grace periods are n't required by law here so this might be common in other countries as well

first decide on your asset allocation are you looking for a fund with 60 stocks risky stuff or 40 or 20 second look for funds that have a mix of stocks and bonds good keywords would be target retirement lifecycle balanced conservative moderate allocation as you discover these funds probably the fund website but at least will tell you the percentage in stocks and risk assets vs. in conservative bonds look for funds that have the percentage you decided on or as close to it as possible third build a list of funds that meet your allocation goal and compare the details are they based on index funds or are they actively managed what is the expense ratio is the fund from a reputable company you could certainly ask more questions here if you have several candidates and are n't sure how to choose for investing in us dollars one can't go wrong choice is vanguard and they have several suitable funds but unfortunately if you spend in then you should probably invest in that currency and i do n't know anything about funds in israel update two other options here one is a financial advisor who agrees to do rebalancing for you if you get a cheap one it could be worth it two is that some 401k plans have an automatic rebalancing feature where you have multiple funds but you can set it up so their computer auto rebalances you that 's almost as good as having a single fund though it does still encourage some mental accounting so you 'd have to try to only look at the total balance not the individual fund balances over time anyway both of these could be alternatives ways to go on autopilot besides a single fund

i would differentiate between pricing and valuation a bit more   valuation is the result of investment analysis and the result of coming up with a fair value for a company and its shares this is done usually by equity analysts i have never heard about pricing a security in this context pricing would indicate that the price of a product or security is set by someone i.e. a car manufacturer sets the prices of its new cars the price of a security however is not set by an analyst or an institution it is solely set by the stock market perhaps based on the valuations of different analysts   there is only one exception to this pricing an ipo before its shares are actually traded on an exchange in this case the underwriting banks set the price based on the valuation at which the shares are distributed

i would open a taxable account with the same custodian that manages your roth ira e.g. vanguard fidelity etc then within the taxable account i would invest the extra money in low cost broad market index funds that are tax efficient unlike in your 401(k and roth ira you will now have tax implications if your funds produce dividends or realize a capital gain that is why tax efficient funds are important to minimize this as much as possible   the portfolio is a popular choice for taxable accounts because of simplicity and the tax efficiency of broad market index funds that are part of the three fund portfolio the portfolio normally consists of depending on your tax bracket you may want to consider municipal bonds in your taxable instead of taxable bonds if your tax bracket is 25 or higher   another option is to forgo bonds altogether in the taxable account and just hold bonds in retirement accounts while keeping tax efficient domestic and international funds in your taxable account then adjust the bond portion upward in your retirement accounts to account for the additional stocks in your taxable accounts this will maintain the asset allocation that you 've already chosen that is appropriate for your age and goals

let me add another consideration to the company 's side of the equation   not only is a 401 k a tool for the company to make them competitive when recruiting employees among other companies that offer that benefit it is also a good retention tool most company 's 401 k plans include a vesting period of at least 3 years sometimes more an employee that leaves the company before they are vested in the plan will have to give up some of the employer matched funds in the account this gives employees incentive to stick around longer and the company reduces the risk of turnover which can be costly in terms of training and recruiting this also factors into the reason why employers would rather give matching on the 401 k than a simple pay raise some of those employees are going to leave during the vesting period anyway and when that happens the employer got the benefit of motivating the employee but in the end got to keep some of the money

two parties will agree to pay each other 's interest obligations this is generally for one of two reasons    one party wishes to swap a fixed interest rate eg coupons on a bond for a floating interest rate eg payments on a loan if their counterparty wishes the opposite and the rates are acceptable to both they will agree to swap their obligations   there are two firms based in countries a and b. each firm has a branch in the other 's country and these branches each have a loan denominated in that other countries currency to reduce each firm 's exposure to fx risk they can swap their obligations so a will pay interest on b 's loan which is in a 's currency and b on a 's loan which is in b 's currency   edit removed bracket

buying a house may save you money compared with renting depending on the area and specifics of the transaction including the purchase price interest rates comparable rent etc in addition buying a house may provide you with intangibles that fit your lifestyle goals in a community ability to renovate pride of ownership etc these factors have been discussed in other answers here and in other questions however there is one other way i think potential home buyers should consider the financial impact of home ownership buying a house provides you with a natural hedge against possible future changes in your cost of living assume the following if these two items are true then buying a home allows you to guarantee today that your monthly living expenses will be mostly fixed as long as you live in that community in 2 years if there is an explosion of new residents in your community and housing costs skyrocket does n't affect you your mortgage payment or if you paid cash the lack of mortgage payment is fixed in 3 years if there are 20 new apartment buildings built beside you and housing costs plummet does n't affect you your mortgage payment is fixed if you know that you want to live in a particular place 20 years from now then buying a house in that area today may be a way of ensuring that you can afford to live there in the future remember that while your mortgage payment will be fixed other costs of home ownership will be variable see below you may or may not save money compared with rent over the period you live in your house but by putting your money into a house you have protected yourself against catastrophic rent increases what is the cost of hedging yourself against this risk a the known costs of ownership closing costs on purchase mortgage interest property tax condo fees home insurance etc b the unknown costs of ownership annual and periodic maintenance closing costs on a future sale etc c the potential earnings lost on your down payment mortgage principal payments whether it is low risk interest or higher risk equity d you may have reduced savings for a long period of time which would limit your ability to cover emergencies such as medical costs unexpected unemployment etc e you may have a reduced ability to look for a better job based on being locked into a particular location though i have assumed above that you want to live in a particular community for an extended period of time that desire may change and f you ca n't reap the benefits of a rental market that decreases in real dollars if that happens in your market over time in short purchasing a home should be a lifestyle motivated decision it financially reduces some the fluctuation in your long term living costs with the trade off of committed principal dollars and additional ownership risks including limited mobility

here are the few scenarios that may be worth noting in terms of using different types of accounts traditional ira in this case the monies would grow tax deferred and all monies coming out will be taxed as ordinary income think of it as everything is in one big black box and the whole thing is coming out to be taxed roth ira in this case you could withdraw the contributions anytime without penalty source should one want it for further research past 59.5 the withdrawals are tax free in my understanding thus one could access some monies earlier than retirement age if one considers all the contributions that are at least 5 years old taxable account in this case each year there will be distributions to pay taxes as well as anytime one sells shares as that will trigger capital gains in this case taxes are worth noting as depending on the index fund one may have various taxes to consider for example a bond index fund may have some interest that would be taxed that the ira could shelter to some extent while index funds can be a low cost option in some cases there may be capital gains each year to keep up with the index for example small cap indices and value indices would have stocks that may the index by either becoming mid cap or large cap in the case of small cap or the value stock 's valuation rises enough that it becomes a growth stock that is pulled out of the index this is why some people may prefer to use tax advantaged accounts for those funds that may not be as tax efficient the bogleheads have an article on various accounts that can also be useful as 's comment referenced disclosure i 'm not an accountant or work for the irs

there are two or three issues here one is how quickly can you get cash out of your investments if you had an unexpected expense if you suddenly needed more cash than you have on hand how long would it take to get money out of your scott trade account or wherever it is i have a td ameritrade account which is pretty similar and it just takes a couple of days to get money out i 'm hard pressed to think of a time when i literally needed a bunch of cash today with no advance warning what sudden bills is one likely to have a medical bill perhaps but hey just a few weeks ago i had to go to the emergency room with a medical problem and it 's not like they demanded cash on the table before they 'd help me i just got the bill maybe 3 weeks after the event i 've never decided to move and then actually moved 2 days later these things take some planning etc second how much risk are you willing to tolerate if you have your money in the stock market the market could go down just as you need the cash that 's not even a worst case scenario extreme scenario after all if the economy gets bad the stock market could go down and the same fact could result in your employer laying you off that said you could reduce this risk by keeping some of your money in a low risk investment like some high quality bonds third you want to have cash to cover the more modest routine expenses like make sure you always have enough cash on hand to pay the rent or mortgage buy food and so on and fourth you want to keep a cushion against bookkeeping mistakes i 've had twice in my life that i 've overdrawn a checking account not because i was broke but because i messed up my records and thought i had more money in the account than i really did it 's impossible to give exact numbers without knowing a lot about your income and expenses but for myself i keep a cushion of $ 1,000 to $ in my checking account on top of all regular bills that i know i 'll have to pay in the next month to cover modest unexpected expenses and mistakes i pay most of my bills by credit card for convenience pay the balance in full when i get the bill so i do n't pay interest so i do n't need a lot of cushion i used to keep 2 to 3 months pay in an account invested in bonds and very safe stocks something that would n't lose much value even in bad times since my daughter started college i 've run this down to less than 1 months pay and instead of replacing that money i 'm instead putting my spare money into more general stocks which is admittedly riskier so between the two accounts i have a little over 2 months pay which i think is low but as i say i 'm trying to get my kids through college so i 've run down my savings some i think if i had more than 6 months pay in easily liquidated assets then unless i expected to need a bunch of cash for something buying a new house or some such i 'd be transferring that to a retirement account with tax advantages

because so many businesses make some money through some form of compound interest like a business that saves its earnings in a business account that pays interest it heavily depends on how strict you interpret this law   some muslims i know interpret it to mean directly and indirectly while for some it 's just direct interest earned what i would suggest is either a direct investment in agriculture or a share in agriculture where you are directly paid from your share in the investment and not through money that comes from a bank account earning interest   if you do a direct investment in agriculture like owning livestock you will be paid money in the form of food which compounds through reproduction and can sell the offspring to others and collect the money   year to date agriculture is crushing the s&p 500 and many places around the world are facing shortages in food like sugar and corn if you do n't have enough money for a direct investment you can try the share route where you own a share of a direct investment   rather than go through stock exchanges where many of these companies make money indirectly through interest also you can negotiate directly with farmers livestock owners etc   some of these individuals are looking to diversify their money so they may be willing to let you own a fraction of what they produce and pay you directly all of this comes with risk of course   livestock and plants die for a variety of reasons but none of it will be interest from lending whether to individuals or through a bank   in addition if we experience very high inflation in the future livestock and plants do very well in this environment

technically you owe self employment taxes not fica taxes because they are imposed under a different law however since se taxes are by design exactly the same rates as combining the two halves of fica employer and employee it is quite reasonable to treat them as equivalent se taxes and income tax also are based on your net self employment income after deducting business expenses but not non business items like your home mortgage dependent exemptions etc which factor only into income tax you owe se medicare tax 2.9 on all your se net income unless it is under $ 400 adjusted down by 7.65 to compensate for the fact that the employer half of fica is excluded from gross income before the employee half is computed you owe se social security tax 12.4 on your adjusted se net income unless and until the total income subject to i.e. your w-2 wages plus your adjusted se net income exceeds a cap that varies with inflation and is $ for 2017 otoh if income exceeds $ 200k single or $ 250k joint you owe additional medicare tax 0.9 on the excess if your w-2 income alone exceeds this limit your employer should withhold for it however the additional medicare tax is part of obamacare ppaca which the new president and republican have said they will repeal and replace whether any such replacement will affect this for ty 2017 is at best uncertain at this point yes se taxes are added to income tax on your 1040 with schedule se attached and schedule c e f as applicable to your business virtually so if you file electronically and paid together you are supposed to pay at least 90 during the year by having withholding increased on your w-2 job or by making quarterly estimated payments irs quarters are not exactly quarters but close or any combination but if this is your first year which you do n't say but someone who had gone through this before probably would n't ask you may get away with not paying during the year as normally required specifically if your w-2 withholding is not enough to cover your increased taxes for this year because of the additional income and se taxes but it is enough to cover your tax for the previous year and your agi that year was n't over $ 150k then there is a safe harbor and you wo n't owe any penalty although you must keep enough money on hand to pay the tax by april 15 but for your second year and onwards your previous year now includes se amounts and this does n't help similar related

i have read from lot of places that transferring funds from nro to nre is possible given correct documents are provided yes this is correct the key document 15cb establishes that you have paid taxes that were due before money is transferred from the nro account to the nre account and/or are repatriated here is what i am simply steps 3 4 more so the step 4 can be seen as new income so the source of the funds is originally from nre account however the ca feels that since my withdrawal and deposit mechanism in nro is cash i might be subject to questioning    is there any issues in doing the above the ca is right the cash withdrawal and cash deposit has broken the link between the money withdrawn and the money deposited it could easily be the case that the cash withdrawals were spent on expenses and the cash deposit is new taxable income to you this new income needs to be declared and the taxes paid if you uncle is a close relative the exact relationships that are called close relatives are defined by law the return of the money can be declared to be a gift from your uncle to you and no taxes are due from you on the money if the funds are large it is advised to have a gift deed it is not a simple matter of creating a gift deed stating that your uncle has given you a gift your uncle has to show how he acquired so many assets that he gave you some money as a gift and whether appropriate taxes were paid by him   if your uncle is not a close relative he can still gift you up to rs 50,000 per year without you having to pay any income tax on the money received but again a gift deed would be needed to account for the cash deposits in short keep speaking to your ca he will advise you on the best course of action related question transfering money from nre account in india to family member

americans do n't actually believe that there are no categories where other countries surpass them   they believe that the unique mix of characteristics the country does have is the best mix available   people who say the united states is the best country in the world are n't saying that every aspect of american life is better than every aspect of life in any other country in the world   they 're saying that they 're willing to trade bad high schools for the best universities that they would rather have a world dominating gdp and a decent per capita than a world dominating gdp per capita alone that they would rather have new york city than hong kong   they 're pointing out that the infant mortality rate between first world countries is essentially equal and that the rankings hide the fact that the differences are negligible   they 're not saying our health care system is better that our public transportation is better or even that our airlines are the most efficient   they 're saying that in the weighted matrix of categories no country gets a better score despite getting high scores in many areas   they 're simply pointing out that their weight factors are different from yours   the anti that is most honest is that of people like the of north korea who say honestly they do n't like america because it is so large and successful and that they hate it when this success is used to further human rights   but the more and dishonest version does n't recognize this and attempts to hold up a straw man that americans who say this is the greatest country on earth are stupid anti who honestly believe that there is n't a single statistic in which america does n't top the world   these americans are imaginary   they do n't exist except in the of jealous or as tiny fringe minorities in counties far removed from economic centers   america is the great experiment of the enlightenment   it was the first country to be ruled by liberal democracy   and it is n't threatened when others join in the wealth generation that the philosophy yields   indeed they celebrate it   they even go too far in trying to spread it

if you want to keep any consistent standard you need to knuckle down and make those transaction entries honestly this is a lot faster doing in bulk than doing day by day   but change how you account so it is n't annoying   i minimize my transactions   for instance i deposit all income whole for tracking but stop tracking when the money is converted to cash or gift card money i log adding $ 50 to a mcdonalds gift card but not the individual meals   i only use cash for the myriad small things i do not want to track fast food parking meters etc   anything big or that i want to track goes on a credit card   then it 's easy to reconcile credit cards to accounting system    ryan 's law if it was n't written down it did n't happen

up to some degree a higher or lower interest rate means a bit less or a bit more money in your pocket if the interest rate gets too high you may be in trouble so you first look at the situation and ask yourself at what interest rate would i be in trouble   if this is a $ 20,000 student loan then even a very high rate would n't be trouble it would be unfortunate and unpleasant but not fatal for a $ 800,000 mortgage that 's different each percent more is $ 8,000 a year going from 3 to 10 would change the interest from $ 24,000 to $ 80,000 a year which would be fatal for many people   in a situation where you can afford increasing variable payments without problems you can go for it if your variable rate would vary over time between 4 and 6 you would still be even in that situation go for variable taking into account where you think interest rates will go in the future for a mortgage the security would likely be more important on the other hand if your dad is a multi millionaire who would help you out then that big rate increase would n't be fatal and you could go for a variable rate mortgage   in some countries you can cancel any loan contract when the interest rate is raised so raising a variable mortgage interest rate would allow you to look elsewhere without early repayment penalties check out if that is the case for you

i 'd add this is actually the way any stock opens every day i.e. the closing price of the prior day is what it is but the opening price will reflect whatever news there was prior to the day 's open if you watch the business news you 'll often see that some stock has an order imbalance and has not opened yet at the normal time so as geo stated those who were sold shares at the ipo price paid $ 38 but then the stock could open at whatever price was the point where bid and ask balanced    i snapped a screen capture of this chart on the first day of trading the daily charts are n't archived where i can find them this is from yahoo finance you can see the $ 42 open from those who simply wanted in but could n't wait the willingness of sellers to grab their profit right back to what they paid and then another wave of buying but then a sell off it closed virtually unchanged from the ipo price

for this to work those who control the dilution must also control their salaries because the only way for them to be paid off when it 's the corporation itself selling is to gain access to the proceeds when a corporation sells newly issued equity the corporation itself owns the money   to at least have the appearance of the scammers must be paid those proceeds   both actions imply that the board is captured by the scammers there are many corporations that seem to do this even with persistently large market the key difference between this and pump and dump is that its a fraudulent group of investors selling in this case instead of the corporation itself a detailed simple example corporations are mandated by law to be little although republic is now becoming more appropriate with all of the new shareholder rights   a corporation is controlled at root by the board of directors who are elected by the shareholders   the board has no direct operational control as that is left to the king the ceo however the board does control what everyone wants access to the money board members have all sorts of legal qualitative mandates on how to behave and they 've fairly decently efficiently over the long run but there are definitely some bad apples boards are somewhat since it 's difficult to hold board elections and usually only specific board members are put up for election by a shareholder vote so a bad one has the potential to really get stuck in there   once a bad one is in there they do n't care because they know it will be tough to get them out so they run over the company 's purse only the board can take action on major funding such as the ceo 's operating budget board compensation financing investment etc some with shareholder approval some without   the corporation itself owns all of those assets but the board controls them in this example they scheme with most likely the top executive but a rubber stamp top executive could allow a lower rung to scheme with the board but the board is always constant until the law is changed because there 's no honor amongst thieves the board votes which can require some combination of executive and shareholder approval are taken very close together sell shares increase salaries to key executive increase board compensation   the trusting shareholders believe this is in the best interests of the company at large so go along so the money flows from existing new shareholders to the corporation now controlled by a malicious board and then finally to the necessary malicious executive and the vital malicious board

investing $ 100k into physical gold bars or coins is the most prudent option given the state of economic turmoil worldwide   take a look at the long term charts they 're pretty self explanatory    gold has an upward trend for 100 + years   a more high risk high reward investment would be to buy $ 100k of physical silver   silver has a similar track record and inherent benefits of gold   yet with a combination of factors that could make it even more bull than gold better liquidity industrial demand    beyond that you may want to look at other commodities such as oil and agriculture   the point is this is troubled times for worldwide economies   times like this you want to invest in real things like commodities or companies that are actually producing essential materials

it would be worthwhile reading into guarantor mortgages or family offset mortgages to achieve the same outcome ideally you are wanting the wealth of your parents to help make a mortgage more accessible to you the first thought is to merely transfer money physically however for the reasons listed in the other posts this carries potential problems a guarantor mortgage will mean your parents agree to pay the portion about 75 ltv if you stop paying you may take out a 95 ltv mortgage and therefore only have to find 5 deposit but benefit from the interest rates of a 75 loan personally the chances of causing a family rift if things go pear shaped would steer me away from this one each to their own though a family offset mortgage involves money rather than a guarantee it will allow for the parents to dedicate some of their money to a third party ie the bank or building society so that you can achieve a mortgage in practice parents deposit money in a dedicated savings account the bank adds that amount to whatever deposit you may have and the combined amount is treated as the deposit towards the mortgage once your ltv reduces over time by repayments and house value rises your parents have their money returned and you carry on as normal here 's an independent which article i 'd also read a couple of provider 's pages to get a feel for the idea or or not endorsements obviously just a way to understand the concept and get a feel for the language they use in short using the money indirectly is much cleaner than your parents actually just giving you such a large sum and then you having to pay it back

here is what we do   we use ynab to do our budgeting and track our expenses   anything that gets paid electronically is tracked to the penny   it really needs to be because you want your transaction records to match your bank 's transaction records however for cash spending we only count the paper money not the coins   here is how it works if i want a coke out of a vending machine for 75 cents and i put a dollar bill in and get a quarter back as change i record that as a $ 1.00 expense if instead i put 3 quarters in to get the coke i do n't record that expense at all   spending coins is free money   we do this mainly because it is just easier to keep track of   i can quickly count the cash in my wallet and verify that it matches the amount that ynab thinks i have in my wallet and i do n't need to worry about the coins   coins that are in my car to pay for parking meters or coins in the dish on my do n't need to be counted this works for us mainly because we do n't do a whole lot of cash spending so the amount we are off just does n't add up to a significant portion of our spending   and again bank balances are exact to the penny

this is almost a question in financial engineering first i will note that a discussion of the greeks is well presented at these measures are first second and higher order derivatives or rate of change comparisons for information that is generally instantaneous bear with me for example the most popular delta compares prices of an option or other derived asset to the underlying asset price the reason we are able to do all this cool analysis is because the the value of the underlying and derived assets have a direct instantaneous relationship on each other because beta is calculated over a large period of time and because each time slice covered contributes equally to the aggregate then the difference in beta would really just be showing two pieces of information summarizing those two pieces of information into delta beta would not be useful to me for further discussion please see specifically look at the huge difference in calculation of ge 's beta using end of month returns versus calculation using day before end of month returns

something to note is that when a company announces a share buyback program there is usually a time frame and amount of shares that are important details as it is n't like the company will make one big buy back of stock generally   rather it may take months or even years as noted in the wikipedia article about share repurchases wikipedia covers some of the technical details here but to give a specific set of answers when a company announces a share buyback program who do they actually    buy back the shares from   from the wikipedia link under us corporate law there are five primary methods of stock repurchase open market private negotiations repurchase put rights and two variants of self tender repurchase a fixed price tender offer and a dutch auction thus there are open market and a couple of other possibilities openly traded shares on a stock exchange   possibly though there are other options is there a fixed price that    they buy back at sometimes   i 'd think a fixed price tender offer would imply a fixed price though the open market way may take various prices if i own shares in that company can i get them to buy back my shares selective buy backs is noted in wikipedia as in broad terms a selective buy back is one in which identical offers are not made to every shareholder for example if offers are made to only some of the shareholders in the company in the us no special shareholder approval of a selective buy back is required in the uk the scheme must first be approved by all shareholders or by a special resolution requiring a 75 majority of the members in which no vote is cast by selling shareholders or their associates selling shareholders may not vote in favor of a special resolution to approve a selective buy back the notice to shareholders the meeting to vote on a selective buy back must include a statement setting out all material information that is relevant to the proposal although it is not necessary for the company to provide information already disclosed to the shareholders if that would be unreasonable thus it is possible though how probable is another question while not in the question something to consider is how the buybacks can be done as a result of offsetting the dilution of employees who have stock options that may exercise them and spread the earnings over more shares but this is more on understanding the employee stock option scenario that various big companies use when it comes to giving employees an incentive to help the stock price

in less than two decades more than half of all publicly traded companies have disappeared there were u.s. stocks in november 1997 according to the center for research in security prices at the university of chicago ’s booth school of business nowadays there are fewer than 3,600   a close look at the data helps explain why stock pickers have been underperforming and the shrinking number of companies should make all investors more skeptical about the market beating claims of recently trendy strategies   back in november 1997 there were more than 2,500 small stocks and nearly 4,000 tiny microcap stocks according to crsp at the end of 2016 fewer than 1,200 small and just under 1,900 microcap stocks were left   most of those companies melted away between 2000 and 2012 but the numbers so far show no signs of recovering   several factors explain the shrinking number of stocks analysts say including the regulatory red tape that discourages smaller companies from going and staying public the flood of venture capital funding that enables young companies to stay private longer and the rise of private equity funds whose buyouts take shares off the public market   for stock pickers differentiating among the remaining choices is an even harder game than it was when the market consisted of twice as many companies says michael an investment strategist at credit suisse in new york who wrote a report this spring titled the incredible shrinking universe of stocks   that ’s because the surviving companies tend to be fewer bigger older more profitable and easier to analyze he says making stock picking much more competitive   consider small stock funds often they compare themselves to the russell 2000 an index of the u.s. stocks ranked through 3,000 by total market value twenty years ago there were over 4,000 stocks smaller than the inclusion cutoff for the russell 2000 says pastor a finance professor at the university of chicago that number is down to less than 1,000 today   so fund managers have far fewer stocks to choose from if they venture outside the index the very area where the best bargains might be found more money chasing fewer stocks could lead some fund managers to buy regardless of value   eric is a veteran portfolio manager with a solid record of investing in small stocks last year he took the drastic step of shutting down his roughly $ 400 million mutual fund river road independent value and giving his investors their money back   prices got so crazy in small caps i fired myself he says my portfolio was 90 in cash at the end because i could n’t find anything to buy if i ’d kept investing i was sure i ’d lose people their money   he adds it was the hardest thing i ’ve ever done professionally but i did n’t feel i had a choice i knew my companies were overvalued   mr. hopes to return to the market when in his view values become attractive again he does n’t expect recent conditions to be permanent   the evaporation of thousands of companies may have one enduring result however and it could catch many investors by surprise   most research on historical returns points out mr. is based on the days when the stock market had twice as many companies as it does today was the population of companies so different then he asks that the inferences we draw from it might no longer be valid   so called factor investing also known as systematic or smart beta investing picks hundreds or thousands of stocks at a time based on common sources of risk and return among them how big companies are how much their shares fluctuate how expensive their shares are relative to asset value and so on   but the historical outperformance of many such factors may have been driven largely by the tiniest companies exactly those that have disappeared from the market in droves   before concluding that small stocks or cheap value stocks will the market as as they did in the past you should pause to consider how they will perform without the from thousands of tiny stocks that no longer exist   the stock market has more than tripled in the past eight years so the eclipse of so many companies has n’t been a catastrophe but it does imply that investing in some of the market ’s strategies might be less profitable in the future than they looked in the past

when evaluating a refinance you need to figure out the payback time refinancing costs money in closing costs the payback time is the time it takes to recover the closing costs with the amount of money you are saving in interest   for example if the closing costs are $ 2,000 your payback time is 2 years if it takes 2 years to save that amount in interest with the new interest rate vs. the old one   to estimate this look at the difference in interest rate between your mortgage and the new one and your mortgage balance for example let 's say that you have $ 100,000 left on your mortgage and the new rate is 1 lower than your current rate in one year you will save roughly $ 1,000 in interest if your closing costs are $ 2,000 then your payback time is somewhere around 2 years if you plan on staying in this house longer than the payback time then it is beneficial to refinance   there are mortgage refinance calculators online that will calculate payback time more precisely   one thing to watch out for when you refinance if you expand the term of your mortgage you might end up paying more interest over the long term even though your rate is less and your monthly payment is less for example let 's say you currently have 8 years left on a 15-year mortgage if you refinance to a new 15-year mortgage your monthly payment will go down but if you only pay the new minimum payment for the next 15 years you could end up paying more in interest than if you had just continued with your old mortgage for the next 8 years to avoid this refinance to a new mortgage with a term close to what you have left on your current mortgage if you ca n't do that continue paying whatever your current monthly payment is after you refinance and you 'll pay your new mortgage early and save on interest

if you are providing vat liable services you are and you register normally for vat then you will be able to reclaim vat on your buisness purchases but you will have to charge vat to your clients so the question really comes down to will your clients regard you adding vat to their invoices as a price increase or not that is likely to depend on whether your clients are in a position to claim back the vat you charged them if you are working mostly for vat registered who perform vat liable including zero rated activities then registering for vat is likely in your financial interests though it does mean more paperwork the flat rate scheme may be better still if you are working mostly for private individuals non vat registered or which perform vat exempt activities then registering for vat when you do n't have to is most likely not in your financial interests note vat exempt and zero rated for vat are very different things even though they look similar to the customer

there is n't a single rate that works in both directions   there are two rates one for each direction   so if $ 1 = inr you may find that 100 inr = $    in fact it 's even worse than that   the rates are just the average values at which transactions occur   what happens in the real world is that someone presumably your bank in this instance offers to sell 100 inr for some amount perhaps $   other traders may either accept this price or refuse to trade   if they refuse to trade the bank may accept one of their offers perhaps $    anyway the answer to your question is that whomever does the actual conversion keeps the difference   of course they may then lose that money if the value falls before they sell   more either your bank or your friend 's bank could do the conversion itself   either or both could hold balances in various currencies so that they do n't have to rely on the of the exchange market   this is called a money market account and banks let their customers invest in them    it is a bit more likely to be your bank that gets the money than your friend 's bank   your friend 's bank does n't actually need to know that your account is in usd   they just transfer the amount in inr   it 's your bank that has to convert that into usd to deposit in your account

to start with gold has value because it is scarce durable attractive and can be made into jewellery but that does not explain its current value in the current economic climate it is difficult for many investors to get a positive return on conventional investments such as equities or bonds i that in such conditions investors decide to park their money in gold simply because there are few other good options this in itself drives the price of gold up making it a better investment and causing a speculative boom as you will see here here and here the gold price is negatively correlated with stock market indices

no   the more legs you add onto your trade the more commissions you will pay entering and exiting the trade and the more opportunity for slippage   so lets head the other direction    can we make a simple risk free option trade with as few legs as possible the not really surprising answer is yes but there is no free lunch as you will see   according to financial theory any riskless position will earn the risk free rate which right now is almost nothing nada 0    let 's test this out with a little example in theory a riskless position can be constructed from buying a stock selling a call option and buying a put option   this combination should earn the risk free rate selling the call option means you get money now but agree to let someone else have the stock at an agreed contract price if the price goes up   buying the put option means you pay money now but can sell the stock to someone at a pre agreed contract price if you want to do so which would only be when the price declines below the contract price   to start our risk free trade buy google stock goog at the oct 3 close    x = $ the example has 100 shares for compatibility with the options contracts which require 100 share blocks we will sell a call and buy a put contract price of $ 500 for jan    therefore we will receive $ 50,000 for certain on jan unless the options clearing system fails because of say global financial collapse or war with according to google finance if we had sold a call today at the close we would receive the bid which is or $ total   and if we had bought a put today at the close we would pay the ask which is or $ total so to receive $ 50,000 for certain on jan we could pay $ for the goog stock minus $ for the money we received selling the call option plus a payment of $ for the put option we need to protect the value   the total is $    if we pay $ today plus execute the option strategy shown we would have $ 50,000 on jan   this is a profit of $ 158 the options commissions are going to be around $ so in total the profit is around $ 120 after commissions    on the other hand in a bank cd for 12 months at 1.1 will yield $ 550 in similarly risk free interest    given that it is difficult to actually make these trades simultaneously in practice with the prices jumping all around i would say if you really want a low risk option trade then a bank cd looks like the safer bet   this is n't to say you ca n't find another combination of stock and contract price that does better than a bank cd but i doubt it will ever be better by very much and still difficult to monitor and align the trades in practice

i 'm a most probably all of those older items were sold both prior to my establishing the llc this is a hobby of yours this is not your business you purchased all of these goods for your pleasure not for their future profit the later items that you bought after your llc was establish served both purposes perks of doing what you love   how should i go about reporting this income for the items i do n't have records for how much i purchased them for   there 's nothing you can do as noted above these items if you were to testify in court against the irs losses from the sale of personal use property such as your home or car are n't tax deductible source do i need to indicate 100 of the income because i ca n't prove that i sold it at a loss yes if you do not have previous records you must claim a 100 capital gain source addition as joetaxpayer has mentioned in the comments the second source i posted is for stocks and bonds   so at year begin of 2016 i started selling what i did n't need on ebay and on various forums january september because you are not in the business of doing this you do not need to explain the cost but you do need to report the income as gross income on your 1040 yes if you bought a tv three years ago for a $ 100 and sold it for $ 50 the irs would recognize you earning $ 50   as these are all personal items they can not be deducted regardless of gain or loss source later in the year 2016 october i started an llc october december if these are items that you did not record early in the process of your llc then it is reported as a 100 gain as you can not prove any business expenses or costs to acquire associated with it   source refer to above answer   refer to above answer   conclusion again this is a income tax question that is split between business and personal use items this is not a question of other 's assessment of the value of the asset it is solely based on the instruments of the irs and their assessment of gains and losses from businesses as op does not have the necessary documents to prove otherwise a cost basis of $ 0 must be assumed thus you have a 100 gain on sale

answers to this your question break down along a few lines regarding opportunity costs of tying up a significant chunk of your salary and assets in one piece of property as opposed to other things you 'd like to do with your life   the 30 year standard mortgage was invented in the 30 's as part of fdr 's new deal to make housing affordable to more people while the strain on the market of foreclosed homes from ~10 year interest only balloon mortgages sound familiar the 30 year term tends to follow the career of the average american of that era allowing them to pay the house off and live out the remainder of their lives there at a lower cost   houses are depreciating assets because they wear out over time their greatest investment value is a place to live the appreciation on a home comes from the real estate it sits on and the community the property is located in value is determined by desirability of the house and community in their current state and the supply of property in the area this value can only be extracted when you sell the home this partially answers your last question noting that you should n't buy a really expensive building for investment value we 've learned in recent years that there are no long term guarantees of property value either because land and communities can decrease in value due to unemployment over supply crime pollution etc only buy as much home as you will need in the next decade or so in a place that you will like living over that time period and do n't consider it much of an investment i will tell you to get a fifteen year fixed rate mortgage since it 's readily available at lower rates and has a significantly lower total purchase price than the standard 30 years the monthly payment difference is n't that great and anyone who looks at the monthly payment as opposed to the total costs your priorities and the opportunity costs should n't be trusted for financial advice i do n't like debt there are psychological benefits to being free from the and drain of a long term mortgage on your finances   the biggest argument for paying off your home quickly is freedom to pursue other desires with all of your salary and the assets you have available to you some financial advisers will tell you to keep your mortgage costs under 25 of your income so that you can actually live off the money you make i would also recommend paying at least enough into your 401k to get the company match and fully funding your roth ira i 'd also have an emergency fund to cover at least 6 months of expenses including this mortgage in case you lose your job a 15 or 20 year mortgage will give you breathing room to take care of these other priorities and you can overpay on almost any mortgage to decrease the principal and finish in a shorter time period make sure to get a mortgage that allows prepayment more financially savvy people may tell you to take the 30 year mortgage and invest the difference especially with mortgage rates around 4 this is a very cheap way to increase your purchasing power and total assets most people lack the investment prowess and self discipline to make this plan pay off there are even fewer guarantees regarding markets and investments than property this also is a way of diversifying your total assets to protect against loss of value in your home this approach has for thousands of people who are underwater on their homes this problem is often compounded by job loss forcing you to move or increasing your commute making your home less desirable for you some people will tell you to maintain the mortgage for the tax credit this fails a basic math test since you only get about a quarter of the money depending on your tax rate that you are paying in interest back from the government the rest of the money goes to bank at no gain to you this approach is basically a taxpayer subsidized decrease of your 4 interest payment to a 3 interest payment assuming you have ~ $ 5000 in other deductions and only pays off if you can successfully invest the money at a rate somewhat greater than 3

how you should record the mortgage payments depends on if you are trying to achieve correct accounting according to the standards or if you are just tracking everything for you and your friends if you 're just keeping track for personal reasons i 'd suggest that you set up your check or journal entry your preference how you 'd like it to be recorded   then memorize that transaction   this allows you to use it as many times as you need to without having to set it up each time   also note there is no way to record a transaction that decreases cash and increases equity if you 're trying to keep track of everything according to accounting standards which it should be if you 've set up an official business then you have a lot more tracking to do with each payment   mortgage payments technically do not affect the equity accounts of the owners   each mortgage payment should decrease the bank balance increase interest expense and decrease the mortgage balance not to mention tracking any escrow account you may have   the equity accounts would be affected if the owners are contributing funds to the bank account but equity would increase at the time the funds are deposited not when the mortgage payments are made hope this helps

keep in mind that the federal reserve chairman needs to be very careful with his use of words   here 's what he said it is arguable that interest rates are too high that they are being constrained by the fact that interest rates ca n't go below zero we have an economy where demand falls far short of the capacity of the economy to produce we have an economy where the amount of investment in durable goods spending is far less than the capacity of the economy to produce that suggests that interest rates in some sense should be lower rather than higher we ca n't make interest rates lower of course they only can go down to zero and again i would argue that a healthy economy with good returns is the best way to get returns to savers so what does that mean when he says that we ca n't make interest rates lower that does n't mean that it is n't possible he 's saying that our demand for goods is lower than our ability to produce them negative interest would actually make that problem worse if i know that things will cost less in a month i 'm not going to buy anything the fed is incentivizing spending by lowering the cost of capital to zero by continuing this policy they are eventually going to bring on inflation which will reduce the value of the currency which gives people and companies that are sitting on money an dis incentive to continue hoarding it

i think optimal is a term that needs to be better qualified what 's optimal investment for one person is not necessary optimal for another as it depends on the investor 's time horizon risk tolerance and investment knowledge i would personally put fix income or products that generates incomes that cra considers as interest products in the tfsa so the gains are n't taxed at all   i would consider putting preferred shares in this account as well since dividend incomes are taxed higher than capital gain and preferred shares do n't usually change in price unless the company 's ability to pay the dividends are in doubt   i do n't want to put common equities in tfsa as that would take away your ability to leverage past losses to reduce future capital gains if you are using tfsa as a way to accelerate saving for a near term purchase then you definitely want to employ fix income products as the underlying saving vehicle since market volatility would be your enemy unless you are feeling very lucky    if you are using tfsa as a way to supplement your registered retirement saving account then you can treat it the same way you would invest in your rrsp

you are confusing two things   one is the business side and the other is the social safety net   i believe very strongly in a social safety net   i do not believe in a business safety net   if you do n't want progress then have central planning let the central planners work out how much to make of everything and direct employers on how many people to employ   there wo n't be any overt creative destruction there will however be a significant decrease in prosperity   it is like getting a lower rate of interest does n't seem to be so bad in the short term but really bites in the long term

both types of plans offer a tax benefit   a traditional ira allows you to invest pre tax money into the account and it grows tax free once you withdraw the money it then gets taxed as though it were income based on the amount you withdraw for that calendar year a roth ira has you invest post tax money and also grows tax free however when you make withdraws in retirement that money is then tax free   neither plan is right for everybody if you have a very high income now and plan on being in a smaller tax bracket later when you 'll be making withdraws then the traditional ira is better if you will be in a higher bracket later then the roth ira will serve you more depending on the way you manage your retirement investing you can likely invest in both if you are unsure as to which would be better the same type of investments should be able to be within each type

you can definitely open an ira and roll the money over i suggest instead of trying opening online calling the institution and asking what would be the procedure in your specific case if not i will have to cash out my 401k. who do i contact to find out    if my country has some sort of deal with the us in regards to taxes i    would of course prefer to not pay the penalty 20 federal + 10    state tax and instead reinvest the money in a retirement fund in my    country us some times have listings of tax advisers who work with us expats in the countries they cover you can check for such a list on the website of your local us embassy these people will be able to answer this question however it is highly unlikely that you 'll be able to avoid the tax and penalty in the us in this scenario it is not likely that you could roll over into a foreign retirement fund from your country 's laws perspective but maybe your country has some solution for this

depending on the details of your solar panel setup the monthly savings may change depending on changes in the law or utility company policy   this could change how long it will take for the solar panels to pay for themselves   so your bullet point about the payback even point is not fixed at the moment you buy the solar panels it depends on costs you will incur over many years and those costs could turn out to be different from what you originally thought at least in the us home solar installations typically work by selling excess power back to the power company   the power company can change the amount that it pays you for that power   there is also typically a minimum charge for being connected to the grid and the power company can raise that charge   this article mentions one such possible change   the power companies want to keep making money and as more people start adding solar panels the power companies may change their rate structure to make that less financially feasible you can avoid many of these issues if your solar panels are not connected to the public electricity grid and you for instance store power with your own battery   however at least in the us this is very uncommon because it is more complex and expensive

you do n't offer any specifics so i 'm guessing a little about what you 're talking about but here 's a few thoughts remember that all tax related transactions are reconciled when you file all of your activity for the year is totaled up and for the most part when during the year things happen is irrelevant    your gross taxable income is calculated which will exclude any pre tax activity deduction applied which will any include and post tax deductions tax liability calculated and withholdings subtracted to get your net tax due   whether you have pre tax activity and less tax withheld or after tax activity with a deduction and reduce your net tax the net effect should be the same

as someone with a lot of student loan debt i can relate the first thing you should do is read the promissory note on your current loans there might be information there you can use   for govt loans stafford etc made after july 1 2006 the interest rate is going to be fixed and even a federal direct consolidation is not going to lower the rates themselves   if anything consolidation will just increase the repayment period which means you 'll end up paying more in the long run    most private loans usually offer variable interest rates which today are quite low but unless your financial situation is very comfortable and stable consolidating out of federally guaranteed loans into private loans might not be the best path   you might lose options like deferment forbearance and maybe even things like a death benefit if you die your loans die with you related if you have a co signer you do n't get that death benefit but refinancing into a variable rate private loan is going to push a lot of risk to you in terms of interest rate inflation etc most financial professionals will agree that interest rates can only go up in the long run keep in mind student loans are completely unsecured meaning lenders are taking a fairly large risk in loaning money and probably why the fed govt has to guarantee most of them   i 've heard of people borrowing against their home equity to pay down student loan debt but i ca n't think of a reason you 'd want to substitute secured for unsecured debt and possibly lose the loan interest tax deduction   the bottom line is you 're unlikely to find an alternative lending source at a lower interest rate for an unsecured student loan   another option may be the income based repayment plan if you qualify it caps student loan monthly payments at 15 of your discretionary income discretionary is your income minus whatever the poverty threshold income amount is and if that 15 does n't even cover the interest on the loans the govt picks up the tab for the difference for up to 3 years you have to re qualify every year by sending in all sorts of documentation but if you somehow stay on for 25 years your loans are then forgiven obviously the downside here is that you are probably paying little to no principal but if you do the math and determine that your payment would be next to nothing and your current situation is barely paying interest only well maybe is n't a bad thing for a couple of years or 25 if you think you will never have a larger income    personally i went through all these options as well and decided that my best option was to just earn more money a 2nd job or side project here and there helps me pay down the debt faster and with less risk than moving to private variable rate loans

my concern is that just moving the balance will make you feel like you 've accomplished something when you really have n't   sure you 'll save on interest but that just reduces the rate at which you 're bleeding and does n't heal the wound   it 's entirely likely that you 'll feel freed by the reduced balance on the original card ignore the transferred balance since you are n't paying any interest on it and soon you 'll have two cards that are maxed out i would instead look at getting your expenses under control make sure you have the start of an emergency fund 1 2k depending on your family situation if you are single start with 1k if you have kids bump it up to 2k or maybe a little more just to avoid charging any expenses get on a written budget and do n't spend any money in the next month that is not accounted for   then you can figure out how much you can afford to put towards the credit card   that will also tell you how much interest you 're going to pay    the only way i would recommend the balance transfer is if the interest savings after the balance transfer fee reduced the time it takes to pay off the card by two or more months since one month is n't going to make a big difference interest wise and you immediately cancelled the original card and cut up both cards including the new one making payments by mail or online   other than that the interest saved after the balance transfer fee probably is n't worth the risk of being in a worse situation on the other side

this is a tough question   let 's try and the metric first let 's expand upon the notion share price is determined in an efficient market where prospective buyers and sellers have access to info on an enterprises cash balance and they may weigh that into their decision making   therefore a desirable undesirable cash balance may raise or lower the share price to what extent we do not know    we must ask how significant is cash debt balance in determining the market price of a stock    as you noted we have limited info which may decrease the weight of these account balances in our decision process using a level of 5 of net income of operations cash debt may be immaterial or not considered by an investor investors oftentimes interpret the same information differently e.g. microsoft 's large cash balance may show they no longer have innovative ideas worth investing in or they are well positioned to acquire innovative companies or weather a contraction in the sector my guess is a math mind would ignore the affect of account balances on the equity portion of the enterprise value calculation because it may not be a factor or because the affect is subjective

so let 's take a mortgage loan that allows prepayment without penalty say i have a 30 year mortgage and i have paid it for 15 years by the 16th year almost all the interest on the 30 year loan has been paid to the bank this is incorrect thinking   on a 30 year loan at year 15 about 2/3 's of the total interest to be paid has been paid and the principal is about 1/3 lower than the original loan amount   you may want to play with some amortization calculators that are freely available to see this in action    if you were to pay off the balance at that point you would avoid paying the remaining 1/3 of interest    consider a 100 k 30 year mortgage at 4.5 in month two the payment breaks down with $ 132 going to principal and $ going to interest   if in month one you had an extra $ 132 and directed it to principal you would save $ in interest   that is a great roi and why it is wonderful to get out of debt as soon as possible    the trouble with this is of course is that most people can barely afford the mortgage payment when it is new so lets look at the same situation in year 15 here $ would go to principal and $ 235 to interest   so you would have to come up with more money to save less interest   it is still a great roi but less dramatic    if you understand the magic of compounding interest then you can understand loans   it is just compounding interest in reverse   it works against you

as you said the next generation will be cheaper and more efficient same for the generation after that from a financial standpoint there is n't a theory that supports when to buy the technology it comes down to primarily personal issues   as far as i know musk 's claims about the cost were relating to a traditional slate roof not a traditional asphalt shingle roof i ca n't recall if he explicitly said one way or the other but i have yet to see any math that supports a comparison to asphalt shingles if you look at all of the demos and marketing material it 's comparisons to various styles of tile roofing which is already more expensive than asphalt shingles   do you feel it 's worth it to invest now or do you think it would be more worth it to invest later when the costs are lower a new roof will last 10 20 years if not longer i'm not a roof expert do you need a new roof yet are your electricity bills high enough that the cost of going solar will offset it enough can you sell unused power back to your power company i could go on but i think you get the point it 's entirely a personal decision and not one that will have a definitive answer if you keep waiting to make a purchase because you 're worried that the next generation will be cheaper and more efficient then you 're never going to make the purchase

uhh not really there was a bank run it just was n't on deposits we are only off depression by taxing future dollars that policy will probably fail eventually and if we have n't gained enough aggregate hard inputs people or technology by the time this delaying tactic runs out then it will be depression   you really misread my comment anyway move all insured deposits to not for profit credit unions and sever them completely from investment commercial banking remove all deposit insurance from commercial investment banking and with it the inherent moral hazard in the system we still have insured deposits but for profit banks wo n't be able to filter them through to investment banking through the shadow banking system

i think based on their publicly available records that they believe their own rather substantial increases in wealth since being elected are repeated amongst the general public   since they only circulate amongst the elite that pay for their elections they probably are unaware that the average american has see their income decrease since the 1980 's while they and their friends incomes have increased an average of 10 per year since the 1980 's   so for them at least their strategy is working   but i still ca n't see why people vote for them

one big deciding factor will be what standard of living you want to maintain once you move out   your parents have had years to get raises accumulate savings and establish the standard of living you are used to    regardless of how much you save up now you 'll still have to be living at or below your means once you move out that means that all the expenses you currently have covered by your parents have to come out of something you are currently spending elsewhere   if they can come out of whatever extra money you have now then great   if not you 'll have to re align your budget to align with your income in my experience seeing my friends and i move out this was the biggest issue   those who settled into a new standard of living until their wages went up did fine even the few who moved out at 18 with no savings   those who could n't drop the extra expenses and wanted to continue living at their parent 's standard of living either never left home ended up moving back or ended up massively in debt   we 're only just hitting 30 now so it did n't take long for things to settle out

you should look at the opportunity cost for your money i.e. what kind of return it could generate otherwise   we took advantage of these types of offer zero interest for x months in the past with the goal to redirect the money to the mortgage it was 7.5 back then and we made sure we do n't get hosed by the surprisingly high interest rate by having a big reminder in the bulletin board in the kitchen to make sure we pay off the money before the interest rate kicks in   so we basically reduced our interest on the mortgage during that period   oh we use an all in one account one so that was real nice i would stay away from those interest deferred offers it 's totally not worth it

you can not even if your children actually have that money your fiduciary duty is to them not to yourself you can not gift away money they own for your own purposes they have to want to gift it away since it belongs to them i doubt they do or they should since you have to have their best interests in mind you should n't allow them gift away such amounts even if they 're willing to doing otherwise will be a criminal act on your behalf embezzlement breach of fiduciary duty do talk to an attorney of course since i 'm not but that is my understanding of things if your kids do n't actually have the money then they can obviously not gift it so claiming that they did would be a tax fraud

if your goal is to have a 400 k net worth in 11 years and you invest the entire time you will need a rate of return of at least 6.4   this is assuming that you have zero net worth now and it does not consider your house   obviously the house will be worth some amount and the mortgage balance will go down   however it can not really be calculated with the details provided    it seems like your risk tolerance is low   you may want to head over to bogleheads.org and look into their asset allocation model   they typically site about a 7 compounded growth rate which will more than meet your goals   they probably have information for european investors that map to the funds that we use here in the us    keep in mind during this time you will likely receive raises if you start out assuming you will hit the 400 500k mark and stick to the plan you will likely blow that goal away    also keep in mind the three legs to wealth building   giving some spending some and investing some   your question is addressing the investing portion make sure you are also enjoying your money by spending some on yourself and others benefit from your prosperity   giving to causes you deem worthy is a key component to wealth building that is often overlooked by those interested in investing

in general there are two types of futures contract a put and call   both contract types have both common sides of a transaction a buyer and a seller   you can sell a put contract or sell a call contract also you 're just taking the other side of the agreement   if you 're selling it would commonly be called a sell to open meaning you 're opening your position by selling a contract which is different from simply selling an option that you currently own to close your position a put contract gives the buyer the right to sell shares or some asset commodity for a specified price on a specified date the buyer of the contract gets to put the shares on someone else    a call contract gives the buyer the right to buy shares or some asset commodity for a specified price on a specified date the buyer of the contract gets to call on someone for shares american options contracts allow the buyer can exercise their rights under the contract on or before the expiration date while european type contracts can only be exercised on the expiration date to address your example   typically for stock an option contract involves 100 shares of a stock   the value of these contracts fluctuates the same way other assets do   typically retail investors do n't actually exercise their contracts they just close a profitable position before the exercise deadline and let unprofitable positions expire worthless   if you were to buy a single call contract with an exercise price of $ 100 with a maturity date of august 1 for $ 1 per share the contract will have cost you $ 100   let 's say on august 1 the underlying shares are now available for $ 110 per share   you have two options option 1 on august 1 you can exercise your contract to buy 100 shares for $ 100 per share   you would exercise for $ 10,000 $ 100 times 100 shares then sell the shares for $ 10 profit per share less the cost of the contract and transaction costs option 2 your contract is now worth something closer to $ 10 per share up from $ 1 per share when you bought it   you can just sell your contract without ever exercising it to someone with an account large enough to exercise and/or an actual desire to receive the asset or commodity

i have a couple of questions regarding bank loans   1 can they ever trade above par from my understanding most get called due to refinancing   2 if a bank loan has a floor attached to it that 's tied to libor say and that floor is does the floor automatically disappear or does that specific loan need to be refinanced before the floor can be done away with additionally should an investor be more cautious when investing in a bank loan without a floor with regard to the second half of my question i would think an investor would demand a higher yield without the assurance of a floor

there 's a significant difference between discount and surcharge for starters legal difference if you have a list price of $ x that 's the price you 're committed to sell regardless of the payment method so it does n't matter if i pay with cash or credit i 'll pay $ x. however it costs you more when i pay with credit so you want to pass that cost on me you charge me surcharge an addition to the price in some states in the us and in some other countries that is against the law you can not add on top of the listed price any amount regardless of the payment method however you can say that the list price is $ x which includes the assumed credit card surcharge of $ y. and then you give discount of $ y to anyone not paying with credit card the list price is still $ x regardless of the payment method you do n't have to give the discount the discount is your cost of doing business but that would be legal in some places not all that forbid credit card surcharge so the main difference from legal perspective is that you 're not allowed to add to the list price but you 're allowed to discount from it regarding taxes exemption deduction is not a penalty for negative exemption deduction is an implementation of a social policy for example it is for the public benefit for everyone to own a house so the congress comes up with a deduction of mortgage interest however you 're not penalized if you do n't own a house by paying higher taxes your tax rate does n't change you just do n't get to deduct something that you might be able to deduct had you owned a house with a mortgage this is again a discount of a list price not a surcharge you 're not penalized if you do n't have a house or do n't have a mortgage but if you do you get a break the author you 're quoting claims that bottom line would be the same as if you considered the absence of a deduction as a penalty but that 's not true because even if you do have a mortgage you may not be able to deduct it because your income is too high the mortgage is for too much or your mortgage is not on the primary residence so mere existence of the mortgage does n't directly correlate to the existence of the deduction similarly with credit card surcharges you may get a cash discount but you may get the similar amount of money back even if you use a credit card not as a cash discount but rather as rewards cash backs or points however if there 's no cash discount you wo n't be getting these if you 're paying cash so again you 're not penalized for having a credit card by not getting a discount because you may still get it in a different way and if you do n't you still may end up not getting it so the quote is a rather simplistic and negative view and more of an opinion than stating a fact

you might convert all your money in local currency but you need take care of following tips while studying abroad here are some money tips that can be useful during a trip abroad know about fees when you use a debit card or credit card in a foreign country there are generally two types of transaction fees that may apply understand exchange rates the exchange rate lets you know the amount of nearby money you can get for each u.s. dollar missing any expenses there are sell rates for individuals who are trading u.s. dollars for foreign currency and the other way around purchase rates it 's a smart thought to recognize what the neighborhood money is worth in dollars so you can comprehend the estimation of your buys abroad   sites like x rates offer a currency converter that gives the current exchange rate so you can make speedy comparisons you can utilize it to get a feel for how much certain amount say $ 1 $ 10 $ 25 $ 50 $ 100 are worth in local currency remember that rates fluctuate so you will be unable to suspect precisely the amount of a buy made in a foreign currency will cost you in u.s. dollars to get cash check for buddy banks if you already have an account with a large bank or credit union in the u.s. you may have an advantage   being a client of a big financial institution with a large atm system may make it easier to find a subsidiary cash machine and stay away from an out of system charge   bank of america for example is a part of the global atm alliance which lets clients of taking an interest banks use their debit cards to withdraw money at any alliance atm without paying the machine 's operator an access fee in spite of the fact that you may at present be charged for converting dollars into local currency used for purchases   citibank is another well known bank for travelers because it has 45,000 atms in more than 30 countries including popular study abroad destinations such as the u.k. italy and spain atms in a foreign country may allow withdrawals just from a financial records and not from savings so make sure to keep an adequate checking balance also atm withdrawal limits will apply just as they do in the u.s. but the amount may vary based on the local currency and exchange rates weigh the benefits of other banks for general needs online banks and even foreign banks can also be good options   with online banks you do n’t have to visit physical branches and these institutions typically have lower fees use our checking account tool to find one that ’s a good fit foreign many american debit cards may not work in europe asia and latin america especially those that do n’t have an emv chip that help prevent fraud or some cards may work at one atm but not another one option for students who expect a more extended stay in a foreign country is to open a new account at a local bank this will let you have better access to atms and to make purchases more easily and without as many fees see our chart below for the names of the largest banks in several countries guard against fraud and identity one of the most important things you can do as you plan your trip is to let your bank know that you ’ll be abroad include exact countries and dates when possible to avoid having your card flagged for fraud unfortunately incidents may still arise despite providing ample warning to your bank bring a backup credit card or debit card so you can still access some sort of money in case one is canceled are also critical not just for traveling from place to place but also as identification to open a bank account and for everyday purposes you ’ll want to make two and give one to a friend or family member to keep at home and put the other in a separate secure location just in case your actual passport is lost or stolen

is there not some central service that tracks current currency rates that banks can use to get currency data sure   but this does n't matter   all the central service can tell you is how much the rate was historically   but the banks paypal do n't care about the historical value   they want to know the price that they 'll pay when they get around to switching not the last price before the switch   beyond that there is a transaction cost to switching   they have to pay the clearinghouse for managing the transaction    the banks can choose to act as a clearinghouse but that increases their risk   if the bank has a large balance of us dollars but dollars are falling then they end up eating that cost   they 'll only take that risk if they think that they 'll make more money that way   and in the end they may have to go on the currency market anyway   if a european bank runs out of us dollars they have to buy them on the open market   or a us bank might run out of euros   or yen   etc    another problem is that many of the currency transactions are small but the overhead is fixed   if the bank has to pay $ 5 for every currency transaction they wo n't even break even charging 3 on a $ 100 transaction   so they delay the actual transaction so that they can make more than one at a time   but then they have the risk that the currency value might change in the meantime   if they credit you with $ 97 in your account $ 100 minus the 3 fee but the price actually drops from $ 100 to $ 99 they 're out the $ 1    they could do it the other way as well   you ask for a $ 100 transaction   they perform a $ 1000 transaction of which they give you $ 97   now they have $ $ 1000 minus the $ 5 they paid for the transaction plus the $ 3 they charged you for the transaction   if there 's a 1 drop they 're out $ $ in currency loss plus a net $ 2 in fees    this is why banks have money market accounts   so they have someone to manage these problems working twenty four hours a day   but then they have to pay interest on those accounts further eating into their profits   along with paying a staff to monitor the currency markets and things that may affect them

first off some companies do something like this   microsoft for example was well known for consistently hitting earnings estimates every quarter nearly never missed them and most of the time did n't exceed by much either   in order to do this and not be prosecuted for accounting fraud you typically have to be a service or good company like microsoft used to be where you can manipulate the amount of product on hand and move costs fairly easily from one quarter to the next   a company like say home depot or caterpillar both of which have tangible goods they 're either or producing has less flexibility there although they will still try to move profits around to match earnings estimates more closely however you have to be consistently doing well to be able to do this   you ca n't manufacture additional total revenue so if you have one down quarter you have to either have moved some revenue into it from the previous quarter or you have to be able to move some into it from the next quarter   that obviously does n't work consistently unless you 're a fast growing company or have an extremely stable base   it 's also hard to do this in a legal seeming fashion technically this sort of manipulation is illegal so decisions have to be justifiable   companies like microsoft that are expanding can also do things to encourage slightly lower expectations   a company in need of a stock price bump issues press releases touting its inventions and products as amazing things that will drive profits through the roof and an aggressive profit forecast just as easy to issue a press release with a conservative forecast meaning the bar will be lower to hit    it 's also not really necessary to manipulate earnings to have a consistently well performing stock   this article for example shows that companies who miss earnings estimates do n't really suffer much when controlling for their actual earnings changes of course in the long run   your price might drop a bit but if your company is otherwise sound it will recover finally companies do sometimes come out with information ahead of earnings that cause expectations to be lowered   for example just lowered its earnings expectations due to various reasons   some companies choose to do this in order to dilute the effect on the market   i 'm not sure if this is ever required but it seems to me that some companies are much quicker to restate earnings expectations than others

restricted stock units are different from stock options because instead of buying them at a particular strike price you receive the actual shares of stock they are taxed as ordinary income at the time that the restriction is lifted you do n't have to sell them to be taxed usually you can choose to have a percentage of the stock withheld to cover tax withholding or pay for the withholding out of pocket so you can retain all of your shares

the fact you are asking this question the number of up votes the real cause of the banking crisis     answers which mention that shareholders will fire a public company board are on the bottom it is obvious that a company owners are interested in company value and should have direct and easy impact on a directors board if management does n't increase shareholders wealth   with large number of passive shareholders and current stock market system that impact is very limited hence your question   so bank directors upper management are n't that interested in company value they are mostly interested in theirs bonuses their wealth increase not shareholders and that 's the real problem of capitalism public companies slowly drift to function like companies in former socialistic countries these is no owner everything is owned by a nation

i agree with joetaxpayer 's answer   the question you should be asking is not how do i spend more but how do i become happier   from what you say it may be that you could increase your happiness simply by cutting back on these aggressive attempts to save a few bucks here and there at the same time if you do this on some level your personality is probably not the type that would allow to simply forget it   i think many frugal people are somewhat as you describe they do n't like wasting money   in such cases often what matters is not so much the actual saving money as the feeling of saving money   therefore i 'd suggest that you take a look at which of the money losing activities you mention are really worth it the easiest ones to drop would be things like the home improvement project which even you acknowledge does not save you money   if you like saving money give yourself a pat on the back when you hire the contractor   if you want run the numbers so you can prove to yourself how much money you are saving by not doing the work for some of the other things it may be that spending time to save a small amount can an everyday experience and make it more interesting   for instance comparing products to save a few bucks is not necessarily bad unless you actually do n't like doing it   if spending a few hours comparing two toaster on amazon or whatever makes you feel good go for it it 's no worse than spending a few hours watching tv   by acknowledging that you get something out of it the feeling of getting a bargain and that you can feel better about and also potentially get it out of your system so that you wo n't feel the need to do it for every little thing   we all have our little pet and it 's possible to acknowledge that they 're irrational while still accepting them as part of your personality and finding a way to satisfy them in a controlled manner that does n't stress you out too much

how do you find good quality dividend stocks that is an easy one past performance has always been my key to this answer also remember why you are investing in the first place do you want cash flow security or capital growth also let 's not forget how much time do you want to devote to this venture there is going to be a balance in your investing and your returns more time in the higher returns you get   as for finding good dividend stocks look to the dividend or the dividend these companies have consistently increased their payouts to their investors for years there is a trading strategy that could escalate your returns dividend capturing simply put you buy the stock before the ex date and sell after date of record thus collecting a dividend and moving on to the next one warning though this is a profitable strategy it only works with certain stocks so do your research or find a good source

there is no single market interest rate there are myriad interest rates that vary by risk profile term corporate bonds are typically riskier than bank deposits and therefore pay a higher effective rate when the market for that bond is in equilibrium than a bank account does if you are willing to accept a higher risk in order gain a higher return you might choose bonds over bank deposits if you want an even higher return and can accept even higher risk you might turn to stocks over bonds if you want still higher return and can bear the still higher risk derivatives may be more appealing than stocks

let 's say i have a life insurance for 20 years whether the money will be given back to the policy holder along with the accumulated interest on it this depends on the type of insurance policy   if you have purchased a term plan policy then these do not give back anything however the premium is very low and is essentially covering for the risk if you have cash value type of policies whole life endowment universal life etc then you get something back at the end this depends on the policy document the premiums are substantially high it is generally advised that cash value type of policies are not good and the returns they generate are poor than depositing the difference in premium in alternative investments and buying a term plan

it would be difficult but it 's a statistical task and you 'd need to refer to a competent statistician to really get a sense of what sort of certainty could be derived from the available data   i believe that you 'd start by looking over your state by state data on a granular level to try to find if there was any persistent correlation between amazon 's market penetration in a particular area and employment data from the retail industry   with regards to ma amp pa 's complaint you 're sort of wrong and sort of right   obviously they have no direct knowledge that online retail was responsible for the decline in sales that they saw   in terms of sustainability and mismanagement however they can show you their books   if the business had been established from some time it would be easy to see whether it had indeed been a sustainable business model in prior years   sustainability and mismanagement however are when it comes to reasoning about causes   in measuring the effect of amazon 's entry into the market on local businesses we can just as easily use a model that assumes a perfect market that inefficiencies on the part of amp would lead them to be displaced by amp and that on average amp manage their business sufficiently well to extract an optimal return on effort     if circumstances are such that the role of vendor is not fungible and the supply of mas and pas does not respond to the demand for family stores then i do n't actually know how to do the math but on the other hand i do recognize a smoking gun

borrowing to invest is almost always a bad idea   you 'd have to take out an unsecured loan which has a higher interest rate or a secured loan and put at risk whatever you are securing the loan with you need some means to make payments on the loan or if interest is being added to the balance then take the compounding effect into account with regards to the cost of the money and how much you will really end up owning in order to come out ahead you need to invest in something that will yield a return that is higher than the cost of borrowing the money such high yields always come with higher risk meaning that you will actually get that return is less and less of a sure thing so now you are talking about the chance to make money or a chance your investment could fail perhaps badly   meaning you could well do nothing but end up in debt with little to nothing to show for it if someone claims to have a sure thing and is encouraging you to borrow money to invest in it i 'd be checking their back for a fin and remembering the when the shark bites start to spread

the value of debt is that it allows you to profit from the return of equity beyond the amount of actual net equity you own   of course this only works if the cost of borrowing is less than your return on equity   market timing matters a great deal but is n't accounted for in this view   for my answer i would like to hand wave away market timing considerations   one plausible justification is that you could default on your current home and then immediately go buy one of equal value   if you buy a new home of a lesser value due to lack of funds and then prices appreciate then you missed some opportunity cost but probably not $ 100k worth of it moving on here are some helpful assumptions i 'll make i 'll ignore performance of your portfolio after retirement and only seek to optimize f which will be your net worth upon retirement   in either case your current net worth is earning the r2 rate   we can convert this for both your current net worth and future savings using conversion formulas present to future value f = p annual to future value f = s 1 r2 adding these together is sufficient to obtain f in the case that you have no borrowing power   the case where you do not default and maintain your credit score is different due to an initial $ 100k penalty and the amortized value of borrowing power   in a completely theoretical sense you get an effective yield on all borrowed money   the future value will be the following f = a1 one step is missing however which is to convert this value the value of having a good credit score into present value to compare to value of your defaulting p of borrowing power = f = a1 now let 's put some specific values in   say that you can borrow $ 300k with your good credit history and this applies for the next 25 years after which you retire   the borrowing rate is 7 and the time value of money to you is 10   i would then calculate p of borrowing power = $ 58 k < $ 100 k this indicates that it would be more economical to default   of course some people might point out that it will be removed from your record after 7 years   if you plug 7 years instead of 25 years into the equation almost no assumptions about rates will lead to the option of keeping your house being preferable so in a nutshell the value of your credit is probably less than $ 100k in a purely mathematical sense   but there are other factors too   if you do n't have that borrowing ability maybe you would n't be able to borrow money to start the business of your dreams   if you are a rock star entrepreneur then time value of money to you could be 1,000 yield sure then maybe you could make the above numbers work to favor keeping the house   i 've also neglected ethics   as other people point out it would be like stealing from the bank

i 'm not a financial guy that being said i think you can make a couple of common sense points here the reason this site exists is because in some of these countries there just is n't an established way to create credit history partly because the infrastructure is risky to build it may also be due to the corruption within a country the really cool part about kiva and these other lending tools might be that they can be an end run around those governments and are a 21st century approach to building the infrastructure for credit worthiness   that being said you probably already realize in this situation you 're the bank and you really ought to be acting somewhat like a bank i 'm also curious whether or not the good loans and opportunities are up so quickly that all you are left with is the really high risk stuff anyway that 's my non expert 0.02

because the question puts moral obligations aside i 'll answer from the practical point of view there are two reasons for declaring side income even cash income if you buy a house in a year or two the additional income will help qualify you for a mortgage   the irs has ways to discover that you earned the money   a. a client might be audited if the client deducts the cost of your services from their income they could be asked for proof that they paid you suppose they saved atm receipts that show the withdrawals of cash used to pay you and kept records that document the dates they paid you the irs might want to ask you if you were paid by the client on those dates and how much the asking might be in the form of an audit and you 'd have to lie to the irs to avoid penalty b. a client might develop a grudge against you and report you to the irs someone could do this even if they do n't know for sure that you do n't declare the income if you were interviewed or audited you 'd have to lie to the irs to avoid penalty c. you could fall prey to an algorithm there might be one that compares deductions and income if you run a crazy high ratio year after year you could be flagged for audit once again you 'd have to lie to avoid penalty

the risk is that you will owe the bank the principal amount of the mortgage based on your question it would be foolish for you to sign anyone who describes a mortgage as something obviously has no idea what they are doing and should never sign a mortgage which is a promise to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars you would be doubly foolish to sign the mortgage because if you are guaranteeing the loan you own nothing so for example if your friend sold the house pocketed the money then left the country you would owe the full amount of the mortgage since you are not on the deed there is no way you can prevent this from happening he does not need your approval to sell the house so essentially what your friend is doing is asking you to assume all the risk of the mortgage with none of the benefits since he gets the house not you if a girlfriend is involved that just increases the risk you will have a problem also although it is not clear it appears this is a second house for him if so that him from any mortgage assistance or relief so the risk is even higher basically it would foolish in the extreme to co sign the loan

this analysis misses the opportunities the roth ira presents to those with special access it assumes that all money grows at the same rate with investments at regular intervals these assumptions hold for normal workers but not for the privileged   suppose for example that in a single year you have limited access to a security that is an acorn you know will grow into a mighty oak for this example this security will grow 1000x over some short period of time for simplicity assume both the value of acorns you can buy and the the maximum ira contribution in this year is $ 5k.   after the short acorn growth period the after tax values are there is a minor difference in the amount of money you need to buy the acorns pre v. post tax but this is negligible relative to the amount of cash you can assume you have on hand to have special access   the atlantic provides an acorn example from private equity not used with a roth and this washington post article describes someone with non publicly traded startup stocks and a roth

process is terrible i hate it it has a damaging effect on the market and we could easily prevent it from happening but i choose to keep it because of a adherence to ideology   not exactly and nothing of the sort   i think it unfair because it gives a leg up to those with access but then such is life i also think it unfair that kids in the middle class have access to tutors kids of the rich have access to elite private schools those with money have access to better medical care and so on   however as someone may well ask and do so rightfully so what   to use cycling as an example use of hft is the equivalent of having access to better training better gear and better opportunities you do n't ban those just because the poorer countries ca n't have access to those the practice of placing orders and immediately canceling them is the equivalent of pulling a lance armstrong better handled by the association than by the government using taxpayer money

this directly relates to the ideas behind the yield curve for a detailed explanation of the yield curve see the linked answer that joe and i wrote in short the yield curve is a plot of the yield on treasury securities against their maturities if short term treasuries are paying higher yields than long term debt the yield curve has a negative slope there are a lot of factors that could cause the yield curve to become negatively sloped or at least less steep but in this case oil prices and the effective federal funds rate may have played a significant role i 'll quote from the section of the linked answer that describes the effect of oil prices first a rise in oil prices may increase expectations of short term inflation so investors demand higher interest rates on short term debt because long term inflation expectations are governed more by fundamental macroeconomic factors than short term swings in commodity prices long term expectations may not rise nearly as much as short term expectations which leads to a yield curve that is becoming less steep or even negatively sloped as the graph shows oil prices increased dramatically so this increase may have increased expectations of short term inflation expectations substantially   the other answer describes an easing of monetary policy e.g. a decrease in the effective federal funds rate ffr as a factor that could increase the slope of the yield curve however a tightening of monetary policy e.g. an increase in the ffr could decrease the slope of the yield curve because a higher ffr leads investors to demand a higher rate of return on shorter term securities longer term treasuries are n't as affected by short term monetary policy so when short term yields increase more than long term yields the yield curve becomes less steep and/or negatively sloped the second graph shows the effective federal funds rate for the period in question and once again the increase is significant   finally look at a graph of inflation for the relevant period   intuitively the steady increase in inflation from 1975 onward may have increased investors expectations of short term inflation therefore increasing short term yields more than long term yields as described above and in the other answer these reasons are n't set in stone and just looking at graphs is n't a substitute for an actual analysis of the data but logically it seems plausible that the positive shock to oil prices increases in the effective federal funds rate and increases in inflation and expectations of inflation contributed at least partially to the inversion of the yield curve keep in mind that these factors are all interconnected as well so the situation is certainly more complex if you approve of this answer be sure to vote up the other answer about the yield curve too

the victim never actually receives the money so that is not an option the scammer generates the transaction using a fraudulent check once the check is found to be fraudulent the chain of involved banks claw the money back which is the bank 's money not the scammer 's so what happens is the victim sees a deposit in their account but it is not real it is a conditional deposit by the bank made on the assumption that the payment is good which it is not when the victim endorses a check they are guaranteeing to the bank that they consider the check good and for the check that is why the bank credits the victim 's account because the victim has for the check when the check later turns out to be fraudulent the victim owes the bank money in theory people who endorse a fraudulent check could be criminally prosecuted but that does not happen normally

with a $ 40,000 payment there is a 100 chance that the owner will be claiming this as a business expense on their taxes   the irs and the state will definitely know about it and the risk of interest and penalties if it is not claimed as income make the best course of action to see a tax adviser because taxes will not be taken out by the property owner the tax payer should also make sure that the estimated $ 10,000 in federal taxes if they are in the 25 tax bracket does n't trigger other tax issues that could result in penalties or the need to file quarterly taxes next year this kind of extra income could also result in a change or an elimination of a health care subsidy a unexpected mid year   change could trigger the need to refund the subsidy received this year via the tax form next april

if we take only the title of the question can the ceo short the stock it was probably different before enron but nowadays a ceo can only make planned trades that is trades that are registered a very long time before and that can not be avoided once registered so the ceo can say i sell 100,000 shares in exactly six months time then in six months time the ceo can and must sell the shares anything else will get him into trouble with the sec quite automatically i do n't know if shorting a stock or buying options can be done that way at all so it 's possible only in the sense of it 's possible but you 'll be in deep trouble   selling shares or exercising share options may indicate that the company 's business is in trouble if the sale makes that impression and everyone else starts selling because the ceo sold his shares then the ceo may be in trouble with the board of directors such a sale would be totally legal if announced long time ahead but just a bad move if it makes the company look bad shorting sales is much worse in that respect if the ceo wants to buy a new car he may have to sell some shares there are people paid almost only in share options no matter where the share price is going but shorting shares means that you most definitely think the share price is going to drop you 're betting your money on it that would tend to get a ceo fired even if it was legal

to be able to truly short something you technically need to be able to borrow the security so you can sell it   there needs to be a system for borrowing in place to be able to do this which is very robust for large u.s. stocks but does n't exist for cdos mainly due to the complex legal structures around them    however the word short is commonly used in finance to mean profiting from a loss of value of something   so the use in the movie title though a bit confusing was fine credit default swaps are not technically insurance as you do n't need own the thing you are insuring and for a few other reasons   however i agree with the movie that thinking of them as insurance is a pretty good way to understand them   as you are playing a monthly premium to for a contract that pays out when something goes very wrong    however the movie was a little fast a loose as cds of various types were regularly traded well before the bubble even started   though maybe not that particular type of cds   so while they may have been expensive it was the easiest route and reasonable idea

in my opinion it generally makes sense to focus all of your debt reduction energy and funds on one loan at a time there are two reasons for this it will allow you to more quickly move from 4 loans to 3 loans and then 2 and then 1 providing you with a sense of progress and motivation as you reduce the number of loans that you have your monthly minimum payment obligations will be reduced   then if you have a month with an emergency expense you will have more income available to you for your emergency without getting behind on your loans there is debate about whether to pay loans in order of the loan balance or in order of interest rate you can read about this here and here but in your case your highest interest loans also have the lowest balance so either method would have you picking the same loans first    you have already chosen wisely to start with the $ 1500 6.8 loans   send all of your $ 1000 to one of these loans and continue to work aggressively to knock out all four as quickly as possible

it is worth noting first that interest and short term dividends capital gains are all taxed at the same rate so all the investments below i mention even savings accounts will be taxed at the same rate   also even short term capital losses can often be harvested to reduce your tax rate in many countries while it is worth paying attention to the taxes when investing in the short term the more important factor is how much risk that you can take or want to take with the money   most equity portfolios like the s&p index give a much higher risk that there will be much less in the account when you need to buy   you generally have a higher expected return with equity but as you mention that return is very random over such a short period over such a short variable period many people will invest in short term bond index funds or just keep the fund in a high yielding savings account   with the savings account your money is guaranteed   short term bond funds will have generally higher yields but a small chance you may lose money in the short term some people can trade short term bond indices for free with their broker but if you ca n't be sure to include the trading costs when thinking about which investment to use as with how low yields are currently the fees may eat up any advantage you gain
