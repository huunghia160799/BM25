even with a good investment strategy you can not expect more than 8 10 per year in average reducing this by a 3 inflation ratio leaves you with 5 7 which means consider seriously if you could live from that amount as annual income longterm if you think so there is a second hurdle the words in average a good year could increase your capital a bit but a bad year can devastate it and you would not have the time to wait for the good years to average it out for example if your second year gives you a 10 loss and you still draw and inflation eats another 3 you have only left effectively and future years will have to go with imagine a second bad year as a consequence you either need to be prepared to go back to work in that situation tough after being without job for years or you can live on less to begin with if you can make it on 10k$ to begin with and do even in good years you have a pretty good chance to get through your life with it note that make it with x always includes taxes health care etc nothing is free i think it 's possible as people live on 10k$ a year but you need to be sure you can trust yourself to stay within the limit and not give in and spent more not easy for many people

an endowment is a large chunk of capital i.e. money held by   a university or other nonprofit   it is meant to hold its value forever against inflation and invested to generate income from interest dividends and appreciation    they seem like a contradiction closely scrutinized by boards of directors managed to a high and accountable standard closely regulated and yet invested aggressively for growth ignoring short term volatility to get the highest growth long term   the law p for prudent requires growth investment and says taking up to 7 of current value per year is prudent even in down times when total value is shrinking   on average this lets the endowment grow with inflation   7 is the high end of prudent   an endowment is watched and the taken income is adjusted to keep the endowment healthy 5 is very safe assuming the endowment must pace inflation until the heat death of the universe if you plan to die someday drawing an extra 1 2 is appropriate   there you go   invest like a university endowment and count on up to 7 per year of income   that 's $ a year there 'll be taxes but the long term capital gain rate at $ is pretty low   that 's pretty tight but possible if your idea of entertaining is netflix   it would work very effectively for or the british version living on a

so my read on the question is how do i invest 300k such that it earns me a living wage without the ongoing grind inherent in most formal employment   reading the other answers to date it looks like most of them are thinking in terms of investment accounts and trying to live off of the earnings from such   i wanted to throw out a couple of alternative choices that may be worth considering the first is real estate investing   $ 300k should allow you to pick up 2 or 3 single family with little or no mortgage   turning them into rentals placed with a good property management company should easily pay their expenses and provide a consistent income with minimal effort attention from you   similar story with buying into multifamily housing or commercial real estate your key concern here is picking the right market in which to buy and finding a reputable manager to handle the day to day issues on your behalf note that you are not overly concerned with the potential resale value of the but the probable rental income they can generate these are separate concerns that may not align with each other second is buying founding a business that has a general manager other than yourself   franchise ownership may be a potential option for you under the circumstances   the key concern here is picking the business location and manager that make you comfortable in terms of the risk involved   you need the place to make enough money to pay for itself and the salary of everyone working there with enough left over for you to live on   sounds easy enough but not so much in practice   generally you can expect at least a few years of being hands on and watching things very closely to make sure it is going the way you want it to   finding a mentor who has done this type of transition before to walk you through it would be strongly advised   so would preparing yourself for a failure or two before you work out the exact combination of factors that work for you

the short answer yes the long answer depends on what you mean by modest living as others have noted living off a $ 300k principle involves risks but the entire future has risk by getting out of the rat race i hope you do n't mean become a on the couch mr money mustache at one can live very frugally yet very well in some parts of the us
# 183869
the title of your question is quite different then the content   the term rat race was coined in the 70 's and refers to the endless cycle of working hard to consume more   fortunately it is very easy not to participate in the cycle and probably will lead to more happiness   just because one works does not mean they are participating in the rat race and i would recommend the following when i think of rat race i picture a a bumper to bumper of people struggling to get to work   for others it might be different but that kind of rat race is easily avoided by the multitude of remote work opportunities   some jobs allow you to work anywhere in the world avoiding the rugged consumerism also helps avoid the feelings of being a rat on the wheel   sure one can like nice things but do we have to have everything that madison ave is trying to sell us   no   pick some nice things and pay cash debt especially consumer debt causes a person in effect to work for a bank   avoiding debt will remove those feelings saving and investing also helps avoid those feelings   there is profound satisfaction in watching ones account balances grow   once you see that your investment earnings can outpace your expenses and then your salary you really feel like you are getting ahead       above all else giving is a paramount and often overlooked part of a person 's financial life   it causes one to be humble and recognize that most people in this world are less fortunate that us   it avoids provide that justifies purchases that we can not afford    so yea you can avoid the rat race and still work

there is no typical return for an ira understand that an ira is not an investment type it is just an account that gets special tax treatment by the federal government the money in the ira could be invested in almost anything including gold stocks bonds cash cds etc so the question as phrased is n't exactly meaningful it is kind of like asking what is the typical price of things if i use $ 10 bills as for a annualized return on your portfolio that 's not a bad return at that rate you will double your investment with compounding every 7.2 years again however some context is needed you can really only evaluate investment returns with your risk profile in mind if you are invested in super safe investments like cds that is an absolutely incredible return you compare it to several indexes which is a good way to do it if you are investing in the types of investments tracked by those indexes

i think swenson 's insight was that the traditional recommendation of 60 stocks plus 40 bonds has two serious flaws 1 you are exposed to way too much risk by having a portfolio that is so strongly tied to us equities especially in the way it has historically been recommend 2 you have too little reward by investing so much of your portfolio in bonds if you can mix a decent number of asset classes that all have equity like returns and those asset classes have a low correlation with each other then you can achieve equity like returns without the equity like risk this improvement can be explicitly measured in the sharpe ratio of you portfolio the vanguard risk factor looks pretty and lame to me the book the the ivy portfolio does a great job at covering the swenson model and explains how to reasonably replicate it yourself using low fee etfs

another answer to this question occurred to me as i started learning more about historical uses for gold etc   perhaps it 's a idea but i 'm going to float it anyway to see what you folks think investing in gold is an indirect investment in the economy and gdp of the nation of india   to that extent is it only a hedge against inflation so long as the indian economy grows at a more rapid rate than your local inflation rate   fact india currently consumes more than 1/3 of gold production predominantly in the form of jewelry and their demand has been growing rapidly up 69 just between 2009 and 2010 alone i ca n't find too many consumption numbers for india but when you look at past articles on this subject you see phrases like one forth and 20 being used only a few years go to describe india 's consumption levels fact india has virtually no domestic sources of gold   india ’s handful of gold mines produce about 2.5 tonnes of the metal each year a fraction of the country ’s annual consumption of about 800 tonnes fact indian culture places high value on gold as a visible demonstration of wealth   particularly in situations such in indian weddings where the bride brings in gold to show her family 's status and wealth and it forms part of the given to bride it is believed that a bride wearing 24k gold on their wedding to bring luck and happiness throughout the married life fact the recent trends in outsourcing indian citizens working abroad sending money home etc have all lead to a influx of foreign cash to the indian economy and explosive gdp growth see the following chart and compare the period of with a chart showing the price of gold in other answer here   notice how the curves parallel each other to a large degree   potentially unfounded conclusion drawn from above numbers   the rapid growth of the indian economy coupled with a rich cultural tradition that values gold as a symbol of wealth along with a sudden rise in wealthy people due to the economy and influx of foreign cash has resulted in skyrocketing demand for gold from india and this large consumption demand is the most likely explanation for the sudden rise in the price of gold over the last several years   investors then jump on the rising price bandwagon as especially does anyone that can make a profit from selling gold to those seeking to get on said bandwagon as such as long as indian cultural tradition remains unchanged and their economy remains strong the resulting increasing demand for gold will sustain current and perhaps increased prices   should there be any sudden collapse in the indian gdp gold will likely tumble in parallel disclaimer not an expert just observations based off the data i 've seen there may be other parts to the picture of gold demand that i 've not considered

you 're right to seek passive income and since you 're already looking for it you probably already know some of the reasons to why it is important    do you live in the united states if so i 'd strongly recommend purchasing your primary residence and then maybe investment properties if you like owning your own home   the us tax and banking structure is set up to favor this move in more ways than i can count so save save save then beg borrow and steal to get the down payment rent rooms to friends or random people to afford the payments buy a fixer upper in an up and coming neighborhood   the us is rife with these in all price ranges if you 're working 56 hrs a week you 've got the work ethic so if you ca n't afford it it 's probably because you 're spending all your money on other stuff if you want to do this it will take some effort and savings you will have to trim back the vacations dinners out etc etc etc   let your friends do that stuff and rent from you   your life will get continually easier if you have already trimmed back all the discretionary spending and still ca n't make it then you need to earn more money doing either and both of these things will absolutely change your whole economic life and future so in summary i 'd offer these   ranked priorities 1 learn to save unless you always want to have to work for someone else 2 increase your income capability since your most valuable asset is you 3 buy and hold real estate because the game is rigged to favor passive income i 'm 38 never earned a six figure salary made some good purchases when i was 25 30 and work is optional for me now

there 's nothing wrong with it living in a two family house and renting the downstairs was a fairly standard path to the middle class and home ownership in the 20th century basically if market conditions are good you 'll have someone else paying your mortgage the disadvantage of the situation is that you 're a landlord so you have to deal with your tenant who is also a neighbor most tenants are fine but the occasional difficult person may come out of the woodwork that model of achieving home ownership became less popular in the late early 70 's when the law allowed two incomes to be used for mortgage underwriting also as became a national trend landlords became more common sounds like you are in the right place at the right time and have stumbled into a good deal

as more actively managed funds are driven out of the market the pricing of individual stocks should become less rational i.e. more stocks will become underpriced relative to their peers as stock prices become less rational the reward for active investing will increase since it will become easier to pick a winner eventually the market will reach a new equilibrium where only active investors who are good enough to turn a profit will remain even then passive investment will still do roughly as well as the market since it has low overhead and minimal investment lag there is no reason to expect the system to collapse since it is characterized primarily by negative feedback loops rather than positive feedback   the last few decades have seen a shift from active to passive investment because increased market transparency and efficiency have reduced the labor required to keep pricing rational basically as people have gotten better at predicting stock performance less active investment has been required to keep prices rational

if the $ 300 due on a credit card is due at the end of the month and you make 2 payments of $ 150 during the month the first half way through the month and the second at the end of the month then yes you will save on interest note if this is a credit card with an interest free period and you are paying the total amount due before the due date then it will not save you anything by paying part of it earlier interest on credit card is calculated daily so if you pay $ 150 half way through the month then you will pay 2.5 x $ 150 365 days x 15 days = $ 0.15 less in interest than if you paid the full $ 300 at the end of the month the higher the interest rate and the more you pay early the higher the savings will be

how would you respond to these cases limited card options if someone has a bad credit record the cards available may only be those with an annual fee   not everyone will have your credit record and thus access to the cards you have some annual fees may be waived in some cases thus someone may have a card with a fee that could be waived if enough transactions are done on the card   thus if someone gives enough business to the credit card company they will waive the fee on the point of the rewards if the card is from a specific retailer there could be a 10 discount for using that card and if the person purchases more than a couple thousand dollars worth from that store this is a savings of $ 200 from the retail prices compared to what would happen in other cases that more than offsets the annual fee   if someone likes to be a handyman and visits home depot often there may be programs to give rewards in this case credit cards can be useful for doing on line purchases flight reservations rental cars and a few other purchases that to with cash or debit can be difficult if not close to impossible some airline cards have a fee but presumably the perks provide a benefit that outweigh that fee over the year i 'm thinking of the citibank cards tied to american airlines first year free then an $ 85 fee

as a new very small business the irs has lots of advice and information for you start at and be sure you have several pots of coffee or other appropriate aid against   by default a single member llc is disregarded for tax purposes at least for federal and generally states follow federal although i do n't know mass. specifically although it does have other effects if you go this route you simply include the business income and expenses on schedule c as part of your individual return on 1040 and the net se income is included along with your other income if any in computing your tax turbotax or similar software should handle this for you although you may need a premium version that costs a little more   you can elect to have the llc taxed as a corporation by filing form see in principle you are supposed to do this when the entity is formed but in practice aiui if you do it by the end of the year they wo n't care at all and if you do it after the end of the year but before or with your first affected return you qualify for automatic relief however deciding how to divide the business income profits into reasonable pay to yourself versus dividends is more complicated and filling out corporation tax returns in addition to your individual return which is still required is more work in addition to the work and cost of filing and reporting the llc itself to your state of choice unless until you make something like $ a year this probably is n't worth it 1099 reporting stripe qualifies as a payment network and under a recent law payment networks must annually report to irs and copy to you on form 1099-k if your account exceeds certain thresholds see   note you are still legally required to report and pay tax on your se income even if you are n't covered by 1099-k or other reporting self employment tax as a self employed person if the llc is disregarded you have to pay se tax that is effectively equivalent to the fica taxes that would be paid by your employer and you as an employee combined this is 12.4 for social security unless until your total earned income exceeds a cap for 2017 $ adjusted yearly for inflation and 2.9 for medicare with no limit plus additional medicare tax if you exceed a higher threshold and it is n't repealed and replaced if the llc corporation status it has to pay you reasonable wages for your services and fica on those wages like any other employer estimated payments you are required to pay most of your individual income tax and se tax if applicable during the year generally 90 of your tax or your tax minus $ 1,000 whichever is less most wage earners do n't notice this because it happens automatically through payroll withholding but as self employed you are responsible for making sufficient and timely estimated payments and will owe a penalty if you do n't however since this is your first year you may have a safe harbor if you also have income from an employer reported on w-2 with withholding and that withholding is to pay last year 's tax then you are exempt from the underpayment penalty for this year   if you elect corporation status then the corporation which is really just you must always make timely payments of withheld amounts according to one of several different schedules that may apply depending on the amounts i believe it also must make estimated payments for its own liability if any but i 'm not familiar with that part

your debits and credits are perfect now it comes down to a choice of how you want your accounts organized financially speaking in terms of taxes it 's recommended you keep a separate set of books just like a corporation and account for them strictly according to law it 's best not to credit phone expenses since it will no longer show on your net reports   a better alternative would be phone reimbursement   with that you can not only see if you 've been compensated but also how much you 're personally managing these expenses by checking the annual phone expense account this is all up to personal preference but so long as you 're properly balancing your accounts you can introduce any level of resolution you wish   i prefer total resolution when it comes to financial accounting also it is not good practice to debit away salary   the net of this account will be lower and distorted   an expense reimbursement is not salary anyways so the proper bookings will follow below finally if gnucash is calling salary an income account this is unfortunate   the proper label would be revenue since income is a net account of expenses from revenue in the income identity entries with this your books will become clearer your cash assets will remain as clear as you had organized them but now your income statement will provide higher resolution

the answer is actually very simple the cost of data seriously call the cboe tomorrow and ask yourself they have two big programs   1 the penny pilot program where options trade at penny increments instead of 5 cent increments this is only extended to a select few symbols because of the amount of data this can generate is too much for the data vendors data vendors store and sell historical data the exchanges themselves often have a big data vending business too 2 the weekly options program where only select symbols get these chains because of the amount of data they will generate liquidity and demand are factors in determining if the cboe will consider enabling those series on new issues although they have to give the list of which symbols are on these programs to the sec

there is some magic involved in that calculation because what health insurance is worth to you is not necessarily the same it is worth for the employer two examples that illustrate the extreme ends of the spectrum let 's say you or a family member have a chronic or a serious illness especially if it is a preexisting condition for instance cancer in that case health insurance can be worth literally millions of dollars to you even if you are a the value of health insurance can be substantial sometimes it could even make financial sense in that case to accept a very low paying job on the other extreme of the scale if you are very young and healthy many people decide to forego insurance in that case the value of health insurance can be as little as the penalty usually 2 of your taxable income i believe

there are cases where it makes sense to insure something even if you can bear its loss   insurance is a tool to control risk   one reason you might want to control risk is indeed if you can not afford to bear it 's loss   however there are other reasons you might wish to insure something when you look at your life in totality let 's say you have $ 100 to work with and you have an item a that costs $ 30 perhaps you really need a in your life but its clear here that you can afford to replace it so maybe you do n't insure it   then you get item b which also costs $ 30 and item c which costs $ 30   we can see that you can cover all three of these total value $ 90 so one might argue that you do n't need to insure it now let 's add item d onto the plate also at a cost of $ 30   now you 're in an interesting position with 4 items you depend on a b c and d which have a sum total replacement cost of $ 120   now if all of these break or are stolen you no longer have the funds to replace them   of course what are the odds that all of them break at the same time   you may be able to do the math to determine the probability of going broke and use that to determine whether you want to insure the item or not now consider that you will have to make a similar mathematical analysis for every additional purchase you make   you will also have items which you can bear to lose but you really do n't want to   these can add a large amount of effort to every decision you make   it may be worth getting insurance in such a case   one could think of the purchase in two parts   there is the part that accounts for the statistical expectation of loss and the other is the insurance company 's profits   the profits could be thought of as paying the insurance company for a service which makes it easier for you to think through complicated decisions by removing risk

there are two ways to measure the value of money in the past 1 as victor mentioned there are inflation statistics covering the last 100 or so years that value the currency against an ever changing basket of goods this is sufficient when measuring general inflation over the period of the hundred years where there is data this is how it was measured in your example 2 for older time periods or where a value comparison is required between specific items particularly where these were not in the basket of goods used for the inflation calculation historical records of the price of comparable goods can be used this is in effect the same as mark to market valuations for illiquid financial instruments and requires through records to find the price of either a comparable basket of goods to one that would be used for inflation calculations today or a comparable set of items an example of this is finding the value of a particular type of house say a house in london in the 19th century compared to the same house today by finding records of how much comparable houses would sell for on average then and now this second measure is also used where the country in question did n't or does n't keep reliable inflation statistics which may well be true of colombia in the 90s this means that there is a chance that this way of estimating 's wealth in today 's terms may have also been used another notable reason to use this methodology is that unless you are using exchange rates in purchasing power parity terms the value of money held in different currencies is different this is even true today as the value of $ 1 in inr in india is likely to be higher than the value of a dollar in the us in terms of what you can buy using this methodology allows for a more accurate comparison in values where different countries and currencies are involved

the securities investor protection corporation is roughly analogous to the fdic for investments   there are some important differences like a lack of 100 guarantee you get all of your funds back the sipc understands you invested knowing there was some risk and therefore you take that same risk in getting your money from a failed brokerage   however there is still a level of commitment and trust that lessen the risk of investing in the wrong place also do not typo the acronym at your work computer   in the us and perhaps elsewhere it is a racist term and you are likely to get some bad search results

401(k withdrawals early or otherwise are not subject to fica or medicare taxes   that 's because they already were taxed when they were contributed   and of course the earnings from the 401(k contributions are not earned income and thus are not subject to payroll taxes for that reason while 401(k contributions are exempt from federal and generally state income taxes they are n't exempt from payroll taxes and as such you 'll see two separate amounts on your w2 and paystub if you contributed the amount that is subject to those taxes and the amount that is subject to income tax so no you do n't have to pay payroll fica social security taxes on your early withdrawal   as for the penalty that is basically an extra tax so if you withdraw $ 1000 you pay income tax at your marginal rate plus 10 penalty if your marginal rate is 25 and you 're not moving across a rate step boundary you will pay +

what is never mention was that even though top marginal taxes were high even extreme nobody paid them reagan lowered taxes but also made lots of people pay taxes that had never had to pay them before you could essentially write off losses from a business indefinitely failing to earn money on an investment was also a loss my dad on the advice of an irs tax auditor built a greenhouse and we started selling flowers but it was intended to never make any money it 's sole purpose was to reduce tax liability   these tax shelters were geared as personal tax shelters so what was done to service bigger business was to create what was called holding corporations these corporations would take investors money and basically just sit on it which could then be claimed as a loss but if these spread between bank interest cds paid on the holdings of this corporation and the interest cost of borrowing against those holdings hit a sweet spot they would build a strip mall or something similar this was the trigger to the boom bust when the feds raised lowered the interest rates and had a lot to do with stagflation at the time they would turn key the project and reinvest in holdings people could essentially bring their taxes down as much as they wanted even to zero it just meant that they had to put more money into holding corporations   when reagan changed the tax code to disallow these tax write offs he put lots of very wealthy people in the poor house overnight they went to bed one night and woke up with all their investors wanting their money i know a guy that operated a holding corporation that still cries about it to this day of course he has never really financially recovered either      the point is that what the tax code listed as your top marginal tax had no bearing on what you paid in tax prior to reagan 34 tax was way more than most of these people ever dreamed of paying in taxes prior to reagan

these have the potential to become end of the world scenarios so i 'll keep this very clear if you start to feel that any particular investment may suddenly become worthless then it is wise to liquidate that asset and transfer your wealth somewhere else if your wealth happens to be invested in cash then transferring that wealth into something else is still valid   digging a hole in the ground is n't useful and running for the border probably wo n't be necessary consider countries that have suffered actual currency collapse and debt default   take zimbabwe for example   even as inflation went into the millions of percent the zimbabwe stock exchange soared as investors were prepared to spend ever more of their devaluing currency to buy stable stocks in a small number of locally listed companies even if the euro were to suffer a critical fall european companies would probably be ok if you did n't panic and dig in the back garden over the fall of dotcom there is no need to panic over the decline of certain currencies   just diversify your risk and buy non cash or euro assets update a few ideas re diversification the problem for greece is n't really a euro problem it is local local property local companies these can be affected by default because no one believes in the entirety of the greek economy not just the currency it happens to be using so diversification really means buying things that are outside greece

i think the answer depends on whether you 're trying to get out of debt and stay out or if you just want this card paid off   that is are you changing the way you deal with money and debt for good if you just want this card paid off and you 're ok with going back into debt later then scott 's advice is one way to go   i 'd personally be nervous about leaving myself with no cash reserves at all    if you are planning to get out of debt and stay out then you do n't want to put yourself in a position where you 're tempted to go back into debt as soon as you hit a speed bump   so you need some cushion so that an emergency does n't push you right back to the credit cards   if you 've got a budget that you can live on and that covers your usual expenses and your job is relatively stable then $ 1000 is probably enough of a cushion for most things you can then pay off most of the credit card using the rest of your savings   if you 're in an unstable job situation then you 'll want to keep more if not all of your savings as protection against the instability   once the situation then throw the surplus savings at the debt $ 1000 does n't cover all possible emergencies but it 's generally a good tradeoff between prudence and paranoia

as for the letting the wise people only make the decisions i guess that would be a bit odd in the long run especially when you get more experienced or when you do n't agree with their decision what you could do is make an agreement that always 3/4 + of the partners must agree with an investment this promotes your involvement in the investments and it will also make the debate about where to invest more alive fun and educational as for the taxes i ca n't give you any good advice as i do n't know how tax business stuff works in the us here in the netherlands we have several business forms that each have their own tax savings the savings mostly depend on the amount of money that is involved some forms are better for small earnings 80k or less other forms only get interesting with large amounts of money 100k or more apart from the tax savings there could also be some legal technical reasons to choose a specific form again i do n't know the situation in your country so maybe some other folks can help a final tip if your also doing this for fun try to use this investment company to learn from this might come in handy later

after reading their full guarantee page it seems that they really do n't understand the definition of the word they do n't seem to offer any guarantee but rather just a list of reasons that they believe their plan is foolproof mostly they argue that their lawyers have covered every angle and a lot of big players use them so naturally everyone will respect the value of their online currency nowhere do they address what happens if their company goes belly up which is the primary thing i 'd be worried about with this type of thing ironically they specifically state on their guarantee page many first rate payment systems tried to guarantee their stability but    unfortunately failed to fulfill their obligations given to the users    and contractors myopic investment policy and court claims of tax    agencies have frequently adversely affected the work of electronic    payment systems which personally would make me even more nervous to use their system their guarantee amounts to other systems have crashed and burned but we are smarter than those guys and even hired lawyers to confirm it

i think you are mixing up forward looking statements with the actual results the funds objective    the fund invests primarily in stocks that tend to offer current dividends it focuses on high quality companies that have prospects for long term total returns as a result of their ability to grow earnings and their willingness to increase dividends over time obviously in 1993 quite a few companies paid the dividends and hence was able to give dividends over the period of years in some years its given more and in some years less for example the year 2000 it gave $ 1999 it gave $ and in 1998 it gave $ the current economic conditions are such that companies are not making huge and the one 's that are making prefer not to distribute dividends and hold on to cash as it would help survive the current economic conditions so just to clarify this particular funds objective is to invest in companies that would give dividends which is then passed on to fund holders this fund does not sell appreciated stocks to convert it into dividends

is evaluating stocks just a loss of time if the stock is traded very much not at all making sound investment decisions based on fundamental analysis of companies will help you to do decide whether a given company is right for you and your risk appetite investing is not a zero sum game and you can achieve a positive long term or short term depending on what you 're after outcome for yourself without compromising your ability to sleep at night if you take the time to become acquainted with the companies that you are investing in how can you ensure that your evaluation is more precise than the    market ones which consists of the evaluation of thousands of people    and professionals for the average individual the answer is often simply you probably can not but you do n't have to set the bar that high what you can do is ensure that your evaluation gives you a better understanding of your investment and allows you to better align it with your investment objectives you do n't have to beat the professionals you just have to lose less money than you would by paying them to make the decision for you

what does negative total equity means in mcdonald 's balance sheet it means that their liabilities exceed their total assets   usually is means that a company has accumulated losses over time but that 's just one explanation    but is n't mcdonald a very healthy company and never lost money just because a company has always money does not mean it 's a healthy company   it may have borrowed a lot of money in order to operate and now the growth is not able to keep up with the debt load in mcdonald 's case the major driver in the equity change is the fact that they have bought back over $ 20 billion in stock over the past few years which reduces assets and equity   if they had instead paid off debt their equity would not be negative but their debt may be so cheap in terms of interest rate that it made more financial sense to buy back stock instead of paying off debt   there are too many variables to assess that in this forum

how much should a rational investor have in individual stocks probably none an additional dollar invested in a etf or low cost index fund comprised of many stocks will be far less risky than a specific stock and you 'd need a lot more capital to make buying voting and selling in individual stocks as if you were running your own personal index fund worthwhile i think in index funds use weightings to   make it easier to track the index without constantly trading so my advice here is to allocate based not on some financial principal but just loss aversion do n't gamble with more than you can afford to lose figure out how much of that you need it does n't sound like you can actually afford to lose it all so i 'd say 5 percent and make sure that 's funded from other equity holdings or you 'll end up overweight in stocks

obviously you should aim to max out your pension though this is a bit of a judgement call as future growth could take it over the limit even once you stop making contributions a public service job with a defined benefit pension wo n't make much difference as they are also assessed against the lifetime limit at a multiplier of 20x the annual pension so a similar rate to what you 're looking at anyway £ 500/year corresponds to a £ 10 k notional pot on the other hand public service pensions are protected against inflation if you wanted an equivalent defined contribution pension annuity rates are actually quite a bit lower than that more like £ per £ 10k. apart from a pension i 'd suggest making sure you own your own property by the time you retire the rent you save by doing that is effectively tax free though you have to pay for the mortgage out of taxed income so it 's equivalent to saving in an isa but with the added benefit that you are effectively hedged against rental changes after that isas are the next logical investment vehicle though be aware that cash isas do n't pay very good returns at the moment

as an expansion on the correct answer consider a really boring economy   nothing changes   wages and prices stay constant for years at a time   every month the consumer price index stays at 0    then something catastrophic happens say on july 31 2000 a cheap local source for a vital resource runs out and it must be obtained from a higher cost source   floods cut internal road networks resulting in higher transportation costs   whatever   the new situation is permanent as a result the next month august 2000 prices go up 5   that is 5 higher than the previous month july 2000 and 5 higher than a year previously august 1999 there is a lot of and politicians each promise that they and only they can inflation to the ground but when the figures for september 2000 come out inflation stays the same   prices are the same as in august 2000 and 5 higher than in september 1999 this goes on for months   nothing changes prices stay the same and the inflation rate year over year stays at 5 finally the figures for august 2001 come out   wonder of wonders   prices are the same as in august 2000 and inflation drops to zero    and the politicians all take the credit short version inflation year over year changes either because of what in now included in the month just past or what is now excluded from a year ago

mathematically it 's arbitrary you could just as easily use the bid or the midpoint as the denominator so long as you 're consistent when comparing securities   so there 's not a fundamental reason to use the ask   the best argument i can come up with is that most analysis is done from the buy side so looking at liquidity costs meaning how much does the value drop instantaneously purely because of the bid ask spread when you buy a security would be more relevant by using the ask purchase price as the basis meaning if a stock has a bid ask range of $ if you buy the stock at $ 100 the ask you immediately lose 5 of its value since you can only sell it for $ 95

some things you should consider balance transfer debt consolidation if you get approved for the citibank 2 year interest free credit card on balance transfers you will need another loan of $ 18 k to consolidate your other debt if you can not get approval for the credit card you may need to get consolidation loan approval for your full $ 35 k of debt this approval again will depend on your income and your ability to make repayments as it sounds like you do n't have any assets you may have to get an unsecured loan which comes with higher interest rates remember a consolidation loan is only worthwhile if you can get an interest rate lower than your current interest rates and if you pay as much as possible to reduce the term of the loan and the total interest you end up paying you have n't given the interest rate for the consolidation loan but lets assume you could get one at 12 p.a over a 3 year period for a loan of $ 18 k you would have to pay $ per week together with the $ per week you would have to pay the credit card balance transfer your total repayments per week for the first 2 years would be $ then $ per week for the 3rd year this option sounds affordable but without knowing what your income and current expenses are it is hard for others to determine for sure if you had to get a consolidated loan for the full $ 35 k at say 12 p.a then your weekly repayments would be $ over a 3 year period this looks to be achievable too being disciplined as you said you will need to be very disciplined in order to get out of this debt you will need to set up a proper budget and watch every dollar you spend you will need to restrict any spending on credit cards and getting any new personal loans you say you will keep a small credit limit to pay for ongoing online payments for courses make sure you uses a 55 day interest free credit card preferably with no annual fee for this and pay the full amount due every month so you do n't end up paying any more interest on this card in case of death would my debts pass on to my next of kin or family if your debts are unsecured which personal loans and credit cards are then no your next of kin or family will not have to pay your debts if you die when you die any money or assets which would be sold in your estate will first be used to pay off any of your debts if there is not enough money or assets in your estate then your remaining debts may not need to be paid other people are only responsible for paying your debts after you die if bankruptcy an alternative to bankruptcy is a part 9 debt agreement as i mentioned in my answer to your previous question in this case you will still need to pay off at least part of the debt but will not be charged any further interest on the debt this is not as severe as bankruptcy but as i mentioned before should not be taken lightly like bankruptcy a debt agreement will appear on your credit file for seven years and your name will be listed on the national personal insolvency index forever bankruptcy or a debt agreement should only be used as a last resort if you are unable to undertake any other option and remember even if you do take this course of action you will still need to be disciplined now and into the future so you do n't end up in a similar situation again

a terrific resource is this article to summarize the points given pros cons there is no generic yes or no answer as to whether you ought to max out your 401(k)s if you are a sophisticated investor then saving the income for investing could be a better alternative long term capital gains are taxed at 15 in the us so if you buy and hold on to good companies that reinvest their earnings then the share price keeps going up and you 'll save a lot of money that would go in taxes   if you 're not a very good investor however then 401(k)s make a lot of sense if you 're going to end up setting up some asset allocation and buying etfs and rebalancing or having a   manager rebalance for you every year or so then you might as well take the 401(k option and lower your taxable income   point 1 is simply wrong because companies that reinvest earnings and growing for a long time are essentially creating tax free gains for you which is even better than tax deferred gains nonetheless most people have neither the time nor the interest to research companies and for them the 401(k makes more sense

if you are investing for 10 years then you just keep buying at whatever price the fund is at this is called dollar cost averaging if the fund is declining in value from when you first bought it then when you buy more the average price you bought in at is now lower so therefore your losses are lower and when it goes back up you will make more even if it continues to decline in value then you keep adding more money in periodically eventually your position will be so large that on the first uptick you will have a huge percent gain anyway this is only suggested because you are in it for 10 years other people 's investment goals vary

i think it depends a lot on your idea of how you should relate to your neighbors personally i think that i should be allowed to do just about whatever i want with my property and i grant my neighbor the same right if my neighbor wants to paint his house purple with orange stripes and fill his front lawn with pink i think that 's his right if i do n't like it i do n't have to look at his house i would draw the line at things that i can not avoid by simply looking the other way like running jet engines in his back yard at 2 in the morning as i could not avoid the noise or dumping toxic waste on the street as it will cause health problems etc others think it is their business what their neighbor does with his property and want to be able to control it they want someone who has the authority to force everyone in the neighborhood to paint their house in colors deemed acceptable to meet certain requirements for yard work and that 's what home owners associations are for to require that everyone in the neighborhood maintain their property according to a standard set by the hoa which should theoretically represent the wishes of the majority of course the price you pay for giving you the right to tell your neighbor what kind of fence he is allowed to have is that now your neighbors can tell you what kind of fence you can have advocates of often say that they are necessary to protect property values personally i think this is something of a circular argument i must have the right to prevent my neighbor from doing something that in my opinion makes his house ugly not because i necessarily have no choice but to stare out my window at his house all day and be by it but because someday i may want to sell my house to someone who will have no choice but to stare out the window at his house all day and be by it and so will not want to buy my house of course if we all just minded our own business this would n't be an issue okay this was pretty much an anti hoa post but i did try to state the other side of it

credit card companies charge merchants for accepting their cards   they 'll take their cut and give you some of the fee back as a reward    so in reality merchants have increased their prices to accommodate for the credit card processing fees the credit card takes a bit of their fee and gives you back some of the money you would n't have spent if there were no fees for using a credit card

what littleadv said is correct   his worth is based on the presumed worth of the total company value which is much greater than all investment dollars combined because of valuation in other words his worth is based on the potential return for his share of ownership at a rate based on the latest valuation of the company he is worth $ 17.5 billion today but the total funding for facebook is only $ 2.4 billion i do n't understand this in private companies valuations typically come from either speculation analysts or from investments   investment valuations are the better gauge because actual money traded hands for a percentage ownership however just as with public companies on the stock market there are at least two caveats just because someone else sold their shares at a given rate does n't mean that rate in both cases it 's possible the value may be much lower or much higher   some high value purchases surprise for how high they are such as microsoft 's acquisition of skype for $ 8.5 billion the formula for one owner 's worth based on a given acquisition is valuation = acquisition amount acquisition percent worth = owner 's percent × valuation according to wikipedia zuckerberg owns 24   in january goldman 's invested $ 500 million at a $ 50 billion valuation that is the latest investment and puts zuckerberg 's worth at $ 12 billion however some speculation places a facebook ipo at a much higher valuation such as as $ 100 billion   i do n't know what your reference is for $ 17 billion but it puts their valuation at $ billion between the january goldman valuation and current ipo speculation for instance originally invested $ 10,000 which at his estimated 5 ownership would now be worth $ 3 5 billion

this is a great question   the irs is not 100 clear on this irs publications do however very strongly suggest that assuming your wife has a plan providing family coverage you can contribute up to your family maximum if she does not have a family coverage plan then the answer is definitively no you may only contribute the individual limit note if you have children covered by her plan then she is considered to have family coverage even if you are not covered by her plan see here question 12 from the 2012 irs publication bottom of page 4 for 2012 if you have self only hdhp coverage you can contribute up to $ if you have family hdhp coverage you can contribute up to $ this is presumably the referencing the definition which is introduced and discussed for married couples on page 6 rules for married people    if either spouse has family hdhp coverage both spouses are treated as having family hdhp coverage if each spouse has family coverage under a separate plan the contribution limit for 2012 is $ you must reduce the limit on contributions before taking into account any additional contributions by the amount contributed to both spouse 's archer msas after that reduction the contribution limit is split equally between the spouses unless you agree on a different division example for 2012 mr. auburn and his wife are both eligible individuals they each have family coverage under separate mr. auburn is 58 years old and mrs. auburn is 53 mr. and mrs. auburn can split the family contribution limit $ equally or they can agree on a different division if they split it equally mr. auburn can contribute $ to an hsa one half the maximum contribution for family coverage $ + $ 1,000 additional contribution and mrs. auburn can contribute $ to an hsa the last example is nearly the exact situation you are in assuming your wife 's plan is family coverage the only assumption beyond what is explicitly written you need to make is that you are considered to have family coverage in the example as per the rules for married people section even though your plan only is a single coverage plan   this conclusion seems to logically follow from information in the faqs here see as well as this document neither the above example nor any irs documents referenced in this answer cover your situation completely

holding pure cash is a problem for 401 k companies because they would then have follow banking rules because they would be holding your cash on their balance sheets they do n't want to be in that business instead they should offer at least one option as a cash equivalent a money market fund this way the money is held by the fund not by 401 k administrator money market funds invest in ultra short term paper such as overnight loans between banks and other debt instruments that mature in a matter of days so it is all extremely liquid as close to money as you can get without actually being money   it is extremely rare for a money market fund to lose value or break the buck during the crisis of 2008 only one or two funds broke the buck and it did n't last long they had gotten greedy and their short term investments were a little more aggressive as they were trying to get extra returns in short your money is safe in a money market fund and your 401 k plan should offer one as the cash option or at least it should offer a short term bond fund if you feel strongly that your money should be in actual cash you can always stop contributing to the 401 k and put the money in the bank this is not a good idea though unless you 're close to retirement you 'll be much better off investing in a well diversified portfolio even through the ups and downs of the market

the hong kong dollar has been pegged to the usd for nearly 30 years and the hong kong authorities have fairly strong means to defend the peg   so at first glance it would appear that there is really no difference as long as you are getting 7.75 hkd for each usd that you used to receive however the peg is arbitrary and could be lifted at any time like the removal of the chf peg to eur surprised a lot of people in early 2015   as mainland china becomes more integrated it is unclear what will happen to the hkd in the long run   whether this matters really depends on your contracts   if your contracts are short dated you may only take a discount relative to usd for a few payments before you can try to renegotiate it 's also worth noting trading hkd for your local inr can be more expensive check your local rates

the level 2 data is simply showing the depth of the market if i am trading shares with my broker i have the option of viewing only the top 10 bid ask prices in the depth or all of the data which sometimes can be a very long list with another broker i get the top ten bid and ask prices and how many orders are available for each price level or i have the option of listing each order separately for each price level in order of when the order was placed i get the same kind of data if trading options i do not know about futures because i do n't trade them simply this data may be important to a trader because it may give an indication of whether there are more buyers or sellers in the market which in turn may but not always give an indication of which way the market may be moving as an example the price depth below shows before market open with sellers the buyers in both numbers and volume   this gives an indication that prices may drop when the market opens of course there could be some good news coming out prior to market open or just after causing a flood of buyers into the market and sellers to cancel their orders this would change everything around with more buyers than sellers and indicate that prices may now be going up the market depth is an important aspect to look at before putting an order in as it can give an indication of which way the market is moving especially in a very liquid security or market

a market maker is someone that is contractually bound by the exchange to provide both bid and ask prices for a given volume e.g. 5000 shares a single market maker usually covers many stocks and a single stock is usually covered by many market makers the nyse has specialists that are market makers that also performed a few other roles in the management of trading for a stock and usually a single issue on the nyse is covered by only one market maker   market makers are often middlemen between brokers ignoring stuff like dark pools and the fact that brokers will often trade stocks internally among their own clients before going to the exchange   historically the market makers gave up buy sell discretion in exchange for being the go to guys for anyone wanting to trade in that stock when you told your broker to buy a stock for you he did n't hook you up with another retail investor he went to the market maker market makers would also sometimes find investors willing to step in when more liquidity was needed for a security they were like other floor traders they hung out on the exchange floors and interacted with traders to buy and sell stocks traders came to them when they wanted to buy one of the specialist 's issues there was no public order book just ticker tape and a quote it was up to the market maker to maintain that order book   since they are effectively forbidden from being one sided traders in a security their profit comes from the bid ask spread being the counter party to almost every trade they 'd make profit from always selling above where they were buying except when the price moved quickly the downside to this arrangement the spread goes to the market maker is just stating that the profit implicit in the spread gets consumed by the market maker with the switch to ecns the role of the market maker has changed for example forex trading firms tend to act as market makers to their customers on ecns the invisible anonymous guy at the other end of most trades is often a market maker still performing his traditional role yet brokers can interact directly with each other now rather than relying on the market maker 's book with modern online investing and public order books retail investors might even be trading directly with each other market makers are still out there in part they perform a service sold by an exchange to the companies that choose to be listed on that exchange that service has changed to helping volatility during normal high volatility periods such as at open and close

we measure the value of gold by comparing it to other things sorry but there is no better answer than that there is no gold standard pun intended by which objects can be measured in value because value is a subjective term it would be comparable to asking how funny is an object different objects are funny to different people even if we gathered all the really funny object together there is no guaranty those objects would be funny next year unless we all agreed they were as part of a social contract which is basically what we do with currency while gold does not need a social contract in order for it to retain its value this is only because it is has been 1 very useful and 2 rare if either of these two factors change the value of gold will change which it has on several occasions rant about intrinsic value of gold below gold has no intrinsic value none whatsoever   intrinsic value makes just as much sense as a cat dog animal dog and cat are referring to two mutually exclusive animals therefore a cat dog is a nonsensical term intrinsic value the actual value of a company or an asset based on an underlying perception of its true value intrinsic value is perceived which means it is worth whatever you or a group of people think it is intrinsic value has nothing i repeat absolutely nothing to do with reality   the most obvious example of this is the purchase of a copy right you are assigning an intrinsic value to a copy right by purchasing it however when you purchase a copy right you are not buying ink on a page you are purchasing an idea someone 's that for all intensive purposes does n't even exist in reality by definition things that do not exist do not have intrinsic properties because things that do n't exist do n't have any natural properties at all intrinsic according to dictionary   belonging to the essential nature or constitution of a thing the intrinsic of a star an intrinsic property of an object is something we know that exists because it is a natural property of that object emit light we know this because we can measure the light coming from it it is not subjective intrinsic value by definition is the opposite of intrinsic

i 'd contact paypal to request clarification   in the meantime most banks will credit outgoing transfers immediately but process later and only debit incoming after it passes through a processing team so while the money will go out right away it may take a few days for your bank to actually process the withdrawal and the subsequent reversal from paypal in reality paypal does n't usually recieve the money immediately either but they extend you credit to speed up things either way it does n't hurt to contact paypal to make sure they have reverted the amount to your bank and if they confirm such you can also reach out to your bank and ask where the money is stuck usually delays like this will happen in the interface between two unrelated financial institutions

shares used to be paper documents but these days they are more commonly held electronically instead although this partly depends on what country you 're in but it does n't make any significant practical difference regardless of their physical form a share simply signifies that you own a certain proportion of a company and are thus entitled to receive any dividends that may be paid to the shareholders to sell your shares you need a broker there are scores of online ones who will sell them for a modest fee your tax forms are entirely dependent on the that tax you and since you 've not told us where you are no one can answer that

this answer assumes based partly on your and some simplifying assumptions as i see it you have a few options get a mortgage to buy your sister out this avoids any ongoing involvement of your sister which may or may not be a good thing it means you will be paying interest to a bank or similar financial institution make an arrangement to buy the house in installments in combination with some kind of rent likely to be a complex option to set up buy the house using a loan from your sister potentially agree a private mortgage to protect your sister in the event you fail to pay if interest is paid then it is likely to attract tax simply pay your sister rent let her keep ownership of her half of the house either forever or until you have saved up the cash to buy her out rent is likely to attract tax whatever option you go with i would you get advice on any local legal tax issues and drawing up the contracts if you do go into an arrangement that keeps your sister involved make sure you discuss the what ifs upfront and build them into your agreement if you can't won't pay what happens can she insist that the house is sold and the proceeds split in some way can she rent our her half of the house to someone else

basically a 401(k can have what is called a loan but is more properly a structured withdrawal and repayment agreement this allows you to access your nest egg to pay for unforeseen expenses without having to actually cash it out and pay the 10 penalty plus taxes you can get up to half of your current savings with an absolute cap of $ 50k minus the balance of any other loan outstanding while there is a balance outstanding you must make regular scheduled payments the agreement does include an interest rate but basically that interest money goes into your account the downside of a 401(k loan is the you must pay the scheduled amount and you also have to keep the job for which you 're paying into the 401(k if you quit or are fired the balance of the loan must usually be paid in 60 days or else the financial institution will consider the unpaid balance a withdrawal and notify the irs to that effect now with a roth account it works a little differently basically contributions to any roth account ira or 401(k are post tax but that means the money 's now yours there is no penalty or additional taxes levied on any amount you cash out so a loan basically just provides structure you withdraw then pay back under structured terms but if you need a little cash for a good reason it 's usually better just to cash out some of the principal of a roth account and then be disciplined enough to pay back into it

it 's slightly more complicated than that usually a country that was in greece 's situation would be able to use inflation to devalue their currency which would have the effect of lowering the value of the government 's debts and also of making greek prices more competitive in the international market or they could use quantitative easing to inject cheap cash into the economy to help stimulate it because greece is on the euro however they have no control over their own currency and their options are highly limited additionally when you join the eu especially the eurozone that 's supposed to come with additional internal responsibilities but it 's also supposed to come with additional external ones as well greece has a responsibility to get its shit together but the whole point is that more financially stable countries have a responsibility to help them right now that means germany they 're the ones with the greatest control over the euro and they 're away from their duties if the rest of europe did n't want to risk ending up in this position they should n't have let greece into the eurozone

i think that all else being equal if more people have solar panels on our roof we keep our military in fewer countries instead of planning on ramping up the number see nigeria furthermore the initial question was n't whether installing solar panels is going to stop the action the conversation started by being about whether solar is actually cheaper when you factor in the amount used to subsidize both sources of energy not whether switching to solar would stop subsidies to oil what you did is called moving the goalposts   the word 2016 does n't show up in the article or in the study it cites that was a typo i understand it was about 2013 i was trying to saying that it was about the same year as yours that was my bad i read the whole thing originally and i even read the study i accept responsibility for the typo though   anyways neither set of data is manipulated my study just includes more things like foreign tax credits cleanup subsidies for both coal and oil tar sands exemption from cleanup funds power africa a five year 7 billion dollar program that was only announced in 2013 that overseas stuff that goes on is a huge part of the equation    and okay so they are n't equivalent then your point is moot yes both sides have off the book subsidies but one side 's off the book subsidies are so bigger that it 's laughable to even put them in the same category not to mention the costs of war in the middle east stretch beyond money think lives and recycling programs actually come with benefits think smaller

this decision depends upon a few things i will list a 1 what is your perception about financial markets in your time span of investments 2 what kind of returns are you expecting 3 how much liquidity do you have to take care of your daily monthly expenses your perception about financial markets is weak for the near future do not invest all your money in a mutual fund at 1 time because if the market falls drastically chances are that your fund will also lose a lot of money and the nav will go down on the other hand if you think it is strong go ahead and invest all at one time 2 if you are expecting very high returns in a short time frame then sip might not be a very good option as you are only investing a portion of your money so if the market goes higher then you will make money only on what you have invested till date and also buy into the fund in the upcoming month at a higher rate so you will get less units   3 if you put all your money into a mutual fund will you have enough money to take care of your daily needs and emergencies the worst thing about an investment is putting in all what you have and then being forced to sell in a bear market at a lower rate because you really require the money other option is taking a personal 16 and taking care of your daily needs but that would not make sense either as the average return that you can expect from a mutual fund in india is 12 13 to 1 if you have money to spare and think the market is going to go higher a mutual fund is a better option 2 if you have the money to spare and think that the market is going to fall don't do is always better to be even than lose 3 if you do n't have the money and do n't know about markets but want to be part of it then you can invest in an sip because the advantages of this are if the market goes high you make money on what you 've put it and if the market falls you get to buy more units of the fund for a cheaper price eventually you can expect to make a return of 14 15 on these but again investments are subject to market risk please watch the funds average return over the last 10 years and their portfolio holdings all the best i am assuming you are talking about equity funds

given that a poor person probably has much less to invest how can odds be in their favor to add to lan 's great answer if one is poor because they do n't have enough income to build wealth invest then there are only two ways to change the situation earn more or spend less   neither are easy but both are usually possible   one can take on side jobs look for a better paying career etc   cutting spending can also be hard but is generally easier than adding income in general wealth building is more about what you do with your income than about how much you make   obviously the more you make the easier it is but just about anyone can build wealth if they spend less than they make once your net income is high enough that you have income then you can start building wealth   unfortunately many people have piles of debts to clean up before they are able to get to that point what could a small guy with $ 100 do to make himself not poor anymore right just having $ 100 is not going to make you rich there is a practical limit to how much return you can make short of high risk activities like gambling lottery tickets etc i have actually seen this as a justification for playing the lottery which i disagree with but is an interesting point   if you just invest $ 100 at 25 per year for illustration traditional investments typically only make 10 12 on average in 10 years you 'll have about $ if instead you invest $ 100 per month at 12 annualized in 10 years you 'll have over $ 23,000 not that $ 23,000 makes you rich the point is that regularly saving money is much more powerful than having money to start with

you should not look at volume in isolation but look at it together with other indicators and/or the release of news good or bad when there is lower than average volume this could be an indication that the stock is in a bit of a holding pattern possibly waiting for some company or economic news to come out especially when accompanied by small changes in price it could also mean that trading in a certain direction is drying up and the trend is about to end this could be accompanied with a large move in price when there is higher than average volume 2 to 3 times more or higher this could be due to the release of company results company or economic news or the start or end of a trend especially if accompanied by a gap a large increase in volume accompanied by a large fall in price usually a gap down may also be an indication the stock has gone ex dividend there could be a range of reasons for variations in volume to the average volume that is why you need to look at other indicators company reporting and news and economic news in combination with the volume changes to get a grasp of what is really happening

this is a very common misconception i 've been studying equities and credits for a while now and the simplest way to explain the difference is this   credit is about stable cash flows your investment in a bond has almost read almost nothing to do with growth rate it has everything to do with how stable the cash flows are and interest coverage   equity is about growth no wonder companies with highly irregular cash flows e.g. every single young tech company in the history of tech companies can have the most in demand equity while few bond investors would touch them with a ten foot pole

what it means is that you can always come up with alternative where the difference between two options is stated as a gain or a loss but the effect is the same in either case   for instance if i offer to sell a t shirt for $ 10 and offer a cash discount of $ 1 you pay $ 10 if buying with a credit card or $ 9 if buying with cash   if i instead offer the shirt for $ 9 with a $ 1 surcharge for credit card use you still pay $ 10 if buying with a credit card or $ 9 if buying with cash   the financial result is the same in either case but psychologically people may perceive them differently and make different buying decisions in a tax situation it may be more complicated since exemptions would n't directly reduce your tax but only your taxable income   however you can still see that in general having to pay $ x more in tax for not doing some action e.g. not purchasing health insurance is the same as being able to pay $ x less in tax as a reward for doing the action   either way doing the action results in you paying $ x less than you would if you did n't do it the only difference is in which behavior doing it or not doing it is framed as the default option   again these may influence people 's behavior even when the net result is the same

the motley fool suggested a good rule of thumb in one of their articles that may be able to help you determine if the market is overheating determine the entire cost of rent for a piece of property so if rent is $ 300/month total cost over a year is $ 3600 compare that to the cost of buying a similar piece of property by dividing the property price by the rent per year so if a similar property is $ 90,000 the ratio would be $ = 25 if the ratio is < 20 you should consider buying a place if its > 20 there 's a good chance that the market is overheated this method is clearly not foolproof but it helps quantify the irrationality of some individuals who think that buying a place is always better than renting   additionally alex b helped me with two additional sources of information for this real estate is local all the articles here refer to the us housing market bankrate says purchase price annual rate in the us has a long term average of fool says purchase price monthly rent 150 is good buy 200 starts to get expensive this answer is copy pasted from a similar question not the same so i did not vote to merge linked here

where are you planning on buying this etf   i 'm guessing it 's directly through vanguard   if so that 's likely your first reason the majority of brokerage accounts charge a commission per trade for etfs and equities but not for mutual funds    another reason is that people who work in the financial industry brokerages mutual fund companies etc have to request permission for every trade before placing an order   this applies to equities and etfs but does not apply to mutual funds   it 's common for a request to be denied if the brokerage has inside information due to other business lines they 'll block trading if a mutual fund company is trading the same security they 'll block trading etc without an explanation   this can happen for months   for these folks it 's typically easier to use mutual funds so if someone can open an account with vanguard and does n't work in the financial industry then i agree with your premise   the vanguard admiral shares have a much lower expense typically very close to their etfs source   worked for a brokerage and mutual fund company

today typically a business needs to hold accounts in more than one currency banks in certain countries are offering what is called a dual currency account it is essentially 2 accounts with same account number but different currency so one can have an account number say and have it in say aud and usd so the balance will always show as x aud and y usd if you deposit funds electronic check or cash in usd your usd balance goes up likewise at the time of withdrawal you have to specify what currency you are withdrawing interest rates are calculated at different percentage for different currencies   so in a nutshell it would like operating 2 accounts with the advantage of remembering only one account number designate a particular currency as default currency so if you do n't quote a currency along with the account number it would be treated as default currency otherwise you always quote the account number and currency of course bundled with other services like free fx advice etc it makes the entire proposition very attractive edit if you have aud 100 and usd 100 if you try and withdraw usd 110 it will not be allowed unless you also sign up for a auto sweep conversion   if you deposit a gbp check into the account by default it would get converted into aud assuming aud is the default currency

you absolutely can be put in jail in america for debt if that debt is to a government or government agency like a municipal government if you have unpaid court costs fines etc it 's common practice in most municipalities to issue an arrest warrant for those even if non payment is due to being indigent in a lot of cases even if you show up to explain why you ca n't pay or make a partial payment on the due date you 'll be arrested and jailed until a judge is available to hear your explanation if one is n't available right when you go in what 's supposed to happen is that if you 're indigent ca n't pay a judge will hear your explanation and provided it 's determined that you 're indigent make adjustments to what you owe cancel or reduce the amount extend the due date setup a payment plan etc and send you on your way it bears mentioning that even in cases where the system works like it should there 's still a very real chance of being put in jail which is n't harmless people can and do lose their jobs while they 're sitting in jail waiting to plead to a judge and of course what 's supposed to happen is n't what always does the police shootings of the past couple years in missouri have some light in a lot of dark corners down there where there are in fact de facto debtor prisons in many municipalities   in addition to civil rights groups filing suit over this in many missouri municipalities the us department of justice has filed suit against the city of over their municipal practices including their use of the courts and to generate municipal revenue some forms of private debt like child support also fall under this umbrella where an arrest warrant will be issued for failure to pay for any reason and this was determined to be a factor in the walter scott shooting walter scott ran to avoid being put in jail over child support debt and losing his job while in jail the new york times highlighted his case in an article titled skip child support go to jail lose job repeat scott said that he sometimes thought his brother did not do everything he could to catch up but that walter seemed to consider it a hopeless cause he recalled seeing his brother plead to a judge that he just did not make enough money he asked the judge how am i supposed to mr. scott said and the judge said something like that ’s your problem you figure it

if she is a legitimate owner you ca n't force her to sell her interest in the house you can communicate indirectly with her perhaps through a lawyer and see if she is willing to sign something authorizing you to sell unless she is mentally incompetent you will likely have a very difficult time of proceeding with a legal challenge at minimum she should be paying you rent if she is the sole and if she is unwilling to let you live in the house or pay you rent as co owners you could possibly proceed with a suit along those lines this is a good example of why it 's not ideal to co own a home with someone you are n't legally married to including a relative or someone you are dating because there is no relatively simple process similar to divorce which determines the allocation of property in the case of a serious dispute if living together it may be preferable to have one party own the home and rent it to another if inherited it may be preferable for one party to buy out the others and rent it back to them or arrange for a portion of any money made through the sale or rental of the home best of luck i hope you are able to reach an agreeable outcome

if you 're looking for some formula i do n't think one exists people talk about this all the time and give conflicting advice if there was a proven accurate formula they would n't be debating it there are basically 3 reasons to do a home improvement project a correct a problem so that you prevent on going damage to your home for example have a leaking roof or replaced or such a job is worthwhile if the cost of fixing the problem is less than the cost of future damage in the case of my termite and leaking roof examples this is almost always worth doing lesser maintenance problems might be more debatable similarly some improvements may reduce expenses like replacing an old furnace with a newer model may cut your heating bills here the question is how long does it take to repay the investment compared to other things you might invest your money in just to make up numbers suppose you find that a new furnace will save you $ 500 per year if the new furnace costs $ 2000 then it will take 4 years to pay for itself i 'd consider that a good investment if that same $ 2000 furnace will only cut your heating bills by $ 100 per year then it will take 20 years to pay for itself you 'd probably be better off putting the $ 2000 into the stock market and using the gains to help pay your heating bill b increase the resale value of your home if you are paying someone else to do the work the harsh reality here is almost no job will increase the resale value by more than the cost of getting the job done i 've seen many articles over the years citing studies on this i think most conclude that kitchen remodeling comes closet to paying for itself and bathrooms come next new windows are also up there i do n't have studies to prove this but my guesses would be replacing something that is basically nice with a different style will rarely pay for itself like replacing oak cabinets with cherry cabinets replacing something that is in terrible shape with something decent is more likely to pay back than replacing something decent with something beautiful like if you have an old iron that 's and falling apart replacing it may pay off if you have a 5-year old that 's in good shape but is not premium top of the line replacing it with a premium will probably do very little for resale value if you can do a lot of the work yourself the story changes many home improvement jobs do n't require a lot of materials but do require a lot of work if you do the labor you can often get the job done very cheaply and it 's likely that the increase in resale value will be more than what you spend for example most of my house has hardwood floors lots of people like pretty hardwood floors i just the floors in two rooms it cost me i do n't know maybe $ 20 or $ 30 for stain and some i 'm sure if i tried to sell the house tomorrow i 'd get my twenty bucks back in higher sale value realtors often advise sellers to paint again if you do it yourself the cost of paint may be a hundred dollars and it can increase the sale price of the house by thousands of course if you do the work yourself you have to consider the value of your time c to make your home more pleasant to live in this is totally subjective you have to make the decision on the same basis that you decide whether anything that is not essential to survival is worth buying to some people a bottle of fancy imported wine is worth thousands even millions of dollars others ca n't tell the difference between a $ 10,000 wine and a $ 15 wine   the thing to ask yourself is how important is this home improvement to me compared to other things i could do with the money like suppose you 're considering spending $ 20,000 remodeling your kitchen what else could you do with $ 20,000 you could buy a car go on an elaborate vacation eat out several times a week for years retire a little earlier etc no one can tell you how much something is worth to you any given home improvement may involve a combination of these factors like say you 're considering that $ 20,000 kitchen remodeling say you somehow find out that this will increase the resale value by $ 15,000 if the only reason you were considering it was to increase resale value then it 's not worth it you 'd lose $ 5,000 but if you also want the nicer kitchen then it is fair to say okay it will cost me $ 20,000 but ultimately i 'll get $ 15,000 of that back so in the long run it will only cost me $ 5,000 is having a nicer kitchen worth $ 5,000 to me note by the way that resale value only matters if and when you sell the house if you expect to stay in this house for 20 years any improvements done are very long term investments if you live in it until you die the resale value may matter to your heirs

your investment is probably in a collective investment trust these are not mutual funds and are not publicly traded i.e. they are private to plan participants in your company because of this they are not required to distribute dividends like mutual funds instead they will reinvest dividends automatically increasing the value of the fund rather than number of shares as with dividend reinvestment you mention the s&p 500 fund you have tracks closely to the s&p index keep in mind there 's two indexes you could be looking at without any new contributions your fund should closely track the total return version for periods 3 months or longer minus the expense ratio if you are adding contributions to the fund you ca n't just look at the start and end balances the comparison is trickier and you 'll need to use the internal rate of return look into the xirr function in excel google sheets are not strictly required to pay dividends but are strongly tax incentivized to do so and essentially all do

companies with existing borrowings where borrowings are on variable interest rates or in the case with fixed interest rates companies that get new borrowings would pay less interest on these borrowings so their cost will go down and profits up making them more attractive to investors   so in general lower interest rates will make the share market a more attractive investment than some alternatives as investors are willing to take on more risk for potentially higher returns this will usually result in the stock market rising as it is currently in the us edit the case for rising interest rates a central bank 's purpose when raising interest rates is to slow down an economy that is booming as interest rates rise consumers will tighten up their spending and companies will thus have less revenue on top of higher costs for maintaining existing borrowing with variable rates or new borrowing with fixed rates if rates are higher companies may also defer new borrowings to expand their business this will eventually lead to lower profits and lower valuation for these companies another thing that happens is that as banks start increasing interest for saving accounts investors will look for safety where they can get a higher return than before without the risk of the stock market   with lowering profits and valuations and investor 's money flowing out of shares and into the money market so will company share prices drop although this may lag a bit with the share market still booming due to greed but once the boom stops for the crash

private investors as mutual funds are a minority of the market   institutional investors make up a substantial portion of the long term holdings   these include pension funds insurance companies and even corporations managing their money as well as individuals rich enough to actively manage their own investments    from business insider with some aggregation    numbers do n't add to 100 because of rounding   also i pulled insurance out of household because it 's not household managed   another source is the tax policy center which shows that about 50 of corporate stock is owned by individuals 25 and individually managed retirement accounts 25    another issue is that household can be a bit confusing   while some of these may be people choosing stocks and investing their money this also includes employee stock ownership plans esop and company founders   for example jeff bezos owns about 17 of amazon.com according to wikipedia   that would show up under household even though that is not an investment account   jeff bezos is not going to sell his company and buy equity in an index fund    anyway the most generous description puts individuals as controlling about half of all stocks   even if they switched all of that to index funds the other half of stocks are still owned by others   in particular about 26 is owned by institutional investors that actively manage their portfolios    in addition day traders buy and sell stocks on a daily basis not appearing in these numbers   both active institutional investors and day traders would hop on stocks either shorting the overvalued or buying the undervalued    it does n't take that much of the market to control prices so long as it is the active trading market   the passive market does n't make frequent trades   they usually only need to buy or sell as money is invested or withdrawn   so while they dominate the ownership stake numbers they are much lower on the trading volume numbers    tl;dr   there is more than enough active investment by organizations or individuals who would not switch to index funds to offset those that do   unless that changes this is not a big issue

ben already covered most of this in his answer but i want to emphasize the most important part of getting a loan with limited credit history go into a credit union or community bank and talk to the loan officer there in person ask for recommendations on how much they would lend based on your income to get the best interest rate that they can offer sometimes shortening the length of the loan will get you a lower rate sometimes it wo n't in any case make sure you can pay it off quickly no matter the term that you sign with   each bank may have different policies talk to at least two of them even if the first one offers you terms that you like talking to a loan officer is valuable life experience and if you discuss your goals directly with them then they will be able to give you feedback about whether they think a small loan is worth their time

opening is the price at which the first trade gets executed at the start of the trading day or trading period high is the highest price the stock is traded at during the day or trading period low is the lowest price the stock is traded at during the day or trading period closing is the price at which the last trade gets executed at the end of the trading day or trading period volume is the amount of shares that get traded during the trading day or trading period for example if you bought 1000 shares during the day and another 9 people also bought 1000 shares each then the trading volume for the day would be 10 x 1000 = 10,000

congratulations on keeping better track of your finances typically there will be a class of accounts labelled income under which you will have a separate account for each type of income stock dividends paychecks home appreciation etc in that case showing your income would be a transfer from the paycheck account to your checking account   note that as there are no offsetting transactions this means your income account will steadily accrue a balance over time just ignore this number it 's only the sum of all your paychecks   there are methods of dealing with that number and making the income account have a zero balance but you do n't need to worry about it at this stage   just learning to properly track expenses is the major accomplishment

compounding is just the notion that the current period 's growth or loss becomes the next period 's principal so applied to stocks your beginning value plus growth or loss in value plus any dividends becomes the beginning value for the next period your value is compounded as you measure the performance of the investment over time dividends do not participate in the compounding unless you reinvest them   compound interest is just the principle of compounding applied to an amount owed either by you or to you you have a balance with which a certain percentage is calculated each period and is added to the balance the new balance is used to calculate the next period 's interest which again adds to the balance etc obviously it 's better to be on the receiving end of a compound interest calculation than on the paying end interest bearing investments like bonds pay simple interest like stock dividends you would have to invest the interest in something else in order to get a compounding effect when using a basic calculator tool for stocks you would include the expected average annual growth rate plus the expected annual dividend rate as your interest rate for bonds you would use the coupon rate plus the expected rate of return on whatever you put the interest into as the interest rate factoring in risk you would just have to pick a different rate for a simple calculator or use a more complex tool that allows for more variables over time believe it or not this is where you would start seeing all that calculus homework pay off

from investopedia a stock split is usually done by companies that have seen their share    price increase to levels that are either too high or are beyond the    price levels of similar companies in their sector the primary motive    is to make shares seem more affordable to small investors even though    the underlying value of the company has not changed from wikipedia it is often claimed that stock splits in and of themselves lead to    higher stock prices research however does not bear this out what    is true is that stock splits are usually initiated after a large run    up in share price stock splits do increase the liquidity of a stock    there are more buyers and sellers for 10 shares at $ 10 than 1 share at    $ 100 some companies have the opposite strategy by refusing to split    the stock and keeping the price high they reduce trading volume    berkshire hathaway is a notable example of this something more to on why warren buffett is against stock splits

you want more information on what the general bond market this article is getting at something different but the first several pages are general background info on the corporate bond market     if you are trying to relate somehow the issue of federal debt a la treasuries to corporate debt you will find that you are jumping to a lot of conclusions    debt is not exactly currency only the promise of repayment at a certain date in the future the only reason that u.s. treasuries and those of certain other highly rated countries is interchangeable is because they are both very liquid and have very low risk    there is very little similarity to this in the corporate bond market companies are no where near to the risk level of a government for one they ca n't print their own money and when a corporation goes bankrupt it 's bondholder are usually recovery rates hover at around 50 of the notional debt amount this is why investors demand a premium to hold corporate debt now consider even the best of companies take ibm the spread between the interest the government must pay on a treasury bond and that which ibm must pay on a similar bond is still relatively large    but beyond that you run into a liquidity issue currency only works because it is highly liquid if you take the article about greece you posted above you can see the problem generated by lack of liquidity people have to both have currency and be willing to accept currency for trade to occur corporate bond are notoriously illiquid because people are unwilling to take on the risk involved with holding the debt there are other reasons but i 'm from them this is the other reason treasuries can be used as currency there is always someone willing to take your treasury in trade for the most part because there is almost zero risk involved you would always be much more willing to hold a treasury than an equivalent ibm bond    now take that idea down to a smaller level who would want to buy the bonds issued by the mom and pop down the street even if someone did buy them who would in turn take these bonds in trade practically speaking no one would they have no way to identify the riskiness of the bond and have no assurance that there would be anyone willing to trade for it in the future    if you read the whole post by the redditor from your first link this is precisely why government backed currency came about and why the scenario that i think you are is very unlikely

besides the reason in 's answer it is important to consider that paying off a 30-year mortgage as if it was a 15-year is much more inconvenient than just paying the regular payments of a 15-year mortgage   when you pay extra on your mortgage some lenders do not know what to do with the extra payment and need to be told explicitly that the extra needs to be applied toward the principal   you might need to do this every month with every payment   in addition some lenders wo n't allow you to set up an automatic payment for more than the mortgage payment so you might need to explicitly submit your payment with instructions for the lender each month and then follow up each month to make sure that your payment was credited properly   some lenders are better about this type of thing than others and you wo n't really know how much of a hassle it will be with your lender until you start making payments if you intend to pay it off in 15 years then just get the 15-year mortgage

i would apply extra cash left over at the end of the month as follows in order of priority realize though that this is my take on priority my experience has been that a liquidity crisis is much more stressful than having a mortgage or other debt illiquid wealth is almost useless when you need cash so if you still have strong feelings about retiring that debt after considering the liquidity issue go ahead and swap 3 and 4 above make plans to pay off the mortgage over the next 10 years find a mortgage payoff calculator and make extra monthly payments that keep you on a 10 year schedule i 'd strongly suggest making sure your retirement savings are on track though time is on your side here and your required monthly contribution will be low now while you 're still in your 20s

i want to know ideally how much should a person save for retirement    funds a person should save enough such that your total retirement resources will equal the amount you personally need for a comfortable retirement at the point in time when the person desires to retire if you want to retire at 40 you may need to save quite a lot each year if you want to retire at 70 you may need to save less each year if you will have a pension you may wish to save somewhat less than someone who wo n't have a pension the same is true for social security or your local equivalent i am getting a feeling retirement funds is equal to financial    independence because one can live without needing to borrow money from    anyone sort of but it depends on your goals some who are financially independent never choose to retire but choose jobs without regard to financial need

two more esoteric differences related to the same cause when you have an outstanding debit balance in a margin the broker may lend out your securities to short sellers   they may well be able to lend them out even if there 's no debit balance check your account agreement and relevant regulations    you 'll never know this there 's no indication in your account of it unless you ask and maybe not even then if the securities pay out dividends while lent out you do n't get the dividends directly   the dividends go to the person who bought them from the short seller   the short seller has to pay the dividend amount to his broker who pays them to your broker who pays them to you   if the dividends that were paid out by the security were qualified dividends 15 max rate the qualified goes to the person who bought the security from the short seller   what you received were n't dividends at all but a payment in lieu of dividends and qualified dividend treatment is n't available for them    some many   all brokers will pay you a gross up payment to compensate you for the extra tax you had to pay due to your qualified dividends on that security not actually being qualified a similar thing happens if there 's a shareholder vote   if the stock was lent out on the record date to establish voting eligibility the person eligible to vote is the person who bought them from the short seller not you   so if for some reason you really want need to vote in a shareholder vote call your broker and ask them to journal the shares in question over to the cash side of your account before the record date for determining voting eligibility

your question points out how most fractional reserve banks are only a couple of defaults away from insolvency the problem arises because of the terms around the depositors money   when a customer deposits money into a bank they are loaning their money to the bank and the bank takes ownership of the money   deposit and savings account are considered on demand accounts where the customer is told they can retrieve their money at any time   this is a strange type of loan is it not   no other loan works this way   there are always terms around loans how often the borrower will make payments when will the borrower pay back the loan what is the total time frame of the loan etc   the bank runs into problems because the time frame on the money they borrowed i.e. deposits does not match the time frame on the money they are lending

this would effectively be currency speculation betting that the pound will be stronger vs. the euro in november or whenever than it is today   this would be a profitable transaction if the exchange fees are less than the swing between the two in my very limited experience exchange fees are going to be at least a few percent and she 's going to have to do the exchange twice if she wants to turn current euros into pounds and back into euros later that 's at least a 6 hit    i 'd recommend against this   while it 's quite plausible for the two currencies to move more than 6 against each other in that time it 's also quite possible for them to move the other way causing her a large loss    the unfortunate thing about large heavily traded things like gbp eur is that you 're very unlikely to have some information that the big traders do n't   while lots of people think that the pound is going to become stronger just as many people think that the euro is going to be stronger   these two camps are constantly bidding against each other resulting in the 1.15 pounds euro exchange rate as of this writing   the current price and current direction that the line is moving in no way tells you what it 's going to do next

i 'm going to assume that you will spend the money to fix the mold problem correctly   using your numbers after that is done the home is worth perhaps $ 280k to evaluate whether or not to sell the amount you have spent on the house is irrelevant the only thing you need to ask yourself is this would i spend $ 280k to buy this house today you might if you were happy with the rental income that you were getting if the house is fully rented it earns you $ 24k year which is an 8.6 return if you had purchased the house today at $ 280k of course you will have vacancies taxes and other expenses bringing that return number down figure out what that is and see if you are happy with the return based on those numbers   if you decide it would be a bad investment for you at $ 280k then sell the house   by the way this question works for any investment not just real estate when deciding whether or not to sell stock the same thing applies it is irrelevant what your cost basis is you only need to ask yourself if the stock would be a good buy for you at the current price

to add to @keshlam 's answer slightly a stock 's price is made up of several components the only one of these that is known even remotely accurately at any time is the book value on the day that the accounts are prepared even   completed cashflows after the books have been prepared contain some slight unknowns as they may be reversed if stock is returned for example or reduced by unforeseen costs   future cashflows are based on amongst other things how many sales you expect to make in the future for all time exercise for the reader how many iphone will apple sell in even known future cashflows have some risk attached to them customers may not pay for goods a supplier may go into liquidation and so need to change its invoicing strategy etc estimating the risk on future cashflows is highly subjective and depends greatly on what the analyst expects the exact economic state of the world will be in the future investors have the choice of investing in a risk free instrument this is usually taken as being modelled by the 10 year us treasury bond that is guaranteed to give them a return to invest in anything riskier than the risk free instrument they must be paid a premium over the risk free return that they would get from that the risk premium is related to how likely they think it is that they will not receive a return higher than that rate calculation of that premium is highly subjective if i know the management of the company well i will be inclined to think that the investment is far less risky or perhaps riskier than someone who does not for example since none of the factors that go into a share price are accurately measurable and many are subjective there is no right share price at any time let alone at time of ipo each investor will estimate these values differently and so value the shares differently and their trading based on their ever changing estimates will move the share price to an level in comments to @keshlam 's answer you ask if there is enough information to work out the share price if a company buys out the company before ipo dividing the price that this other company paid by the relative ownership structure of the firm would give you an idea of what that company thought that the company was worth at that moment in time and can be used as a for market price but it will not and can not accurately represent the market price as other investors will value the firm differently by estimating the criteria above differently and so will move the share price based on their valuation

the reason a company creates more stock is to generate more capital so that this can be utilized and more returns can be generated it is commonly done as a follow on public offer typically the funds are used to retire high cost debts and fund future expansion what stops the company from doing it    are small investors cheated    it 's like you have joined a car pool with 4 people and you are that you own of the total seats so when most of them decide that we would be better of using minivan with 4 more persons you can not complain that you now only own 1/8 of the total seats even before you were having just one seat and even after you just have one seat overall it maybe better as the ride would be good

in principle the us taxes both income and gifts simply thinking good thoughts is not necessarily sufficient to avoid filing or payment obligations giving somebody money with no repayment date no interest and no enforceable note looks an awful lot like either income or a gift a loan normally has interest money sitting in a savings account is insured and other investments generally have an expected return   why would somebody give a loan with no interest with only flexible or informal payment expectations in a way where it has neither deposit insurance nor any expectation of net returns   that looks a lot like a gift at the very least a gift of the time value and the default risk the irs definitely polices loan rates the latest release is revenue ruling 2014 13 the is useful for tax concepts such as original issue discount when issuers sell low interest or no interest bonds or loans at less than face value attempting to recharacterize interest income as return of principal various grantor trusts e.g. and so forth   it 's a simple way for the irs to link to market rates of interest documentation and sufficient interest as well as clear payment schedule and maybe call or demand rights make it a bona fide loan   there is no real way for the irs to distinguish between an informal arrangement and a post hoc lie to conceal a gift   moreover an undocumented loan is generally difficult to enforce so it looks less like a true loan the lender declares the interest payments as income on his form 1040 line and if necessary schedule b.

i would make a change to the answer from if you buy a call that 's because you expect that the value of call options will go up so if you still think that options prices will go up then a sell off in the stock may be a good point to buy more calls for cheaper it would be your call at that point no pun intended here is some theory which may help an options trader in a bank would say that the value of a call option can go up for two reasons the vix index is a measure of the levels of implied volatility so you could intuitively say that when you trade options you are taking a view on two components the underlying stock and the level of the vix index importantly as you get closer to the expiry date this second effect diminishes big jumps up in the vix will produce smaller increases in the value of the call option taking this point to its limit at maturity the value of the call option is only dependent on the price of the underlying stock an options trader would say that the vega of a call option decreases as it gets closer to expiry a consequence of this is that if pure options traders are naturally less inclined to buy and hold to expiry because otherwise they would really just be taking a view on the stock price rather than the stock price the implied volatility surface trading options without thinking too much about implied is of course a valid strategy maybe you just use them because you will automatically have a mechanism which limits losses on your positions but i am just trying to give you an impression of the bigger picture

does it add to their lending reserves or is it utilized in other ways it depends on how the economy and the bank in particular are doing to simplify things greatly banks get deposits and lend or otherwise invest the majority of those deposits they must keep some percentage in reserve in case depositors want to make withdrawals and if they get a high percentage of withdrawals pushing them to be then they may sell their loans to other banks whether they lend the money to someone else or use the money for something else will depend completely on how many reserves they have from depositors and whether they have people lined up to take profitable loans from them i wrote this answer for the benefit of cqm i 'd vote to close this question if i had 49 more reputation points since it 's not really about personal finance

the real answer why the government is allowed to do something is because they are the government and they make the rules there are lots of laws that i think make no sense i ran into a similar situation to yours i bought a house during a time when the market in my area was way down the previous owner had paid $ 140,000 but i got it for only $ 80,000 the government appraised it for i forget the exact number but over $ 100,000 i appealed and the argument i made to the appeal board was that the law says it is supposed to be appraised for fair market value the definition of fair market value is the amount that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller absent special conditions like a sweetheart sale to a relative the house had been advertised for a higher price and the seller had to drop the price several times before getting an offer and finally accepting mine this is pretty much the definition of fair market value the appeals board replied that it was not fmv because the market was bad at this particular time and so i got a good deal i said that that 's the definition of market value it goes up and down as market conditions change if the market happened to be up when someone bought a house and they had to pay a high price would the government assess the house at a lower value because that was an unusually high price i doubt it they ended up reducing the assessed value but not to what i actually paid all that said arguably a foreclosure sale might be considered special conditions prices at a foreclosure sale tend to be lower than ordinary sales in a foreclosure the bank is usually trying to get rid of the property quickly because they do n't want to be in the property management business they want to be in the money lending and management business of course you could say that sort of thing about conditions surrounding many sales maybe the price is low because the seller needed cash now to start a business maybe the price is high because the buyer was too lazy to shop around maybe the price is low because the buyer is a very skilled negotiator etc etc   my watch just broke and while i was shopping for a new one i found two listings for the exact same watch i mean exact same manufacturer and model number identical picture on the same web site one giving the price as $ 24 and the other as $ 99 what is the market value of that watch i presume anyone who saw both listings would pick the $ 24 one but i presume some number of people pay the higher price because they never see the lower price in real life there is n't really one exact fair market value that 's an abstraction

first off i would label this as speculation not investing   there are many variables that you do n't seem to be considering and putting down such a small amount opens you to a wide variety of risks   not having an emergency fund for the rental increases that risk greatly   i assume that you would not have an emergency fund based upon the basic idea is to save up a 20 down payment on a property and take out a mortgage this type of speculation lent a hand in the housing bubble is your home paid off   if not you can reduce your personal risk by owning your home and have a pretty safe investment in real estate   mission accomplished my hope for you would be that you are also putting money in the market   historically it has performed quite well while always having its share of chicken

i interned for about six months at a firm that employed a few technical analysts so i 'll try to provide what little information i can since the bulk of the intra day trading was decided technical analysts had two main functions this basically boils down to my answer to your question there are still enough people trading firms etc who believe in candlestick charting and other visually subjective patterns that if you notice a trend pattern etc before the majority of traders observing you may be able to time the market successfully and profit this is becoming increasingly dangerous however because of the steps i outlined above over time the charting patterns that have been proven effective often in many firms individually since the algorithms are all proprietary are incorporated into computer algorithms so the traders you 're competing with to see the pattern are increasingly low latency computer less than a few blocks from the exchange summary candlestick charting along with other forms of subjective technical analysis has its believers and assuming enough of these believers trade the standard strategies based on the standard patterns one could conceivably time the market with enough skill to anticipate these traders acting on the pattern and therefore profit however the marginal benefits of doing so are decreasing rapidly as computers take over more trading responsibility   caveats   i know you 're in australia where the market penetration of hf algo traders is n't as high as in the us so it might be a few more years before the marginal benefits cease to be profitable that being said if various forms of technical analysis proved wildly profitable in australia above and beyond profits available in other markets rest assured that large american or british trading firms would already have moved in   my experience is limited to one trading firm so i certainly ca n't speak for the industry as a whole i know i did n't address candlestick charts specifically but since they 're only one piece of visual technical analysis i tried to address the issue as a whole   this somewhat ties into the debate between fundamental or technical analysis which i wo n't get into investopedia has a short article on the subject as i said i wo n't get into this because while it 's a nice debate for small traders at large trading firms they do n't care they want to make profit and any strategy that can be vetted whether it 's fundamental technical or will be vetted   i want to add more information to my answer to clear up some of the misconceptions in the comments including those talking about biased studies and a lack of evidence for or against technical analysis and candlestick charts i 'll explore this relationship further down   it 's important to keep in mind that charting methods including candlestick charts are visually subjective ways of representing data and that any interpretations drawn from such charts should ideally represent objective technical indicators a charting method is only as good as the indicators it 's used to represent therefore an analysis of the underlying indicators provides a suitable analysis for the visual medium in which they 're presented   one important study that evaluates several of these indicators is foundations of technical analysis computational algorithms statistical inference and empirical implementation by lo and lest anyone accuse its authors of bias i should point out that not only is it published by the national bureau of economic research a highly reputable organization within economics and finance but also that the majority of its authors come from mit 's sloan school which holds a reputation second to none this study finds that several technical indicators e.g. head and shoulder double bottom and various rectangle techniques do provide marginal value they also find that although   human judgment is still superior to most computational algorithms in the area of visual pattern recognition technical analysis can be improved by using automated algorithms since this paper was published in 2000 computing power and statistical analysis have gained significant ground against human ability to identify and exploit for visual pattern detection like candlestick charts   second i suggest you look into david 's book evidence based technical analysis applying the scientific method and statistical inference to trading signals he finds similar results to the lo et al paper in that some technical indicators do add value to the investment process but those that do are those that can be represented mathematically and thus programmed directly into trading algorithms thus bypassing visual tools like candlestick charts   he describes how studies including lo et al have found that head and shoulders patterns are worse than random i.e. you would earn higher returns if you simply traded at random that point is worth than repeating if a day trader is using a candlestick chart and using head and shoulders patterns as part of their he 's rolling the dice when he uses that pattern and returns that come from its application come from chance this reminds me of that old story about a company that sends out predicting the results of sports games complete with strategies and data to back up the predictions the company sends out several versions of the every game each predicting a different winner given a large enough sample size by the end of the season there are a few people who have received a that accurately predicted the winner for every game and they 're convinced the system is perfect the others were n't so lucky however relying on candlestick charts and ta patterns that are from the pre computerized era is reassuring to some traders and gives them a sense of control and beating the market but how long will chance remain on your side this is why i maintain that visual tools like candlestick charts are a slowly dying medium they certainly still add value to some trading firms which is why bloomberg terminals still ship with this functionality built in but as more and more research shows automated algorithms and statistical indicators can provide more value it 's also important to think about whether the majority of the value added by visual tools like candlestick charts comes in the form of profit or a sense of security to traders who learned the field using them over the past few decades   finally it 's extremely important to realize that the actions of retail investors in the equities market can not begin to represent the behaviors of the market as a whole in the equities markets alone trading firms and institutional investors dwarf retail investors and the difference in scale is even more vastly pronounced in derivatives and currency markets the fact that some retail investors use candlestick charts and the technical indicators they hope them provides nothing but minor anecdotal evidence as to their effectiveness

are you interested in your rented home here in singapore if you are struggling with financial difficulties you can apply for a renovation loan offered by banks most banks in singapore offer renovation loans and home loans only to those who own a property it is very hard to find a renovation loan for a rented home   home loans for renovation   you can take a home loan for your rented property and top up your home loan to finance your renovation project if you already have a home loan all you need to do is ask your bank representative to add extra financing to your home home for renovation purpose applying for a home loan for a rented property is simple you can use an online loan calculator and compare home loans provided for a rented property according to your repayment capacity and financial requirements you can choose a home loan and use it for renovation make sure you have a good credit score while applying so that your home loan gets approved easily   personal loans for renovation   if you are not able to find too many home loans or renovation loans for rented property you need not worry have you considered taking a personal loan to make awesome home improvement measures that ’s right you can apply for a personal loan and use the funds to renovate your the best thing about a personal loan is that a lender does not enquire about the purpose for your loan application so you can use your personal loan for any of your needs   eligibility criteria for personal loans   the general criteria to be qualified for a personal loan in singapore are the applicant should be 21 to 65 years old the applicant should be a or a permanent resident or a foreigner the minimum income requirement for a or pr is generally p.a and p.a for a foreigner   when are personal loans ideal for renovation   there are a few situations when a personal loan is the best option for renovating your rented property many banks give personal loans with attractive promotions such as interest free loan for a certain period you can take this loan and even repay the full amount before the zero interest period expires this will help you save efficiently on your renovation project the minimum income required to secure a home loan is generally higher than the income requirement for a personal loan hence a personal loan is a better option a home loan generally gives a higher sum of money than a personal loan this high amount is suitable for a construction project but will be excessive for renovation work therefore it makes more sense to apply for a personal loan to give the perfect makeover to the in your home the approval process for a home loan is typically very lengthy personal loan applications get approved within 24 hours by most banks in singapore so now you can apply for a personal loan without any tension and remodel your to have a party at home sweet home personal loan rates are generally lower than home loan rates you can refurbish your living space by paying your loan at an interest rate not more than 4 now you would have got a fair idea about how to finance your work always remember to enquire about every loan ’s terms and conditions never sign any loan contract without being absolutely clear about the loan ’s features

i ca n't give you proper legal advice but if i called their customer service and used half an hour of my time to wait and explain the situation in detail and their official response was just use the points i would do just that of course you would have stronger legal standing if you had recorded their answer or had it in writing from them but i do n't think spending these points will come crashing down on you and morally i see absolutely no problem with spending these points it is not as if you are stealing from someone else these points can usually be given away in any kind of crazy manner sometimes there are lotteries or events where they give away 100,000 points for new customers who open up an account on a specific weekend sometimes they give points to customers who want to terminate their contracts as an attempt to them into staying they have given you a lot of points and do n't really care as a result you are probably staying their customer forever and will most likely tell this story to many friends this is free advertising for them heck maybe they would even make a news story out of this some day it could be good publicity everyone is essentially getting these points for free but in fact the company has a business case by improving their image and customer retention with these points so you can spend these points with a sound mind morally legally you would have to contact a lawyer but i think chances for legal repercussions are small if you have done your duty informed them and their customer service basically said it 's ok

insurance companies on average make money by selling insurance which    means you lose money on average by dealing with them the insurance is not gambling where the house always wins this expression is literal in gambling because that 's how they set the odds insurance is n't necessarily similar example suppose there 's 10 chance that $ 10,000 the boat sinks due to a defect so on average your loss is going to be $ 1,000 the variability of your loss measured as its standard deviation is $ the variability of loss is a measure of risk now let 's look at two $ 10,000 boats there 's 1 chance that they both sink and 18 chance that only one of them sinks so the expected loss is unsurprisingly $ 2,000 however the variability of expected loss is $ not quite twice the risk variability of a single boat accident if you imagine that instead of a couple of boats the insurance has 100 boats the variability of their loss hence their risk will increase only by a factor of 10 not 100 compared to a single boat this means that their risk in relative terms is smaller than yours the individual insurer 's   what i tried to show was that it is possible to both of you and the insurer to benefit from the arrangement it does n't mean that it happens in every case but generally it does that 's why in actuarial science there 's a term fair price update i was trying to avoid talking about utility here because it 's an involved subject but you 're dragging the discussion in this direction you 're right that expected value can not explain the insurance the reason is that there 's another concept that 's necessary in addition to the objective measures such as expected value and risk i mean the utility function or risk aversion so in short you need to maximize expected utility not the expected payout here 's a toy example with the same boat assume that insurance is $ 150 and they pay the entire boat 's value in case of accident i.e. $ 10,000 you 're given two choices effectively at the end of the year you have either of the following you 're right that the expected value in the second option can be higher in the second option let 's say the probability of the loss is 10 in this case the expected value would $ 9,900 which is higher than certain value of option 1 why then some people choose option 2 the reason is that we do n't maximize the expected payout but we maximize the utility according to modern microeconomics and game theory   utility is some kind of an function that reflects your preference given the uncertain choices every person has their own preferences and utility function   let 's say that yours is exponential with in this case we can calculate the expected utility as follows the math works out in such a way that it accounts for your risk tolerance depending on how much you love or hate risk your expected utilities for these option will come out differently for this given toy example it turned out that the expected utility is higher with insurance so this person should get it however for different values of a parameter a in the function it may not make a sense to insure some people are risk averse some are risk lovers in certain situations that 's the reason why given the same options we make different choices you may say that you do n't value certainty enough to buy this insurance the bottom line is that nobody can tell you that you 're wrong to not buy an insurance if your risk tolerance is high it may not make a sense for you having said this all i must note that sometimes the society does n't accept your preferences and utility function yes you tell me today that you accept the risk but tomorrow when the boat sinks you may come to me and say that you ca n't pay the student loan because of the hardship that 's the reason why it 's mandatory to get liability insurance on cars for instance

the lot size is 100 troy ounce see the contract specification at the same site so with the current price of around $ one lot would cost you around there may be other sites that offer smaller lots you would need to check with your broker if the price moves up by $ 500 you gain $ 50,000 for a lot the margin required changes from time to time   currently it 's $ with a maintenance of $ so a drop of $ per oz of gold will cause a margin call you make or lose 100 times the per oz movement as there are 100 oz in the contract you cited there 's also a broker fee analogous to the commission on a stock trade   the other option would be to buy a fund that invests in gold this will be more easier to buy and the lot sizes will be much less i hope you jumped into this great opportunity at the time experts said gold would have a straight run to $ 5000

generally it is not recommended that you do anything potentially short term to your credit during the process of seeking a mortgage loan such as opening a new account closing old accounts running up balances or otherwise applying for any kind of loan people often get carried away and apply for loans to cover furniture and appliances for the new home they have n't bought yet you are usually ok to do things that have at least a short term positive effect like paying down debt but refinancing which would require applying for a non home loan is exactly the sort of hard pull that can drop your credit rating it is not generally advised the exception to this is would be if you have an especially unusual situation with an existing loan like your car that is causing a deal breaking situation with your home loan this would for example be having a car payment so high that it violates maximum debt to income ratios dti if your monthly debt payments are more than 43 of your monthly income for instance you will generally be unable to obtain a qualified mortgage and over 28 36 will disqualify you from some lenders and low cost mortgage options the reason this is unusual is that you would have to have a terrible existing loan which could somehow be refinanced without increasing your debt while simultaneously providing a monthly savings so dramatic that it would shift your dti from unacceptable to acceptable it 's possible but most simple consumer loan just do n't give that kind of savings in most cases you should just sit tight and avoid any new loans or refinances while you seek a home purchase if you want to be sure you 'll need to figure out your dti ratio which i recommend anyway and see where you would be before and after a car refinance if this would produce a big swing maybe talk with some mortgage loan professionals who are familiar with lending criteria and ask for their opinion as to whether the change would be worth it 9 times out of 10 you should wait until after your loan is closed and the home is yours before you try to refinance your car however i would only warn you that if you think your house + car payment is too much for you to comfortably afford i 'd strongly recommend you seriously reconsider your budget current car ownership and house purchasing plans you might find that after the house purchase the car refi is n't available either or fine print means it would n't provide the savings you thought it would do n't buy now hoping an uncertain cost saving measure will work out later

you wo n't get reported to a credit bureau for an overdraft that 's a service offered internal to the bank   the only way it would affect your credit score is if you had an overdraft fee that you did n't pay which would get reported there 's is a system that gets a notice when you overdraft though   the bank might report you to chexsystems which is an agency that tracks the mishandling of accounts   generally a fee based overdraft is an agreement with you and the bank that they will charge you a fee this is desirable to the bank so they do n't report to chexsystems unless there 's some sort of abuse   banks view overdraft like a product for revenue generation and they encourage you to continue   examples of abuse are intentional overdrawing where the bank updates the account balances by batch jobs so that you can overdraft on an account that only has $ in it   banks check chexsystems to see if you have accounts to determine if you can open up another account though they 're mostly checking to see if you are leaving accounts in bad or negative status

if you take the statement you quote as stated it is indeed absurd unless you have a really creative tax accountant or live in a country with very unusual tax laws any tax deduction you get for mortgage interest is going to be less than the interest you do n't come out ahead by getting a $ 25 deduction if you had a $ 100 expense to get that deduction where there can be some sense behind such a statement is if you consider the alternative to paying cash for a house or making extra payments against a mortgage if you had $ 100,000 in cash in a box under your bed and the choice is between a use that $ 100,000 to buy a house in cash or b borrow $ 100,000 at 6 interest and leave that cash in the box under the bed than clearly a is the better choice because it saves you the interest expense but if the choice is between a buy a house for $ 100,000 in cash and borrow $ 100,000 at 6 to buy a car or b borrow $ 100,000 at 6 interest to buy a house and use the $ 100,000 cash to buy the car b is the better choice the home mortgage loan is tax deductible the car loan is not as others have pointed out if instead of using some extra cash to pay down the principle on your mortgage you used that money to invest in the stock market it is likely that you would get better returns on the investment than what you would have saved in interest on the mortgage depending of course on how the market is doing and how well you pick stocks but the key issue there is n't the tax deduction it 's the comparison of the profits from the investment versus the opportunity cost of the money that could have been saved on the mortgage interest the tax deduction affects that comparison by effectively reducing the interest rate on the mortgage your real interest expense is the nominal interest minus the deduction but that 's not the key point just another number to plug in to the formula by the way given the complexity of u.s. tax law i would not rule out the possibility that there could be some scenario where you really would save money by having mortgage interest there are lots of deductions and credits that are phased out or eliminated as your income goes up perhaps you could find some set of tax laws that apply to you such that having an additional $ 1000 in interest expense lets you take a $ 300 deduction here and a $ 500 credit there etc and they add up to more than $ 1000 i do n't know if that could actually happen but the rules are complicated enough that maybe any tax accountants here who can come up with such a scenario

sounds like an illiquid option if there are actually some bidders market makers then sell the option at market price market sell order if there are not market makers then place a really low limit sell order so that you can sit at the ask in the order book a lot of time there is off book liquidity so there may be a party looking for buy liquidity you can also exercise the option to book the loss immediately selling the shares when they get delivered to you if this is an american style option but if the option is worthless then it is probably significantly underwater and you 'd end up losing a lot more as you 'd buy the stock at the strike price but only be able to sell at its current market value the loss could also be increased further if there are even more liquidity issues in the stock

it 's definitely not a good idea to pay off one of the smaller loans in your case a $ 4k payment split across all the loans would be better than repaying the 5 $ 4k loan completely as it 's the most beneficial of your loans and thus is last priority for repayment a payment that splits across all the loans equally is in effect a partial repayment on a loan with an interest rate of weighed average rate of all your loans   it 's not as good as repaying a 7 loan but almost as good it might be an option to save up until you can repay one of your 7 loans but it depends if it takes a lot of time then you would've paid interest during that time

when margin is calculated as the equity percentage of an account the point at which a broker will forcibly liquidate is typically called maintenance margin in the us this is 25 for equities to calculate the price at which this will occur the initial and maintenance margin must be known   the formula for a long with margin is and for a short where is the maintenance margin price is the initial margin price is the initial margin rate and is the maintenance margin rate   at an initial margin of 50 and a maintenance margin of 25 a long equity may fall by 1/3 before forced liquidation a short one may rise by 50 this calculation can become very complex with different asset classes with differing maintenance margins because the margin debt is applied to all securities collectively

but speculation is absolutely intended to happen and is considered necessary for healthy a investment environment   what i am saying however is that this desire to rid the world of hft appears to be moral rather than logical there is very little reason to eliminate hft as it stands although there appears to be a propensity for very emotional responses to the basic concept ones i can appreciate however i am suggesting they are misguided as the people who should be upset with hft are the hedge fund managers and day traders they are not you or me who buy and sell shares on a whim every so often if you want to ban day traders that is a separate argument i do n't want to go into   the idea that these computer algorithms are all set to sell sell sell is provably nonsensical if that were the case all of the hft participants would have gone massively bankrupt during the flash crashes also it is quite patently the case that somebody has to be buying in order for anybody to sell saying this is what caused some of the crashes is just your desire for a simple explanation it must have been more complex than this and to my knowledge none of these crashes have been adequately explained although some poorly designed algorithms have been note that in one of these cases iirc a fund closed its doors due to the losses and the market was largely unaffected so it seems like a problem that self corrects in this case and one that only harms the participant that   also to correct a basic misunderstanding selling happens all of the time and does not inherently drive the price down there are by definition an equal number of sales to what drives the price down is the people buying being willing to pay   edit as another aside a point i have made elsewhere and seems suitable to make here flash crashes whilst causing panic are again something only the professional intra day trading community are likely to be affected by their very name implies so the reason being that anybody investing based on the long term investment potential of a company will only benefit in the temporary drop in price as they can purchase more of the company at a bargain price any intelligent investor will not be by the drop in price as price has no bearing on a company 's real value and stocks do tend towards this value over time whatever happens over the short term the only case in which it could is if the company owns a large portfolio of stock that itself devalues dramatically that they intended to sell and as a result experience cash flow problems this is so incredibly unlikely with a flash crash as to be ignored

there is not necessarily a need to prevent what you describe turning insurance on before high risk situations they just need to calculate the premiums accordingly for example if an insurance needs to take for insuring your house against flood and a flood happens in average every 10 years if you just insure the two weeks in the ten years where heavy rain is predicted you might pay 500 $ for the two weeks the total is the same for the insurance they get 500 $ and you get insurance for the dangerous period in the contrary if a flooding unexpectedly happens outside your two weeks they are out from the home owners view 500 $ for two weeks when heavy rains and floods are expected and nothing otherwise sounds pretty good compared to 50 $ every year it is the same of course but psychology works that way

what good does that do a city though more so than housing any large company   i 'd be mildly surprised if hq2 surpassed what amazon has in seattle now that 's a very long buildup and there 's a lot of established business structure here and i do n't get the impression that it 's going to slow down my hunch is that they 've simply given up on trying to keep up with the pace of growth with only one major campus this gives them a lot more options   i want to see how they plan to foster the growth of hq2 there are a couple of easy ways to get me to consider moving but at the same time there are serious advantages to staying in seattle all of the interesting projects and teams are here and all of it 's within walking distance it would be a pity to lose that

one thing i would add to 's answer one of the benefits of using an llc for your business is right there in the name limited liability it provides a level of protection for your personal assets should your business go bankrupt get sued and so forth however if someone can show that there 's no real separation between your llc 's activities and your personal activities then they can pierce the corporate veil and go after your personal assets if this loan is really purely personal and not related to your business activities you may create a paper trail that can later be used in this way my advice would be to just avoid the whole thing and make the loan from personal funds i do n't see any upside to doing this out of the llc funds

if i appear to be attacking you i apologize up front because that 's not my intent     windows phone has a market share of 2.5 and it 's falling   their market share is more closely compared with blackberry than with android or ios   in addition they are really only releasing low end phones and there are no known high end phones scheduled   office may be better but blackberry was leading edge and 10 years later they 're pretty much gone   as a developer who has worked with office products since office 4.3 back in the 90 's there are just too many components that are clearly 10 15 years old that have not been updated   from data importing to vba there is just too much in there that they 're just milking for as long as they can   i would add that when they introduced the office subscription service in 2012 they told users that it was better to buy the subscription instead of buying the software outright because they would be constantly providing functional improvements like google docs   that simply has n't happened as there has been nothing but bug fixes for two years   azure may have a nice console it 's from 2011 but i 'm here to tell you that working with azure can be downright painful compared to aws   whether it 's the firewall between two servers sql azure data in beta for 1.5 years and counting seriously ms what the f are you doing with that anyway to paid support if you think comcast ignores you you ai nt seen nothing yet they clearly are working in silos and not listening to their customers   as for windows 8 by their own admission it 's been a disaster and has really harmed their brand   8.1 has brought back some much needed functionality but they need to make windows 9 a winner release it immediately and get everyone on it asap

i do n't think anyone can give you a definitive answer without knowing all about your situation but some things to consider if you are on a 1099 you have to pay self employment tax while on a w-2 you do not that is social security tax is 12.4 of your income if you 're a 1099 you pay the full 12.4 if you 're w-2 you pay 6.2 and the employer pays 6.2 so if they offer you the same nominal rate of pay you 're 6.2 better off with the w-2 what sort of insurance could you get privately and what would it cost you i have no idea what the going rates for insurance are in california if you 're all in generally good health you might want to consider a high deductible policy then if no one gets seriously sick you 've saved a bunch of money on premiums if someone does get sick you might still pay less paying the deductible than you would have paid on higher premiums i wo n't go into further details as that 's getting off into another question even if the benefits are poor if there are any benefits at all it can be better than nothing the only advantage i see to going with a 1099 is that if you are legally an independent contractor then all your business expenses are deductible while if you are an employee there are sharp limits on deducting employee business expenses maybe others can think of other advantages if there is some reason to go the 1099 route i understand that setting up an llc is not that hard i 've never done it but i briefly looked into it once and it appeared to basically be a matter of filling out a form and paying a modest fee

played the balance transfer game once recently just as a reference got a balance transfer offer for a sock drawer no af card 2 up front fee 0 apr grace period was by the time i acted on it about 16 months used it to pay down an auto loan with an apr slightly higher than 2 and brought my equity back to positive towards the end when i rolled over the auto loan thanks to the positive equity i was offered a rate discount on the new loan essentially this was a piggyback loan on the original auto loan funded by credit card via balance transfer saved some interest charges without having to refinance

the policy you quoted suggests you deposit 6 minimum that $ 6,000 will cost you $ 4,500 due to the tax effect yet after the match you 'll have $ 9,000 in the account taxable on withdrawal but a great boost to the account   the question of where is less clear there must be more than the 2 choices you mention most plans have too many choices this into my focus on expenses a few years back pbs frontline aired a program titled the retirement gamble in which fund expenses were discussed with a focus on how an extra 1 in expenses will wipe out an extra 1/3 of your wealth in a 40 year period very simple to illustrate this go to a calculator and enter .99 raised to the power of 40 is the result my 401(k has an expense of .02 that 's of 1 raised to the same 40 gives in other words a cost of .8 over the full 40 years my wife and i are just retired and will have less in expenses for the rest of our lives than the average account cost for just 1 year   in your situation the knee jerk reaction is to tell you to maximize the 401(k deposit at the current 2016 $ 18,000 that might be appropriate but i 'd suggest you look at the expense of the s&p index sometime called large cap fund but see the prospectus and if it 's costing much more than i 'd go with an ira roth if you ca n't deduct the traditional ira much of the value of the 401(k beyond the match is the tax differential i.e. depositing while in the 25 bracket but withdrawing the funds at retirement hopefully at 15 it does n't take long for the extra expense and the holy cow my 401(k just turned decades of dividends and long term cap gains into ordinary income effect to take over understand this now not 30 years hence   last to answer your question how much i often recommend what may seem a cliche continue to live like a student half the country lives on $ 54 k or less there 's certainly a wide gray area but in general a person starting out will choose one of 2 paths living just at or even above his means or living way below and saving say 30 40 off the top even 30 does n't hit the extreme saver level if you do this you 'll find that if when you get married buy a house have kids etc you 'll still be able to save a reasonable percent of your income toward retirement   in response to your comment what counts as retirement savings there 's a concept used as part of the budgeting process known as the envelope system for those who have an income where there 's little discretionary money left over each month the method of putting money aside into small buckets is a great idea in your case say you take me up on the 30 40 challenge 15 of it goes to a hard and fast retirement account the rest to savings according to the general order of emergency fund 6 12 months expenses to cover a job loss another fund for random expenses such as new transmission i 've never needed one but i hear they are expensive and then the bucket towards house down payment keep in mind i have no idea where you live or what a reasonable house would cost regardless a 20 25 downpayment on even a $ 250 k house is $ that will take some time to save up if the housing in your area is more bump it accordingly   if the savings starts to grow beyond any short term needs it gets invested towards the long term and is treated as retirement money there is no such thing as saving too much when i turned 50 and was let go from a 30 year job i was n't unhappy that i saved too much and could call it quits that day had i been saving just right i 'd have been 10 years shy of my target

this article has a section titled do you need an umbrella policy to cover your personal liability risks that says if you have young children for example you might need a policy    because they have lots of friends these little might get into    some and hurt themselves at your home if so you ’re at risk    of being sued do you have people over often do you drive like a or a    do you have firearms on your premises do you have gardeners    and on the grounds all these are reasons why you might    want to own an umbrella policy although many people in the us are homeowners parents drivers etc not everyone falls into these categories for some people as low as the premiums for such a policy might be   the expected cost outweighs the expected benefit the cost of a lawsuit may be extremely high but someone may feel that the chance of a lawsuit being filed against them is low enough to be safely ignored and not worth insuring against i 'm probably not a great example but i 'll use my own situation anyway even though a liability policy probably would n't cost me too much i 'm almost certain that i would n't derive any benefit from it i live alone without children or firearms pet tigers gardeners etc in a 520 sq ft apartment so the probability that something bad would happen to someone on the small bit of property that i rent and that they would file a sizable lawsuit against me is small enough that i choose to ignore it

you might find some of the answers here helpful the question is different but has some similar concerns such as a changing economic environment what approach should i take to best protect my wealth against currency    devaluation poor growth prospects i want to avoid selling off any    more of my local index funds in a panic as i want to hold long term    does my portfolio balance make sense good question i ca n't even get us banks to answer questions like this such as what happens if they try to nationalize all bank accounts like in the soviet union   response it 'll never happen the question was what if i think that your portfolio carries a lot of risk but also offsets what you 're worried about   outside of government confiscation of foreign accounts if your foreign investments are held through a local brokerage you should be good   what to do about government confiscation   even the us government in 1933 confiscated physical gold and they made it illegal to own so even physical resources can be confiscated during hard times quite a large portion of my foreign investments have been bought at an    expensive time when our currency is already around historic lows    which does concern me in the event that it strengthens in future what    strategy should i take in the future if when my local currency starts    the strengthen do i hold my foreign investments through it and just    trust in cost averaging long term or try sell them off to avoid the    devaluation are these foreign investments a hedge   if so then you should n't worry if your currency does strengthen they serve the purpose of hedging the local environment   if these investments are not a hedge then timing will matter and you 'll want to sell and buy your currency before it does strengthen   the risk on this latter point is that your timing will be wrong

you need to stop what you are doing right now and cut off contact with them this is an extremely common scam here 's how it works they give you a check maybe even a certified check usually in payment for something they are buying from you the check happens to be for more than the sales price they ask you to refund the difference and pressure you to do so quickly you will see why in a second the check deposits fine and the money shows up in your account assuming the bank would n't do that if it was n't a good check you let your guard down and pay them in a couple of weeks the bank that it is a fake check they remove the money from your account and may even report you for prosecution to local authorities for passing a fraudulent check   meanwhile the person has the money you gave them and you ca n't find them because they gave you a fake name to add insult to injury they may also have the property you sold them   you feel like a chump variants of this scam include them asking you to cash a check for them and you get to keep a part of the proceeds for your trouble sometimes it is presented as a work at home scheme   if you feel you absolutely must complete this deal and you should n't i would suggest you ask the person for a couple of forms of picture id and tell them you need to make sure they are n't a scammer and you are going to do a background check on them with your local police to protect yourself i predict the person will disappear and never contact you again about the money   also i suggest you talk to your bank immediately and inform them you think you might have been a victim of a scamming attempt so that you do n't look like an when this is all said and done

there 's not usually a point to issuing new stock as a dividend because if you issue new stock it dilutes the existing shareholders by the exact same amount as the dividend so now they have a few more shares great but they 're worth the exact same amount this assumes that all stockholders are equal if there are multiple share classes or people whose rights to a stock are tied to the stock price in some manner options warrants or something then a properly structured stock dividend could serve to enrich one set of shareholders and other rights holders at the expense of another but this is usually illegal if this sort of dividends are popular in china i suspect it is due to some regulatory or tax related circumstances which are not present in the united states markets china is kind of notorious for having unusual capital controls limitations on the exchange of currency and markets which are not very transparent

you have a few correlated questions here   yes you can there are only a few investment strategies that require a minimum contribution and those are n't ones that would get a blanket recommendation anyway investing in bonds or stocks is perfectly possible with limited funds you 're never too young to start the power of interest means that the more time you give your money to grow the larger your eventual gains will be provided your investment is beating inflation if your financial situation allows it it makes sense to invest money you do n't need immediately which brings us to this is the one you have to look at most you 're young but have a nice chunk of cash in a savings account that money wo n't grow much and you could be losing purchasing power to inflation but on the other hand that money also is n't at risk while there are dozens of investment the two main ones to look at are bonds these are fixed income which means they 're fairly safe but the downside is that you need to lock up your money for a long time to get a better interest rate than a savings account index funds that track the market these are basically another form of stock where each share represents fractions of shares of other companies that are tracked on an index such as the s&p 500 or nasdaq these are much riskier and more volatile which is why you should look at this as a long term investment as well because given enough time these are expected to trend upwards look into index funds further to understand why but this is n't so much about what you should invest in but more about the fact that an investment almost by definition means putting money away for a long period of time so the real question remains how much can you afford to put away for that you need to look at your individual situation and your plans for the future do you need that money to pay for expenses in the coming years do you want to save it up for college do you want to invest and leave it untouched to inspire you to keep saving do you want to save for retirement i 'm not sure if you can start saving via iras and the like at your age but it 's worth looking into or do you want to spend it on a dream holiday or a car there are arguments to be made for every one of those   most people will tell you to keep such a low sum in a savings account as an emergency fund but that also depends on whether you have a safety net i.e. parents and how reliable they are most people will also tell you that your long term money should be in the stock market in the form of a balanced portfolio of index funds but i wo n't tell you what to do since you need to look at your own options and decide for yourself what makes sense for you you 're off to a great start if you 're thinking about this at your age and i 'd encourage you to take that interest further and look into educating yourself on the investments options and funds that are available to you and decide on a financial plan involving your parents in that is sensible not in the least because your post high school plans will be the most important variable in said plan to my first point and answer your main question if you 've decided that you want to invest and you 've established a specific budget the size of that investment budget should not factor into what you invest it in 1 for the record penny stocks are not an investment they 're an expensive form of gambling

this was actually sort of possible a few years ago the us mint trying to encourage use of dollar coins would sell the coins to customers for face value and no shipping many people did exactly what you are proposing bought hundreds thousands of dollars worth of coins with credit cards the rewards deposited the coins in the bank and paid off the credit cards see here for example yeah they do n't have that program any more   of course this sort of behavior was completely predictable and painfully obvious to the credit card companies who as far as i know never let users net rewards on cash advances they 're trying to make money after all unlike the mint which uh well

ok   that 's not a risk of making an investment that 's the risk of an investment failing   my point is the workers are actually the ones taking the biggest risk their lives health family and homes depend on the companies employing them and if those companies fail they need a financial cushion to get them into the next job just like investors need some investments to make a profit to cushion the ones that do n't but as it stands now the investors are getting every pillow in the land and the workers are left to hit solid rock as they fall they are n't getting a comparable share of the profits they are making not nearly enough to provide any sort of savings scheme anyway when the companies and investors are rolling in profits and that 's not the way to a healthy society

diversified is relative alfred has all his money in apple   he 's done very well over the last 10 years but i think most investors would say that he 's taking an incredible risk by putting everything on one stock has stock in apple microsoft and google   compared to alfred she is diversified charlie looks at and realizes that she is only investing in one particular industry   all the companies in an individual industry can have a downturn together so he invests everything in an s&p 500 index fund david looks at charlie and notes that he 's got everything in large high capitalization companies   small cap stocks are often where the growth happens so he invests in a total stock market fund realizes that david has all his money tied up in one country the united states   what about the rest of the world   she invests in a global fund frank really likes 's broad approach to equities but he knows that some portion of fixed income assets e.g. cash deposits bonds can reduce portfolio volatility and may even enhance returns through periodic rebalancing he does what does but also allocates some percentage of his portfolio to fixed income and intends to maintain his target allocations being diversified enough depends on your individual goals and investing philosophy   there are some who would say that it is wrong to put all of your money in one fund no matter what it is   others would say that a sufficiently broad index fund is inherently diversified as is

there are a few questions i think you must consider when considering this problem do fundamental or technical strategies provide meaningful information are the signals they produce actionable in my experience and many quantitative traders will probably say similar things technical analysis is unlikely to provide anything meaningful of course you may find phenomena when looking back on data and a particular indicator but this is often after the fact one can not action trade these observations on the other hand it does seem that fundamentals can play a crucial role in the overall typically long run dynamics of stock movement here are two examples technical suppose we follow stock x and buy every time the price crosses above the 30 day moving average there is one obvious issue with this strategy why does this signal have significance if the method is designed arbitrarily then the answer is that it does not have significance moreover much of the research supports that stocks move close to a geometric brownian motion with jumps this supports the implication that the system is meaningless if the probability of up or down is always close to 50/50 then why would an average based on the price be predictive fundamental suppose we buy stocks with the best p e ratios defined by some cutoff this makes sense from a logical perspective and may have some long run merit however there is always a chance that an internal or some macro event creates a large loss   a blended approach for sake of balance perhaps we consider fundamentals as a good long term indication of growth what quants might call drift we then restrict ourselves to equities in a particular index say the s&p500 we compare the growth of these stocks vs. their p e ratios and possibly do some regression a natural strategy would be to sell those which have exceeded the expected return given the p e ratio and buy those which have underperformed since all equities we are considering are in the same index they are most likely somewhat correlated especially when traded in baskets if we sell 10 equities that are deemed too high and buy 10 which are too low we will be taking a neutral position and betting on convergence of the spread to the market average growth we have this constructed a hedged position using a fundamental metric and some helpful statistics this method can be categorized as a type of index arbitrage and is done roughly in a similar fashion if you dig through some data yahoo finance is great over the past 5 years on just the s&p500 i 'm sure you 'll find plenty of signals and perhaps profitable if you calibrate with specific numbers sorry for the long and rambling style but i wanted to hit a few key points and show a clever methods of using fundamentals

is it safe to invest in a portfolio of dividend stocks yielding 7 9 with the money borrowed at 3 4 from one of these brokerages yes and no it depends on your risk profile any investment has its risks of losing your capital but not investing is a guaranteed risk as you will be guaranteed to fall behind the rate of inflation regarding investing on margin this can increase your gains but can also increase your loses regarding the stock market when investing in stocks you should not only look at the dividend rate but also the capital gain or loss potential remember in regards to investing on margin if the share price drop too much you can get a margin call no matter how much dividend you are getting it is no use gaining 9 in dividend yield per year if you are losing 15 or more in capital each year also what is the risk of the dividend rate being cut back or dividends not being paid at all in the future these are some of the risks you should consider before investing and derive a risk management plan as part of your investment plan before you invest no investment is totally safe or risk free but it is less risky than not investing at all as long as you understand the risks involved and have a risk management plan in place as part of your overall investment plan

the problems with ratings and the interpretation of ratings is that they are retrospective and most people read them as prospective they basically tell you that debtor is solvent right now what does that mean it means that the ratings are based on the audited financial statements of a company government or other organization issuing debt so in the best case scenario where the rating agency is acting properly they are still dependent on folks with fiduciary responsibility telling the truth and even if they are telling the truth accounting rules make it possible to obscure problems for years in some cases municipal are a great example of this the general obligation bonds cities and even states with deep structural budget problems still get good ratings because they are solvent and have sufficient operating cash to meet obligations today but towards the end of a 30-year bond 's life that may not be the case anymore unless they dramatically alter their budgets at the end of the day ratings are one aspect of due diligence they are useful screening devices but you need to understand who you are lending money to by purchasing bonds and diversify your holdings to protect your wealth   the problem of course is when the trustees of your pension fund invests in garbage assets after getting a sales pitch on the beach in hawaii then conveniently place all of the blame for that bad investment on the rating agency you unfortunately have zero control over that

this is really two questions about yield and contents content as others have noted an annuity is a contractual obligation not a portfolio contained within an investment product per se the primary difference between whether an annuity is fixed or variable is what the issuer is guaranteeing and how much risk reward you are sharing in generally speaking the holdings of an issuer are influenced by the average duration of the payments however you can ascertain the assets that back that promise by looking at for example the holdings of a large insurance or securities firm that is why issuers are generally rated as to their financial strength and ability to meet their obligations a number of the market failures you mentioned were in part caused by the failure of these ratings to represent the true financial strength of the firm yield as to the second question of how they can offer a competitive rate there are at least several reasons i am assuming an immediate annuity 1 return of principal the 7 you are being quoted is the percent of your principal that will be returned to you each year not the rate of return being earned by the issuer if you invest $ 100 in the market personally and get a 5 return you have $ 105   however the annuity 's issuer is also returning part of your principal to you each year in your payment as they do n't return your principal when you eventually die because of this they can offer you more each year than they really make in the market what makes a ponzi scheme different is that they are also paying out your principal usually to others but lie to you by telling you it 's still in your account 2 the time value of money a promise to pay you $ 500 tomorrow costs less than $ 500 today a fixed annuity promises to pay you a certain amount of money each year this can be represented as a rate of return calculated based on how much you have to pay to get that annual payment but it is important to remember that the first payment will be worth substantially more in real purchasing power than the last payment you get the longer you live the less your fixed payment is worth in real terms due to inflation in short the rate of return has to be discounted for inflation it is not a real rate of return in other words if you give me $ 500 today and i promise to pay you $ 100 for the next 5 years i am making money not only because i can invest the money between now and then but also because $ 100 will be worth less five years from now than it is today with annuities if you want your payment to rise in step with inflation you have to pay more for that a lot more these are the two main reasons here are a few smaller ones 3 a very long time horizon if the stock market or another asset class is performing well poorly the issuer can often afford to wait much longer to buy or sell than an individual and can take better advantage of historical highs and lows over the long term 4 big boy investing a large financially sound issuer can afford to take risks that an individual can not such as in very large or illiquid assets such as a private company a la warren buffet 5 efficiencies of scale institutional investors have a number of legal advantages over individuals which i wo n't discuss in detail here however they exist large issuers are also often in related business insurance mutual funds such that they can deal in large volumes and form an internal clearinghouse i.e. if i want to buy facebook and you want to sell it they can just move the stock around without doing any trading with the result that their costs of trading are lower than those of an individual hope that helps

the other issue you could run into is that each deferred account is going to be subject to its own rmd 's required minimum distributions when you 've retired or hit 70.5 years of age   roth 's do n't generally care about rmd 's at first but are still subject to them once the person that created the roth has passed   having fewer accounts will simplify the rmd stuff but that 's really only a factor in terms of being forced to sell something in each account in order to make the rmd    other than that it 's just a matter of remembering to check each account if you come to a decision that it 's time to liquidate holdings in a given security lest you sell some but forget about the rest of it in another account   and perhaps as chris pointed out maybe having to pay fee 's on each account for the sale   where this really can come into play is if you choose to load up each individual account with a given kind of investment instead of spreading them across the accounts   in that case rmd 's could force you into selling something that is currently down when you want to hold onto it because that is your only choice in order to meet rmd 's for account x.   so if you have multiple accounts it 's a good idea to not particular vehicles into a single account but spread similar across multiple accounts so you always have the choice in each account of what to sell in order to meet an rmd if you have fewer accounts it 's thus a lot easier to avoid the effect

something very similar to this was extremely popular in the uk in the late 1980s   the practice has completely vanished since the early 2000s   reading up on the uk endowment mortgage scandals will probably give you an excellent insight into whether you should attempt your plan endowment mortgages were provided by banks and at their peak were probably the most popular mortgage form   the basic idea was that you only pay the interest on your mortgage and invest a small amount each month into a low fee endowment policy   many endowment policies were simply index tracking and the idea being that by the end of your mortgage you would have built up a portfolio sufficient to pay off your mortgage and may well have extra left over in the late 1990s the combination of falling housing market and poor stock performance meant that many people were left with both the endowment less than their mortgage and their house in negative equity

what you are describing sounds a lot like the way we handle our household budget   this is possible but quite difficult to do with an excel spreadsheet   it is much easier to do with dedicated budgeting software designed for this purpose when choosing personal budgeting software i 've found that the available packages fall in two broad categories some packages take what i would call a proactive approach you enter in your bank account balances and assign your money into spending categories   when you deposit your paycheck you do the same thing you add this money to your spending categories   then when you spend money you assign it to a spending category and the software keeps track of your category balances   at any time you can see both your bank balances and your spending category balances   if you need to spend money in a category that does n't have any more money you 'll need to move money from a different category into that one   this approach is sometimes called the envelope system because it resembles a digital version of putting your cash into different envelopes with different purposes   a few examples of software in this category are you need a budget ynab mvelopes and everydollar other packages take more of a reactive approach you do n't bother assigning a job to the money already in your bank account   instead you just enter your monthly income and put together a spending plan   as you spend money you assign the transactions to a spending category and at the end of the month you can see what you actually spent vs. what your plan was and try to adjust your next budget accordingly   software that takes this approach includes quicken and mint.com i use and recommend the proactive approach and it sounds from your question like this is the approach that you are looking for   i 've used several different budgeting software packages and my personal recommendation is for ynab the software that we currently use   i do n't want this post to sound too much like a commercial but i believe it will do everything you are looking for    one of the great things about the proactive approach in my opinion is how credit card accounts are handled   since your spending category balances only include real money actually sitting in an account not projected income for the month when you spend money out of a category with your credit card the software deducts the money from the spending category immediately as it is already spent   the credit card balance goes negative   when the credit card bill comes and you pay it this is handled in the software as an account transfer from your checking account to your credit card account   the money in the checking account is already set aside for the purpose of paying your credit card bill dedicated budgeting software generally has a reconcile feature that makes verifying your bank statements very easy   you just enter the date of your bank statement and the balance and then the software shows you a list of the transactions that fall in those dates   you can check each one against the transactions on the statement editing the ones that are n't right and adding any that are missing from the software   after everything checks out the software marks the transactions as verified so you can easily see what has cleared and what has n't let me give you an example to clarify in response to your comment   this example is specific to ynab but other software using the same approach would work in a similar way let 's say that you have a checking account and a credit card account   your checking account named checking has $ 2,000 in it currently   your credit card currently has nothing charged on it because you 've just paid your bill and have n't used it yet this billing period   ynab reports the balance of your credit card account we 'll call this account creditcard as $ 0 every dollar in checking is assigned to a category   for example you 've got $ 200 in groceries $ 100 in fast food $ 300 in rent $ 50 in phone $ 500 in emergency fund etc   if you add up the balance of all of your categories you 'll get $ 2,000 let 's say that you 've written a check to the grocery store for $ 100   when you enter this in ynab you tell it the name of the store the account that you paid with checking and the category that the expense belongs to groceries   the groceries category balance will go down from $ 200 to $ 100 and the checking account balance will go down from $ 2,000 to $ 1,900 now let 's say that you 've spent $ 10 on fast food with your credit card   when you enter this in ynab you tell it the name of the restaurant the account that you paid with creditcard and the category that the expense belongs to fast food   ynab will lower the fast food category balance from $ 100 to $ 90 and your creditcard account balance will go from $ 0 to $ -10 at this point if you add up all the category balances you 'll get $   and if you add up your account balances you 'll also get $ because checking has $ 1,900 and creditcard has $ -10   if you get your checking account bank statement at this time the account balance of $ 1,900 should match the statement and you 'll see the payment to the grocery store assuming the check has cleared   and if the credit card bill comes now you 'll see the fast food purchase and the balance of $ -10 when you write a check to pay this credit card bill you enter this in ynab as an account transfer of $ 10 from checking to creditcard   this transfer does not affect any of your category balances they remain the same   but now your checking account balance is down to $ and creditcard is back to $ 0 this works just as well whether you have one checking account and one credit card or 2 checking accounts 2 savings accounts and 3 credit cards   when you want to spend some money you look at your category balance   if there is money in there then the money is available to spend somewhere in one of your accounts   then you pick an account you want to pay with and looking at the account balance if there is n't enough money in that account to pay it you just need to move some money from another account into that one or pick a different account   when you pay for an expense with a credit card the money gets deducted from the category balances immediately and is no longer available to spend on something else

qe is artificial demand for bonds but as always when there are more buyers than sellers the price of anything goes up when qe ends the price of bonds will fall because everyone will know that the biggest buyer in the market is no longer there   so price of bonds will fall and therefore the interest rate on new bonds must increase to match the total return available to buyers in the secondary market

you have figured out most of the answers for yourself and there is not much more that can be said from a lender 's viewpoint   non immigrant students applying for car loans are not very good risks because they are going to graduate in a short time maybe less than the loan duration which is typically three years or more and thus   may well be leaving the country before   the loan is fully paid off in your case the issue is exacerbated   by the fact that your opt status is due to expire in about one year 's time so the issue is not whether you are a citizen but whether the lender can be reasonably sure that you will be gainfully employed and able to make the loan   payments until the loan is fully paid off yes lenders care about work history and scores but they also care perhaps even care more about the prospects for steady employment and ability to make the payments until the loan is paid off   yes you plan on   applying for a h1-b visa but that is still in the future and whether the visa status will be adjusted is still a matter with uncertain outcome also these are not matters that can be explained easily in an on line application or in a paper application submitted by mail to a distant bank whose name you obtained from some list of lenders who have a reliable track record of extending   auto loans to non permanent residents for this reason i   suggested in a comment that you consider applying at a credit union   especially if there is an employees credit union for those   working for your employer if you go this route go talk to a loan officer in person rather than trying to do this on the phone similarly a local bank and especially one where you currently have an account hopefully in good standing is more likely to be willing to work with you   failing all this there is always the auto dealer 's own loan offers of financing   finally one possibility that you might   want to consider is whether a one year lease might work for you instead of an outright purchase and you can buy a car after your visa issue has been settled

i ’m not an expert on the visa us tax or insurance but you 're making enough mistakes in terms of all the associated costs involved in owning and renting houses apartments that this already looks potentially unwise at this stage of your investment career renting cheap properties to students involves the property constantly being trashed often being empty and requiring extremely close management which you either have to pay someone a lot to do or do yourself and lose other potential earning time if doing yourself you will also make lots of mistakes in the vetting managing marketing process etc at first as this is a complex art in itself   costs on this type of rental can often get as high as 25 a year depending exactly how lucky you get even if you do it all yourself and will typically be in the 5 15 range every year once everything you have to constantly maintain replace and is up that 's all pre what you could be earning in a job etc so if you could earn a decent clip elsewhere in the same time also have to deduct that lost potential send it all to third parties so all upkeep by hired contractors all renting by an agency you will be lucky to even break even off a year per property rents to students you ’re not seeming to price in any transaction costs which usually run at ~5 a time for both entrance and exit that s between half and one years rent gone from the ten per property on these numbers sell before ten is up its even more on point three rounding projections in house price rises to one decimal place is total gibberish no one who actually has experience investing their own money well ever makes or relies on claims like this no idea on pittsburgh market but sound projections of likely asset changes is always a ranged and figure that can not and should n’t be counted on for much even if it was it ’s also completely unattainable in property because you have to spend so much money on upkeep post costs and changes in size standard house values generally roughly track inflation have a look at this chart and play around with some reasonable yearly upkeep numbers and you will see what i mean renting property is an absolute for inexperienced investors and if you do n't know the stuff above already and it 's less than 10 of what you need to know to do this profitably vs other uses of your time you will nearly always be better off investing the money in more passive investments like diversified bonds reits and stock

if the value of these hard assets is significant you probably have them insured and for significant art work you should have had them appraised as part of getting them insured therefore the process of adding them into the net worth calculation would be trivial   your goals should be a mix of liquid assets and assets that are harder to sell such as real estate it should also include those items you are more reluctant to sell in some cases these investments do need to be included in official calculations such as applying for a student loan or financial aid required financial disclosure statements for some government jobs or applications for government assistance
