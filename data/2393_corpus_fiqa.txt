then at the end if you decide to cash in your house you can roll the    proceeds into a fancier house to avoid paying taxes on your profit the problem is that the book was written in 1989 that comment is no longer true that part of the tax law changed in the 1990 's also in 1989 the maximum amount that person could put in an ira was $ 2,000 and had n't been raised for almost a decade and would n't be raised for another decade roth accounts did n't exist nor did hsa 's or 529 's most people did n't have a 401k. you are asking to compare what options we have today compared to what was available in the late 1980 's   for me except for the years 2001 2005 and 2010 2015 the period from 1988 until now has had flat real estate values still the current values have n't returned to the peak in 2005 the score is 11 great years 17 flat or negative i know many people who during the 1990 's had a zero return on their real estate

the assumption that house value appreciates 5 per year is unrealistic over the very long term real house prices has stayed approximately constant a house that is 10 years old today is 11 years old a year after so this phenomenon of real house prices staying constant applies only to the market as a whole and not to an individual house unless the individual house is maintained well one house is an extremely poorly diversified investment what if the house you buy turns out to have a mold problem you can lose your investment almost overnight in contrast to this it is extremely unlikely that the same could happen on a well diversified stock portfolio although it can happen on an individual stock thus if non leveraged stock portfolio has a nominal return of 8 over the long term i would demand higher return say 10 from a non leveraged investment to an individual house because of the greater risks if you have the ability to diversify your real estate investments a portfolio of diversified real estate investments is safer than a diversified stock portfolio so i would demand a nominal return of 6 over the long term from such a diversified portfolio to decide if it 's better to buy a house or to live in rental property you need to gather all of the costs of both options including the opportunity cost of the capital which you could otherwise invest elsewhere the real return of buying a house instead of renting it comes from the fact that you do not need to pay rent not from the fact that house prices tend to appreciate which they wo n't do more than inflation over a very long term for my case i live in finland in a special case of near rental property where you pay 15 of the building cost when moving in and get the 15 payment back when moving out and then pay a monthly rent that is lower than the market rent the property is subsidized by government provided loans i have calculated that for my case living in this property makes more sense than purchasing a market priced house but your situation may be different

thinking of personal residence as investment is how we got the bubble and crash in housing prices and the great recession there is no guarantee that a house will appreciate or even retain value it 's also an extremely illiquid item selling it especially if you 're seeking a profit can take a year or more housing is not guaranteed to appreciate constantly or at all tastes change and renovations rarely pay for themselves things wear out and have costs neighborhoods change in popularity without rental income and the ability to write off some of the costs as business expense it is n't clear the tax advantage closes that gap as the advantage is limited to the taxes upon your mortgage interest by deducting that from agi   if this is the flavor of speculation you want to engage in fine but i 've seen people screw themselves over this way and wind up forced to sell a house for a loss by all means hope your home will be profitable count it as part of your net wealth but generally lynch is wrong here or at best oversimplified a house can be an investment or perhaps more accurately a business or your home but unless you 're renting out the other half of a duplex which splits the difference trying to treat it as both is dangerous accounting

paying off your loan in full will most likely not help your credit score and could potentially even hurt it because car loans are installment loans and thus differ from consumer credit lenders really only like seeing that you responsibly pay off your loans on time they do n't really care if you pay it off early lenders like seeing open lines of credit as long as you manage them well the hard inquiry will simply lower your credit score a few points for up to two years so from a credit score perspective you 're really not going to help yourself in this scenario although it 's not like you 're going to be plummeting yourself either

according to pages 6 7 of the instructions for form 1040 in 2009 amt was only temporarily for the year congress ca n't politically afford to drastically cut amt exemptions by 30 to 40 and may even retroactively change it if it is n't passed by the end of the year despite the constitution ex post facto laws what ’s new for 2009     alternative minimum tax amt exemption amount increased the amt exemption amount has increased to $ $ if married filing jointly or a qualifying $ if married filing separately what ’s new for 2010     alternative minimum tax amt exemption amount the amt exemption amount is scheduled to decrease to $ $ 45,000 if married filing jointly or a qualifying $ 22,500 if married filing separately so if you are married and several regular tax deductions push your income below the amt exemption amount of $ 45,000 it 's quite possible you would be required to pay amt even if you did n't last year there is a work sheet for amt in the instructions for line 43 but the irs also provides an amt calculator according to page 146 of the instructions for form 1040 amt is paid as the smallest amount you are allowed to report as your taxable income form 1040 line 43 it is also the smallest amount you are allowed to report as your alternative minimum taxable income    on form line 29 if the amt calculation is larger than your taxable income would otherwise be enter the amount from column c on form 1040 line 43 or form line 29   as always congress finds ways to further complicate things by making a few credits and losses deductible against the absolute minimum you 're expected to pay taxes on making the amt a misnomer

i agree with the others that pulling the money out of your 401(k is not the best idea due to the taxes and penalties   but i also think that a 401(k loan is not a good option either   somehow life happens and the time when you can least afford to repay the loan just after losing your job will be the time when you have to repay the loan or pay the taxes and penalties   there 's just too much risk there   you also lose the compounding gains you 'd get from the investment and it 's likely not worth sacrificing your future retirement for this it 's probably worth finding out how close you are to having your house appraise out for a successful re fi   without that information you 're just guessing   depending on how close you are you pile up as much cash as you can over the next few months to try to pay down the mortgage enough to qualify for the re fi   as you 're doing this if home values start coming up in your area you 'll have that going for you as well   it might even be worth suspending your 401(k contributions for a short while to give you more cash to put towards the re fi goal

as a common shareholder why would i want to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares because it could increase the value of your existing shares companies sell new shares to raise capital and they use capital to among other things expand if whole foods issues new shares and uses the capital to opens new stores then profit could increase enough to offset the dilution effect and your stock price will go up you should ask yourself   what areas is is your company of choice planning on expanding into will they do well there are there better ways for the company to raise capital debt cash in hand cut expenses elsewhere etc if you think that the management has a good plan for expanding then authorizing new shares makes good sense for you personally

put options for kids you have a big box of candy bars you saved up your allowance to get a lot of them so you could have one whenever you want one but you just saw a commercial on tv for a new toy coming out in one month your allowance alone wo n't buy it and you want that toy more than you want the candy so you decide that you 'll sell the candy to your friends at school to buy the toy now you have a choice you can sell the candy now and put the money in your piggy bank to buy the toy later or you can save the candy and sell it in a month when you actually need the money to buy the toy you know that if you sell all the candy you have today you can get 50 cents a bar that 's not quite enough to buy the toy but your allowance will cover the rest   what you do n't know is how much you might be able to sell the candy for in a month you might be able to get 75 cents a bar if you did you could pay for the toy with just the money from the candy and even have some left over but you might only be able to sell them for 25 cents each and you would n't have enough to buy the toy even with your allowance you 'd like to wait and see if you could get 75 cents each but you do n't want to risk getting only 25 cents each so you go to your father he and his co workers like these candy bars too so he 'd be willing to buy them all and sell them to his friends the way you 're planning to do with yours you ask for the option to sell him all the candy bars for 50 cents each in one month if you find out you can get more for them at school you want to be able to take that deal but if you ca n't sell them for 50 cents at school you 'll sell them to your dad now your dad knows that he could have the same problem selling the candy at 50 cents or more that you are afraid of so he offers a compromise if you pay him $ 5 now he 'll agree to the deal you figure that even without that $ 5 between your allowance and the candy money you can still buy the toy so you take the deal   in one month you can offer the candy at school if nobody will pay 50 cents you can sell the candy to your dad when you get home but if the kids at school will pay 50 cents or more you can sell it all at school either way you have enough money to buy the toy and you can also choose which price to accept but you had to pay your dad $ 5 and you ca n't get that back so if it turns out that you can sell the candy at school for 50 cents same as today then because you paid the $ 5 you do n't end up with as much as if you 'd simply waited in the financial market this type of option is a put option someone who owns something that 's traded on the market like a stock can arrange to sell that stock to someone else at an agreed on price and the seller can additionally pay some money to the buyer up front for the option to not sell at that price now if the stock market goes up the seller lets the contract expire and sells his stock on the open market if it goes down he can exercise the option and sell at the agreed upon price to the buyer if however the stock stays about the same whether he chooses to sell or not the money the seller paid for the option means he ends up with less than he would have if he had n't bought the option call options for kids let 's say that you see another ad on tv for another toy that you like that was just released you check the suggested retail price on the company 's web site and you see that if you save your allowance for the next month you can buy it but in school the next day everybody 's talking about this toy saying how they want one some already have enough money others are saving up and will be able to get it before you can you 're afraid that because everyone else wants one it 'll drive up the price for them at the local store so that your month 's allowance will no longer buy the toy so you go to your dad again you want to be able to use your allowance money for the next month to buy the new toy you 're willing to wait until you actually have the money saved up before you get the toy but you need that toy in a month so you want your dad to buy one for you and hold it until you can save up to buy it from him but you still want it both ways if the price goes down in a month because the toy 's not so new anymore and people do n't want it you do n't want to spend your entire month 's allowance buying the one from your dad you just want to go to the store and buy one at the lower price you 'll pay him $ 5 for the trouble right now whether you buy the toy he got you or not your dad does n't want to have a toy he 's not using sitting around for a month especially if you might not end up buying it from him so he offers a different deal in one month if you still want it he 'll stop by the store on his way home and pick up the toy you 'll then reimburse him from the allowance you saved up if it ends up costing less than a month 's allowance so be it but if it costs more than that you wo n't have to pay any more this will only cost you $ 3 because it 's easier for him but because he 's not buying it now there is a small chance that the item will be out of stock when he goes to buy it and you 'll have to wait until it 's back in stock you agree on the condition that if you have to wait longer than a month for your toy because he could n't get one to sell you he pays you back your $ 3 and knocks another $ 5 off the cost to buy the toy from him the basic deal to buy something at an agreed price with the option not to do so is known as a call option someone who wishes to buy some stocks bonds or commodities at a future date can arrange a deal with someone who has what they want to buy them at a specific price the buyer can then pay the seller for the option to not buy the counter offer dad made where he will buy the toy from the store at whatever price he can find it then sell it to you for the agreed price is known as a naked call in finance it simply means that the seller who is in this case offering the option to the buyer does n't actually have what they are agreeing to sell at the future date and would have to buy it on the open market in order to turn around and sell it this is typically done when the seller is confident that the price will go down or wo n't go up by much between now and the date of the contract in those cases either the buyer wo n't exercise the option and will just buy what they want on the open market or they 'll exercise the option but the difference between what the seller is paying to buy the commodity on the market and what he 's getting by selling it on contract is within the price he received for the option itself if however the price of an item skyrockets the seller now has to take a significant real loss of money by buying something and then selling it for far less than he paid if the item flat out is n't available the buyer is usually entitled to penalties for the seller 's failure to deliver if this is all understood by both parties it can be thought of as a form of insurance

getting the first year right for any rental property is key it is even more complex when you rent a room or rent via a service like airbnb. get professional tax advice for you the irs rules are covered in tax topic renting residential and vacation property and irs pub residential rental property there is a special rule if you use a dwelling unit as a personal    residence and rent it for fewer than 15 days in this case do not    report any of the rental income and do not deduct any expenses as    rental expenses if you reach that reporting threshold the irs will now expect you to to have to report the income and address the items such as depreciation when you go to sell the house you will again have to address depreciation all of this adds complexity to your tax situation the best advice is to make sure that in a tax year you do n't cross that threshold when you have a house that is part personal residence and part rental property some parts of the tax code become complex you will have to divide all the expenses mortgage property tax insurance and split it between the two uses you will also have to take that rental portion of the property and depreciation it you will need to determine the value of the property before the split and then determine the value of the rental portion at the time of the split from then on you will follow the irs regulations for depreciation of the rental portion until you either convert it back to non rental or sell the property   when the property is sold the portion of the sales price will be associated with the rental property and you will need to determine if the rental property is sold for a profit or a loss you will also have to recapture the depreciation it is possible that one portion of the property could show a loss and the other part of the property a gain depending on house prices over the decades you can expect that airbnb will collect tax info and send it to the irs as a us company we ’re required by us law to collect taxpayer    information from hosts who appear to have us sourced income virginia will piggyback onto the irs rules local law must be researched because they may limit what type of rentals are allowed local law could be state or county city town even zoning regulations could apply also check any documents from your home owners association they may address running a business or renting a property   you may need to adjust your insurance policy regarding having tenants you may also want to look at insurance to protect you if a renter is injured

for one thing fund managers even fund management companies own less money than their clients put together on the whole they simply can not underwrite 50 of the potential losses of the funds they manage and an offer to do so would be completely unsecured warren buffet owns about 1/3 of berkshire hathaway so i suppose maybe he could do it if he wanted to and i wo n't guess why he prefers his own business model investing in the fund he manages or used to manage over the one you propose for him keeping his money in something so secure he could use it to cover arbitrary losses on b h buffett and his investors have always felt that he has sufficient incentive to see b h do well and it 's not clear that your scheme would provide him any useful further incentive you say that the details are immaterial supposing instead of 50 it was one part in a million then it would be completely plausible for a fund manager to offer this invest 50 million lose it all and i 'll buy dinner to but would you be as attracted to it as you would be to 50 then the details are material actually a fund manager could do it by taking your money putting 50 into the fund and 50 into a cash account if you make money on the fund you only make half as much as if you 'd been fully invested so half your profit has been taken when you get back the fund value + cash if you lose money on the fund pay you back 50 of your losses using the cash worst case scenario the fund is completely wiped out but you still get back 50 of your initial investment the combined investment vehicle has covered exactly half your losses and it subtracts exactly half your profit the manager has offered the terms you asked for -50 leverage but still does n't have skin the game your proposed terms do not provide the incentive you expect why do n't fund managers offer this because with a few exceptions 50 is an absurd amount for an investment fund to keep in cash and nobody would buy it if you want to use cash for that level of inverse leverage you call the bank open an account and keep the interest for yourself you do n't expect your managed fund to do it furthermore supposing the manager did invest 100 of your subscription in the fund and cover the risk with their own capital that means the only place they actually make any profit is the return on a risk that they take with their capital on the fund 's wins losses you 've given them no incentive to invest your money as well as their own they might as well just put their capital in the fund and let you keep your money they 're better off without you since there 's less paperwork and they can invest whatever they like instead of carefully matching whatever money you send them if you think they can make better picks than you and you want them to do so on your behalf then you need to pay them for the privilege riding their for free is not a service they have any reason to offer you it turns out that you can not force someone to expose themselves to a particular risk other than by agreeing that they will expose themselves to that risk and then closely monitoring their investment portfolio otherwise they can find ways to insure hedge the risk they 're required to take on if it 's on their books but cancelled by something else then they are n't really exposed so to provide incentive what we normally want is what buffett does which is for the fund manager to be invested in the fund to keep them keen and to draw a salary in return for letting you in their investment can not precisely match yours because the fund manager 's capital does n't precisely match your capital it does n't cover your losses because it 's in the same fund so if your money vanishes the fund manager loses too and has nothing to cover you with but it does provide the incentive all right i admit it worst case scenario there 's a total banking collapse end of civilization as we know it and the cash account defaults but then even in your proposed scheme it 's possible that whatever assets the fund manager was using as security could fail to so why you might ask do individual fund managers get bonuses in return for meeting fixed targets instead of only being part paid in shares in their own fund whose value they can then maximise i honestly do n't know but i suspect lots of reasons probably the psychology of rewarding them for performance in a way that compares with other executive posts or professions they might take up instead of fund management probably the benefit to the fund itself which wants to attract more clients of beating certain benchmarks probably other things including frankly human error in setting their compensation packages

all of this assumes that this relationship is n't as employer employee relationship which would require you to withhold taxes if you send them a small token of appreciation and you are unable to record it as a business expense or some other deductible expense you do n't have to be concerned about how they claim it they decide if they want to risk claiming it was a gift or if they want to record it as an expense even if you say some magic phrase that you think will impress the irs the recipient can still decide declare it as income to have any hope of being able to treat it as a gift they would have to be able to demonstrate that there is a non business relationship   if you can claim it as a business expense or a deductible expense   they will have to also claim it as income because your documentation could point the irs to their lack of documentation   giving them a check or sending the payment electronically will require them to claim it as an income since an audit could require them to explain every line on their bank statements

both are saying essentially the same thing   the forbes articles says as much as 20 up to a maximum of $ 50,000   this means the same as what the irs page when it says the lesser of a percentage of your income or a total of $ 53,000   in other words the $ 53k is a cap you can contribute a percentage of your earnings but you can never contribute more than $ 53k even if you make so much money that 20 of your earnings would be more than that the difference between 20 and 25 in the two sources appears to reflect a difference in contribution limits depending on whether you are making contributions for employees or for yourself as a self employed individual see publication 560   the difference between $ 50k and $ 53k is due to the two pages being written in different years the limits increase each year

$ 33 k $ payment is but is that right you 're also stretching out the remaining loan back to 30 years   now if the bank just let you do the stretch you 'd owe $ 95 k 4.75 360 mo pmt = $ this would be a neutral move same rate you now have $ 128 k 360 pmt = $ 737 so to my thinking the delta is $ 33 k x rate 360 pmt = $ and the rate is if you have enough equity to refi you have enough to take that in a heloc and pay it off aggressively why give up the great rate the $ you will pay the heloc off in 22 years even at 6 my heloc is 2.5 i 'd use any raise or bonus to hack away at it   i tried to spell out my thought process on the math if any savvy reader you all are i know wants to look at this and offer a better method i 'm open minded there 's a fallacy that comes with refinancing certainly money appears in the payment stream as a result of extending the term somewhere that needs to be accounted for else a higher rate at a longer term appears favorable so my approach is to normalize the numbers one way or another here producing that first step of calculating the payment on the extended term an interim step that 's a mental process only that loan is hypothetical   comments welcome

right so the fundamental question is if the roll over will cause short term interest rates to decouple from the fed 's say so   this is otherwise known as a bond auction failure   the fed wants the treasury debt off their books but they do n't want to raise interest rates to make that happen   so they 're going to experiment with outside of the fed to see if they can boil the   if the starts to i guarantee you that they 're going to take the pot off the   at their the proposed roll over suspension rate it 'll take approximately 12 to 16 years to to get that two trillion off their books and that assumes that nothing bad happens during that time   gt do you know of any good that would back your side   the closest you 're going to find would be anything written about the post 1995 but it looks like their program of direct stock market participation technically they 're using etfs probably for financial cryptography purposes began in earnest in news articles/2017 07 head turns surprise critic of etf purchases   this piece indicates that the japanese are n't the only ones doing this   england the swiss and even the eu is doing the same thing across multiple exchanges   as the article points out there 's a two effect of suppressing fx stock price correlations strengthening or weakening of currencies raising or lowering stocks listed on associated and reducing volatility through market intervention aka plunge protection teams    they also reference an survey of   central bank reserve managers

wow very by some of the answers i will comment on those later to directly answer your question here is a link to a brochure that explains the three basic and is written in straightforward language link text that is step one step 2 is a question cheapest when initially or for long term without a doubt term initially is the cheapest however every 10 years or 20 years it increases in price as the name term implies it is temporary coverage will end at some point 75 or 80 depending upon plan design chosen it is possible that if you choose term you can outlive your coverage and all you have are a bunch of cancelled cheques young people with a mortgage children and other debts should buy a lot of term as the mortgage will be paid off the kids will no longer be dependent these needs are temporary however some needs are permanent what about leaving a legacy at death to a charity insurance is a good solution and can provide a tax deduction too term is n't a good fit or a business owner wishing to transfer his her business at death to their children taxes will be due and permanent insurance such as whole life and universal life can be arranged to provide cash to pay tax whenever this happens   let me ask you who received 10 in the last ten years on their equity portfolio almost zero people did however a whole plan would have generated a guaranteed return of 3.0 plus a non guaranteed return via dividends that the combined internal rate of return   on a combined basis would be about 5.6 after taxes life a bond portfolio yield internal rate of return is dependent on age at buying years of investing all insurance software can show you the internal rate of return irr is what is the return after tax that you must get to equal the equity or death benefit from a permanent insurance plan someone mentioned by term and invest the difference that is what universal life is term and invest the difference except the difference is growing tax sheltered outside investments with comparable risk are taxable there is no easy answer for what type is right often a combination is the key question you should ask is how much is enough then consider types based upon your needs and budget here is a link where you can calculate how much you need i hope this helps a bit

tl;dr sure do your own homework is sometimes a cop out but that does n't mean we should n't do our homework i agree that in many cases this is a cop out by commentators however even if you believe in perfect market efficiency there is benefit in doing your homework for many reasons one of which you already mention in the question different stocks all with the same value might have widely ranging risk another factor that might vary between stocks is their tax consequences high dividend stocks might be a better fit for some buyers than others one stock might be priced at $ 40 because there is a small chance they might get regulatory approval for a new product this might make this stock very risky with a 20 of being $ 150 in 12 months and a 80 chance of being $ 20 another stock might be priced at $ 40 because the company is a cash cow declining in revenues but producing a large dividend of $ 0.40 per quarter low risk but also with some potential tax disadvantages another stock might be priced at $ 40 because it 's a high growth stock this would be less risky than the first example but more risky than the second example and the risk would be more generalized i.e. there would n't be one day or one event that would be make or break the stock in short even if we assume that the market is pricing everything perfectly not all stocks are equal and not all stocks are equally appropriate to everyone sometimes when we hear an analyst say they should have done their homework they are really saying this was a high risk high reward stock they should have known that this had a potential downside and that all assumes that we believe in 100 pure market efficiency which many disagree with at least to some extent for example if we instead subscribe to peter lynch 's theories about local knowledge we might believe that everyone has some personal fields of expertise where they know more than the experts a professional stock analyst is going to follow many stocks and many not have technical experience in the field of the company this is especially true of small and mid cap stocks if you happen to be an expert in led lighting it is entirely feasible at least to me that you could be able to do a better job of doing homework on than the analysts or if you use a specialized piece of software from a small vendor at work and you know that the latest version stinks then you will likely know more than the analyst does i think it is somewhat akin to going to a doctor we could say to ourselves the doctor is more knowledgeable about me than medicine i 'm just going to do what they tell me to do and 99 of the time that is the right thing to do but if we do our homework anyway and research the symptoms diagnoses and drugs ourselves as well we can do get benefits sometimes we just can express our preferences amongst equal solutions sometimes we can ask smarter questions and sometimes we have some piece of knowledge that the doctor does n't have and can actually make an important discovery they did n't know and just like investing sometimes we can also have just enough knowledge to be dangerous and do ourselves harm if we go against the advice of the professionals

what you did is called a strangle it 's rather unlikely that both will be exercised on the same day but yes it can happen   that is if the market is very volatile on a given day so that the stock hits 13 in the morning the put gets exercised and then hits 15 later in the day so the call gets exercised or vice versa more to the point the prices are close enough that one might be hit on one day and the other on a different day in either case if one side gets hit you need to reevaluate your position in the other but basically any open position you have can be hit at any time the only way to avoid this risk is not to have positions

since handled arbitrage i 'll take goodwill   goodwill is an accounting term that acts much like a plug account you add subtract to it the amount that makes everything balance   in the case of goodwill it generally only applies to mergers amp acquisitions   the theory and justification is this firms buy other firms at prices other than the market price usually higher and it is assumed that this is because the acquirer values its acquisition more than other people do   but whether you use historical prices or market prices when you add subtract assets and liabilities to to from your balance sheet this will never add up because you paid more less than the assets are worth in the market so more less cash flowed out than assets flowed in   the difference goes into the goodwill account so firms with a large goodwill account are ones that have made lots of acquisitions

they are entirely free to do whatever they want with the shares in particular they can sell them to whomever they choose no restrictions on who can sell when and to whom are a common thing with startups publicly traded companies are regulated in a much stricter way than private companies so until the ipo the sales are limited to the otc markets but even that can be restricted by bylaws for example ownership can only be limited to a group of investors approved by the board as an employee your grant was approved by the board but when you come to sell the buyer was not and the company may not agree to vet them bottom line is that it is not illegal to impose all kinds of restrictions on what the employees can do with their shares as long as the shares are not listed on a public stock exchange even after the company goes ipo with one class other classes may remain restricted

child care expenses are n't exactly deductible without the fsa but if you ca n't use the fsa and end up paying them with after tax dollars you can use these expenses to qualify for the child and dependent care tax credit which depending on your circumstances could save you more money than the fsa would have saved you

i see your remarks regarding zillow but would add a question why not look only for recent sales if you find homes similar to yours with recent sales that 's similar to how the appraisers do it i 've refinanced many times and each time i looked at sales within three miles of my house i hit the appraised price very close in my estimate high or low compared to zillow but used transaction data from my thought   i chose a random neighborhood and this was the first house i clicked the main view shows last sale date so i 'd obviously suggest the op look for more recent ones if turnover is that low in his neighborhood i understand but the comment that transactions are n't listed is factually incorrect i 'd like my back

your questions seek answers to specifics but i feel that you may need more general help there are two things i feel that you need to learn about in the general category of personal finance   your asking questions about investing but it is not as important imho as how you manage your day to day operations    for example you should first learn to budget   in personal finance often times living on a budget equates to poor or low income    that is hardly the case   a budget is a plan on how to spend money   it should be refreshed each and every month and your income should equal your expenses   you might have in your budget a $ 1200 trip into the city to see a concert hardly what a low income person should have in theirs secondly you need to be deliberate about debt management   for some they feel that having a car payment and having student loans are a necessary part of life and argue that paying them off is foolish as you can earn more from investments   others argue for zero debt   i fall in the later   using and carrying a balance on high interest ccs and having high leases or car payments are just dumb   they are also easy to wander into unless you are deliberate    third you need to prepare for emergencies   engineers still get laid off and hurt where they are unable to work   they get sued   having the proper insurance and sufficient reserves in the bank help prevent debt now you can start looking into investments    start off slow and deliberate with investing   put some in your company 401 k or open some mutual funds on the side   you can read about them and talk with advisers for free at fidelity and vanguard   read books from the library most of all do n't get caught up in too much hype   things like forex options life insurance gold silver are not investments   they are tools for sales people to make fat commissions off the ignorant       you are fortunate in that engineers are very likely to retire wealthy   they are part of the second largest demographic of first generation rich   the first is small business owners    to start out i would read millionaire next door and stop acting rich   for a debt free approach to life check out financial peace university by dave ramsey video course   his lesson on insurance is excellent    i am an engineer and my wife a project manager we found life changing and regretted not getting on board sooner   along these lines we have had some turmoil recently that became little more than an inconvenience because we were prepared

gt;if we lose our reserve currency status we would have to pay it off with a different currency    no a debt that comes into being as dollar denominated remains dollar denominated reserve currency status does n't change this   the advantage of having the reserve currency is that other countries have a strong motive to accumulate dollars because of this we can pay for our imports in dollars if we no longer had the reserve currency we would lose the ability to run a persistent trade deficit without borrowing foreign currency to do so   to some extent this would self correct if foreigners no longer desired to hoard dollars the flow of dollars back in to the us would bring down the trade deficit going forward we 'd have to live within our means with respect to foreign trade funding imports with exports   domestically every country that has its own currency not just the us can use that currency to fully fund its own domestic productive capacity printing money does n't make a poor country rich but it does allow any country to fully realize its own potential   countries do n't have the luxury of just printing out massive amounts of money to pay off their debts   this is only true when a country borrows in a currency it does n't issue when a country spends in its own currency its policy space is constrained by inflation to the extent any country uses to or borrows in someone else 's currency that policy space is narrowed by the need to first borrow or earn that currency   gt;if the un followed through with its suggestion to create a global reserve currency or reverted back to the gold standard   the euro shows us where that road leads countries that give up monetary authority give up sovereignty and when they find themselves in a situation where the monetary policy they no longer control is at odds with their needs their economies get torn apart   that 's why one country one currency is good policy stability and maximum policy space is achieved when fiscal authority political legitimacy and monetary authority are consolidated at the same level it 's a three that becomes a fragile balancing act when one leg is taken away   also there 's a whole side discussion to be had on what the alternatives are to the dollar as a reserve currency the dollar is in that position for a reason

as best as i can understand your payout is based on your which    is also capped at that same $ 118,500 so trump 's payout should also be    equivalently small exactly proportional to this cap not sure what you want from bernie here but that is correct is it accurate to say that trump will be paid by social security as    though his actual income was $ 118,500 rather than his full income assuming trump does pay that much depends on how much of his income is actually subject to the fica se tax yes it is accurate however i believe what confuses you is the point bernie sanders made about people getting the same benefit while being rich bernie 's point was that trump and the likes do n't need the social security income while they 're still getting it social security is designed at least theoretically to be the safety net for people of age who can not provide for themselves thus it is not supposed to be you get what you paid system this is a political discussion though social security system by definition is based on a major principle of any socialist society we as a group should support those who can not support themselves thus bernie 's point is that we should n't support trump and the likes at all since they do n't need that money but they should still pay the tax to allow supporting those who do need but can not pay in

that was a major statistic that i ca n't find honestly i did n't look but i know it is out there that supporters of obama care would use basically they said a large portion of those that are uninsured are healthy people between the ages of 18 35 who do n't see the need for health insurance ca n't afford health insurance or feel like they are never going to die or get sick so what s the point so the argument was if the pool for people paying for health insurance increases with a majority of that increase being people who will not use the system very much then rates should drop for everyone since there are more healthy people covering for the unhealthy people    i did n't assume that was how it was marketed while it was being proposed

no an entrepreneur actually adds value whereas stock ownership does not buying stocks is akin to gambling except with different rules and an average positive return over time whereas normal casino gambling always has a net negative result on average   to put it shortly   if it does n't make a difference whether its you or john from across the corner doing the action then its basically a speculation with investment as an alias you 're merely the purse   if you are involved in the running of the project taking decisions organizing putting your time and creativity in then you 're an entrepreneur   in this case its clear to see that different persons will have different results so they matter as persons and not just as purses   note that if you buy enough stock to actually have a say in the running of the company then you 're crossing the threshold there

dollar cost averaging is beneficial if you do n't have the money to make large investments but are able to add to your holding over time if you can buy the same monetary amount at regular intervals over time your average cost per share will be lower than the stock 's average value over that time this wo n't necessarily get you the best price but it will get you on the whole a good price and will enable you to increase your holdings over time if you 're doing frequent trading on a highly volatile stock you do n't want to use this method a better strategy is to buy the dips know the range and place limit orders toward the bottom of the range then place limit orders to sell toward the high end of the range if you do it right you might be able to build up enough money to buy and sell increasing numbers of shares over time but like any frequent trader you 'll have to deal with transaction fees you 'll need to be sure the fees do n't eat all your profit

the original option writer seller can close his short position in the contracts he wrote by purchasing back matching contracts i.e. contracts with the same terms underlying option type strike price expiration date from any others who hold long positions or else who write new matching contract instances rather than buyer and seller settling directly options are settled through a central options clearing house being the options clearing corporation for exchange listed options in the u.s. see also wikipedia clearing house finance so the original buyer of the put maintains his position insurance and the clearing process ensures he is matched up with somebody else holding a matching obligation if he chooses to exercise his put i also answered a similar question but in more detail here

i realize that a million dollars is    a completely arbitrary figure but    it 's one people on perhaps    folks just meant it 's getting easier    because inflation has made it a far    less lofty sum than when the word    millionaire was coined your point is correct it relatively easier as the 1 million dollar nowadays is no where as valuable as compared in the old days after the inflation adjustment however the way to achieve that is easier said than done the most possible way is to run your own business assuming you will make profit for most of the people running a job to earn a living the job income is the biggest factor being extremely frugal would n't help much if you do n't maximize your income potential earning a million dollar through investment how much capitals are you able to invest in 5k 50k 500k i see no way to earn 1 million with 5k from investment i would n't call it easy this again depends on your income with better income of course you could dedicate a larger portion to investment without exposing too much risk and having to affect your way of life 3 invest some part of your income    over a long period of time and let the    stock market do the work i 'd say this is more geared towards beating the inflation and earn a few extra bucks instead of getting very rich this is being very relative   just a word of the mindset of investment being the shortcut to wealth is very dangerous and often leads to speculative behavior

you can not just decide to declare bankruptcy and make the debts go away bankruptcy proceedings under chapter 7 include accounting of all of your assets and income and all of your debts and dividing all your assets and income except for amounts left for your own support between the debtors so if you can i.e. capable pay the debts off there 's nothing magical in bankruptcy that will make it any better for you you will still pay the debts off except that now you will also have the huge and much heavier stain of bankruptcy for chapter 7 the length it stays on the credit report is 10 years not 7 under chapter 13 the procedure is less drastic does n't include complete liquidation of all of your assets but the result is equally not as good you still pay all your debts but they may be reorganized interest rates change durations change some things can still be charged off but not likely if you actually have the capability to pay chapter 13 stays on your credit report for 7 years

the interest bearing mortgage of £ 300,000 would be six times your salary that 's a ratio that was found in japan and i believe was a main reason for their depressed economy of the past two decades even with an interest free loan of nearly £ 150,000 it would be a huge gamble for someone of your income essentially you are gambling that 1 your income will grow into your mortgage and that 's counting income from renting part of the property or 2 the house will rise in value thereby bailing you out that was a gamble that many americans took and lost in the past ten years if you do this you may be one of the lucky ones you may not but you are really taking your future in your hands   the american rule of thumb is that your mortgage should be no more than 2.5 3 times income that is maybe up to £ 150,000 perhaps £ 200,000 if £ 50,000 or so of that is interest free but not to the numbers you 're talking about

you will maximize your expected wealth by investing all the money you intend to invest as soon as you have it available do n't let the of dollar cost averaging induce you to allocate more much money to a savings account than is optimal   if you want the positive expected return of the market do n't put your money in a savings account   that 's especially true now when you are certainly earning a negative real interest rate on your savings account dollar cost averaging and putting all your money in at the beginning would have the same expected return except that if you put all your money in earlier it spends more time in the market so your expected return is higher   your volatility is also higher because your savings account would have very low volatility but your preference for investment tells me that you view the expected return and volatility tradeoff of the stock market as acceptable if you need something to help you feel less stress about investing right away think of it as dollar cost averaging on a yearly basis instead of monthly   further you take take comfort in knowing that you have allocated your wealth as you can instead of letting it away in real terms in a bank account

mining discovery of gold can be inflationary the spanish looting of central america for a few hundred years or the gold rush in the 19th century us are examples of that phenomenon the difference between printing currency and mining is that you have to ability to print money on demand while mining is limited to whatever is available to extract at a given time the rising price of gold may be contributing to increased production as low grade ore that was n't economically viable to work with in the 1980 's are now affordable

if your goal is to have a 400 k net worth in 11 years and you invest the entire time you will need a rate of return of at least 6.4   this is assuming that you have zero net worth now and it does not consider your house   obviously the house will be worth some amount and the mortgage balance will go down   however it can not really be calculated with the details provided    it seems like your risk tolerance is low   you may want to head over to bogleheads.org and look into their asset allocation model   they typically site about a 7 compounded growth rate which will more than meet your goals   they probably have information for european investors that map to the funds that we use here in the us    keep in mind during this time you will likely receive raises if you start out assuming you will hit the 400 500k mark and stick to the plan you will likely blow that goal away    also keep in mind the three legs to wealth building   giving some spending some and investing some   your question is addressing the investing portion make sure you are also enjoying your money by spending some on yourself and others benefit from your prosperity   giving to causes you deem worthy is a key component to wealth building that is often overlooked by those interested in investing

so you believe people are free to have opinions act on them but what is a business except a bunch of people interacting with others do you stop being human when you walk through the doors of your work using terms like companies should provide a service sounds like they are staffed by machines and we should force them to do whatever they want which is troubling   in my opinion companies should be free not to bake for neo nazis or gay couples of course i would boycott the latter as would many people i suspect the free market forces people to cooperate because bigoted organization will lose business   my biggest problem with paypal 's decision is i 'm not sure i trust them to determine who is a hate group fairly like you said of course i trust the government even less but the good news is if they implement their policy unfairly then they 'll get slapped by the invisible hand and go broke the free market is one of the most democratic systems we have

while there are many very good and detailed answers to this question there is one key term from finance that none of them used and that is net present value while this is a term generally associate with debt and assets it also can be applied to the valuation models of a company 's share price the price of the share of a stock in a company represents the net present value of all future cash flows of that company divided by the total number of shares outstanding this is also the reason behind why the payment of dividends will cause the share price valuation to be less than its valuation if the company did not pay a dividend that those future outflows are factored into the npv calculation actually performed or implied and results in a current valuation that is less than it would have been had that capital been retained unlike with a fixed income security or even a variable rate debenture it is difficult to predict what the future cashflows of a company will be and how investors chose to value things as intangible as brand recognition market penetration and executive competence are often far more subjective that using 10 year libor rates to plug into a present value calculation for a floating rate bond of similar tenor opinion enters into the calculus and this is why you end up having a greater degree of price variance than you see in the fixed income markets you have had situations where companies such as amazon.com google and facebook had highly valued shares before they they ever posted a profit that is because the analysis of the value of their intellectual properties or business models would overtime provide a future value that was equivalent to their stock price at that time

i think the math is wrong note that in scenario 1 you are only out of pocket $ 1000 while in scenario 2 you are out of pocket $ 1250   the contribution and the tax you paid with respect to it a better concept than tax rate is retention rate   this is the fraction of your money that the feds let you keep   and growth factor is the how much the investment grows so in scenario 1 you multiply $ 1000 by the investment growth factor and then by the retirement retention rate and in scenario 2 you multiply the same $ 1000 by the current retention rate and then by the growth factor since in your approximation the two are the same there is no saving

only select items first i agree beware the factor any of those items may very well lead to greater consumption which will impact your worse than your bottom line and in this category chips and snacks in general you 'll typically get twice the size bag for the same price as supermarket for a large family this might work ok if one is interested in saving on grocery items the very first step is to get familiar with the unit cost often cents per ounce of most items you buy warehouse store or not this knowledge will make you a better buyer   in general the toiletries are cheaper than at the store but not as cheap as the big sale coupon cost at the supermarket or pharmacy cvs so if you pay attention you may always be stocked up from other sources all that said there are many items that easily cover our membership cost for costco the meat beef $ i can pay up to $ 18 at the supermarket or big 12 to the lb $ easily $ 15 at fish dept funny i buy the carrots mentioned they are less than half supermarket price per lb so i am ahead if we throw out the last 1/4 of the bag more often than not it 's used up 100   truth is everyone will have a different experience at these stores costco will refund membership up to the very end so why not try it and see if the visit is worth it last year i read and wrote a review of a book titled the paradox of choice the book 's premise was the diminishing return that come with too many things to choose from in my review i observed how a benefit of costco is the lack of choice there 's one or two brands for most items not dozens if you give this a bit of thought it 's actually a benefit

a company 's return on equity roe is its net income divided by its shareholder 's equity   the shareholder 's equity is the difference between total assets and total liabilities and is not dependent on the stock price what it takes to have a roe over 100 is to have the income be greater than the equity   this might happen for a variety of reasons but one way a high roe happens is if the shareholder 's equity the divisor is small which can occur if past losses have eroded the company 's capital the original invested cash and retained earnings   if the equity has become a small value the income for some period might exceed it and so the roe would be over 100 operating margin is not closely related to roe   although operating income is related to net income to calculate the margin you divide by sales which is completely unrelated to shareholder 's equity   so there is no relationship with roe to be expected   operating margin is primarily dependent on market conditions and can be substantially different in different industries

here is my simplified take in any given market portfolio the market index will return the average return on investment for the given market an actively managed product may outperform the market great achieve average market performance ok but then it is more expensive than the index product or be worse than the market bad   now if we divide all market returns into two buckets returns from active investment and returns from passive investments then these two buckets must be the same as index return are by definition the average returns which means that all active investments must return the average market return   this means for individual active investments there are worse than market returns and better then market returns depending on your product and since we ca n't anticipate the future and nobody would willingly take the worse than market investment product the index fund comes always up on top if you would like to avoid the gamble of underperforming the market with all these basics out of the way if you can replicate the index by simply buying your own stocks at low no costs i do n't see any reason for going with the index product beyond the convenience

your question is n't great but i will attempt to answer this piece as it seems really the root of your personal finance question i want to convince my wife to make this move because it will save us    at least 800 month but she fails to see how buying a second home is    financially sound because we have to lose our savings and we have to    pay interest on our second home and her logic is it will take almost 5 years to get back our down payment    and we have to pay interest as well so how can this move help our    family financially in the long run is she right she is mostly wrong first consider that there is no roi really on your down payment assuming you are paying what your home would sell for the next day then your rio is already yours minus realtor fees she is talking about cash on hand not roi i will use an example without taking into account risk of home markets going down or other risks to ownership example let 's say you pay $ 2800 a month in mortgage at 5.5 apr and $ 200 a month in on a $ loan $ 400k house in this example let 's say the same house if you were to rent it is $ 3800 a month understand the opportunity cost of renting the marginal amount it costs you to not buy so far your opportunity cost is $ 800 a month the principle of your house will be increasing with each payment in our example it 's about $ 400 for the first payment and will increase with each payment made while decreasing the interest payment suggest you look at an amortization table for your specific mortgage example so you 're real number is now $ 1200 a month opportunity cost consider also the fact that the $ 400 a month is sitting in a savings account of sorts while most savings accounts give you less than 1 in returns and then charge taxes on that gain your home may or may not be much higher than that and wo n't charge you taxes on the gains when you sell it if you live in it for a period of time as defined by the irs let 's assume a conservative long term appreciation rate of 3 that 's $ 12k a year on a $ 400k house so now you 're at $ 2200 a month opportunity cost in this example i did n't touch on your tax savings of ownership i also did n't touch on the maintenance cost of ownership or the maintenance cost of renting your deposit + other fees which all should be considered you may have other costs involved in renting for instance the cost of not being able to fully utilize your rental as your own house this may be an even simpler and more convincing way to explain it on the $ 2800 mortgage example you will be paying around $ 19k in interest and $ 2400 on taxes insurance = $ 23k per year number could be way different in your example that is basically throw away money you 're never getting back on the rental 100 of your rent at $ 3800 a month is throw away money you 're never getting back that 's $ a year

the standard in such moving average crossover systems is the numbers are essentially arbitrary as long as the long term average is greater than the short term and there is some different between the averages in terms of the smoothing they provide i.e. comparing a 74 day ma to a 75 day ma is n't what the system is intended for there are plenty of software programs that will let you run through many possible values for the system over historical data i concur with the other answers in that this system indicator alone is n't very good however i disagree with their blanket off of technical analysis there are many successful traders out there the moving average cross over system is perhaps the second most primitive example of technical strategies categorized as trend following systems buying new recent highs and selling new recent lows being the most simple this particular system is n't very powerful because of its poor use of simple moving averages a simple moving average is intended to smooth out data but smoothing comes at the cost of lagging from the present a simple moving average essentially gives you an smoothing of price action for the day at that is one half of their period ago so your 200 day simple moving average shows you an smoothing of price action 100 days ago a lot can happen in 100 days and that is why this system is far from ideal

the stock market is just like any other market but stocks are bought and sold here just like you buy and sell your electronics at the electronics market this is a place where buyers and sellers come together to buy and sell shares or stocks or equity no matter what you call it what are these shares   a share is nothing but a portion of ownership of a company suppose a company has 100 shares issued to it and you were sold 10 out of those it literally means you are a 10 owner of the company why do companies sell shares companies sell shares to grow or expand suppose a business is manufacturing or producing and selling goods or services that are high in demand the owners would want to take advantage of it and increase the production of his goods or services and in order to increase production he would need money to buy land or equipment or labor etc now either he could go get a loan by something or he could partner with someone who could give him money in exchange for some portion of the ownership of the company this way the owner gets the money to expand his business and make more profit and the lender gets a portion of profit every time the company makes some now if the owner decides to sell shares rather than getting a loan that 's when the stock market comes into the picture why would a person want to trade stocks first of all please remember that stocks were never meant to be traded you always invest in stocks what 's the difference trading is short term and investing is long term in very simple language it 's the greed of humans which led to this concept of trading stocks a person should only buy stocks if he believes in the business the company is doing and sees the potential of growth back to the question a person would want to buy stocks of the company because how does a stock market help society look around you for the answer to this question let me give you a start and i wish everyone reading this post to add at least one point to the answer corporations in general allow many people come together and invest in a business without fear that their investment will cause them undue liability because shareholders are ultimately not liable for the actions of a corporation the cornerstone north american case of how corporations add value is by allowing many investors to have put money towards the railroads that were built across america and canada for the stock market in particular by making it easier to trade shares of a company once the company sells them the number of people able to conveniently invest grows exponentially this means that someone can buy shares in a company without needing to knock door to door in 5 years trying to find someone to sell to participating in the stock market creates liquidity which is essentially the ease with which stocks are converted into cash high liquidity reduces risk overall and it means that those who want risk because high risk often creates high reward can buy shares and those who want low risk because say they are retiring and do n't have a risk appetite anymore can sell shares

hmm very fair point i mean this is theoretically what the earlier stated rule is for but in this case it probably would n't work maybe some sort of blanket exception for small starting businesses as certain places that have $ 15 minimum wages already have also i should note that a teenager would probably be exempt from any such law in the first place as they 're already getting support from their parents and thusly already have a livable wage as it were this is why i mentioned that part earlier regarding part time jobs since people working such jobs already generally have another resource for basic needs   i should note i 'm about to go to bed because it 's midnight where i live that said this has actually been a very enlightening discussion you 've given me a lot to think about i 'll do some further research and if you 'd like to continue this discussion in roughly eight hours that 'd be just fine

i 'm not sure it is the best idea but you can buy only 4 stocks generally   as you alluded to you should take notice of the fees   also note that many stocks trade at significantly lower prices than apple 's per shares so you might want to factor that into your decision   you could probably get a better feel for transactions if you bought say 50 shares of a $ 30 stock then it might be easier to see what it 's like to sell some etc note that specific trading sites might have various limits in place that would pose as barriers to this sort of behavior though

my understanding i 've never filed one myself is that the 1040es is intended to allow you to file quarterly and report unpredictable income and to pay estimated taxes on that income    i was in the same sort of boat for 2016 i had a big unexpected income source in 2015 and this took away my safe harbor for 2016   i adjusted my w-2 to zero exemptions eventually and will be getting a refund of about 1 of our income so lets say you make 10000 in in march and another 15000 in in april   file a quarterly 1040-es between march 31 and april 15   report the income and pay some tax   you should be able to calculate the tax for 10k pretty easily   just assume that it comes off the top and does n't add at all to your deductions   then for april do the same by june 15 just like your w-2 is used to estimate how much your employer should withhold the 1040es is designed to estimate how much extra you need to pay to the irs to avoid penalties   it 'll all get resolved after you file your final 1040 for the 2017 calendar year

warren buffett answered this question very well at the 2009 berkshire hathaway annual meeting   he said that it was important to read everything you can about investing   what you will find is that you will have a number of competing ideas in your head   you will need to think these through and find the best way to solve them that fits you you will mostly learn how to invest through good examples   there are fewer good examples out there than you might think given how many books there are and how many people get paid to give advice in this area   if you want to see how professional investors actually think about specific investments over a thousand investment examples can be found at just login as a guest   the site is run by joel greenblatt you would benefit from reading his books also and it will give you a sense of the work that investors put into their research good luck

i think i have a better answer for this since i have been an investor in the stock markets since a decade and most of my money is either made through investing or trading the financial markets yes you can start investing with as low as 50 gbp or even less if you are talking about stocks there is no restriction on the amount of shares you can purchase the price of which can be as low as a penny i investing in stocks when i was 18 with the money saved from my pocket money which was not much but i made investments on a regular period no matter how less i could but i would make regular investments on a long term remember one thing never trade stock markets always invest in it on a long term the stock markets will give you the best return on a long term as shown on the graph below and will also save you money on commission the broker charge on every transaction the brokers to make money for themselves will ask you to trade stocks on short term but stock market were always made to invest on a long term as warren buffet rightly says and if you want to trade try commodities or forex forex brokers will offer you accounts with as low as 25 usd with no commissions the commission here are all inclusive in spreads   is this true can the average joe become involved yes anyone who wants has an interest in the financial markets can get involved knowledge is the key not money is it worth investing £ 50 here and there or is that a laughable idea 50 gbp is a lot i started with a few indian rupees if people laugh let them laugh only morons who do n't understand the true concept of financial markets laugh there are fees rules involved is it worth the effort if you just want to see the problem with today 's generation of people is that they fear a lot unless you crawl you do nt walk unless you try something you do nt learn the only difference between a successful person and a not successful person is his ability to try fail fall get back on feet again try he succeeds i know its not instant money but i 'd like to get a few shares here and there to follow the news and see how companies do i hear that bric russia india and china is a good share to invest in brazil india the good thing is share prices are relatively low even the commissions mostly roi return on investment on a long term would almost be the same can anyone share their experiences maybe best for community wiki always up for sharing please ask questions no matter how stupid they are i love people who ask for when i started i asked and people were generous enough to answer and so would i be

i feel like this is probably a good thing    but   i 'm not sure it 's going to lower the gender wage gap   for starters women tend to make more than men in their early 20 's so women 's prior salaries are often actually higher than men 's at a certain point in their lives later on of course men tend to make more but you could make the argument that asking about prior salaries actually helps women in their early to mid careers   secondly the gender wage gap for same skills same position is really really narrow so asking prior salaries would only seem to work in instances where the candidate was switching careers which is to say it would n't help narrow the gender wage gap very often   lastly this helps men just as much as women which is a good thing btw and so it 's not really a gender related law   all in all it seems like a good law though hr departments are going to hate it though and i bet they share data anyway and get around it without asking

look into the asset allocations of lifecycle funds offered by a company like vanguard this page allows you to select your current age and find a fund based on that you could pick a fund like the target retirement fund ages 21 25 and examine its allocation in the portfolio management tab for this fund the breakdown is then look at the allocation of the underlying funds that comprise the lifecycle fund in the same tab   look at each of those funds and see what asset allocation they use and that should give you a rough idea for an age based allocation for example the total stock market index fund page has a sector breakdown so if you wanted to get very fine grained with your allocation you could you 're probably much better off investing in the index fund low cost etfs or the lifecycle fund itself however it 'll be much cheaper   doing this for several lifecycle funds should be a good start keep in mind however that these funds are rebalanced as the target date approaches so if you 're following the allocation of some particular funds you 'll have to rebalance as well if you really want an age based allocation that you do n't have to think about invest in a lifecycle fund directly you 'll probably pay a lower expense ratio than if you invested in a whole slew of funds directory and it 's less work for someone who is n't comfortable managing their portfolio themselves furthermore with vanguard the expense ratios are already fairly low   this is only one example of an allocation however your tolerance of risk age etc may affect what allocation you 're willing to accept   full disclosure part of my roth ira is invested in the target fund i used as an example above and another part uses a similar rebalancing strategy to the one i used above but with admiral share funds which have higher minimum investments but lower expense ratios

i believe this argument is most often used when considering which debts to pay back first or when there are other options available such as investment options building up an emergency fund or saving for a large purchase   in that case it 's simply justifying making minimum payments and paying more over the life of the loan in exchange for larger liquidity in the present unfortunately when it comes to choosing between which debts to pay e.g. my mom pays more than the minimum on her car because she ca n't deduct auto loan interest despite her mortgage carrying a higher interest rate it 's only beneficial if the tax savings offsets the interest savings difference the formula for that is tax bracket > 1 target loan interest rate mortgage interest rate that said most people do n't think in the long term either by natural or by necessity need to have an emergency fund

gt you ca n't find anyone else who would pay you more or you would have left that 's a reflection of what you have to offer the world   your comment was thoughtful and this last bit in particular i feel is like something that i 've been wrestling with for a while    it 's a very libertarian view as you probably know it makes a lot of sense to me but i ca n't help to think of some possible flaws and wonder what you think   1 availability of work if somebody has a choice between no job and being grossly underpaid would n't the choice be between having no money and a little money at that point does n't that run the risk of exploitation would n't exploitation be working for less than what you 're worth   2 value unskilled pretty much means replaceable they do n't give a shit if you come or go and vice versa that 's not a reflection of a job 's worth to the company nor is a real reflection of how difficult it is there 's no competition for wages eventually workers get sick of it and leave not expecting improved wages elsewhere but a job they can deal with for 40 hours per week but there are always more people in need to take their place so the company has no incentive to raise wages     like you said it is a reflection of what you have to offer to the world in a sense that your skills are not uncommon however is this everything the world needs unskilled labor to run is there something wrong with being a cashier a a guy who the trucks that carry the things we all use no the world needs these people should people who are needed have jobs that do n't allow for them to meet basic living standards     3 expectation the only reason why most people wo n't work for less than 8 or 9 dollars hr expect reasonable flexibility to balance work and personal life do n't expect to be forced to work more than 8 9 hours per day have weekends off and those working 40 hrs week demand holiday pay sick days access to insurance vacation time is because that 's what people expect out of a job in this day and age none of these things are law i think people used to be treated considerably worse by their employers and likely there will be a time when people will think that the people of our day were stupid for settling for less the labor movement has done much in this regard   gt maybe instead of bitching that you are paid shit wages you should ask why you ever expected to earn more after failing to acquire any skill a teenager could n't master in a week    4 everyone 's solution let 's say everyone learns to do a skilled job who will be left to do the unskilled jobs someone will have to do them some countries have hordes of college educated workers working unskilled jobs because of the high that go to college ok so then leave it to merit does merit always work though what about nepotism personality when it does n't matter for the job age race sex ethnicity think these play any part in the hiring process    if all else fails not everyone can be expected to be a successful entrepreneur   5 life life can throw you some and people make mistakes some tend to pay for them more than others some have talent others do n't some are born with money some not some have a large and caring family others have no family at all     again i 'm not saying these things necessarily invalidate your original point but it 's something to consider your thoughts

i was in a very similar place 10 years ago i was in my mid 20 's with 45 k in combined school + personal business related debt and working in it for not very much i already had 10 15 k in debt when my college loans first came due and it was the first time i really had to come to terms with the hole i had dug myself and i spent weeks at a time obsessing over plans that would help me get out of debt it effected my health and my relationships i felt like i was never going to come out from under it my family was very much lower middle class k household income and i was n't going to get or expect any help there so i went to work and made it a point to make sure every personal and professional decision i made was conducive to my long term goals and before i knew it they became short term goals    find out what your basic monthly need is be brutally honest cut back on things like cable tv i still do n't have it reduce your phone plans borrow things when you do n't have to buy them and send that money to your debt pick up some hobbies that do n't cost much these are all minor sacrifices i got back in to playing the piano and spent a lot of time at the beach in the summer and up on books i 'd always meant to read in the winter    i ran a lot of numbers in a spreadsheet but you can play with the numbers with online loan calculators to put some real numbers behind your goals here is one that i just tried out   you 'll probably be surprised how much effect a little bit of extra towards a loan can make in the long term   put your current college loan details in to it and then see what the effect of an extra 150 a month is i know you 've implied that you really do n't have anything extra each month and that is fine figure out an amount that gets you moving towards your goals and then start working on a way to make it figuring out how to make or squeeze an extra n dollars out of your budget every 30 days is much less daunting than thinking about paying off 50k. you said you are working in it i do n't know where you live but in my city there are lots of decent it related jobs your first goal might need to be to find a better one     if possible move around balances until you 've got interest rates you can deal with and now that you have solid numbers to plan with consider the effect of making smaller goals would you feel as bad if you had half as much debt how about if you got rid of 10 k of debt or just your credit cards   i know i felt a huge relief when i cut my overall debt in half it felt like a huge part of my burden had lifted and it had i could start seeing the end of the tunnel     i think that one of the biggest changes in my life since then has been the way i look at and think about money and debt   i did n't really have to sacrifice much i learned to travel cheaply and whenever i met    a goal i 'd reward myself with a small trip today i have a very low mortgage payment and i pay my full credit balances each month so i have no revolving bad debt    i wish you luck and i know exactly where you are standing right now

perhaps you can track your vat amounts in a liability account   using a tax liability account is a common thing in accounting to do this when you receive money split the transaction such that your actual revenue which you will keep after vat remittance goes into an asset account and the amount you will eventually have to pay back to the state goes into a liability account   later when you pay the vat back to the state your transaction will effectively pay back the liability with one end of your double entry decreasing the funds in your checking account and the other end decreasing the funds in your tax liability account having said that i 've found that there are many shortcomings in the cash flow report and i 'm not sure that using a tax liability account which i think is the right thing to do will necessarily solve this problem for you

if you are concerned about fdic coverage then yes you can spread your money across multiple banks the limit is $ 250k so after you invest in property 4 banks should do it   that having been said in my opinion it would be a waste to keep all this money in a bank 's savings account you will slowly lose value over time due to inflation i suggest you spend a little money on an independent fee based investment advisor choose someone who will teach you about investing in mutual funds so you can feel comfortable with it he or she should take into account your tolerance for risk look at your goals and help you come up with a low cost plan for investing your money   it 's certainly okay to keep the money in a bank short term but do n't wait too long take steps toward putting that money to work for you

many states require that use tax be paid on items purchased out of state and the subsequently brought to your home state the vendor has the responsibility to collect based upon the shipping destination it is the buyers responsibility to declare and pay taxes on purchases where the vendor is not required to collect them for your when you purchase it out of state so if you have an item shipped out of state to avoid sales tax and then bring it to your home state then you are required to pay sales tax in your home state as well   some states florida for 1 allow for the reduction in sales tax owed by the amount paid in out of state sales taxes   some states like ct exempt purchases under a certain amount federation of tax administrators website has links to state revenue services where you can check the tax requirements for your and other states     other state links

gt;you assume that student performance is a good proxy for teacher performance one of the bigger influences on student performance is parent engagement   if the goal is success in actual conveyance of knowledge then external factors are merely the environment in which the performance or lack thereof must be executed   if a teacher is incapable of reaching a particular group of students due to whatever environmental reasons then that teacher is obviously not performing in that environment   it would be best then for everyone including that teacher to get a different teacher in their place and for that teacher then to attempt to teach in a different environment where they may be capable of shining rather than to keep them in an environment where they are failing   a big part of the problem here is that merit is seen by teachers as if it were a judgment of them as people which ironically enough is a rather juvenile mindset when in fact it is merely a judgement of their specific performance in a particular situation   and as far as pay is concerned pay varies in virtually every profession and industry and people move and choose accordingly the seeking of some utopian is woefully naive

good question your assumptions are a bit off track though i am sure you would agree that automation will occur gradually allowing a new workforce that is with relevant skills to support automation tech and operations to bubble up this workforce will drive up consumer spending offsetting your assumption of diminishing consumer spending    the extent to which this new workforce will offset diminishing consumer spending of the being laid off is a matter of debate but one thing is certain consumer spending albeit relatively weaker or stronger will exist and businesses will continue to thrive another possibility is that the workforce getting laid off might be in other sectors of the economy or better yet some companies might re train some of it    the assumption that most of the jobs will be automated does n't necessarily imply that automation leads to job loss some automation will actually drive up productivity which will increase the margin of companies in light of this logic we can assume that employees will be paid more increasing their disposable income     the bottom line is that consumer spending is unlikely to bottom out it might weaken or strengthen for one or two reasons but people will continue consuming and businesses will thrive

a true 0 loan is a losing proposition for the bank that 's true   however when you look at actual 0 loans they usually have some catches there might also be late payment fees prepayment penalties and other clauses that make it a good deal on average to the bank   individual borrowers might be able to get away with free money but the bank does not look to make money on each loan they look to make money on thousands of loans overall for a retailer including new car sellers the actual financing costs will be baked into the sales price   they will add say 10 to the sales price in exchange for an interest free loan they can also sell these loans to an investment bank or other entity but they would be sold at a deep discount so the difference will be made up in the sales price or other fees it 's possible that they would just chalk it up to promotional discounts or customer acquisition costs but it would not be a good practice on a large scale

i 'm assuming the question is about how to compare two etfs that track the same index i 'd look at for etfs ignoring index funds so for example you might compare spy vs ivv spy has about 100x the volume sure ivv has 2 m shares trading so it is liquid enough but the bigger volume on spy might matter to you if you use options open interest is as much as 1000x more on spy even if you have no interest in options the spreads on spy are probably going to be slightly smaller they both have 0.09 expense ratios when i looked on 2010 9 6 spy was trading at a slight discount ivv was at a slight premium looking for any sort of trend is left as an exercise to the reader grab the prospectus for each to examine the rules they set for fund makeup both come from well known issuers and have a decent history rather than crazy uncle ed 's pawn shop or the central bank of so unless you find something in the spy prospectus that makes you the higher volume and equal expense ratios would seem to suggest it over ivv the fact that it is at a tiny discount right now is a tiny bonus

if it is a business loan the borrower would be able to claim a deduction for any interest paid on the loan and the lender would include the interest earned as part of their taxable income you need to be careful on what you do and do n't include as income if the repayments made to you by the borrower in a year is $ 10,000 but only $ 8,000 of that is interest and the other $ 2,000 is part of the principal being returned to the lender then you would only claim $ 8,000 as your income and the borrower would only claim $ 8,000 as a business deduction of course if it is interest only then you and the borrower would use the full $ 10,000

some people have this notion that withdrawing dividends from savings    is somehow okay but withdrawing principal is not   note this notion would someone please explain the mistake on and why it 's a    mistake because there may be times where withdrawing principal may be a good idea as one could sell off something that has gained enough that in re balancing the portfolio there are capital gains that could be used for withdrawing in retirement how and why does the sale of financial instrument equate to the    receipt of dividends   in either case one has cash equivalents that could be withdrawn if you take the dividends in cash or sell a security to raise cash you have cash thus it does n't matter what origin it has if i sell a financial instrument that later    appreciates in value then this profit opportunity is lost in the    case of a dividend i 'd still possess the financial security and    benefit from the stock 's appreciation one could argue that the in the case of a dividend by not buying more of the instrument you are missing out on a profit opportunity as well thus are you out to make the maximum profit overall or do you have reason for taking the cash instead of increasing your holding

from a mathematical expected value standpoint there is no difference between gambling e.g. buying a lottery ticket and investing e.g. buying a share of stock   the former probably has negative expected value while the latter probably has positive expected value but that is not a distinction to include in a definition else every company that gives a bad quarterly earnings report suddenly changes categories however investment professionals have a vested interest in claiming there is a difference that justifies them charging fees to steer you into the right investment   consequently hair splitting ideas like the motive behind a purchase are introduced   the classification of an item to be purchased should not depend on the mental state of its purchaser depending on the situation it may be right to engage in negative ev behavior   for example if you have $ 1000 and need $ 2000 by next week or else you ca n't have an operation and you will die and you ca n't find anyone to give you a loan   your optimal strategy is to gamble your $ 1000 at the best odds you can get with a possible outcome of $ 2000   so even if you only have a 1/3 chance of winning and getting that operation it 's still the right bet if you ca n't find a better one

i assume that whatever you 're holding has lost a considerable amount of its value then what sort of instrument are we talking about if the margin call is 14k on something you borrowed against the you 're a bit more leveraged than just another 100 the trading company you 're using should be able to tell you exactly what happens if you ca n't cover the margin call but my hunch is that selling and taking the cash out ceased to be an option roughly at the time they issued the margin call being labelled as a day trader or not most likely did not have anything to do with that margin call they 're normally issued when one or more of your leveraged trades tank and you do n't have enough money in the account to cover the shortfall not trying to sound but the fact that you needed to ask this question suggests to me that you should n't have traded with borrowed money in the first place

so you are paying taxes on your contributions regardless the timing    is just different i am failing to see why would a person get an ira instead of just    putting the same amount of money into a mutual fund like vanguard or    something like that what am i missing you are failing to consider the time value of money getting $ 1 now is more valuable to you than a promise to get $ 1 in a year even though the nominal amount is the same with a certain amount of principal now you can invest it and it will likely grow into a bigger amount of money principal + earnings at a later time and we can consider the two to have approximately equivalent value the principal now has the same value as the principal + earnings later with pre tax money in traditional ira the principal + earnings are taxed once at the time of withdrawal assuming the same flat rate of tax at contribution and withdrawal this is equivalent to roth ira where the principal is taxed at the time of contribution because the principal now has the same value as the principal + earnings later so the same rate of tax on the two have the same value of tax even though when you look at nominal amounts it might seem you are paying a lot less tax with roth ira since the earnings are never taxed with actual numbers if we take a $ 1000 pre tax contribution to traditional ira it grows at 5 for 10 years and a 25 flat rate tax we are left with $ 1000 1.05 ^ 10 0.75 = $ with the same $ 1000 pre tax contribution so after 25 tax it 's a $ 750 after tax contribution to a roth ira growing at the same 5 for 10 years and no tax at withdrawal we are left with $ 1000 0.75 1.05 ^ 10 = $ you can see they are equivalent even though the nominal amount of tax is different the lower amount of tax paid now is equivalent to the bigger amount of tax later with a taxable investment which you will not buy and sell until you take it out you contribute with after tax money and when you take it out the earnings portion is subject to capital gains tax but remember that the principal + earnings later is equivalent to the principal now which is already all taxed once and if we tax the earnings portion later that is effectively taxing a portion of the money again another way to look at it is the contribution is just like the roth ira but the withdrawal is worse because you have to pay capital gains tax instead of no tax you can take the same numbers as for the roth ira $ 1000 0.75 1.05 ^ 10 = $ but where the $ $ 750 = $ is earnings and is taxed again at say a 15 capital gains rate so you lose another $ in tax and are left with $ you would need a capital gains tax rate of 0 to match the advantage of the pre tax traditional ira or roth ira after tax money in traditional ira has a similar problem the contribution is after tax but after it grows into principal + earnings the earnings part is taxed again except it is worse than the capital gains case because it is taxed as regular income like above you can take the same numbers as for the roth ira $ 1000 0.75 1.05 ^ 10 = $ but where the $ earnings is taxed again at 25 so you lose another $ in tax and are left with $ so although the nominal amount of tax paid is the same as for pre tax money in traditional ira it ends up being a lot worse everything i said above about pre tax money in traditional ira after tax money in traditional ira and roth ira also applies to pre tax money in traditional 401(k after tax money in traditional 401(k and roth 401(k respectively regarding the question you raise in the title of your question why someone would get contribute to a traditional ira if they already have a 401(k the answer is mostly they would n't first note that if you merely have a 401(k account but neither you nor your employer contributes to it during the year then that does n't prevent you from deducting traditional ira contributions for that year so basically you can contribute to one or the other so if you only want to contribute below the ira contribution limit and do n't need the bigger 401(k contribution limit and the ira 's investment options are more attractive to you than your 401(k 's then it might make sense for you to contribute to only traditional ira if you or your employer is already contributing to your 401(k during the year then you can not deduct your traditional ira contributions unless your income is very low and if your income is really that low you are in such a low tax bracket that roth ira may be more advantageous for you if you make a traditional ira contribution but can not deduct it it is a non deductible traditional ira contribution i.e. it becomes after tax money in a traditional ira which as i showed in the section above has much worse tax situation in the long run because its earnings are pre tax and thus taxed again however there is one good use for non deductible traditional ira contributions and that is as one step in a backdoor roth ira contribution basically there is an income limit for being able to make roth ira contributions but there is no income limit for being able to make traditional ira contributions or for being able to convert money from traditional ira to roth ira so what you can do is make a non deductible traditional ira contribution and then immediately convert it to roth ira and if you did not previously have any pre tax money in traditional iras this achieves the same as a regular roth ira contribution with the same tax treatment but you can do it at any income level

the folks who hold stock are the legal owners of the company if a majority of stock holders become unhappy with the management of a company they can fire the executives and put in new management or they can direct the company to close its doors and sell off its assets as a crude approximation the stock holders are happier when the stock price goes up and when it goes down therefore executives are highly motivated to drive the stock price up   a frequent criticism of corporate is that management can be so motivated to drive the stock price up that they will take actions that drive the stock price up in the current year even if undercuts the company in the long term

no the above calculation does not hold good when financial statements are prepared they are prepared on a going concern basis i.e. a business will run normally in the foreseeable future valuation of assets and liabilities is done according to this principle when a bankruptcy takes places or a business closes down immediately the valuation method will change for assets the value will be more relevant for example if you hold 100 computers in an normal situation they will depreciated at the normal rate every year some portion of the cost is written off as depreciation when you actually go to sell these computers you are likely to realize much less than what is shown in the statement similarly for a building the actual value may be more for liabilities they tend to increase in such situation hence just a plain computation can give you a very broad idea but the actual figure may be different

in the united states if the person insures an article and then claims a loss of that article the insurance replaces the missing destroyed article if later on the item is found the original is owned by the insurance company the person who purchased the policy does n't get to keep both   of course if the item was so valuable to be priceless the insurance company would be open to an exchange of items or money   but if they suspect fraud then it becomes a legal matter even when a life is n't involved it can be a source of dispute insured v. insurer when stolen art is recovered who owns it kenneth s. levine   this essay is about the word which frequently appears    in insurance policies an insured painting is stolen and the insurance    company pays the owner ’s claim for the value of the painting many    years later when the painting is recovered its value is many times    what it was when the insurance claim was paid the insurance company    takes the position that it owns the painting while the owner says i    own the painting less the value of the insurance proceeds received    the resolution of this dispute depends on the meaning of the word    in the insurance policy when life insurance is involved the item being replace is the lost stream of income the question of returning money and how much would be a legal issue they would also want to know if there was fraud and who was involved

gt;are you saying they did commit fraud but it 's hard too pin on any one person you say there is little evidence there was fraud but that it 's too hard to prove there was fraud so what did they do if it was n't fraud   i am saying both i am saying that as a general matter criminal fraud is difficult to prove and expensive to litigate fraud requires intent you have to know or reasonably know that what you are doing is fraudulent and you do it anyway proving that mens rea is extremely difficult in this situation risky does not mean fraudulent the entire market was bundling mortgage backed securities fannie mae and freddie mac government backed entities were the largest buyers of mbs   the point is that if the banks honestly believed that they mbs were secure and the regulators at the time did not see a problem with them then how can you prove criminal fraud we are only displaying hindsight bias because the subprime market did indeed implode and it did affect the wider mortgage market and the economy but it was n't known that would happen at the time no financial models projected that everything would fail   you can blame lack of foresight or whatever but risky losses is not criminal corporations are allowed the business judgment rule which is arguably the strongest presumption in all of law there were bad models but they were n't fraudulent    now there could have been fraud in certain circumstances but in no way was it systematic it was bad modeling and bad economics   again bernanke has multiple bernanke saying there was no problem how can the bank 's actions be fraudulent when the top regulator is saying nothing is wrong and the market is working as intended

my super fund and i would say many other funds give you one free switch of strategies per year   some suggest you should change from high growth option to a more balance option once you are say about 10 to 15 years from retirement and then change to a more capital guaranteed option a few years from retirement this is a more passive approach and has benefits as well as disadvantages the benefit is that there is not much work involved you just change your investment option based on your life stage 2 to 3 times during your lifetime this allows you to take more risk when you are young to aim for higher returns take a balanced approach with moderate risk and returns during the middle part of your working life and take less risk with lower returns above inflation during the latter part of your working life a possible disadvantage of this strategy is you may be in the higher higher growth option during a market correction and then change to a more balanced option just when the market starts to pick up again so your funds will be hit with large losses whilst the market is in retreat and just when things look to be getting better you change to a more balanced portfolio and miss out on the big gains a second more active approach would be to track the market and change investment option as the market changes one approach which should n't take much time is to track the index such as the asx200 if you investment option is mainly invested in the australian stock market with a 200 day simple moving average sma the concept is that if the index crosses above the 200 day sma the market is bullish and if it crosses below it is bearish see the chart below   this strategy will work well when the market is trending up or down but not very well when the market is going sideways as you will be changing from aggressive to balanced and back too often possibly a more appropriate option would be a combination of the two use the first passive approach to change investment option from aggressive to balanced to capital guaranteed with your life stages however use the second active approach to time the change for example if you were say in your late 40s now and were looking to change from aggressive to balanced in the near future you could wait until the asx200 crosses below the 200 day sma before making the change this way you could capture the majority of the uptrend which could go on for years before changing from the high growth aggressive option to the balanced option if you where after more control over your superannuation assets another option open to you is to start a smsf however i would recommend having at least $ 300 k to $ 400 k in assets before starting a smsf or else the annual costs would be too high as a percentage of your total super assets

i argued for a 15 rule of thumb here saving for retirement how much is enough though if you 'll let me i 'd refine the argument to use a rule of thumb to set your minimum savings then use monte carlo to stress test and look at any special circumstances and make a case to save more you 're right that the rule of thumb in tons of assumptions great list btw a typical scenario could include if any of those big assumptions do n't apply to you or you do n't want to rely on them you 'd have to re evaluate it sounds like you 're assuming 4 5 investment returns as you say that 's probably the big difference 4 5 is lower than most would assume 6 7 real return is maybe a middle of the road assumption and 8 is maybe an unrealistic one many of the assumptions you list such as married kids cost of living spouse 's income paying for college can maybe be bundled up into one assumption percentage of income you will spend set a percentage budget and as you go along stay within your means by sacrificing as required also smooth out income across layoffs and things by having an emergency fund by staying on budget as you go you can remove some of the the reason i think the rule of thumb is still good despite the assumptions is that i do n't think a more accurate number based on a lot of unpredictable guesses is really better and it may even be harmful if you use it to justify saving less or even if you use it to save far too much see also many most important assumptions are not predictable investment returns health care inflation personal health lifestyle creep changing spending needs desires irrational investment behavior i agree with you that for many scenarios and people 15 will not be enough though it 's a whole lot more than most save already in particular low investment returns over your time horizon will make 15 insufficient and some argue that low investment returns over the coming 30 years are likely without a doubt 20 or more is safer than 15 do consider that saving enough is not a binary thing if you save only 15 and it turns out that does n't completely replace your income it 's not like you 're out on the street you might have to retire a few years later or downsize your house or something but perhaps that is n't a catastrophe there 's a very personal question about how much to sacrifice now for less risk of sacrifice in the future maybe i 'd better qualify not a binary thing some savings rates certainly anything less than 10 make major sacrifices pretty likely so in that sense there is a binary distinction between plausible plan and denial also precise assumptions and calculations get a lot more useful as you approach retirement age you can pretty much answer the question is it reasonable to retire right now or could i retire in 5 years though with a retirement that could last 30 years plenty of unknowns will remain even then i think at age 20 or 30 though just saving 15 20 if you 're conservative and not spending too much time on a speculative analysis would be a sound decision that 's why i like the rule of thumb analysis paralysis saving nothing or near nothing is the real danger early in one 's career any plausible percentage is fine as long as you save as your life and you see what happens you can refine and correct adjusting your savings rate moving your retirement age around spending a little less or more the important thing earlier in life is to just get in the right ballpark

the reason on line savings accounts ally capitalone american express and many others provide much higher rates than brick and mortar banks is because they 're not brick and mortar they do not need to pay for a huge amount of real estate utilities public facing employees inter office mail security etc etc all that allows them to pay more for your money the back office of these banks is the same as that of chase boa or wells fargo its just that they do n't have the enormous expense of having a branch in every neighborhood while still reaching all the same population of depositors so no its not a scam these are reputable banks some have physical offices for example i know that capitalone has some branches in new york some do n't iirc neither ally nor american express federal saving bank have physical branches but they 're banks nonetheless insured as required by fdic or ncua in case of credit unions and provide all the same services for less or all the same savings for more if you will imho giving 0.01 apr is a scam not the other way around the old style banks want your money for free and you 're worried why would someone else treat you better well that 's why the us has one of the most retarded financial systems in the western world

in my opinion it depends on the type of product i would get a warranty for a washing machine or tumble dryer or other product with lots of moving parts that is liable to break down i also take into account my luck the one washing machine i did n't get covered broke down 2 weeks outside the normal warranty period i would not get a warranty for a consumer electronics product like a tv pc or ipod because they devalue so quickly as a rule of thumb if the model you buy today is going to be on sale for the next few years for around the same price and has moving parts it is worth considering a warranty if it will be worth a small percentage of its value because newer faster models come along to replace it do n't bother i would also not get the warranty from the shop i bought the product from you can get warranties for consumer products from specialist third parties that will allow you to cover multiple products for a discount these work out a lot cheaper than the one the shop will give you for example in the uk will cover 3 appliances for £ and 6 for £

you 're not missing any concepts it sounds like you are contributing a piece of collateral to the business and you want to know a fair way to value how much this contribution of collateral is worth technically the economic answer would be the difference in interest between a secured loan and an unsecured loan   so for example suppose that the business could get a loan at 17 without the collateral maybe just on a credit card but with the duplex as collateral it is able to get the loan at 10.5 in principle the value of this collateral is 17 10.5 or 6.5 because it has allowed the business to pay 6.5 less interest on its loan

there is more than one kind of tax it is a little confusing because in reality the tax revenues collected by the government are n't earmarked to a particular usage based on where they came from usually well the gov't often claims they do but for all practical matters it all goes in a big bucket so just because a business or individual is n't paying income taxes does n't mean they are n't paying anything for the use of government furnished infrastructure services you are limiting the scope of your question to income taxes which are taxes paid on profits to a business or individual it makes perfect sense that you would n't pay a tax on something you did n't get however you are n't considering taxes that are being paid even by a company that is n't profitable for example consumption taxes employment taxes and other fees that same company paid sales tax on all the supplies it purchased and probably collected paid sales taxes on anything it sold to take one of your examples it paid for its share of using the roads through government imposed taxes on fuel   do n't worry about the government they know how to get theirs they might not pull it from your right pocket but they will make sure to get it from the left

i agree with the answers above would just like to make a couple of additional points it 's a good and simple strategy to try it out with a small amount as suggested by @joetaxpayer it 's also generally safe to assert that card issuers currently do n't receive or actively look at itemized transaction details but that does not mean they can not in the future some stores utilize level 3 data processing which tells the card issuers exactly what you bought in a transaction an example of level 3 data being utilized to reject rewards is with discover which announced a 10 cashback reward for any transactions made with apple pay last year it later introduced an additional term to exclude gift card purchases and this has been verified to be effective no more reward on gift card purchases of cashback on existing gift card transactions as far as i know amex does receive and look at some level 3 data that does not necessarily mean they will claw back your cashback after initially rewarding the 6 but it might show up if you ever trigger an account review and be used as evidence of your abuse of the program which btw is defined rather there has been many cases of account because of this card issuers are also trying to do a better job preventing abuses by proactively setting caps on rewards as opposed to closing those accounts afterwards and taking the rewards away altogether given the trend in recent years i have to speculate that at some point the card issuers would put clear language in the terms against gift card purchase and enforce it effectively if they have n't already this reward game is constantly changing it 's good while it lasts just be prepared and do n't get surprised when things go south

a bit strange but okay   the way i would think about this is again that you need to determine for what purpose you 're computing this in much the same way you would if you were to build out the model the ipo valuation is not going to be relevant to the accretion dilution analysis unless you 're trying to determine whether the transaction was net accretive at exit but that 's a weird analysis to do for longer holding periods like that you 're more likely to look at irr not eps eps is something investors look at over the short to medium term to get a sense of whether the company is making good acquisition decisions and to do that short to medium term analysis they look at earnings    damodaran would say this is a shitty way of looking at things and that you should probably be looking at some measure of instead and i tend to agree but i do n't get paid to think like an investor i get paid to sell shit to them if only in indirect fashion the short answer to your question is that no you should not incorporate what you are calling liquidation value when determining accretion dilution but only because the market typically computes accretion dilution on a 3-year basis tops i 've never put together a book or seen a press release in my admittedly short time in finance that says the transaction is estimated to be x% accretive within 4 years that just seems like an absurd timeline   final point is just that from an accounting perspective a gain on a sale of an asset is not going to get booked in either ebitda or so just mechanically there 's no way for the ipo value to flow into your accretion dilution analysis there even if you are looking at ebitda shares you could figure the gain on sale into some kind of adjusted ebitda shares version of eps but this is neither something i 've ever seen nor something that really makes sense in the context of using eps as a standardized metric across the market typically we take out non recurring shit in eps we do n't add it in adding something like this in would be much more appropriate to measuring the success of an acquisition investing vehicle like a private equity fund not a standalone operating company that reports operational earnings in addition to cash flow from investing and as i suggest above that 's an analysis for which the irr metric is more ideally situated   and just a semantic thing we typically would n't call the exit value a liquidation value that term is usually reserved for dissolution of a corporate entity and selling off its physical or intangible assets in piecemeal fashion i.e. not accounting for operational synergies across the business ipo value is actually just going to be a measure of market value of equity

simply put for a mortgage interest is charged only on the balance as well think of it this way on a $ 100 k 6 loan on day one 1/2 is $ 500 and the payment is just under $ 600 so barely $ 100 goes to principal but the last payment of $ 600 is nearly all principal   by the way you are welcome to make extra principal payments along with the payment due each month an extra $ in this example paid each and every month will drop the term to just 15 years think about that 40 higher payment all attacking the principal and you cut the term by 1/2 the time

i think your approach of looking exclusively at usd deposits is a prudent one here are my responses to your questions 1 it is highly unlikely that a usd deposit abroad be converted to local currency upon withdrawal the reason for offering a deposit in a particular currency in the first place is that the bank wants to attract funds in this currency 2 interest rate is a function of various risks mostly supply and demand central bank policy perceived risk etc in recent years low interest rate policy as led by u.s. european and japanese central banks has led particularly low yields in certain countries disregarding their level of risk which can vary substantially thus e.g. eastern europe has very low yields at the moment in spite of its perceived higher risk some countries offer depository insurance   3 i would focus on banks which are among the largest in the country and boast good corporate governance i.e. their ownership is clean and transparent and they are true to their business purpose thus ownership is key then come financials country depository insurance low external threat low war risk is also important most banks require a personal visit in order to open the account thus i would n't split much further than 2 3 banks assuming these are good quality

again you 're welcome   it 's also important to note it really can not be is that the taxes that were increased were are virtually all the regressive ones   the rate of fica taxation for example on rents interest and other capital gains i.e. non payroll income were initially 0 then later became 0 and currently are 0   meanwhile the fica rate on average amp median payroll wages salaries of workers and mid level managers etc increased from 1 to 15 that 's a increase or put another way it is an increase of 1,500 during less than a single working career the cost of absolutely nothing else in the history of our society increased at anything like that rate not even education and health care costs nor even housing at the peak of the bubble and in actuality just about everything else including the notorious gasoline sold by those evil petroleum companies actually decreased during the same time frame   and then during virtually the same time period those other taxes increased in a similar if less egregious fashion for example in my state there was no sales tax at all circa 1950   a bit over a decade later when it was first instituted it was initially set at 3 but applied only to a select category of goods subsequently the rate was increased to 4 then 5 then with the addition of various county and municipal sales taxes to 6 and higher and more critically the goods and services that are subject to the tax has increased as well many of them already with hidden buried excise taxes so a large portion of the sales tax is actually a tax on a tax   when you realize that as wealth increases the average expenditure on taxable goods tends does not tend increase in anything like a directly proportional manner i.e. while a person making $ 50k a year may pay more than 2x the total sales tax than someone making $ 25k a year simply because a big part of the $ 25k a year goes to basic necessities of food rent etc and it is even possible that the person making $ 100k a year pays a simple 2x in sales tax of the $ 50k person but the $ 1 m a year is highly unlikely to be paying 10x the sales tax as the $ 100k a year person then you begin to realize the way that the regressive form of those taxes work basically the middle class and preventing it from reaching upper middle class status   now to be blatantly it is not simply a matter of blaming the rich because the lion 's share of those taxes were and are being used to redistribute money to an ever increasing number of non working people either retirees or disabled former workers etc the vast majority of which were things demanded by the general population   hence the reality   the means that the rich elites have used to milk amp the system may be indirectly linked to those taxes but in general are actually much more likely to be based on other things access to leverage credit amp the socialization of bad bets losses avoidance of wages and emphasis on capital gains etc   does n't mean the elites wealthy gaming scamming the system indeed many of them are but at least a significant part of the blame for the burdensome tax system lies with the people themselves   as another example of the same thing take healthcare insurance people want their insurance to not only cover the rare large expenses cancer treatment major accident trauma etc but also to cover their annual checkups etc and then are shocked shocked i say when their insurance premiums go up   well what do people expect if virtually everyone goes for an annual checkup and that checkup costs per policy are say $ 300 a year then how can premiums not go up by approximately $ 300 + administration costs   did they expect the money to pay those things to magically appear out of nowhere   seriously you demand something and eventually one way or another you are going to pay for it     so in your father and they were able to support a larger family in no small part because they were not paying for all of those safety net things   in addition for what little safety net did exist at the time the people collecting on it were tiny versus the larger working paying history i.e. in 1940 each retiree on social security was supported by nearly 160 workers by 1950 the ratio was a tenth of that 1 retiree supported by 16 workers by 1965 it was a quarter of that of the 1940 ratio 1 retiree to 4 workers and currently 2009 it is a 1 to 3 ratio and set to get a lot worse as the baby boomer bulge retires en masse in the coming   so basically your single income job still is supporting a large family you just are n't supporting them directly any more instead you pay the government and they get checks from the government and the family you are supporting is probably not biologically related to you i.e. they are someone else 's kids parents etc   and then just as importantly since you are no longer directly supporting a large family you have essentially zero control over the of how the money gets spent whereas your father and grandfather did get to decide instead the monies are being tossed as entitlements to the recipients who since they have been told and certainly want to believe that they are just getting what they are due do n't feel that anyone has any right to tell them how to spend it   sorta like as if when your father and grandfather were working as if their wife and each of their kids as well as great grandpa joe in the back bedroom and maybe the disabled neighbor dave was legally granted a government mandated allowance of 1/10th of your dad 's paycheck and instead of your dad getting his full paycheck the government required his employer to cut several paychecks paying those allowances directly to the wife kids whose checks would go directly to their schools grandpa joe neighbor dave etc and they other than the kids were then able to spend it on whatever they wanted and your dad would n't have been able to say boo about it   because when it comes right down to it that 's what has happened there 's just multiple layers of official bureaucratic obfuscation in the middle that hide the transfers under various

i would think that a lot of brokers would put the restriction suggested in in place or something more restrictive so that 's the first line of answer if you did get assigned on your short option then i think the t+3 settlement rules would matter for you   basically you have 3 days to deliver   you 'll get a note from your broker demanding that you provide the stock and probably threatening to liquidate assets in your account to cover their costs if you do n't comply   if you still have the long leg of the calendar spread then you can obtain the stock by exercising your long call or if you have sufficient funds available you can just buy the stock and keep your long call   if you 're planning to exercise the long call to cover the position then you need to check with your broker to see how quickly the stock so obtained will get credited to your account since it also has some settlement timeline   it 's possible that you may not be able to get the stock quickly enough especially if you act on day 3 note that this is why you must buy the call with the far date   it is your insurance against a big move against you and getting assigned on your short call at a price that you can not cover with the ira you have some additional concerns over regular cash account namely you can not freely contribute new cash any time that you want   that means that you have to have some coherent strategy in place here that ensures you can cover your obligations no matter what scenario   usually brokers put additional restrictions on trades within iras just for this reason finally in the cash account and assuming that you are assigned on your short call you could potentially could get hit with a good faith cash liquidation or free riding violation when your short call is assigned depending on how you deliver the stock and other things that you 're doing in the same account   there are other questions on that on this site and lots of information online   the rules are n't super simple so i wo n't try to reproduce them here   some related questions to those rules an external reference also on potential violations in a cash account

first you should diversify your portfolio   if your entire portfolio is in the roth ira then you should eventually diversify that   however if you have an ira and a 401k then it 's perfectly fine for the ira to be in a single fund   for example i used my ira to buy a riskier reit that my 401k does n't support    second if you only have a small amount currently invested e.g. $ 5500 it may make sense to put everything in a single fund until you have enough to get past the low balance fees   it 's not uncommon for funds to charge lower fees to someone who has $ 8000 $ 10,000 or $ 12,000 invested   note that if you deposit $ 10,000 and the fund loses money they 'll usually charge you the rate for less than $ 10,000   so try to exceed the minimum with a decent cushion    a balanced fund may make sense as a first fund   that way they handle the diversification for you   a targeted fund is a special kind of balanced fund that changes the balance over time   some have reported that targeted funds charge higher fees   commissions on those higher fees may explain why your bank wants you to buy    i personally do n't like the asset mixes that i 've seen from targeted funds   they often change the stock bond ratio which is not really correct   the stock bond ratio should stay the same   it 's the securities stocks and bonds to monetary equivalents that should change and that only starting five to ten years before retirement   prior to that the only reason to put money into monetary equivalents is to provide time to pick the right securities fund   retirees should maintain about a five year cushion in monetary equivalents so as not to be forced to sell into a bad market    long term i 'd prefer low load index funds   a bond fund and two or three stock funds   you might want to build your balance first though   it does n't really make sense to have a separate fund until you have enough money to get the best fees   70 75 stocks and 25 30 bonds should add to 100 e.g. 73 and 27   balance annually when you make your new deposit

i usually would not say this but if you can just put down 20 i would do that and get a 15 year mortgage   the rates are so low on 15 year mortgage that you should be able to make more than the 3 in the market per year and make some money   i would n't be surprised if for 1/2 of the term of your loan you will be able to make that just in interest   basically i have done this for my house and my rental properties   so i have put my money where my mouth is on this    i have made over 9 each of the last three years which has made me $ 12,000 dollars above and beyond over what i would have paid in interest per year   so it a decision that net me $ 36,000 for doing nothing   now the market is going to be down some of those years so lets see how it works out but i have history on my side   its not about timing the market its about time in the market   and 15 years in the market is a pretty safe bet albeit not as safe as just dumping you money in the mortgage

disallowed losses due to the wash sale rule are added to the basis of the repurchased shares   in your example on day two you paid $ per share then the disallowed $ 0.30 loss from the previous day gets added to the basis making your total basis $ 1.00 per share when you sell at the end of the day for $ 1.00 per share your net gain loss is zero furthermore you can recapture disallowed losses by selling the last lot of abc completely yourself of all holdings in abc for at least 31 days even if that last lot was a loss when taking into account the increased basis from previously disallowed wash sale losses you can claim the loss fully on this last non wash sale

@joetaxpayer gave a great response to your first question here are some thoughts on the other two 2 transaction fees for mutual funds are tied to the class of shares you 're buying and will be the same no matter where you buy them a shares have a front end load the fee charged and the lowest expenses and can be liquidated without any fees b shares have no up front load but come with a 4 7 year period where they will charge you a fee to liquidate technically called contingent deferred sales charge and slightly higher management fees after which they often will convert to a shares c shares have the highest management fees and usually a to 18-month period where they will charge a small percentage fee if you liquidate there are lots of other share classes available but they are tied to special accounts such as managed accounts and 401-k plans not all companies offer all share classes c shares are intended for shorter timeframes eg 2 5 years a and b shares work best for longer times use a b share if you 're sure you wo n't need to take the money out until after the fee period ends most fund companies will allow you to exchange funds within the same fund family without charging the edit no load funds do n't charge a fee in or out usually they are a great option if they are available to you most self service brokerages offer them few full service brokerages offer them the advantage of a brokerage versus personal accounts at each fund is the brokerage gives you a single view of things and a single statement and buying and selling is easy and convenient 3 high turnover rates in bond funds depending on how actively the portfolio is managed the fund company may deliver returns as a mix of both interest and capital gains and the management expenses may be high with a lot of churn in the underlying portfolio bond values fall as interest rates rise so at least in the usa be prepared to see the share values of the fund fall in the next few years the biggest risk of a bond fund is that there is no maturity date so there is no point in time that you have an assurance that your original investment will be returned to you

in the united states a jumbo loan is one in which the loan amounts exceeds a set value for much of the us it is currently $ but it is higher in some areas it is set by the us government and is adjusted each year   if you are trying to avoid the jumbo designation then putting more down makes that possible generally the jumbo loans have a higher rate my credit union does allow jumbo loans with less than 20 down but i am not sure if they are in the majority or the minority regarding down payment requirements keep in mind that once the house price goes above or $ you will be putting down more than 20 to avoid the jumbo designation

there is no difference in safety form the perspective of the bank failing due to fdic ncua insurance   however there is a practical issue that should be considered if you allow payments to be automatically withdrawn from your checking account   in the case of an error all of you money may be unavailable until the error is resolved which could be days or weeks   by having two accounts this possibility may be reduced   it is n't a difference between checking and savings but a benefit of having two accounts note that if both accounts are at the same bank hey make take money from other accounts to cover the shortfall that said i 've done this for years and have never had a problem   also i have two accounts one at a local credit union with just enough kept in it to cover any payments and another online account that has the rest of my savings   i can easily transfer funds between the two accounts in a couple days

this is somewhat of a non answer but i 'm not sure you 'll ever find a satisfying answer to this question because the premises on which the question is based on are flawed   money itself does not exist physically at least not in the same sense that a product you buy does it simply does not make sense to say that you physically own money you can build a product out of but you can not build a money out of if you could then you could print your own money actually you can try to print your own money but nobody would knowingly accept it and thus is it functionally to real money the paper has no intrinsic value its value is derived from the fact that other people perceive it as valuable and nowhere else ergo paper money is no different than electronic money it is for this reason that if i were you i would be okay with online forex trading

the price earnings ratio is calculated as the market value per share divided by the earnings per share over the past 12 months in your example you state that the company earned $ 0.35 over the past quarter that is insufficient to calculate the price earnings ratio and probably why the pe is just given as 20 so if you have the formula correctly the calculation given the numbers in your example would be 0.35 4 20 = $ as to i 'm not sure your pe is correct according to yahoo the pe for is at the time of writing not using the formula above this would lead to 2.3 4 = $ that stock has a 52-week high of $ so $ is not unrealistic i 'm more than a little dubious of the validity of that formula however and urge you not to base your investing decisions on it

sounds like you have a in your ear the coinage act does n't restrict you from using foreign currency or lawful commodity or service to fulfill a debt you are free to do that whenever you enter into an explicit or implicit contract with another party if that was n't the case your kid trading his bag of chips for a bag of cookies at lunch would be a criminal act   it does mean that you ultimately must accept us currency to settle a debt following the previous example if your kid gives his friend the bag of chips but the cookies get destroyed somehow before being transferred the friend can offer a couple of dollars to complete the transaction the whole point of the coinage acts is to set a level playing field if you do n't pick one dominant store of value you have a situation where it is impossible to evaluate the cost of goods and services it has nothing to do with some competition with foreign currency a robust modern economy requires an adequate supply of capital and a common reference point for value within the economy think about it further with respect to article 1 section 10 of the constitution would you want a fiscally profligate state like california or new york to be able to print money and compel you as a contractor employee or creditor to accept their scrip as payment or worse require payment in gold or vermont issued dollars but pay you in their money of course not that 's why the federal government controls the currency and a dollar in alaska is the same as a dollar in georgia

overall i think it sounds like it 's worth it it 's hard to find that high of a rate on a checking account these days   it looks like you 're looking at this bank and i can see they have a few more requirements that seem a little tedious if you do n't do these things every month then you lose the great interest rate if you can think of an easy way to jump through these hoops and not forget then it 's probably worth it for example if you routinely eat out for lunch or buy a morning coffee you can use that card to pay for it set yourself a recurring reminder in your calendar or smartphone to remind you to login to the online banking site ultimately since this is an emergency fund it 's a good idea to keep it nice and liquid in a checking account you 're not likely going to find many other options that will give you a better and safe return and still keep your funds available for when you need them in summary it sounds like a good idea to me so long as you think you can reliably jump through their hoops

paying down your mortgage now will decrease the total cost of your home loan and the time period for which your loan lasts even if you trade up in that time period you will be that much closer to being free of house payments owning your home outright gives you a significant amount of freedom to consider less lucrative and more personally fulfilling career especially if your work environment becomes unpleasant it can also help you weather the storm of a job loss more easily though you should also build an emergency fund homes are depreciating illiquid assets with significant transaction fees it is wise to get a starter home that meets your current needs and move up to a home that better meets your needs as you mature however getting on the status treadmill and buying large homes that generally exceed the utility that you get out of them is expensive a poor investment and often impairs the ability to generate long term wealth

a reason that the wealth has never and will never trickle down is because as society goes on the wealth transfer only happens between upper tiers of society   it used to be that the rich would spend their money and many people would benefit from it in a society small business owners were pretty much all their were and the only people who had monopolies were the rail and oil lines   as time went on more major organizations up for news food computers etc now wealth transfers only between the top tiers and the lower tiers only get the crumbs the higher tier chooses to pay them which is significantly less than they used to whereas employees used to cost a reasonable value to a company they are now almost entirely expendable assets exceptions made for certain portions of history   i am of the opinion that much like history the cycle is going to repeat shortly the occupy wall street being a precursor to another wage fight between the rich and poor with the dissemination of knowledge being much easier more people are getting the general idea that they 're getting shafted they want to be rich although not necessarily because the rich are wealthy they simply want to be able to increase their class mobility that 's been dying a slow death for the past 20 years and quite by the bank bail out   it 's unfortunate a sizable portion of the population actually sides with the 1 of people actively preventing them from moving up gaining more mobility and improving the quality of their life i sincerely hope that at some point in the near future people realize this before the lower class goes and starts busting heads

you probably know that the answer is it depends   if this is truly a pin money type of operation then perhaps sole trader is for you i to using a limited company for two reasons one optimistic and one pessimistic   you are looking at a business to make some money with your talents   if your business takes off it 's much easier to expand a ltd than a sole trader getting credit dealing with suppliers hiring people all much easier   and if things go well you will be expanding    the negative reason is that as a sole trader   you have unlimited liability for the debts of your enterprise if you get sued say your line makes someone 's face into a rash you are on the hook for the whole amount you do n't want to your family if it goes bad being a limited company protects you from that i can tell you that the overhead of running a small ltd is pretty light so long as you are meticulous about your record keeping i had an ltd with two under my feet and it was perfectly doable to handle the paperwork

a key principle of economics is sunk costs are irrelevant you bought the stock at 147 and it has now fallen to 144 that 's too bad this has nothing to do with whether it is wise or foolish to buy shares at 144 the only relevant thing to consider is do i expect the stock to go up or down from 144 you have lost $ 3 per share on the original buy buying more shares will not reduce your loss in any way suppose you bought 100 shares at 147 the price then drops to 144 you have lost $ 3 per share or $ 300 total you buy another 50 more shares at 144 the price stays at 144 so your average purchase price is now 147 x 100 + 144 x 50 150 = 146 so i guess you could say that your average loss per share is now only $ 2 but it 's $ 2 x 150 shares instead of $ 3 x 100 shares you still lost $ 300 you did n't reduce your loss by a penny maybe it made you feel better that you reduced your average loss per share but this is just an arithmetic game if you believe that the stock will continue to drop than buying more shares just means you will lose even more money your average loss per share may go down but you 're just multiplying that average by more and more shares of course if you believe that the stock is now at an low price and it will likely go back up then sure buy if you buy at 144 and it goes back up to 147 then you 'll be making $ 3 per share on the new shares you purchased but i repeat whether or not you buy more shares should have nothing to do with your previous buy buy more shares if you think the price will go up from the present price do n't buy more shares if you do n't think it will go up the decision should be exactly the same as if you had never previously bought shares i 'm assuming here that you are a typical small investor that you not buying enough shares to have any significant effect on the market nor that you are in a position to buy enough shares to take control of the company

your question is best asked of a tax expert not random people on the internet such an expert will help you ask the right questions   for example you did not point out the country or state in which you live   that matters    first point is that you will not pay tax on 60 k its expensive to transact real estate so your net proceeds will be closer to   also you can probably the deduct the costs of improvements you implied that you really like this rental property   if that is the case why would you sell ever   this home could be a central part of your financial independence plan   so keep it until you die   iirc when it passes to your heirs a new cost basis is formed thereby not passing the tax burden onto them assuming the property is located in the us

mortgage interest in canada is not generally tax deductible for individuals where did you read otherwise as an individual the only mortgage interest you may be able to deduct is when you borrow the money to purchase an income producing asset e.g another property you can rent out or investments producing dividends or other income   in these cases the interest you pay on the borrowed funds i.e. the carrying costs for your investments would be deductible against the income produced by the investments purchased

i thought the line is much than that though say you have a company with divisions an overseas division makes an item sells it to another division overseas for final packaging then it 's sold domestically the domestic division should only pay taxes on the profits they earn and overseas on the profits from what they ship    but the company only wants to pay minimal taxes so they set the foreign price high so that a majority of profits are made overseas who will argue that this is n't correct is n't that it it 's not foreign sales but markup

they have weighed its impact on healthcare how could they possibly do that from a meaningful methodological point of view american healthcare was and is the one of the biggest of all time from an point of view   essentially everyone is on the take the insurance companies want to charge the highest premiums the hospitals want to perform as many procedures as possible and the doctors want as big a cut of the take as they can get their hands on the patient has no choice about how much is spent and simply wants to survive and until recently there was no attempt to regulate fair use within the system    do you really think that have any real practical understanding of the situation and even if they did would that make any difference at all to the travesty that is going on in washington at the moment

the dow jones industrial average djia is a price weighted index   that means that the index is calculated by adding up the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing by a constant the dow divisor   the value of the dow divisor is adjusted from time to time to maintain continuity when there are splits or changes in the   this has the curious effect of giving a member of the index influence proportional to its share price   that is if a stock costing $ 100 per share goes up by 1 that will change the index by 10 times as much as if a stock costing $ 10 per share goes up by the same 1 now look at the price of google   it 's currently trading at just a under $ 700 per share   most of the other stocks in the index trade somewhere between $ 30 and $ 150 so if google were included in the index it would contribute between 5 and 20 times the weight of any other stock in the index   that means that relatively small in google 's price would completely dominate the index on any given day   until june of 2014 apple was in the same boat with its stock trading at about $ 700 per share   at that time apple split its stock and after that its stock price was a little under $ 100 per share   so post split apple might be a candidate to be included in the dow the next time they change up the components of the index   since the dow is fixed at 30 stocks and since they try to keep a balance between different sectors this probably would n't happen until they drop another technology company from the lineup for some reason   correction apple is in the djia and has been for a little over a year now   mea the dow 's price weighting is unusual as stock indices go   most indices are weighted by market capitalization   that means the influence of a single company is proportional to its total value   this causes large companies like apple to have a lot of influence on those indices but since market capitalization is n't as arbitrary as stock price most people see that as ok   also notice that i said company and not stock   when a company has multiple classes of share as google does market cap weighted indices include all of the share classes while the dow has no provision for such situations which is another albeit less important reason why google is n't in the dow   keep this in mind the next time someone offers you a bar bet on how many stocks are in the s&p 500   the answer is currently 505 finally you might be wondering why the dow uses such an odd weighting in its calculations   the answer is that the dow averages go back to 1896 when charles dow used to calculate the averages by hand   if your only tools are a pencil and paper then a price weighted index with only 30 stocks in it is a lot easier to calculate than a market cap weighted index with hundreds of constituents about the dow jones averages dow constituents and prices apple 's stock price chart the split in 2014 is marked   note that prices before the split are retroactively adjusted to show a continuous curve

the investopedia article you linked to is a good start its key takeaway is that you should always consider risk adjusted return when evaluating your portfolio in general investors seeking a higher level of return must face a higher likelihood of taking a loss risk different types of stocks large vs small international vs us different industry sectors have different levels of historical risk and return not to mention stocks vs bonds or other financial instruments so it 's key to make an apples to apples comparison against an appropriate benchmark a benchmark will tell you how your portfolio is doing versus a comparable portfolio an index such as the s&p 500 is often used because it tells you how your portfolio is doing compared against simply passively investing in a diversified basket of securities first i would start with analyzing your portfolio to understand its asset allocation you can use a tool like the morningstar x ray to do this you may be happy with the asset allocation or this tool may inform you to adjust your portfolio to meet your long term goals the next step will be to choose a benchmark given that you are investing primarily in non us securities you may want to pick a globally diversified index such as the dow jones global index depending on the region and stock characteristics you are investing in you may want to pick a more specialized index such as the ones listed here in this wsj list with your benchmark set you can then see how your portfolio 's returns compare to the index over time irr and roi are helpful metrics in general especially for corporate finance but the comparison based approach gives you a better picture of your portfolio 's performance you can still calculate your personal irr and make sure to include factors such as tax treatment and investment expenses that may not be fully reflected by just looking at benchmarks also you can calculate the metrics listed in the investopedia article such as the sharpe ratio to give you another view on the risk adjusted return

there is a shortcut you can use when calculating federal estimated taxes   some states may allow the same type of estimation but i know at least one my own illinois that does not the shortcut you can completely base your estimated taxes for this year on last year 's tax return and avoid any underpayment penalty   a quick summary can be found here emphasis mine if your prior year adjusted gross income was $ 150,000 or less then    you can avoid a penalty if you pay either 90 percent of this year 's    income tax liability or 100 percent of your income tax liability from    last year dividing what you paid last year into four quarterly    payments this rule helps if you have a big spike in income one year    say because you sell an investment for a huge gain or win the    lottery if wage withholding for the year equals the amount of tax you    owed in the previous year then you would n't need to pay estimated    taxes no matter how much extra tax you owe on your windfall note that this does not mean you will not owe money when you file your return next april this shortcut ensures that you pay at least the minimum allowed to avoid penalty you can see this for yourself by filling out the worksheet on form 1040es   line is what your expected tax this year will be based on your estimated income   line is your total tax from last year possibly with some other modifications   line then asks you to take the lesser of the two numbers   so even if your expected tax this year is one million dollars you can still base your estimated payments on last year 's tax

the spot curve or yield curve demonstrates the different yields at which bonds of differing maturities are being purchased when the yield curve is upward sloping longer maturity bonds are being purchased at higher yields when it 's downward sloping longer maturity bonds are purchased at lower yields keep in mind that yield is inversely related to price so that a high yield bond will be at a lower price and vice versa the spot curve can also be used to determine the forward curve this is based on the concept that an investor given two options with identical cash flows will be indifferent in what to purchase i.e. their prices should be equal    to learn more about this stay here in /r finance to learn anything about your actual question try /r personalfinance

also almost by definition rebalancing involves making more trades    than you would have otherwise would n't the additional trading fees    you incurred in doing so reduce the benefits of this strategy you forgot to mention taxes rebalancing does or rather can incur costs one way to minimize the costs is to use the parts of the portfolio that have essentially zero cost of moving these generally are the funds in your retirement accounts in the united states they can be in iras or 401ks they can be regular or roth selling winners withing the structure of the plan does n't trigger capital gains taxes and many have funds within them that have zero loads   another way to reduce trading fees is to only rebalance once a year or once every two years or by setting a limit on how far out of balance for example do n't rebalance at to get back to 60/40 even if it has been two years   given that the ratio of investments is often rather arbitrary to begin    with how do i know whether i 'm selling high and buying low or just    sticking with a losing asset ratio the ratio used in an example or in an article may be arbitrary but your desired ratio is n't arbitrary you selected the ratio of your investments based on several criteria your age your time horizon your goals for the money how comfortable you are with risk as these change during your investing career those ratios would also but they are n't arbitrary   these decisions to rebalance are separate from the ones to sell a particular investment you could sell computer company x because of how it is performing and buy stock in technology company y because you think it has a better chance of growing that transaction would not be a re balancing selling part of your stock in domestic company a to buy stock in international company b would be part of a re balancing

short answer yes longer answer there may or may not be a medical exam or a physical as with a life insurance policy but your medical history is considered in the underwriting process disclosure i once worked as a financial advisor and held an insurance license for life annuity and long term care it has been 8 years since i left that line of work there are some knock out questions that the salesperson is encouraged required to ask just to see if there would be anything obvious that would disqualify you the only one i can remember from that list is if you have that as a diagnosis in your personal medical history the instruction to the salesperson is to not waste anybody 's time there were several other conditions all with very long technical names    if you 're not disqualified by the no brainer knock out questions your medical history will likely be included in the underwriting process   not every serious illness is an automatic including cancer it may cause your premiums to be a little higher as the underwriters will take a closer look and increase your risk profile due to the history there may be some group policies where underwriting is limited or not required at all as with all group insurance policies the healthy members in the group are paying more in premiums than they otherwise would in order to subsidize the premiums of the less healthy members it 's almost always cheaper to get your own personal policy unless you know you would n't qualify for it then the group policy might be your only chance for some coverage age 60 62 is statistically the best time to purchase on average if you make it to 62 you have a very high chance of making it to 90 these were the numbers available to me 8 years ago when i was in the business after 62 the prices go up a lot faster with each year of age   i ca n't answer with anything helpful about your spouse 's specific situation it would be good to talk to a licensed insurance broker about it not a salesman from a specific company the broker is not necessarily bound to disclose personal details you might have shared with them the company salesman would be obligated to disclose it to their company

i try to think of it as present money and future money   right now there 's still plenty of present wealth crops are growing there 's plenty of rubber steel glass and such being processed people still need toothpaste etc   stocks go way up when there 's expectations in the marketplace for future earnings and production profit   debt is issued read money is created when banks and lenders think production and profits will increase in the future   that future profit is what pays for the debt being issued money being created in the present   they essentially borrow from the future to create money today in exchange for a chunk of the future profits     right now there 's so much doom and gloom that everybody thinks future production and future profits will just not be there so nobody lends nobody invests and no money is created and thus money just kinda disappears     at least that 's how i think about it   present wealth vs expectations of future wealth   i 'm probably wrong though this stuff gives me a headache

those government workers in greece were just off a corrupt system that was enabled by the blind pursuit of yield and the moral hazard of bailout expectations they were way overpaid to do nothing but collect bribes and drink coffee all day good greece is a poor agricultural country with some tourism and some shipping and needs to go back to living within its means nobody is going to starve and high unemployment was always the norm there until a few years ago i lived there before the euro and they managed just fine despite high interest rates and inflation    japan has had lost decades because its banks like those in the west now are practicing extend and pretend so there has n't been a proper flush of the system the piigs should just flat out default and get it over with rather than slowly default while giving up sovereignty    even germany would be better off if the piigs defaulted since it is german taxpayers and savers who are going to pay for these bailouts let the banks fail meaning let their equityholders and bondholders take losses the depositors will be fine the resulting lower asset prices will tempt risk capital back into the system and life will go on bailouts just throw good money after bad and prop up corrupt banks and politicians   edit let me clarify about depositors making out fine the banks equityholders and bondholders take losses before depositors who are insured anyway in most cases in europe as in the us the write downs are not large enough to eat through this cushion before threatening depositors creditors were rewarded with higher interest for lending to these irresponsible banks so they should take the hit rather than get made whole at taxpayer and saver inflation expense

yes you can depreciate gifts to your business subject to the special rules in and regulation and it is dual basis property so when you sell the item your gain loss basis will be different adjusted basis of the donor for gain fmv on the date received for the loss minus any depreciation you add of course in both cases

store cards are incredibly generous with their approvals i recently graduated and started working making around 100k and bank of america only approved me for a $ 1000 credit limit however approved me for $ 2000 for everyday purchases and $ 5000 for large ticket items like furniture sets it may not sound so glamorous to have a specific store card but they all allow you to build credit and a credit card really does n't let you do anything a debit card ca n't unless you 're buying things you do n't currently have the money for amazon is also issuing credit cards now so with one of those there really is n't much you could n't buy if you needed

the concept of emergency fund is a matter of opinion i can tell you the consensus is that one should have 6 9 months worth of expenses kept as liquid cash this is meant to cover literally all bills that you might encounter during that time   that 's a lot of money there are levels of savings that are shy of this but still responsible not enough to cover too much in case of job loss but enough to cover the busted transmission the broken water heater etc this is still more than many people have saved up but it 's a worthy goal   the doctor visit is probably the lowest level even without insurance the clinic visit should be under $ 200 and this should n't cause you to have to carry that amount beyond the time the bill comes in   the point that should n't be ignored is that if you owe money at 18 on a credit card the emergency fund is costing you money and is a bit misguided i 'd send every cent i could to the highest rate card and not have more than a few hundred $ $ liquid until the cards were at zero   last $ 5 k $ 10 k in the emergency account is great unless you are foregoing matched 401(k dollars to do it all just my opinion others here whom i respect might disagree with parts of my answer and they 'd be right    edit regarding the consensus 6 9 months i suggest   from investopedia using the conservative recommendation to sock away eight    worth of living expenses the article strongly support my range for the fact that it both cites consensus yet disagrees with it   from money under 30 the more difficult you rank your ability to find a new job the more    we suggest you save up to a year ’s worth of expenses if you think    your income would be very difficult to replace from bank of america    i have no issue with those comfortable with less a dual income couple who is saving 30 of their income may very well survive one person losing a job with no need to tap savings and any emergency expense can come from next month 's income that couple may just need this month 's bills in their checking account

this is the result of market competition as well   cheese company a pays its employees $ 10/hour 20k year cheese company b pays its employees $ 40k year   this increase in wages results in a increase kg in production cost to company b.   since the grocery chain has a policy to set their sales price to 100 of purchase price in order to break even on a sale price this increase kg results in $ when it hits the consumer   assume both cheeses are equal most consumers will purchase the product at a lower price leading to lost sales for company b.    capitalism is a race to the bottom

couple of things to make sure you have going for you since you are not at a target school are as follows   1 make sure your gpa is amazing and if it is n't make sure you are in 3 4 professional organizations not just join them get involved   2 make sure you know technicals and how to talk about them very important   3 start applying to internships at all of the banks big 4 accounting pe fund account firms in the city there are many you have to get an internship this year and next year the more the better get summer fall spring internships   4 network with any and every person you know in ib working in m&amp;a working for ib shops working for pe shops other finance alumni   5 do more networking find out if there are any networking events conferences meet and charity events events there are a lot just need to find them do n't people with the i 'm at depaul in finance and want to be in ib story line perfect hone practice perfect your elevator pitch remember you do n't need to tell why you need a job you need to tell them why they need you to make money   6 find some industries that might interest you and are valuable and learn them learn the technicals to solar energy or some emerging markets   ps i know you want to make a shit ton of money but you 'll fail in ib if that is all you want to do because the guys that get these roles love the job because of the chase and the deal they fundamentally understand the markets they work in on another level they make themselves valuable to the firm they work for i think you should dive into what ib is first
