a minimum purchase quantity just means that you need to round your result up to the nearest 100 in your example it comes out evenly if we look at an example where it does n't come out even you 'd round up and round that up to 700 due to purchase quantities for a slightly more complex and accurate approach you 'd then evaluate how many of the extras you had to buy due to the minimum purchase quantity would need to be sold so you 'd have to sell of the 700 purchased to break even

as per the age of your son you mentions i would suggest yes charge them an interest amount but lesser than the market rate and give them a valid reason behind taking interest on given amount the reason you might grab from below real incident happen with me at the time of last year i am 26 and i am currently doing job and my salary is not so much that i can accomplish all my dreams of buying expensive watch and many things so i borrowed some strong amount from my mom she gave me the amount but she asked me to pay interest of 5 and when i asked the reason behind demanding the interest she said something which was valuable things she said me if i would not give you money then you will definitely ask money from some money lenders or your friends because now that watch is your first priority and in that case you need to pay the higher interest rate to them and in life there might be situation where we would not capable to help you in terms of financial so this is the time you should learn to pay interest and responsibility of borrowing amount and repaying it on time with interest rate this will help you also to learn a lesson and our money will be withing home i am not expert in parenting because i am still unmarried but i shared my point of view for your question thanks

for those who do n't know credit card checks are blank checks that your credit card company sends you   when you fill them out and spend them you are taking a cash advance on your credit card account   you should be aware that taking a cash advance on your credit card normally has extra fees and finance charges above what you have with regular credit card transactions that having been said when you take one of these to your bank and try to deposit them it is entirely up to bank policy how long they will make you wait to use these funds   they want to be sure that it is a legitimate check and that it will be honored   if your teller does n't know the answer to that question you 'll need to find someone at the bank who does   if you do n't like the answer they give you you 'll need to find another bank i would think that if the credit card is from chase and you are trying to deposit a credit card check into a chase checking account they should be able to do that instantly   however bank policy does n't always make sense

dollar cost averaging is a great strategy to use for investment vehicles where you ca n't invest it in a lump sum a 401 k is perfect for this you take a specific amount out of each paycheck and invest it either in a single   fund or multiple funds or some programs let you invest it in a brokerage account so you can invest in virtually any mutual fund or stock with annual or semi annual re balancing of your investments dollar cost averaging is the way to invest in these programs if you have a lump sum to invest then dollar cost averaging is not the best way to invest imagine you want to invest 10 k and you want to be 50 bonds and 50 stocks under dollar cost averaging you would take months to move the money from 100 cash to 50/50 bonds stocks while you are slowly moving towards the allocation you want you will spend months not in the allocation you want you will spend way too long in the heavy cash position you were trying to change the problem works the other way also somebody trying to switch from stocks to gold a few years ago would not have wanted to stay in limbo for months obviously day traders do n't use dollar cost averaging if you will will be a frequent trader dca is not the way to go   no particular stock type is better for dca it is dependent on how long you plan on keeping the investment and if you will be working with a lump sum or not edit there have be comments regarding dca and 401ks when experts discuss why people should invest via a 401 k they mention dca as a plus along with the company match many participants walk away with the belief that dca is the best strategy many articles have been written about how to invest an inheritance or tax refund many people want to use dca because they believe that it is good in fact in the last few years the experts have begun to discourage ever using dca unless there is no other way

the issue here is that the transaction your funds to her account looks very similar to the rent payments which you plan to make in the future those rental payments if deemed to be commercial would normally be subject to tax consider the scenario where rather than an up front $ 5000 and $ 5000 over 2 years you paid her $ 10000 and paid no rent that might be an attempt to avoid paying tax a commercial transaction ca n't be re labeled as a gift just based on your election the transaction needs to be considered as a whole however an interest free unsecured loan connected with you paying rent at market rate would be depending on local laws simply foolish to some extent i do n't think you are able to structure the transaction as a joint purchase since the mortgage will prevent her from allocating a part of the property to you its also likely that you can live in her house and contribute an adequate amount to the household costs without creating a taxable income for her for example in the uk up to pa rental income generated from the property in which you reside does not need to be declared you need to identify the scenarios where your particular arrangement could be imagined as resulting in a taxable or potentially taxable event then make sure you are not avoiding those events just by choosing how you label the events

i do n't know about india but here in the us banks and more friendly institutions such as credit unions use to offer the option of a secured credit card where the card was secured by placing a lock on money in a savings account equal to the credit limit on the card so for example if you had $ 1500 in savings you could have them lock say $ 1000 which you would not be able to withdraw from savings in return for a credit card account with a credit limit of $ 1000   typically you still earned interest on the full amount of the savings you were just limited to having to maintain a minimum balance in that account of $ 1000

it appears that the company in question is raising money to invest in expanding its operations specifically lithium production but that is off topic for here the stock price was rising on the back of perceived increases in demand for the company 's products but in order to fulfil demand they need to either invest in higher production or increase prices they chose to increase production by investing to invest they needed to raise capital and so are going through the motions to do that the key question as to what will happen with their stock price after this is broken down into two parts short term and long term in the short term the price is driven by the expectation of future profits see below and the behavioural expectations from an increase in interest in the stock caused by the fact that it is in the news people who had never heard of the stock or thought of investing in the company have suddenly discovered it and been told that it is doing well and so want a piece of it this will exacerbate the effect of the news broadly positive or negative and will drive the price in the short run the effect of extra leverage assuming that they raise capital by writing bonds also immediately increases the total value of the company so will increase the price somewhat the short term price changes usually back after a few months as the shine goes off and people take profits for investing in the long run you need to consider how the increase in capital will be used and how demand and supply will change since the company is using the money to invest in factors of production i.e. making more product it is the return on capital or investment employed roce that will inform the fundamentals underlying the stock price the higher the roce the more valuable the capital raised is in the future and the more profits and the company as a whole will grow a to ask yourself is whether they can employ the extra capital at the same roce as they currently produce it is possible that by investing in new more productive equipment they can raise their roce but also possible that because the lithium mines or whatever can only get so big and can only get so much access to the extra capital will not be as productive as existing capital so roce will fall for the new capital

one interesting part of this history that is often forgotten was how absolutely close we came to a universal basic income under nixon fap went through the democratic dominated house without much trouble in late 1970 it carried a very decisive margin absent a of rather unique circumstances in 1970 high among them the cambodian campaign for a host of reasons that created a chill between nixon and the senate from which their relations would never truly recover it is not at all hard to imagine it being passed    one wonders how welfare policy would have developed with that keep in mind fap was meant to help both the working poor and working class as well as really more than the underclass which was part of how knew how to appeal to nixon    other factors in fap 's downfall include   1 the of the finance committees these things often were passed down by generation by strongly conservative southern democrats whose states being largely still the poorest the new south was only getting started would have disproportionately effected by fap largely against their own political interests unlike the great society fap would have given recipients direct cash payouts and would have largely gone over their heads so to speak and after the cambodian campaign nixon could ill afford to alienate them    2 nixon 's shift in attention in the summer of 1970 to other areas prominent among them national security and foreign policy for the former the violently illegal to the point where j. edgar hoover no shrinking when it came to treating the civil rights of certain us citizens with some flexibility objected plan would be created in the summer of 70 as for the latter this was when the china initiative was just beginning to take off and getting into high gear following the destruction of the absent both of these nixon would have his hands full at any rate that autumn with the dual crisis of the black september and right at the moment fap was in its death in front of the aforementioned finance committees   nixon would take a subsequent conservative turn for the 1970 elections following a very strategy with little to no success which shaped his 1972 strategy    3 the strong resistance of the senate gop to the measure especially in the wake of the great society some libertarians did support the fap but intended it to replace the welfare state as opposed to nixon wishing to supplement it it into something more fiscally feasible the gop were strongly resistant in general to nixon 's attempts to transform the gop into something they fundamentally did n't wish to be    the ultimate of this was had nixon had his way his vp and eventual successor would have been john former texas governor and 's de facto right hand man top fixer who the kind of conservative democrat that nixon wanted to transform the gop with into what would have essentially been a style party this was not the same vision the people who dominated the gop at the local level had in mind to say the least and was a contributing factor into why nixon did n't invest a lot of energy into for the gop during the 72 and why the party returned the favor during    4 the resistance of a lot of senate liberals to anything that would have given nixon a domestic success especially after cambodia and before the 70 merely the clinton wars in reverse in a sense clinton 's strategy in 1995 after the democratic slaughter in the of 1994 was ironically off of nixon 's in 1971 following the disappointing results of the 1970 for the gop   the fap would be attempted again twice but it never really had the same chance of passing that it did the first time as for cheney and i 'm not terribly shocked both of them belong to the heavily influenced wing of the party that historically has n't had much attachment to small government style thinking found in the congressional part of the gop they both have a knack for thinking politically too cheney defended bush senior 's decision to not boot the out of in the early 90s when few in the gop were the next decade would dramatically change things as the dominant foreign policy ideology of the part transformed to the ideology of democratic that came over to the basement in the reagan years and in 92 against bush the who along with the old style nixon realist foreign policy school of the party cheney knew where his bread was and where the winds were going   was also a dove on vietnam by 71 believe it or not to the point where it somewhat alienated nixon and eventually incurred the of hr a very unwise move in the nixon white house to the point where he got kicked upstairs to a post in brussels dealing with nato the reason i emphasized normally is because this let escape completely unscathed had that not happened there 's no way he 'd have had the clout to pull off the halloween in 75 at that age

i agree that to take the money from the defined benefit plan you are saying that you can get a better return than the plan you are taking all the risk if you take the lump sum but there are two more risks that you are taking by keeping the money in the plan even though you are decades from retirement funding risk companies and state city county governments have underfunded their pension programs due to budget pressure in some cases they have skipped payments when the market was good because they felt they were ahead of their obligations they also delayed or skipped contributions when they had a budget shortfall and wanted to not end the government company fiscal year in the red the risk is that they can get so far behind that they change their promises to current and former employees this was one of the issues with the city of detroit this year bankruptcy even though their are guarantees regarding pension benefits the pension benefit guaranty corporation does set a maximum benefit if the company goes bankrupt or the plan is terminated   you might not get all the money you were expecting while the chances of taking a haircut generally impacts people who have a long career because they are entitled to a large benefit it can impact people who do n't expect it

the bank certainly does n't have to take it for a deposit that 's not a debt   there have been several cases where disgruntled debtors have attempted deliberately annoying ways to pay their debts the example being pennies   courts are not likely to support such efforts since it 's obvious that a the action is malicious and relevant to you b it 's really on you to maintain your money in a form   if you allow your money to become unwieldy nobody owes you anything    i wonder about the meta meaning of that   and whether in that light it really makes sense to worry about 5 or rolling   as far as getting rid of it when i bought out a girlfriend 's at par i just made sure to walk out of the house with $ 5 in change in my pocket and unload $ 2 3 at every retailer none ever objected and some appreciated   quarters were traded to coin laundry users when going on transit i brought a bunch the machines never   i burned through the cache much faster than expected

does your company offer a 401k or similar pre tax retirement plans is your company a publicly traded company these questions are important basically the key to any of your investments should be diversification this means buying more than one kind of investment amongst bonds real estate or more the answer to how much of your salary should go to company stock is subjective i personally would contribute the max toward a retirement plan or even post tax savings which would be invested in a variety of public companies   hope that helps

great example of levered tracking error is any vix etf during periods of high volatility like last week you will be able to realize much higher returns on the underlying index as the levered and inverse etfs are unable to replicate their intended performance using market securities   it is not uncommon to see the vix up ~30 with levered etfs only netting ~10 12 as opposed to the intended 60 or 90 for example

one of the things that you have to be aware of is a little gotcha in the credit utilization rate they or at least the credit company i worked for used the high balance in figuring the credit utilization not the ending balance for example say you had a single card with a $ 2000 credit limit and used it to charge everything during the month say that the high balance was $ 1900 and you paid it down to zero at the end of the month the company would calculate your credit utilization at 95 this is not good and not really fair but that was the way it was done increasing the credit limit helps but you can also usually make interim payments say as a paycheck comes in during the month if you have an online account

so my questions are payment cards provide sufficient security now yes if so how is that achieved depending on your country 's laws of course in most places the us and eu notably there 's a statutory limit on liability for fraudulent charges for transactions when the card is not present proving that the charge is not fraudulent is merchants task why do online services ask for all those cvv codes and expiration date    information if whenever you poke the card out of your wallet all of    its information becomes visible to everyone in the close area what    can i do to secure myself is it try to copy someones credit card info next time you 're in the line at the local grocery store btw some of my friends tend to rub off the cvv code from the cards    they get immediately after receiving nevertheless it could have    already been written down by some unfair bank employee rubbish

if the call is in the money and you believe the reason for the price jump was an overreaction with a on the horizon or you anticipate downward movement for other reasons i will roll sometimes for a strike closer to at the money as long as the trade results in a net credit    you already have the statistical edge trading covered calls over everyone who purchased stock at the same point in time   this is because covered calls reduce your cost basis and increase your probability of profit for people reading this who are not interested in the math behind probability of for covered calls you should be aware of why pop is higher for covered calls cc   with ccs you win when the stock price stays the same you win when it goes down slightly you win when the stock goes up   you have two more ways to win than someone who just buys stock therefore a higher probability of making a buck another option if your stock is going to be called at a loss or the strike you want to roll to results in a net debit or   your cash funds are short of owning 100x shares and you are familiar with the stock try writing a naked put for the price you want to buy at   at if the naked put is exercised your basis is reduced by the premium of the put you sold and you can write a covered call against the stock you now own   if it expires worthless you keep the premium   this is also another way to increase your pop

actually the part is interesting because they actually are n't middlemen just faster buyer 's and sellers on the open market they just buy what one person is selling and sell it to someone else who is at the same time looking to buy so i guess the issue is the same time is n't the same for all parties concerned on the other hand both buyer and seller can set limits on the bounds of the price and only transact when someone meets their terms if you are willing to accept whatever the market will bear then it seems like you should be ok with getting it

an option is a financial instrument instrument that gives you the right but not the obligation to do some transaction in the future at a given price an employee stock option is a kind of call option it gives you the right but not the obligation to buy the stock at a certain price the exercise price usually set as the price of the stock when the option was granted the idea is that you would exercise the option buy the stock at the given price as provided by the option if the value of the stock is higher than the exercise price and not if it is lower the option is gifted to you but that does not mean you get any stock if and when you choose to exercise the option you would buy the stock with your own money at what time you can exercise the option and how many shares you can exercise at a given time will be specified in the agreement usually you can only exercise a particular share after it has vested according to some vesting schedule and you lose the ability to exercise after you no longer work for the company plus perhaps a grace period or after the option expires

emv cards use an offline transaction counter to increase security this counter is maintained inside the card and every time a transaction is confirmed by the card for online contact transactions the card will usually receive feedback from its issuer which among other actions will reset that counter to zero for offline transactions the card will increment the counter by one each time it is used for contactless transactions things are a bit different since contactless transactions usually do not maintain a connection between the card and the terminal long enough to transmit issuer feedback to the card the counter can not be reset that way the counter will therefore even be for online transactions the implications of this are dependent on what your issuer is actually doing with the contents of the offline counter some issuers use this as a safety measure for contactless cards and allow only a limited number of contactless transactions since those usually do not require any cardholder verification method below a certain threshold e.g. 25 € in many european countries and the total risk in case of physical card theft can therefore be limited to < number of offline contactless transaction usually you would have to use your card in a contact based transaction to reset the counter and the terminal would display an according notice it is indeed strange that the terminal instead requested your pin if this happens again you could try to use your card once via the contact interface and see if this resets your offline counters and allows you to pay without pin entry for the next few transactions

a financial planner can help with investments insurance estate planning budgeting retirement planning saving for college tax planning prep and other money topics one way to get a sense is to look at this certified financial planner topic list another idea is to look at this book my favorite i 've read which covers roughly a similar topic list in a concise form it could not hurt at all to read that before deciding to visit a planner so you have baseline knowledge by the way look for the cfp certification which is a generalist certification a cfp might also have a deeper cert in certain topics or connect you with someone who does for example you really want a generalist cfp who may have an additional credential as well the idea is to look at what you 're trying to accomplish and all finance related areas especially because there may be tradeoffs the cfp would then refer you to or work with lawyers accountants etc importantly some advisors are fiduciaries must act in your interests and some are not in particular many stockbrokers are neither qualified planners no cfp or equivalent nor are they fiduciaries stay away there are several models for paying a financial planner including there 's an organization called napfa for fiduciary non commission based planners membership there is a good thing to look for since it 's a third party that defines what fee only means and requires the no commissions fiduciary standard finally the alternative i ended up choosing was to just take the cfp course myself you can do it online via correspondence course it costs about the same as 1 year of professional advice i also took the exam just to be sure i learned the stuff this is the extreme diy approach but it is cheaper over time and you know you are not going to defraud yourself you still might do things that are counterproductive and not in your interests but you know that already probably anyway i think it 's equivalent to about a quarter 's worth of work at a decent college or so there are about 6 textbooks to dig through you wo n't be an experienced expert at the end but you 'll know a lot to get an actual cfp cert you need 3 years experience on top of the courses and the exam i have n't done that just the book learning someone who puts cfp after their name will have the 3 years on top of the training some editorial many planners emphasize investing and many people looking for planners or books on finance emphasize investing this is a big mistake in my view investing is more or less a commodity and you just need someone who wo n't screw it up overcharge and/or lose your money on something idiotic or inappropriate some people are in plain bad and inappropriate investments do n't get me wrong but once you fix that and just get into anything decent your biggest planning concerns are probably elsewhere on investments i 'd look for a planner to just get you out of overpriced annuities and expensive mutual funds you may have been sold anything you were sold by a salesperson is probably crap and look for them to help you decide how much to invest and how much in stocks vs. bonds those are the most important investment decisions

whenever you do paid work for a company you will need to fill out some sort of paperwork so that the company knows how to pay you and also how to report how much they paid you to the appropriate government agencies you should not think of this as a hurdle and you should n't worry that you have n't been employed for a long time the two most common ways a company pays an individual are via employee wages or independent contractor payments when you start a relationship with a company if you are going to become an employee then you will out a w4 form and at the end of the year you will receive a w2 form if you are an independent contractor which you would be considered in this case you will fill out form w9 and at the end of the year you will receive a 1099 this is completely normal and you have nothing to worry about all it means is that if you make more than a certain amount typically $ 600 in a year you will receive a 1099 in the mail or electronically the 1099 form basically means that they are reporting that amount to the irs and it also helps you file your tax return by showing you all the numbers you need on one form please remember that when you are paid as an independent contractor no taxes are withheld on your behalf so you may owe some tax on the money you make it 's best to set aside some of your income so you are prepared to pay it come tax time next year

i 'd recommend an online fx broker like xe trade at xe.com   there are no fees charged by xe other than the spread on the fx conversion itself which you 'll pay anywhere they have payment clearing facilities in several countries including uk bacs so provided you 're dealing with a major currency it should be possible to transfer money free of wire charges at least   the fx spread will be much better than you would get from a bank since fx is their primary business the additional risk you take on is settlement risk   xe will not pay the sterling amount to your uk bank account until they have received the euro payment into their account   if xe went bankrupt before crediting your uk account but after you 've paid them your euros you could lose your money xe is backed by custom house which is a large and established canadian firm so this risk is very small indeed there are other choices out there too is another that comes to mind although xe 's rates have been the best of those i 've tried

i should think the primary reason is due why those countries have a higher standard of salary its not what you get but what it buys you in a high salary low exchange rate country like sweden you get a lot of services that your taxes buy you healthcare and quality of life in a stable country is something you want when you get old note that your viewpoint might be very different when you 're a kid moving to a country that has less impact on your finances is often because that country has significantly fewer services to offer so a swedish citizen might think about moving to a 3rd world country and find that their retirement income is n't sufficient to pay for the kind of lifestyle they actually want such countries tend to be pleasant to live in only if you are exceptionally wealthy   now this kind of thing does happen but only within reason there are a number of old people who retire to the coast in the uk at least and many people who used to work in london who retire to the south west for them the idea of moving does n't seem so bad as they are moving to areas where many other people in their situation have also moved see florida for an example for us citizens too

owing taxes to two or more levels of government is n't double taxation it 's a feature of the american union i 'm not for this bill in general mostly for the timing and the loss of the highest bracket but both the state and federal governments have to generate revenue and basing rates on pure incomes with a few loopholes as possible is the most progressive way to do it by owing taxes unadjusted for other taxes paid there 's more incentive for states to lower local taxes and to balance state programs with federal programs and for state reps to more fairly redistribute federal transfers instead of targeting states with usually artificially low local taxes and fewer state programs usually republican

if you buy stock in established companies it is unlikely that they will lose all their value spreading your money across multiple stocks diversifying reduces that risk because it is extremely unlikely that they all lose all their value at once spreading them across multiple industries and adding bonds to the mix increases diversification of course the trade off is that if one of the stocks skyrockets you do n't benefit as much as if you had been lucky enough to put all your money in that one stock   you need to decide for yourself how much risk you are willing to tolerate in exchange for the chance of gains   other answers on this site have dealt with this in more detail

the problems with ratings and the interpretation of ratings is that they are retrospective and most people read them as prospective they basically tell you that debtor is solvent right now what does that mean it means that the ratings are based on the audited financial statements of a company government or other organization issuing debt so in the best case scenario where the rating agency is acting properly they are still dependent on folks with fiduciary responsibility telling the truth and even if they are telling the truth accounting rules make it possible to obscure problems for years in some cases municipal are a great example of this the general obligation bonds cities and even states with deep structural budget problems still get good ratings because they are solvent and have sufficient operating cash to meet obligations today but towards the end of a 30-year bond 's life that may not be the case anymore unless they dramatically alter their budgets at the end of the day ratings are one aspect of due diligence they are useful screening devices but you need to understand who you are lending money to by purchasing bonds and diversify your holdings to protect your wealth   the problem of course is when the trustees of your pension fund invests in garbage assets after getting a sales pitch on the beach in hawaii then conveniently place all of the blame for that bad investment on the rating agency you unfortunately have zero control over that

long story short 8 turned out to be the tipping point because it was the average subordination level of the a rated tranches of the subprime mbs bonds     the reason this was the magic number is because of the way bonds were placed during the period   basically no end user wanted to take on the risk of buying below a rated paper so instead of being sold directly these bbb rated and below bonds were re packaged into cdos and off   again the higher rated paper was sold off to whomever while the bbb and below stuff got and repackaged into other cdos or further levering up the initial subprime bonds     now back to the magic 8 number remember how i said that 8 was the subordination level for the a rated subprime paper the other way of saying that is once defaults reached 8 the bbb and below tranches of the the mbs were completely wiped out   since the cdos were largely made up of these bbb and below mbs once they started getting written down so did the cdos   when the lower rated cdo tranches started to go because they were also repackaged in the same way it just continued the negative feedback loop and before long even the   aa and aaa rated paper was seeing massive losses     as more and more supposedly safe paper started to get wiped out highly leveraged cds contracts started coming due causing aig which had written contracts on over $ 500 billion in assets to get downgraded by the rating agencies putting it on the brink of going under   because basically every major bank had exposure to aig had they gone under the other banks would have all had to write down those contracts at the same time essentially causing the entire financial system to collapse

even if you avoid the issue of the auto dealer wanting to limit the abuse of their policy you have to realize that the discount they give is 25 off of some stated price it might be 25 off the sticker they do n't want to lose money the 25 represents the haggling they avoid by selling to the employee this means the discount might not be as large as you imagine because you would n't have paid sticker if you had purchased the vehicle on your own the other issue you will have to deal with is taxes and registration when your friend drives the car off the lot the car will have to be registered with the state then they will have to sell the car to you and that transaction will have to be done though the state for a price then you will sell it to somebody else these transaction fees will cut into your profits   it is likely that when the potential purchaser runs a vin check through a service it will show multiple owners which can cut the estimated resale value the manufacturer will also have to be notified so that all the relevant warranty coverage is still intact   the question is for that final sale can you offer enough discount compared to the new car dealer and still make enough profit to be worth the hassle

the advice you were given in the other question was do n't do it the math is not the issue the interest structure is not the issue but there is a significant chance that you could lose money on the deal if you invested your money in a nasdaq heavy position in january 2000 you are still waiting to break even in november of 2013 invest in almost anything in august 2001 and you will be down for a long time invest just before the housing collapse in 2007 and only now returning back to where you were if you take money on a monthly basis and invest it you will be better off   if want to get the loan then set up a stream of money into a bank account to make sure that when payments are due you have the cash to do so when the two years are up you will have cash to repay the loan and no need to sell the investments also if you are a bad judge of investments you wo n't have a problem repaying the loan using a loan to purchase stock reduces your gains and increases your losses use the power of dollar cost averaging by making periodic purchases

as has been stated you do n't need to actively bank with a credit union to apply for one of their credit cards that said one benefit to having account activity and significant capital with a cu is to increase the likelihood of having a larger credit line granted to you when you do apply if you are going to use the card sparingly however then this is a non issue that said if you really want to maximize card benefits then you want to look for cards with large sign up bonuses e.g. chase or ink bold if you have a business and sign up exclusively for those bonuses these cards offer rewards in excessive value of $ 1000 in travel services hotels plane tickets or $ 500 cash back if you prefer straight cash back redemptions if you prefer to keep it really simple you can sign up for a cash back card like the amex fidelity which offers 2 cash back everywhere with no annual fee albeit the cash back is through their investment account which you do n't actually have to invest with personally i have the card and use it exclusively for gas 5 cash back i also have a charles schwab bank account which i keep funded exclusively for atm withdrawals free atm usage worldwide 100 fee reimbursement i use the accounts exclusively for the benefit they provide me and no more and have never had an issue i also have 3 dozen other credit cards which i signed up for exclusively for the sign up bonus but that 's outside the scope of this question i only mention it because you seem to believe it is difficult to get approved for a new credit line if your credit is good however you wo n't have a problem   for a small idea of how to maximize credit card bonus categories i would advise you read this as mentioned in the article its possible to get rewards almost everywhere you shop in short anytime you use cash you are missing out on a multitude of benefits a credit card offers you e.g. see the benefits of a visa signature card in addition to points cash back

a few thoughts you said   to me it makes sense that if he accidentally put his own money in when he was n't supposed to he could just take it out and pay the tax on it and be fine in this case he would be putting his own after tax money in and would n't be able to deduct it so the act of putting it in and taking it back out in the same tax year would be as if the transaction never occurred at all he would not have to pay the tax on it as for this question is there any penalty to his employer if they contribute to an hsa on his behalf knowing that he is not eligible and that the money will be an excess contribution it 's good that your son is prepared to treat it as regular income and pay the appropriate taxes however the employer should be the one doing that they should be treating it as regular income and taking out fica and paying their end of fica too if they are n't doing that technically they are breaking the law the employer really should n't be making the contributions at all and if they ever bothered to correct this this article suggests that the employer may be legally allowed to drain the hsa account and take their money back out of it but only for the same tax year apparently they can do this without your son 's consent if that 's true it may make sense to withdraw all money from that account immediately as soon as the money arrives since they can not take the money back if it is no longer there once the money leaves the hsa account the employer has no choice but to change it to income and if they do n't your son must declare it as such which it sounds like he is prepared to do this does n't really answer your question of whether or not the employer can be i would assume yes but not too badly the worst case scenario for them would probably be just having to pay all the back fica on those funds if they are n't doing so already maybe an interest penalty as well all that being said i 'd recommend talking to an accountant the most important thing you want to be sure of is that your son can not possibly be liable for any wrongdoing particularly i would get confirmation on pulling money out of the hsa that you know should n't be there in the first place just to make sure there is no possible way to get dinged for that

you mentioned three concepts 1 trading 2 diversification 3 buy and hold    trading with any frequency is for people who want to manage their investments as a hobby or profession   you do not seem to be in that category   diversification is a critical element of any investment strategy   no matter what you do you should be diversified   all the way would be best this means owning at least some of every asset out there   the usual way to do this is to own a mutual or index fund   or several   these funds own hundreds or thousands of stocks so that buying the fund instantly diversifies you buy and hold is the only reasonable approach to a portfolio for someone who is not interested in spending a lot of time managing it   there 's no reason to think a buy and hold portfolio will underperform a typical traded portfolio nor that the gains will come later   it 's the assets in the portfolio that determine how aggressive risky it is not the frequency with which it is traded this is n't really a site for specific recommendations but i 'll provide a quick idea   buy a couple of index funds that cover the whole universe of investments   index funds have low expenses and are the cheapest easiest way to diversify   buy a total stock market fund and a total bond fund in a ratio that you like   if you want also buy an international fund   if you want specific tickers and ratios another forum would be just ask your broker or 401(k provider   the bogleheads forum is one that i respect where people are very happy to give and debate specific recommendations at the end of the day responsibly managing your investment portfolio is not rocket science and should n't occupy a lot of time or worry   just choose a few funds with low expenses that cover all the assets you are really interested in put your money in them in a reasonable ish ratio no one knows that the best ratio is and then forget about it

in general what you will find is that a prepaid debit card will allow you to make any sort of purchase that is not also used as a security against possibly open ended charges   a hotel wants to have a method of payment on file that they can potentially charge for damages to a room for example   the same goes for a car rental    another limitation you will discover is when you are getting close to the amount of money that remains on the card   a restaurant will typically send through a preauthorization for the bill amount + example to account for a tip   if you have $ 60 left on your card and the bill is $ 50 the preauth may not be approved    some prepaid debit cards particularly those that are non start charging a service fee just for having the card after a certain period of time   this seems to be after a year but ymmv lastly make sure that the card you get is   some like gift cards and rebate cards are sold to the buyer with a fixed amount on them   and you can not add additional money to them

if we were to observe some call price e.g. 15 and then derived implied volatilities from the bs formula depending on different strike prices but fixed maturity i.e maturity = 1 and strike goes from 80 to 140 would we then see a smile yes market prices for various strikes and a given maturity often have higher implied volatilities from the black scholes model away from at the money    it is not accounted for in the black scholes model in the fact that volatility is not a function of strike so volatility is assumed to be constant across strikes but the market does not price options that way i do n't know that a quantitative theory has ever been proven i 've always just assumed that people are willing to pay slightly more for options deep in or out of the money based on their strategy but i have no evidence to base that theory on

but what about the following scenario which is my paraphrasing of a nanex article i 'm hoping you can help clarify this for me   1 i observe a 1,000 lot advertised for sell on a lit exchange   2 i try to lift the 1,000 by placing a limit order   3 my order goes through some kind of order routing process first 3 orders get executed on a dark pool let 's say i got a 50 lot filled so available offer reduces to 950   4 my order hits a lit exchange i get a partial fill for 100 offer shrinks to 850 but the offered size shrinks instead to 500 or 0   5 now in order to execute my trade i will have to take a higher price than the original advertised liquidity   my question maybe you can answer this is why did my original order size of 1,000 appear in smaller blocks is this because the order routing algorithm breaks up the size   or is it that market makers only post offers in small block sizes e.g. 100 so even if the order book looked like   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   all the way to 1,000 total as soon as the first 100 shares were lifted the mm can immediately cancel the remainder of the advertised liquidity in practical terms making it impossible to execute large orders at an advertised price

aganju has mentioned put options which are one good possibility i would suggest considering an even easier strategy short selling   technically you are borrowing the stock from someone and selling it   at some point you repurchase the stock to return to the lender covering your short   if the stock price has fallen then when you repurchase it it will be cheaper and you keep the profit short selling sounds complicated but it 's actually very easy your broker takes care of all the details   just go to your brokerage and click sell or sell short   you can use a market or limit order just like you were selling something you own   when it sells you are done   the money gets credited to your account   at some point after the price falls you should repurchase it so you do n't have a negative position any more but your brokerage is n't going to hassle you for this unless you bought a lot and the stock price starts rising   there will be limits on how much you can short depending on how much money is in your account   some stocks distressed and small stocks may sometimes be hard to short meaning your broker will charge you a kind of interest and/or may not be able to complete your transaction you will need a margin account a type of brokerage account to either use options or short sell   they are easy to come by though note that for a given amount of starting money in your account puts can give you a much more dramatic gain if the stock price falls   but they can and often do expire worthless causing you to lose all money you have spent on them   if you want to maximize how much you make use puts   otherwise i 'd short sell about ipos it depends on what you mean   if the ipo has just completed and you want to bet that the share price will fall either puts or short selling will work   before an ipo you ca n't short sell and i doubt you would be able to buy an option either foreign stocks   depends on whether there is an adr for them that trades on the domestic market and on the details of your brokerage account   let me put it this way if you can buy it you can short sell it

a tfsa is a tax free savings account   it is a type of account where you can buy various investments like stocks bonds or funds mutual exchange traded and money market   there are some other options but it 's best to see what your bank or broker will allow you probably specified the type of investment when you opened the account   you can look at your statements or maybe online to see what you 're invested in   my guess is some kind of high interest savings account   this is kind of the default option for banks the government created these accounts for a variety of reasons   the main stated reason was to encourage people to save    obviously they also do things to get votes   there was an outcry after the change to a type of investment called investment trusts   this could be seen as a consolation prize   these can be valuable to seniors for many reasons and they tend to vote more often   there was also an election promise to eliminate capital gains taxes in some fashion it 's not profitable for the government in fact it supposedly cost the federal government $ 410 million in 2013   banks make money by investing your deposit or by charging fees you can see what every tax break costs the government in lost revenue here

any inward remittance received by your parents can not be treated as income as per the this can at best be treated as gift however in india there is no gift tax for certain relations and there is no ceiling on the amount in your case gifting of money by son to father or is allowed without any limits and tax implication however if you father were to invest this money in his name and make gains the gains would be taxable   however if the money is being transfered with specific purpose such as to buy a property etc make sure you have the bank give your dad an certificate of inward remittance this is also advisable even otherwise the remittance certificate from bank that the credit entry in the account is because or funds into india and if the tax authorities were to question the large amount of credits it would be proof that it is due to inward remittance and not due to say a sale of property by your dad helpful links edit 1 what you father does with the money is treated as expense ie spends on day to day expense or pays off your loans or pay off his loans have no relevance from a tax in india   the only issue comes in say you have transfered the funds to buy a property and there was no purpose of remittance specified by bank 's letter and one want to this funds back to us then its an issue if you transfer the funds directly to your loan account again there is no tax implication to you in india as you are nri

my recommendation is simple   rent the fact that you have to ask the question is a clear sign that you have no business buying a home that 's not to say that it 's a bad question to ask though far more important then rather it 's wise for you to buy a home is the more important question of are you emotionally ready for the responsibility and of a home   at best you are tying your self to the same number of rooms same location and same set of circumstances for the next 5 7 years in that time it will be very unlikely that you will be able to sell the house for a profit get your minor equity back or even get a second loan for any reason   you mentioned getting married soon that means the possibility of more children divorce and who knows what else   you are in an emotionally and financially time in your life now is not the right time to buy anything large instead rent and focus on improving your credit rating in 5 years time you will have a much better credit rating get much better rates and fees and have a much better handle on where you want to be with your home family situation   buying a house is not something you do on a weekend for most people it 's the culmination of years of work searching researching and preparation   often times people that buy before they are ready will end up in foreclosure and generally have a crappy next 15 years as they try to work themselves out of the issue

alright i know a lot of people do see it as being wrong and some have tried to pull a government motors sort of thing with tesla but it 's really not correct to do so so i tend to overreact a bit when i hear any suggestion that that be the case   by the way i should say that elon says the government loan did n't save the company   maybe it did and he 's just saying that for pr purposes but he has been honest in the past about when the company has been near death so i 'm willing to trust him on this one when he says this was n't a near death experience especially after hearing the story of the mercedes investment which elon has told in a few interviews   the roadster did make money overall but it was all spent on s development as had been the plan all along which is why tesla did n't show a profit on the books because it went into r&amp;d capex   the loan definitely helped make the s happen faster but i feel it probably would have happened anyway just maybe a year or two later or something   i also do encourage you to drive one if you can it 's a great thing to try

if i invest x each month where does x go an existing low yield    bond or a new bond at the current interest rate this has to be viewed in a larger context   if the fund has outflows greater than or equal to inflows then chances are there is n't any buying being done with your money as that cash is going to those selling their shares in the fund   if though inflows are greater than outflows there may be some new purchases or not   do n't forget that the new purchase could be an existing bond as the fund has to maintain the duration of being a short term intermediate term or long term bond fund though there are some exceptions like or high yield where duration is n't likely a factor does that just depend on what the fund manager is doing at the time    buying selling no it depends on the shares being created or redeemed as well as the manager 's discretion if i put y into a fund and leave it there for 50 years where does y    go when all of the bonds at the time i made the purchase mature   you 're missing that the fund may buy and sell bonds at various times as for example a long term bond fund may not have issues nearing maturity because of what part of the yield curve it is to mimic does y just get reinvested in new bonds at the interest rate at that time y gets mixed with the other money in the fund that may increase or decrease in value over time   this is part of the risk in a bond fund where nav can fluctuate versus a money market mutual fund where the nav is somewhat fixed at $ 1/share

not in the slightest   the issue is however the same one   we 've created new industries to replace the ones lost in many cases 1:1 because advancing technology simply displaced jobs or made them higher on the education pay scale   likewise in a lot of cases rather than reduce employment overall we saw increased productivity   that is good for everyone since a rising tide lifts all ships   the issue however is one of stability   when you get a shock to the system 2008 etc then the whole thing falls apart   last time it took spending on a scale of wwii along with a number of important factors to break the downward spiral   i 'm wondering what 's going to break this one   last time there were plenty of mid skill high pay jobs manufacturing to the economy   this time most of those jobs are gone having been replaced either by automation or sent overseas to cheaper labor markets   now once the rest of the planet catches up or if fuel starts to go into the again then we 'll see a lot of those jobs come back as some already have   i do n't think we 'll see as many as we had in the past   the service market is far more susceptible to shocks than manufacturing however just as a sales tax is far more susceptible to shocks than an income tax   drawing all of that together though if you take it out to its logical conclusion when we hit full automation and even fast food is run by machines what are people going to do for employment

entire books have been written on how to get to the end of the month before you get to the end of the money it 's a very broad problem but in your case let me point out that your salary never suddenly disappears unless you 're paid in cash and it blew away or was stolen while you were sleeping you spent it   for a month monitor your spending one approach is to write everything down in a small notebook come up with categories like rent food transportation and look at the totals over time you can estimate what you spend in a normal week or month on these things when you spend much more you can ask yourself why it might be because you just money you did n't have on something you did n't need it might be because something broke and you had n't been saving a small reserve month after month to pay for those repairs when they would be needed it might be because some bills only come once a year or every 6 months and you had n't been saving a small reserve to pay that bill when it came in   once you understand where your money is going and why it sometimes runs out you can work out what to do about that it might involve spending less but that 's not the first step the first step is not to be surprised by sudden that are anything but

there are a few reasons particularly for businesses the first is opportunity cost that chunk of money they have could be used to get higher returns somewhere else if they can borrow from a bank at low interest rates to finance their ongoing operations they can use their cash to get a higher return somewhere else the second is credit rating for public companies ratings companies give high emphasis to companies with large reserves this strengthens their ability to pay back the loan should it become necessary a good credit rating in turn let 's the company borrow money at lower rates when a company can borrow money at low rates it circles back to the first point where they can now put their reserves to better use the third is leverage companies can use the cash they have built up to leverage into a larger investment assuming the investment works out it will pay for the cost of borrowing over time for instance let 's say i have $ 1 million to invest i can pay all cash for a $ 1 million apartment building or i can leverage that into a $ 3 million building assuming i run it well the tenants will pay for the cost of borrowing $ 2 million and at the end of the term i 'll be left with my $ 3 million building

i would add only and you alluded in this direction but to clarify that barter economies rarely ever exist if you ask an economist about the origin of money they usually offer thus barter to credit story because adam smith this line of development it subsequently became true even though there was no evidence for it    anthropology has come a long way since smith lived and we now know that early societies were communal as in from each according to their means etc the term of art is gift economy where there are no or of who owes exactly what but rather a general sense of mutual obligation   accounting credit and debt as we think of them were a result of dealing with people you did not trust money being a debt arose from this mistrust and was typically only used to settle the most serious matters stolen wives murder etc in a way that could prevent deadly conflict by protecting the honor of the money was intended to replace the lost person    money debt and the rest have come in and out of fashion over the ages the efficiency argument is really null if you consider a gift economy and there have been prolonged periods since the first use of metallic money in which money has gone away for most of the middle ages for example europe reverted to credit and gift economies believe in fact that the use of money comes to typically prevail in societies that are rife with mistrust and lost persons that is societies plagued by war and slavery slaves being historically one of the primary products of war the rise of money usually brings the rise of a creditor class a debtor class who approximate slaves even though not losers in war per se and a terrific amount of social strife and that leads often to collapse if not addressed by periodic debt

suppose you have a bar of gold and are hungry i buy the gold from you for cash which you then use to buy food clothes and generally support yourself   would it be fair to say that i paid for your food clothes etc i do n't think so i think you paid for them in gold i facilitated the exchange of gold into money and without me or someone like me around to provide liquidity for your gold you 'd still be hungry but fundamentally it was the gold that was valuable   now suppose there is a lack of liquidity in gold there 's a shortage of gold buyers i take advantage of this distortion to offer to buy your gold for half its free market value you do n't want to accept this deal but since your only alternative is starvation you accept   i say this is wrong not because of socialism but because of capitalism the efficiency of capitalism arises from the price system of value goods and services command a fair market price and buyers and sellers have access to both liquidity and good information about the relative value of things when distortions are allowed to interfere with free market pricing as inevitably happens under faire capitalism this efficiency is lost good government regulation is necessary to keep markets free and efficient and this is good for everyone   so what does this have to do with david siegel   first nothing in my example above changes when you substitute labor for gold if i am hungry but i have a skill and i sell you some of my labor for cash then use the cash to buy food you did not give me the you did not pay for my food you did not make it possible for me to get food or anything of the sort i paid for it myself by trading labor for cash in exactly the same way that you could trade gold for cash   second the price system of value allows you to earn a normal profit which means sufficient profit for resources to remain within an industry but excess profit harms market efficiency and thus the price system this is pure capitalist theory straight from adam smith it is nothing to do with socialism or communism it is quite clear that david siegel is taking excess profit this is no different from the sort of profiteering i described when there 's only one gold dealer in town it is parasitic behavior according to capitalist theory   and finally david siegel is the guy who invented high pressure selling of by inviting to a free vacation trapping them in a room and basically holding them hostage until they sign on the dotted line his business is near criminal you can argue that drug also create thousands of jobs that does n't make them good people or their actions beneficial to society i already thought david siegel was a parasite on society before i ever heard of his opinion on obama and quite frankly i 'm shocked and appalled that people are actually defending him

the principle to follow is called pay yourself first have your savings deducted from your paycheck before it hits your checking account you spending will change to accommodate the reduction if you have a 401(k available from your employer start saving some money via that if not figure out a way to have something moved out of your checking account to a separate savings account when your paycheck hits then as you get raises up the amount of automatic savings by half of the raise you will find this hurts less than you think and it will let you build an emergency fund which is the first thing you need when the emergency fund is 6 months of normal spending then you can start to invest

is there a solution here that would allow me to provide him with a    debit card in his name that i could fund that would n't have foreign    transaction fees associated with it i 'd probably be okay with a small    fixed atm fee   there are separate issues here   there is no law limiting bank accounts to u.s. citizens but most banks will not open an account for a non citizen outside their declared service area   there are substantial legal liabilities to the bank in allowing it whether a citizen or non citizen    the difficulty will be compliance with the patriot act   this is an extension of the older know your customer doctrine   it is improbable that the bank could comply with the act without the potential customer being physically present   you would have to check with your bank in advance as to their policies   banks are not required to accept a customer outside their policies as to waiving the foreign transaction fee that is very improbable   although a handful of institutions do this in specific cases it is uncommon because the bank is n't actually charging the fee they are passing it along   with a credit card they collect interest and waiving the fee can be thought of as a reduction in interest income that is n't possible on a debit card you would want to make sure you have a honest nephew   you could be held criminally liable for any actions he takes at both the state and the federal level   u.s. law is global   a citizen who commits a crime in any country of the world can be charged for it in the united states   by being on the account you can acquire any liabilities that are created as an   this is a bigger issue at the federal level because 4,000 federal laws do not require criminal intent   some do not require you to even know the action happened   unlike state law which generally requires you intended to commit a crime and had to be aware of it federal law often does not   it is also not adequate that the action is legal in russia if it would be illegal in the united states if i get a card in my name and give it to him to use to withdraw money from atms is that legal what problems might that cause it is legal but you are now strictly liable for its use   see the above answer   it would probably get shut down anyway when they phone you and asked are you in russia right now   the bank is still liable for you giving away the card   the bank may close out all your accounts and submit a currency transaction report on you to the treasury for possible money laundering wire the money   plan out how much and when but just wire it

market capitalization is the value the market attributes to the company shares calculated by multiplying the current trading price of these shares by the total amount of shares outstanding so a company with 100 shares trading at $ 10 has a market cap of $ 1000 it is technically not the same as the value of a company in the sense of how much someone would need to pay to acquire the company enterprise value is what you want to determine the net value of a company which is calculated as the market capitalization + company debt as the acquirer has to take on this debt company cash as the acquirer can pocket this for itself the exact boundary for when a company belongs to a certain cap is up for debate for a large cap   a market capitalization of $ 10 is usually considered the cutoff with $ 100 + billion behemoths being called mega caps anything between $ 10 billion and billion is considered mid cap from to ~$200 million it 's called a small cap and below $ 200 million is nano cap   worth noting that these boundaries change quite dramatically over time as the overall average market capitalization increases as companies grow for example in the 80s a company with a market cap of $ 1 billion would be considered large cap the market determines what the market cap of company should be based usually but certainly not always on the historical and expected profit a company makes for a simple example let 's say that our $ 1000 market cap company makes $ 100 a year   this means that this company 's earnings per share is $ 1 if the company grows to make $ 200 a year you can reasonably expect the share price to rise from $ 10 to with the corresponding increase in market cap this is all extremely simplified of course

technical analysis is based more on psychology than anything else as an example if an analyst estimates or believes that a stock is undervalued or simply wants to re balance their portfolio then they will buy some amount moving the price up others in the market see the upwards move as the start of an upwards trend an indication that the stock is undervalued or perhaps even that an insider is trading ahead of better than expected data from the firm they then buy the stock creating a self fulfilling prophecy and pulling more traders in as they see an upward trend being confirmed this is even more pronounced in a bear market as fear is an even stronger driver when a trader sees a stock is falling they are more likely to jump to the conclusion that it is due to expected poor performance of the firm and that the firm and the economy are both in trouble and going down than to think that it is simply a or a large investor re balancing etc to quote credit suisse 1   a chart is a mirror    of the mood of the crowd and not of the fundamental factors thus technical analysis is the    analysis of human mass psychology therefore it is also called behavioral finance the underlying truth that makes technical analysis work is that people are predictably irrational at least in the short run and tend to follow the same patterns of thought references 1 2 3 cfa level 1 syllabus

they are overpriced to begin with   one reason is the fact that they are luxury cars   a second related reason is that they tend to push the technology envelope    all cars depreciate drastically the minute they are driven off the lot   this a good argument for buying a car that is 1 2 years old   the higher you are the more you can fall    repairs and maintenance are typically still expensive on these cars due to relative rarity and the lack of necessary expertise   here is where that advanced technology bites you   this is a reason that a 5 year old civic may be worth more than than a 10 year old benz   it may simply not be worth the hassle of maintaining repairing a luxury car   this is especially true for an aging luxury car   there are some people that only buy domestic precisely because of the maintenance costs   also a 10 year old car is still a 10 year old car regardless of the make   there are a few notable exceptions like the and have a great reputation for reliability and long term total cost of ownership better is a subjective issue that depends on a variety of variables   a civic is certainly not better in terms of technology comfort etc   but it is likely better in terms of maintenance reliability etc   which better you focus on is up to you

your employer pays the expected but estimated taxes for you so the chances are you do n't own more but that might be different if you have other sources of income that he does n't know about interest on savings or a side job or whatever also you could have deductions that reduce the taxes you owe which he again does n't know so you overpay if you do n't file you do n't get them back most tax software companies offer free usage of their tool for standard filings and you can use it to find out your tax situation and then buy the tool only when you want to file if you use one of those you can type in all your data and depending on the result decide to buy it and file right away note that if it turns out you owe taxes you must file and pay but of course you can do it manually instead of buying the tool if it turns out you get money back it is your decision to file you probably do n't care for a small amount but if you get 1000 $ back you might want to file again buying the software of doing it manually

the 3 and 9 figures are based on the cost of borrowing money and all the other ownership costs associated with real estate   from the same article because it 's usually still much cheaper to rent than to own the same    size and quality house in the same school district in rich    neighborhoods annual rents are typically only 3 of purchase price    while mortgage rates are 4 with fees so it costs more to borrow the    money as it does to borrow the house renters win and owners lose    worse total owner costs including taxes maintenance and insurance    come to about 8 of purchase price which is more than twice the cost    of renting and wipes out any income tax benefit imagine you are renting a house if the cost of your annual rent is lower than x then renting is obviously the best idea from a monetary calculation if rent is greater than y being a landlord makes more sense in the middle it is debatable and the non monetary reasons need to be considered

if you take a loan you make a contract with your lender let 's call them bank even if it might not be a real bank   this loan contract contains an agreed upon way of paying back the loan   both sides agreed upon these conditions   any change of it like paying back early needs the consent of both sides   so in general no you can not just pay back everything earlier unless the other side accepts this change of the contract consider it from the bank 's point of view   they want to earn money by getting the interest you have to pay when you pay back everything nice and slowly   it is their business   they plan on these expected revenues etc so if for whatever reason you have to pay back the whole remaining loan at once you create a revenue loss for the bank and are liable for this financial damage   in german the term for this is which translates to prepayment penalty or acceleration fee   you just have to pay it so in the end you come out like if you were paying back the loan in the agreed upon fashion however many loan contracts contain the option to pay back early at specific points in time in specific amounts and under specific conditions

no absolutely not   income tax rates are marginal   the tax bracket 's higher tax rate only applies to extra dollars over the threshold not to dollars below it   the normal income tax does not have any where one extra dollar of income will cost more than one dollar in extra taxes moreover you are ignoring the personal exemption and standard deduction   a gross salary of $ 72,000 is not the same as taxable income of $ 72,000   the deduction will generally be $ and the exemptions will be $ 3,900 for you your spouse and any kids   so married filing jointly with the standard deduction will get an automatic $ 20,000 off of adjusted gross income when counting taxable income   so the appropriate taxable income is actually going to be more like $ note that getting your compensation package may result in different tax treatment   but simply taking a smaller salary rather than taking some compensation as stock options health insurance or fringe benefits is not a money saving move   never do it

what could a small guy with $ 100 do to make himself not poor the first priority is an emergency fund one of the largest expenses of poor people are short term loans for emergencies being able to avoid those will likely be more lucrative than an s&p investment remember just like a loan if you use your emergency fund you 'll need to refill it be smart and pay yourself 10 interest when you do it 's still less than you 'd pay for a payday loan and yet it means that after every emergency you 're better prepared for the next event to get an idea for how much you 'd need you probably own a car how much would you spend if you suddenly had to replace it that should be money you have available if you think must buy a new car better have that much available if you can live with a you 're still going to need a few k.   having said that the next goal after the emergency fund should be savings for the infrequent large purchases the emergency fund if for the case where your car unexpectedly gets totaled the saving is for the regular replacement again the point here is to avoid an expensive loan   paying down a mortgage is not that important mortgage loans are cheaper than   car loans and much cheaper than payday loans still it would be nice if your house is paid when you retire but here chances are that stocks are a better investment than real estate even if it 's the real estate you live in

if you 're absolutely certain that you wo n't buy a house within a year or so i 'd still be tempted to put some of the money into short term cds ie a max of 12 months i think that at the moment cds are a bit of a mug 's game though because you 'd hardly find one that offers better interest rates than some of the few savings accounts that still offer interest a savings account is probably where i 'd put the money unless i could find a really good deal on a cd but i think you might have to check if they 've got withdrawal limits there are a couple of savings accounts out there that pay at least 1 yes i know it 's pitiful so i 'd seek out one or two of those from memory both sallie mae and amex offer those and i 'm sure there are a couple more it 's not great that your money is growing at less than inflation but if you 're saving for something like a downpayment on a house i would think that nominal capital preservation is probably more important than the potential for a higher return with the associated higher risk

trading at the start of a session is by far higher than at any other time of the day this is mostly due to markets incorporating news into the prices of stocks in other words there are a lot of factors that can affect a stock 24 hours a day but the market trades for only 6.5 hours a day so a lot of news accumulates during the time when people can not trade on that news then when markets finally open people are able to finally trade on that news and there is a lot of price discovery going on between market participants in the last minutes of trading volumes increase as well this can often be attributed to certain kinds of traders closing out their position before the end of the day for example if you do n't want to take the risk a large price movement at the start of the next day affecting you you would need to completely close your position

you might want to read about about the coase theorem   in law and economics the coase theorem attributed to ronald coase describes the economic efficiency of an economic allocation or outcome in the presence of externalities the theorem states that if trade in an externality is possible and there are no transaction costs bargaining will lead to an efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property rights in practice obstacles to bargaining or poorly defined property rights can prevent bargaining this is similar to what you are asking each country has an endowment of gold and they must create a set amount of money to represent their endowment of gold this will establish an exchange rate if i have 5 tons of gold and you have 5 tons and i print 10 dollars and you print 20 then one of my dollars is worth two of your dollars   thus the amount of money is not   it 's the exchange rate between the countries if all the nations know each other 's gold endowment then we will have a perfect exchange rate if we do n't then currency printing will vary but arbitrage should drive it to an accurate price   gold and diamonds are both valuable in part due to scarcity but gold has been used as a measure of value because it 's been historically used as a medium of exchange people just realized that swapping paper was safer and cheaper than physically transporting gold but the idea of gold as a measure of value is present because that 's how it 's always been nobody creates these procedures but organizations like the imf ecb fed reserve etc implement monetary policy to regulate the money supply and arbitrage drives exchange rates to fair values

luke i 'd like to point out some additional benefits of the roth ira accounts 1 going roth you can effectively increase the amount of your contribution to your ira account in your example you are assuming that your contribution to roth ira is in fact $ 85 $ 100 less $ 15 tax paid in reality albeit more costly roth ira allows you to contribute full $ 100 $ less $ tax incurred using this method you can in fact grow your tax free funds to $ over 30 years the larger you effective tax rate is the larger will be the difference between your maximum effective traditional vs roth ira contribution will be 2 should you need to access your ira funds in case of emergency unqualified event of not buying your first home nor paying for your college education roth ira account contributions can be withdrawn without incurring the 10 penalty charge that would be imposed on your unqualified traditional ira distribution 3 as other contributors noted it 's hard to believe that lower us tax rates would prevail chances are you will be contributing to traditional 401k later throughout your work life having a roth ira account would afford you a tax diversification needed to hedge against possible tax rate hikes coming in the future considering the future of the social security funding and ever growing us national debt can we really expect for there to not be any tax rate increases in the next 20 40 years by the way as others pointed out your effective tax rate will always be lower than your marginal tax bracket

it appears the company you 're talking about did not report as you expected them to which is not unusual for otc companies because as stated they are not well managed that being said reports on edgar are available as soon as they 're posted   i 'm not aware of any lag between when the company uploads their report and it is available on the edgar site looking at the profile of the company you 're referring to i 'm curious why you 'd be so interested in a company with huge negative earnings a near zero share price and an obviously spotty history of reporting its numbers   in order to make any money with this stock you 'd have to buy a huge number of shares which could be difficult to unload   further the fees you 're going to pay to make your trades are very likely to outstrip your return so you 'd be upside down on it this company has pretty negative financials and in a world of cheap oil alternative energy and the companies that deal in it are out of vogue so they 're not likely to see a turnaround anytime soon   they 're spending money on r d at a rate almost 17 times earnings and the losses are while revenues are not improving all that much   these guys are bleeding to death and there 's little prospect of a financial on the horizon this is as they say a dog with so your best bet is to find something else to put your money into i hope this helps good luck

gt;but on the bright side the most common decade for people to start saving is in their 20s twice as many 30 to 49 year olds said they started saving in their 20s instead of their 30s while the 50 to 64 age group was only slightly more likely to have started saving in their 20s over their 30s according to the report which adults living in the continental u.s.   so they are basing their analysis of how early people start saving purely by studying people in their 30s and 40s with those in their 50s and 60s they do n't compare either of those age groups with those in their 20s and 30s to see how things have changed

in my experience any kind of equity you may be offered by the company is just a carrot your offer may be written in such a way that your potential ownership represents say 1 of the company today but if the company goes for a round of financing your ownership percentage can get diluted if this happens a couple of times and the terms of financing are n't very favorable then your percentage can go from that 1 down to 0.001 making the equity worthless i 've known people who heard their company was being bought and thought they might get some kind of payoff come to find out the company had n't done all that well and there was n't anything to pay out after the main investors got some money back the main investors took a loss for obvious reasons management was n't keeping the staff up to date about the fact that they were operating in the red and their options were worthless some people about lawyers and filing lawsuits but at the end of the day there was n't any money to be won keep this in mind as to your question regarding what to look out for

yeah there 's a lot to talk about with basic income like how currently there is an incentive to not work harder or move up the socio economic ladder because as you earn more your welfare benefits go away so people think it 's not worth getting a better job because they will pay more in taxes and lose benefits but now they are working harder and not getting more for it a basic income would n't go away with that sweet new job promotion therefore there is an incentive to work more   i like the basic income idea but i wonder about how to handle immigration and global relations you will have it in some countries where others are like literally falling apart basically we have a long way to go until we are comfortably collecting our bi checks at least in the us

you say   my work is steady even if i lost my job it 'd be easy to get another location has been static for a few years now but i 'm not sure that 'll extrapolate to the future i 'm lazy so i do n't want to move but for a significantly better job opportunity i would n't mind    the general rule of thumb is that you 'll come out ahead if you buy a house with a mortgage and live there for five years   what you lose in interest you make up in rent   and living there for five years you make back your closing costs in equity   if you 're there less than five years though you do n't make back the closing costs   you 'd have been better off renting    historically up to about twenty years ago your mortgage payment and rent payment for the same basic property would be about the same   i.e. if your current landlord sold you what you are renting your mortgage payment would be roughly the same as your rent   maybe a little lower or a little higher but about the same   more recently it has n't been strange to see a divergence in those   now it is not uncommon for a mortgage payment to be 50 higher than rent on the same property    this has some consequences   first your $ 1000 rent probably wo n't stretch as far as a $ 1000 mortgage payment   so you 'll be buying something that you 'd only pay $ 650 or $ 700 rent   second if you move and ca n't sell immediately you 'll get less in rent than you 'd pay in mortgage   rather than contributing to your income the property will require subsidy just to maintain the mortgage   and in the early years of the mortgage this means that you 're paying all of the principal equity and some of the interest    buying a duplex makes this worse   you have your side and their side   you can substitute your $ 1000 rent for half of the mortgage payment   meanwhile they are paying $ 700 in rent   you have to subsidize the mortgage by $ 300   plus you are talking about hiring a property management company to do things like lawn maintenance   there goes another $ 100 a month   so you are subsidizing the mortgage by $ 400    i do n't know real estate prices in utah but a quick search finds a median house price over $ 200,000   so it seems unlikely that you are buying new construction with new appliances   more likely you are buying an existing duplex with existing appliances   what happens when they fail   the renter does n't pay for that   the property management company does n't pay for that although they 'll likely arrange for it to happen   you pay for it    also it often takes a bit of time to clean up the apartment after one tenant leaves before the new tenant starts paying rent   that 's a dead weight loss   if this happens during a local recession you could be carrying the mortgage on a property with no offsetting rental income for months    there are some forces   for example if house prices in your area are increasing the rent will increase with them not necessarily at the same pace   but your mortgage payment stays the same   so eventually the rent may catch up with the mortgage payment   if you wait long enough in a strong enough market the rent on the other half of the duplex may cover the entire mortgage payment    if you currently have an urban apartment within walking distance of work and switch to a suburban apartment with a commute you have a better chance of finding a duplex where the entire mortgage payment is only the $ 1000 that you pay in rent   your half of the duplex wo n't be as nice as your apartment is and you 'll have a half hour or hour long commute every morning and the same to get home in the evening   but on strictly fiscal terms you 'll be doing about as well   plus you have the income from the other half   so even if your mortgage payment is more than your rent payment you can still break even if the rent covers it    consider a $ 1400 mortgage and $ 400 in rent from the other half after property management fees   so long as nothing goes wrong you break even   perhaps the agreement is that your parents take care of things going wrong broken appliances troublesome tenants time between tenants   or perhaps you drain your emergency fund and adjust your 401(k payment down to the minimum when that happens   once your emergency fund is replenished restore the 401(k    if you 're willing to live in what 's essentially a $ 500 apartment you can do better this way   of course you can also do better by living in a $ 500 apartment and banking the other $ 500 that you spend on rent   plus you now have the expenses of a commute and five hours less free time a week    you describe yourself as essentially living paycheck to paycheck   you have adequate savings but no building excess   whatever you get paid you immediately turn around and spend   your parents may view you as profligate   your apartment is nicer than their early apartments were   you go out more often   you 're not putting anything aside for later except retirement    it did n't use to be at all strange for people to move out of the city because they needed more space   for the same rent they were paying in the city they could buy a house in the suburbs   then they 'd build up equity   so long as they stayed in roughly the same work location they did n't need to move until they were ready to upgrade their house    the duplex plan leads to one of two things   either you sell the duplex and use the equity to buy a nicer regular house or you move out of the duplex and rent your half   now you have a rental property providing income   and if you saved enough for a down payment you can still buy a regular house    from your parents perspective encouraging you to buy a duplex may be the equivalent of asking you to cut back on spending   rather than reducing your 401(k deposits they may be you trading in your car for a cheaper one and trading in your nice but expensive apartment for something more reasonable in a cheaper neighborhood   rather than working with a property management company you 'll be out doing rather than with your friends   and maybe the new place would have more space to share when you meet someone you are n't going to provide many grandkids alone    if you get a mortgage on a duplex you are responsible for paying the mortgage   you are responsible even if something happens to the house   for example if a fire burns it down or a takes it away   or you just find that the house is n't solid enough to support that party where all of your friends are jumping up and down to the latest pop sensation   so beyond losing whatever you invest in the property you may also lose what you borrowed    now consider what happens if you invest the same amount of money in general motors as in the house   let 's call that $ 10,000 and give the house a value of $ 200,000   with general motors even if they go bankrupt tomorrow you 're only out $ 10,000   with the house you 're out $ 200,000   admittedly it 's much hard to lose the entire $ 200,000 value of the house   but even if the house loses $ 80,000 in value you are still $ 70,000 in the hole    you do n't need a disaster for the house to lose $ 80,000 in value   that 's pretty much what happened in the 2006 2010 period   people were losing all of what they invested in houses plus having to declare bankruptcy to get out of the excess debt   of course if they had been able to hold on until 2015 markets mostly recovered   but if you lost your job in 2008 they would n't let you not make mortgage payments until you got a new one in 2012    when you declare bankruptcy you do n't just lose the house   you also lose all your emergency savings and may lose some of your belongings    there are some pretty disasters too   for example you and your tenant both go away for a weekend   it rains heavily and your roof starts to leak due to weak maintenance so not covered by insurance   the house floods destroying all the electronics and damaging various other things   bad enough if it 's just you but you 're also responsible for the tenant 's belongings   they sue you for $ 20,000 and they move out   so no rent and big expenses   to get the house livable again is going to take $ 160,000   plus you have a $ 190,000 mortgage on a property that is only worth about $ 40,000   that 's at the extreme end

and i 'm reading through the pack of stuff   there should be a soft copy of terms and conditions if so please put up a link generally 0 apr comes with some strings attached the literature on the bank of america site shows 0 apr only for balance transfers done with 60 days   on one of the comparison sites the bank of america card shows 0 only for balance transfers and purchases done in first 60 days 0 introductory apr for 12 billing cycles for purchases and for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days then variable apr 3 fee min $ 10 applies to balance transfers which means that if you spend say $ 200 in first 2 months you can repay this $ 200 in next 12 months at 0 apr however if you spend another $ 100 in 3 month this should be paid in full along with a portion of $ 200 else interest would start for all of $ 300 generally 0 apr do n't make sense as there are lots of hidden terms and conditions and the real benefit may not be that great   edits the literature looks quite confusing on the main page it says introductory apr    0 for 12 billing cycles    applies to purchases and to any balance transfers made within 60 days of opening your account this would mean say you do a balance transfer within 60 days of 120 and say you make purchases with 60 days of 120 total liability is 240   scenario 1 assume you do not use this card then you can safely keep making payments of 20 per month for next one year scenario 2 in 3rd month you swipe for 100 more now the total due will be 100 + 20 if you make the payment of 120 then fine if you make a payment of only say 50 then the interest will be calculated for 240 40 payments for 2 of current month i.e. on 250 however the detailed terms of conditions seem to limit this only to balance transfer of 120 in first 60 days and not to any purchases in first 60 days with terms so vague my suggestion do n't get this card for these benefits get this if you need a regular card

ipo is initial public offering just so you know the valuations are done based on the company business model intellectual property products market shares revenues and profits assets and future projections you know the usual stuff yes it is and very frequently done in fact i ca n't think of any company that is now publicly traded that did n't start this way the first investor the one who the company is the first one who invests in it after raising the capital even if it is from his own bank account to pay the fees for filing the incorporation papers what is the difference between normal investor and angel what do you refer to as angel how is it abnormal to you any investor can play a role depending on the stake he she has in the company if the stake is large enough the role will be significant if the stake is the majority the investor will in fact be able major decisions regarding the company how he bought the stocks whether through a closed offering initial investment or on a stock exchange does n't matter at all you may have heard of the term angels with regards to high tech start up companies these are private investors not funds that invest their own money in start ups at very early stages they 're called angels because they invest at stages at which it is very hard for entrepreneurs to raise money there 's no product no real business usually it is a stage of just an idea or a patent with maybe initial prototype and some preliminary business analysis these people gamble in a sense and each investment is very small relatively to their wealth tens of thousands of dollars sometimes a hundred or two thousands and they make a lot of these some may fail and they lose the money but those that succeed bring very high returns imagine investing 10 k for 5 stake at google 15 years ago those people are as investors as anyone else and yes depending on their stake in the company they can influence its decisions

yes the stock market is rigged to some extent but if you are good at game theory then you can predict the direction of bias and therefore take advantage of the rigged nature of the market eventually enough people become aware of the bias and then the people who are manipulating the market have to change their strategy this is just how the market works though its always worked this way it has just become more and more sophisticated   look at it this way if you control billions of dollars in equities then you have to manipulate the market to give you a favorable price if you do nt manipulate then day traders and speculators will drive up the price of a security before you can even get your money in   so the big players try to manipulate the market and the small fish try to predict the manipulation welcome to the jungle

because i feel the answers given do not represent the answer you are expecting i 'd like to re but include more information when you own stock in a company you own some of that company when that company makes profit you usually receive a dividend of those profits if you owned 1 of the company stock you should recieve 1 of the profits if your company is doing well someone might ask to buy your stock the price of that stock is supposed to be worth a value representative of the expected yield or how much of a dividend you 'd be getting   the worth of that is what you 're betting on when you buy the stock if you buy $ 100 worth of coca cola stock and they paid $ 10 as dividend you 'd be pretty happy with a 10 growth in your wealth especially if the banks are only playing 3 so maybe some other guy sees your 10 increase and thinks heck 10 is better than 3 if i buy your stocks even as much as 6 more than they are worth $ 106 i 'm still going to be better off by that extra 1 than i would be if i left it in the bank so he offers you $ 106 and you think awesome i can sell my $ 100 of cola shares now make a $ 6 profit and buy $ 100 worth of some other share i think will pay a good dividend then cola their profits and they only made 2 profit that guy that bought your shares for $ 106 only got a dividend of $ 2 since their worth is still $ 100 and effectively he lost $ 4 as a result he bet on a better than 10 profit and lost out when it did n't hit that now imho while the stock market was supposed to be about buying shares and getting dividends people brokers discovered that you could make far more money buying and selling shares for perceived value rather than waiting for dividends to show actual value especially if you were not the one doing the buying and selling and risk but instead making a 0.4 cut off the difference between each purchase broker fees so tl;dr   many people have lost money in the market to those who made money from them but only the traders and gamblers

in my experience when a salesperson says a particular deal is only good if you purchase right now 100 of the time it is not true of course i ca n't guarantee that is universally the case but if you leave and come back 5 minutes later or tomorrow or next week it 's extremely likely that they 'll still take your money for the original price in fact sometimes after you leave you get a call with even a lower price than the excellent offer most of the time when you are presented with high pressure sales accompanied by a this price is only good right now pitch it ends up being because they do n't want you to go search the competition and read reviews in this case you have already done that and deemed the item to be worthwhile perhaps a better tactic for the salesperson would have been to try to convince you that others are interested in the item and if you wait it might be sold to someone else at that excellent price sales is an art and it requires the salesperson to size you up and try to figure out your vulnerability and exploit it this particular salesperson obviously you and/or you do n't have an easily vulnerability i would n't let the shortcomings of the salesperson get in the way of your purchase if you are worried about the scenario of someone else up the item consider offering a deposit to hold the item for a certain amount of time while you reflect and/or arrange for the funds

there are several ways to protect against or even profit from a market correction hedge funds do this by hedging that is buying a stock that they think is strong and selling short a paired stock that is weak if you hold say a strong retail company in your portfolio you might sell short an equal weight of a weak retail company   these are like buying insurance on your portfolio if you own 300 shares of xyz currently trading at $ 68 you buy puts at a level at a strike price that lets you sleep at night for example you might buy 3 xyz 6-month puts with a strike price of $ 60 a disadvantage is that the puts are wasting assets that is their time premium which you paid for at the outset becomes zero at expiration this is why it is like insurance you would n't complain that your insurance premium was lost when you purchase insurance on your house and the house does n't burn down would you of course not the purpose of the insurance is to protect your investment note that as these puts are married they only protect your portfolio instead of profiting from a correction you would merely protect your portfolio during a correction no small feat if your portfolio is similar to the market you can buy s&p index puts if your market reflects a lot of technology you can buy technology sector puts   say you have a portfolio of $ 80 k that reflects the market you could buy out of the market puts again reflecting your tolerance for loss any losses in your portfolio after the puts go in the money would be more or less offset by gains in the puts   an advantage is that the bid ask spread is smaller for the s&p. you would pay less for the protection also the s&p puts are cash settled meaning you get money put in your account on the business day after expiration day a disadvantage is that the puts do not linearly go up as the market drops delta hedging is a big deal in and of itself another disadvantage is that they are wasting assets see the married puts section previous while the s&p puts can be used to maintain your market portfolio in the midst of a correction you could purchase more puts than needed if you had correctly timed the market then your portfolio with puts would increase your mileage may vary some have predicted an imminent market crash way too often collars involve selling out of the money calls and using the premiums to buy out of the money puts there are many varieties of collars but the most straightforward is to sell 1 call and buy 1 put for every 100 shares this can also be done for index puts and calls this has the effect of simultaneously you get your insurance for almost free but again it is protecting your portfolio   as the name implies you make money when the market goes bearish   bear put spreads involve buying puts at a close strike price and selling an equal number of puts at a lower strike price than the first you have a defined maximum loss the premium you paid for the higher put minus the premium you received for the lower put you have a defined maximum gain the difference between strikes minus the defined maximum loss   buy s&p 500 index puts if you buy deep out of the money puts it wo n't cost much but you have little probability of it paying off but if they go in the money there could be a sizable payoff this is similar to putting one chip on red 18 on the roulette wheel but rather than paying off it is a variable payoff if you 're $ 1 in the money you just get $ 100 if you 're $ 12 in the money you have a $ 1200 payoff   if you buy at the money puts it will cost a lot and your probability will be about 1 in 2 that you will pay off in our roulette analogy this is like putting 30 chips on the even bet of the roulette wheel the variable payoff is as in the previous paragraph but you 're more likely to get a payoff and you will lose it all of the roulette ball lands on an odd number 0 or 00 that is the underlying of your put goes up or stays the same if your research shows you what good stocks to buy it may also tell you which stocks are ripe for a fall you could short sell these stocks or buy puts on them   similar to short selling stocks or buying puts you could sell short overpriced sectors or buy puts on them there are etfs that will allow you benefit from falling prices without needing to have a margin agreement or options agreement in place   sorry to have a lengthy answer many other answers emphasize that one should n't try to time the market but that is not the op 's question provided here are both

the simple answer because you believe every other option can yield greater losses so the thinking is lend it to france you 'll get your money back put your money in a bank and there 's a chance you wo n't get it back if the bank goes bust investors also believe that rates will continue to go more negative in which case they will actually make money   it 's a momentum play which will eventually reverse but since the bond market is extremely liquid it 's a bet that can quickly be unwound another theory floating around is that if the weaker countries of the euro leave e.g. greece etc and the core keep the euro then the value of the euro will actually rise so by putting your money in french or german bonds you would also be securing cash in french or german euro 's thinking the on a euro break up

you ca n't blame businessmen for wanting to run their operations more efficiently   as much as i dislike overseas call centers and severely question their trade off low cost for low quality the cost benefits can save a business from going under e.g. 100 man call center possible over there 100 man call center locally not possible due to costs    in many cases the business is forced to use the less expensive option both by necessity and common business sense i 'm not going to run the numbers but after you add all the taxes and regulatory requirements the difference is significant    as for president i dislike all career politicians but would prefer someone with extensive business experience if i had to make a choice    from a business stand point was romney successful with investing his money it certainly seems so now contrast that with obama 's own equity record of investing taxpayer money and then check out all that red and and bare benefit   seems pretty obvious to me who has the worse record here

seems to me you do n't have a ton of great choices but of them keep going as you are   if when the car becomes unusable without significant expenses stop using it   buy another junker and use that to get by until your loan is paid off   from now until then put aside a few hundred or whatever you can if more each month towards the anticipated purchase   when you do buy this junker pay in cash no loan   just get something that will take you to work and that includes bike if that 's a possibility   when you can sell the no longer usable car to finish paying off the loan start aggressively paying off the current loan with the eye of getting it down to where you 're not underwater anymore   then sell the car and dispose of the loan and buy a better replacement   scrimp and save and cut everything eat cheaply and never out cut your personal expenses everywhere you can   if you get another $ 250 a month towards principal you can probably be no longer underwater in about a year get a personal loan today for the amount that you 're underwater and immediately sell the car   this gets you out of the loan and car the quickest and if you think the car will devalue significantly between now and when you might be not underwater anymore this might be the best option   but it 's the most expensive likely you 'll pay 12 to 20 on the difference   now 12 of $ 5000 is less than 5 of 15000 so it might actually be a good financial deal but you 'll probably have to shop around to get 12 15 with a 660 though it 's probably possible   you 'll still be without a car at this point though so you 'd have to buy another one or live without for a while and you 'd still have a payment of some sort but perhaps a more manageable one $ 5000 12 5 years means something a bit over $ 100 a month for example i recommend that if you can get by without a car for a while option 2 is your best bet   all of these will require some financial care for a while and probably cutting back on expenses for a year or two but realistically you should n't expect anything else   get a budgeting app if it will help see how to do this as far as getting out of the loan without paying it i do n't recommend that at all   your credit will be ruined for at least seven years and 660 is not bad at all really and then would take   yet more years to recover   you will likely be sued for the balance plus collection costs beyond repossession   the consequences would be far far worse than just paying it off and i mean that financially as well as ethically

i 'm an aussie and i purchased 5 of these properties from 2008 to 2010 i was looking for positive cash flow on properties for not too much upfront investment the usa property market made sense because of the high aussie $ $ at the time the depressed property market in the us and the expensive market here   i used an investment web site that allowed me to screen properties by yield and after eliminating outliers went for the city with the highest consistent yield performance i settled on ohio as it had the highest yields and was severely impacted by the housing crisis i bought my first property for $ 18 k us which was a little over $ 17 k aud   the property was a duplex in great condition in a reasonable location   monthly rentals $ and rents guaranteed and direct deposited into my bank account every month by section 8   taxes $ 900 a year and $ 450 a year for water total return around $    my second property was a short sale in a reasonable area the asking was $ k and was a single family in good condition already   i went through the steps with the bank and after a few months was the proud owner of another positive cash flow property returning $ 600 a month gross taxes of $ 600 a year and water about the same   $ k net a year on a property that cost $ k third and fourth were two single family in good areas   these both cost $ k each and returned $ a month each   $ k for two properties that gross around $ k a year    my fifth property was a tax foreclosure of a guy with 2 kids whose wife had left him and whose friend had stolen the money to repay the property taxes   he was basically on the bones of his butt and was staring down the barrel of being homeless with two kids   the property was in great condition in a reasonable part of town   the property cost me $ 4k.   i signed up the previous owner in a land contract to buy his house back for $ payments over 10 years at 7 came out to around $ per month   i made him an offer whereby if he acted as my property manager i would forgo the land contract payments and pay him a percentage of the rents in exchange for his services i would also pay for any work he did on the properties   he jumped at it   seven years later we 're still working together and he keeps the properties   right now the aud is around 80c us and looks like falling to around by june 2015   rental income in aussie $ $ is around $ every month this month jan 2015 i have transferred my property manager 's house back to him with a quit claim deed and sold the remaining houses for $ k   after taxes and commission i expect to receive in the vicinity of k   which is pretty good for a $ k investment   i 've also received around $ 30 k in rent a year i 'm of the belief i should be buying when everybody else is selling and selling when everybody else is buying    i 'm on the look out for my next positive cash flow investment and i 'm thinking maybe an emerging market by the oil shock    i wish you all happiness and success in your investment take care vr

the key word you forgot to include from slide 29 is free riding investopedia defines free riding as in the context of a brokerage firm a free rider problem refers to a situation where a client has been allowed to purchase shares without actually paying for them and then subsequently sells the shares ideally for profit the problem with this scenario is that the client if allowed to free ride can profit from a stock trade without actually using any of his or her own capital this is illegal i have not heard of any issues with this type of action being a problem with trading accounts in australia nor have i been able to find any such rules on the asx website or any of by brokers websites so i think this may be an issue in the usa but not australia you should check the rules in any other countries you wish to trade in

for starting with zero knowledge you certainly did a great job on research as you hit on most of the important points with your question   it seems like you have already saved up around six months of expenses in savings so it is a great time to look into investing the hardest part of your question is actually one of the most important details   investing in a way that minimizes your taxes is generally more important in the end than what assets you actually invest in as long as you invest even semi reasonably   the problem is that the interaction between your home country 's tax system and the u.s. tax system can be complex   it 's probably likely still worth maxing out your 401(k ira sep 529 accounts if you qualify to avoid taxes but like this question from an indian investor it may be worth seeing an investment professional about this   if you do see a fee based professional preferably one familiar with your country    if tax advantaged accounts are not a good deal for you or if you max them out a discount broker is probably a good second option for someone willing to do a bit of research like you with this money investing in broadly diversified low fee index mutual funds or exchange traded funds is generally recommended   among other benefits diversified funds make sure that if any particular company fails you do n't feel too much pain   the advantages of low fees are fairly obvious and one very good reason why so many people recommend vanguard on this site   a common mix for someone your age is mostly stocks local and international and some bonds   though with how you talk about risk you may prefer more bonds some people recommend this up a bit with a small amount of real estate reits sometimes even other assets   the right portfolio of the above can change a lot given the person   the above mentioned adviser and/or more research can help here if in the future you start to believe you will go back to your home country soon that may throw much of this advice out the window and you should definitely reevaluate then   also if you are interested in the math stats behind the above advice a random walk down wall street is a light read and a good place to start   investing makes for a very interesting and reasonably profitable math stats problem

since you are not yet legally married he is a stranger to you and strictly speaking you do n't need to worry about the tax impact of his income yet file on your income alone that said you may have to address the money transfer aspect at a later date as banks are getting around money laundering regulations it 's really best if he has his own account for this especially given you are not married the worst case scenario is that his income gets frozen due to money laundering regulations and the deposits in your account get treated as unreported monetary gifts to you again you should be able to argue out of this but separate accounts make it much easier to do so

a few of the answers are spot on but here 's another thing to consider the type of trade for example i sometimes day trade stocks with momentum where the stock price is spiking relatively fast a limit order in this situation may never get filled and you will miss out on the trade a market order will get you filled but you mostly likely pay more than your limit order however you are now catching the wave up   overall using a limit or market is relative to your trading style and the type of trade i always prefer to use a limit buy order

i am not a lawyer nor a tax accountant so if such in here i 'll gladly defer but my understanding is   if you 're involved and living together you 're considered a household and thus your finances are deemed shared for tax purposes any money your partner gives you toward paying the bills is not considered rent but her contribution to household expenses i do n't know the but i 'll call your partner her for convenience this is not income and is not taxed on the off chance that the irs actually investigated your arrangement do n't call any money she gives you rent call it her contribution to living expenses if you were two or more random people sharing a condo purely for economic reasons i.e. you are not a family in any sense but each of you would have trouble affording a place on your own it 's common for all the room mates to share the rent or mortgage utilities etc but for one person to collect all the money and write one check to the landlord etc tax law does not see this as the person who writes the check collecting rent from the others it 's just a book keeping convenience and so there is no taxable transaction of course the landlord owes taxes on the rental income but that 's not your problem in that case it likely would be different if one person outright owned the place and really was charging the others rent but then he could claim deductions for all the expenses of maintaining it including depreciation so if it really was a case of room mates sharing expenses the taxable income would likely be just about zero anyway so short answer if you really are a couple there are no taxable transactions here if the irs should actually question it do n't refer to it as collecting rent or any other words that imply this is a business arrangement describe it as a couple sharing expenses people sometimes have created tax problems for themselves by their choice of words in an audit but the chance that you would ever be audited over something like this is probably remote i suppose that if at some point you break up but you continue to live together for financial reasons or whatever reasons that could transform this into a business relationship and that would change my answer

i and probably most considering trading had a similar thought as you   i thought if i just skimmed the peaks and sold before the perhaps aided by computer i 'd be able to make a 2 here 2 there and that would add up quickly to a nice amount of money   it almost did seem foolproof then i realized that sometimes a stock just slides down and there is no peak higher than what i bought it for   that 's ok i 'd think i 'm sure it will recover and surpass the price i bought it for so now i play the waiting game   but then it continues sliding and my $ 10k is now worth $ 7k   do i sell   did i build a stop loss point into my computer program   if so what is the right place to put that stop   what if there is a freak dip down and it triggers the stop loss but then my stock recovers   i just lost $ 14,000 like this last week luckily only virtually the point is your idea only has half a chance to work when there is a mildly volatile stock that stays around some stable baseline and even then it is not easy   and then you factor in fees as others mentioned people do make money doing this day traders and some claim you can use technical analysis to time orders well so if you want to try that read about technical analysis on this site or elsewhere

re life insurance multi purpose vehicles generally do n't work as well as just going with single purpose well except for the person company selling them   whole life plans are a great deal for the insurance company and agent not so much for you the easiest way to prove this to yourself is to get the difference in price between a simple term life product that would be appropriate to provide for your family in the event you die   then get the price for a whole life product with the same benefits and what it would be worth after say 20 or 30 years take the difference you would have to pay figure what it would be worth if invested conservatively over the same period figuring in some conservative figure for compound growth such as 6 percent what you could get from a good long term savings bond or index based mutual fund    the last time i did this the pure value of the money alone without any interest was within something like 80 of the value of the whole life policy adding in even a conservative amount of interest turned it into a no brainer the whole life plan was terrible as in investment vehicle   i was far far better off using term life and investing the difference

the simple answer is that you are correct you should not purchase a house until you are financially stable enough to do so a house is an asset that you must maintain and it can be expensive to do so   over the long term you will generally save money by purchasing however in any given year you may spend much more money than a similar rental situation even if the rent is higher than your mortgage payment if you are financially stable with good cash savings or investments plus a 20 down payment then anytime is a good time to buy if that is part of your financial plan as of now in 2016 is is safe to assume that mortgage rates    would should not get back to 10    does this mean that one should always buy a house only when mortgage    rates are low is it worth the wait if the rates are high right now the mortgage rates are not the primary driver for your purchase decision that might be like saying you should buy everything on sale at target because it 's on sale do n't speculate on future rates also keep in mind that back when rates were high banks were also giving much better savings cd rates that is all connected   is refinancing an option on the table if i made a deal at a bad time    when rates are high you need to make sure you get a loan that allows it always do a break even analysis looking at the money up front you spend to refi vs the savings per year you will get this should give you how many years until the refi pays for itself if you do n't plan on being in the house that long do n't do it how can people afford 10 mortgage buying a house they can afford taking into consideration the entire it should be a reasonable amount of your monthly income generally 25 or less note that this is much less than you will be approved for by most lenders   do n't let good rates suck you into a deal you will regret make sure you have the margin to purchase and maintain a home consider where you want to be living in 5 years do n't leave so little financial breathing room that any bump will place you at risk of foreclosure   that said home ownership is great i highly recommend it

the first thing you need to know is that getting a new social security number will not erase your credit history in fact using a name change or a social security number change to get out of debt is considered fraud in most jurisdictions and you can be arrested for it as soon as you are issued a new social security number your old number and new number are linked in the government and credit bureau files everything that was on your old credit report will appear on your new credit report the second big thing to know is if you suspect that your social security number has been used fraudulently in regards to credit stop reading this right now immediately call one of the three major credit bureaus experian transunion or equifax and place what 's called an initial fraud alert you only need to call one of the three the one you call will notify the other two this places a flag on your credit file at all three bureaus which says that your identity may have been stolen and any financial institution which is processing an application for credit should immediately contact you at the phone number you provide the alert is good for 90 days and you can renew it as many times as you wish i suggest using transunion as your one call because i 've called them when my identity was stolen and they 're automated system is very well designed now that that is out of the way you said that they have your email address but it is very unusual for people to be contacted by email for a debt in fact i would automatically disregard any emails about debts every legitimate financial institution i 've ever come across will either call you or send mail to your last known address regarding what 's being reported on your credit report you need to type a letter to each credit bureau which is reporting the information telling them who you are and that you are disputing this information on your report mail it to the bureaus by certified mail with return receipt under united states law they are required to verify the information on your report if you dispute it and remove the information if they are unable to verify it in many cases it 's too much of a hassle and the bureaus just remove the information the other thing i 'll leave you with is that you said you 've only had credit in the past six months six months is not enough time to build an adequate credit profile you really need to be strategic about your credit score every time you apply for credit it drags the score just a little bit lower your question was n't really about building credit so i 'll spare you the novel on that but i would encourage you to seek out one of the many resources which are readily available online i am not an attorney this is not legal advice you should consult with an attorney who is licensed to practice law in your particular jurisdiction

in general you are expected to pay all the money you owe in taxes by the end of the tax year or you may have to pay a penalty but you do n't have to pay a penalty if the amount you owe i.e. total tax due minus what you paid in withholding and estimated taxes is less than $ 1000 you paid at least 90 of your total tax bill you paid at least 100 of last year 's tax bill i think point 3 may work for you here suppose that last year your total tax liability was say $ 5,000 this year your tax on your regular income would be $ 5,500 but you have this additional capital gain that brings your total tax to $ 6,500 if your withholding was $ 5,000 the amount you owed last year than you 'll owe the difference $ 1,500 but you wo n't have to pay any penalties if you normally get a refund every year even a small one then you should be fine i 'd check the numbers to be sure of course if you normally have to pay something every april 15 or if your income and therefore your withholding went down this year for whatever reason then you should make an estimated payment the irs has a page explaining the rules in more detail

for one thing fund managers even fund management companies own less money than their clients put together on the whole they simply can not underwrite 50 of the potential losses of the funds they manage and an offer to do so would be completely unsecured warren buffet owns about 1/3 of berkshire hathaway so i suppose maybe he could do it if he wanted to and i wo n't guess why he prefers his own business model investing in the fund he manages or used to manage over the one you propose for him keeping his money in something so secure he could use it to cover arbitrary losses on b h buffett and his investors have always felt that he has sufficient incentive to see b h do well and it 's not clear that your scheme would provide him any useful further incentive you say that the details are immaterial supposing instead of 50 it was one part in a million then it would be completely plausible for a fund manager to offer this invest 50 million lose it all and i 'll buy dinner to but would you be as attracted to it as you would be to 50 then the details are material actually a fund manager could do it by taking your money putting 50 into the fund and 50 into a cash account if you make money on the fund you only make half as much as if you 'd been fully invested so half your profit has been taken when you get back the fund value + cash if you lose money on the fund pay you back 50 of your losses using the cash worst case scenario the fund is completely wiped out but you still get back 50 of your initial investment the combined investment vehicle has covered exactly half your losses and it subtracts exactly half your profit the manager has offered the terms you asked for -50 leverage but still does n't have skin the game your proposed terms do not provide the incentive you expect why do n't fund managers offer this because with a few exceptions 50 is an absurd amount for an investment fund to keep in cash and nobody would buy it if you want to use cash for that level of inverse leverage you call the bank open an account and keep the interest for yourself you do n't expect your managed fund to do it furthermore supposing the manager did invest 100 of your subscription in the fund and cover the risk with their own capital that means the only place they actually make any profit is the return on a risk that they take with their capital on the fund 's wins losses you 've given them no incentive to invest your money as well as their own they might as well just put their capital in the fund and let you keep your money they 're better off without you since there 's less paperwork and they can invest whatever they like instead of carefully matching whatever money you send them if you think they can make better picks than you and you want them to do so on your behalf then you need to pay them for the privilege riding their for free is not a service they have any reason to offer you it turns out that you can not force someone to expose themselves to a particular risk other than by agreeing that they will expose themselves to that risk and then closely monitoring their investment portfolio otherwise they can find ways to insure hedge the risk they 're required to take on if it 's on their books but cancelled by something else then they are n't really exposed so to provide incentive what we normally want is what buffett does which is for the fund manager to be invested in the fund to keep them keen and to draw a salary in return for letting you in their investment can not precisely match yours because the fund manager 's capital does n't precisely match your capital it does n't cover your losses because it 's in the same fund so if your money vanishes the fund manager loses too and has nothing to cover you with but it does provide the incentive all right i admit it worst case scenario there 's a total banking collapse end of civilization as we know it and the cash account defaults but then even in your proposed scheme it 's possible that whatever assets the fund manager was using as security could fail to so why you might ask do individual fund managers get bonuses in return for meeting fixed targets instead of only being part paid in shares in their own fund whose value they can then maximise i honestly do n't know but i suspect lots of reasons probably the psychology of rewarding them for performance in a way that compares with other executive posts or professions they might take up instead of fund management probably the benefit to the fund itself which wants to attract more clients of beating certain benchmarks probably other things including frankly human error in setting their compensation packages

log returns are very commonly used in financial maths especially quantitative finance   the important property is that they 're around 0 with respect to addition this property makes it possible to talk about an average return for instance if a stock goes down 20 over a period of time it has to gain 25 to be back where you started   for the log return on the other hand the numbers are down over a period of time and up to get you back to square 1 in this sense you can simply take an arithmetic average and it makes sense   you can freely add up or subtract values on the log return scale like log interest rates or log inflation rates   whereas the arithmetic mean of non log returns is simply meaningless a stock with returns -3 and + 3 would have 0 on average when in fact the stock has declined in price the correct approach on direct price returns would be to take a different mean e.g. geometric to get a decent average   and yet it will be hard to incorporate other information like subtracting the risk free rate or the inflation rate to get rate adjusted average returns in short log returns are easier to handle esp in bulk but non log returns are easier to comprehend imagine as a number of their own

it will likely only increase as unemployment rises too   most companies which request degrees or unnecessary levels of experience generally do so as a way to filter out applications as unemployment rises and the number of people applying for each job increases i would imagine that will become more widespread   two things which reddit feels very passionately about and understandably so are   1 companies not paying a living wage    2 companies requesting unnecessary levels of qualification or experience and thus making it very difficult for young people to find work    unfortunately it seems like solving one of these problems will only exacerbate the other

presumably you need a car to get to work so let 's start with the assumption that you need to buy something to replace the car you just lost the biggest difficulty to overcome in buying a car is the concept of the monthly payment dealers will play games with all of the numbers to massage a monthly payment that the buyer can swallow but this usually does n't end up giving the customer the best deal the 18 month term is not normal for a lease typically you 'll see 24 or 36 months you are focusing on another goal of paying your student loans by then which would free up much more money for other wants like a car but at what cost the big difficulty of personal finance is the mental mind game of delaying gratification for greater long term benefit you are focusing on paying your student loans now so that you can be free of that debt and have more flexibility for the future good you 're tempted to spend another $ 5400 assuming no down payment or other surprise fees to drive a car for 18 months that does n't sound any wiser than $ 5,000 for an unreliable used car that gave you more problems than you for presumably you got some percentage of that money back from the insurance company when the car was totaled but even if not the real lesson should be finding a car that you can afford up front but also one that you can still use when the loan is paid off like your education that investment will keep giving even when the loans are a distant memory my advice would be to look for a car that has about 30k miles on it and pay for it as quickly as possible then drive it at least for 70 120k more miles before replacing it you may wish for a newer car especially in 3 or 4 more years when it starts to show its age but you 'll also thank yourself when you can buy a newer better car with cash and break out of the monthly payment game that dealers try to push on you you might even enjoy negotiating with car salesmen when you see through their manipulations and simply work for the best cash price you can get

i dug up an old article on motley fool and one approach they mention is to get the stock certificates and then sell them to a friend if the company was liquidated you should receive a 1099-div form at     year 's end showing a liquidating distribution treat this as if you    sold the stock for the amount of the distribution the date of sale    is the date that the distribution took place using your original cost    basis in the shares you can now compute your loss if the company has n't actually been liquidated you 'll need to make    sure it 's totally worthless before you claim a loss if you have    worthless stock that 's not worth the hassle of selling through your    broker you can sell it to a friend or cousin aunt or uncle for    pennies however you ca n't sell the stock to a spouse siblings    parents grandparents or lineal descendants here 's one way to do    it send the certificate to your stock transfer agent explain that the shares have been sold and ask to cancel the old shares and issue    a new certificate to the new owner some brokerages will offer you a quicker alternative by buying all of your shares of the stock for a penny they do it to help out    their customers in addition over time some of the shares may    actually become worth more than the penny the brokers paid for them by selling the shares you have a closed transaction with the stock and can declare a tax loss meanwhile your friend relative or    broker for a pittance has just bought a or liner

let me start with something you might dismiss as trite correlation does not mean causation   a money manager charging say 1 is n't likely to take on clients below a minimum level   on the other hand there 's a long debate regarding how on average managed funds do n't beat the averages   i think that you should look at it this way people that have money tend to be focused on other things a brain surgeon making $ 500k yr may not have the time nor the inclination to want to manage her own money   i was always a numbers person i at the difference between raising 1.1 to the power getting i.e. getting times your investment after 40 years at 10 vs at 9 that 1 difference feels like nothing but after a lifetime 1/3 of your money has been skimmed off the top the data show that one can do better by simply putting their money into a mix of s&p index and cash and beat the average money manager over time regardless of convoluted 12 asset class allocations   similarly there are people who use a tax guy in quotes because i mean this as an individual whom they go to year after year not a storefront my used to go to one and i was curious what they got for their money each year he sent them a form 3 pages they needed to fill in every cell made its way into the guy 's tax program the last year i went with them to pick up the tax return i asked him if he noticed that they might benefit from small roth conversions each year or by making some of their ira rmd directly to charity he kindly told me that 's not what we do here and us away i planned both questions in advance the roth conversion was a strategy that one could agree made sense or dismiss as convoluted for some clients but the rmd issue was very different they did n't have enough schedule a deductions to itemize therefore the $ 3000 they donated each year was n't impacting their return by donating directly from their iras this money would avoid tax it would have saved them more than the cost of the tax guy who charged a hefty fee in my opinion it seemed to me this particular strategy should be obvious to one whose business is preparing returns

before i answer you should know a few things about me i 've paid to get into a couple of network marketing multi level marketing franchises and i made a little money in it i have worked in financial services sales i later went on to get my masters in business administration i 've been there and i know mlms and business in theory and practice there 's room for some nuance here but for the most part do n't do it there 's no snake oil out there that people ca n't get on their own if you can sell it to them then here 's the simple case against it if you 're a good enough salesman to get other people to buy products or franchises from you and really you do n't care about product sales you care about franchise sales because that 's how they sold it to you right you can make far more money selling business to business   if you 're a good enough sales manager that you can get good salespeople to buy franchises from you and sell more franchises you 'll make far more money managing salespeople selling business to business   for the most part people are n't good at sales and that likely includes you most mlm 's are sales groups with bad salespeople leading bad salespeople it 's the blind leading the blind and as your friends get burned and your family gets burned and you start losing everyone who got burned you 'll start to wish you had never done this stuff in the first place the main reason the above holds true is that the people involved in mlm do n't really create any value they 're looking to get a free ride on everyone else in the pyramid beneath them   there are exceptions the main ones that come to mind are like mary kay where ok mostly women makeup artists teach women how to apply makeup without looking like a clown and it 's a skill and it 's part of how they create value and it may well be the best option for someone whose chosen career is a makeup artist i 'm not particularly an exception but at the age of 17 i sold books door to door in southern mississippi mostly to teach myself how to talk to people since i had grown up with my nose in a book it turned out that the business was structured like a mlm to encourage the salespeople to become managers but i had no interest in that i just wanted to learn people skills i also blew a couple hundred bucks on franchise fees on other mlms mostly because friends were in it never did i see that money ever again   sales is hard work teaching people how to sell is even harder and impossible if you do n't know how if you 're good at it you 'll do so much better in a business to business setting think about the economics of it salespeople get paid on volume of sales businesses have a lot more money than consumers you have to sell to an awful lot more consumers than businesses to make the same amount of money think about competition too considering amway you 're competing with everyone from walmart to the corner convenience store and you will be asking everyone and their brother to join up and many of them have already been pitched it if they 've been around long enough the bargaining strength of your customers they have lots of alternatives and suppliers their over priced pricing structure is set in stone is pretty strong you have immense direct competition and product substitutes and anyone else can go into the same business as you your competitive position is extremely weak it 's almost guaranteed to fail you probably do n't have the skills you 'll burn your relationships and you 'll make more money doing almost anything else

you should have separate files for each of the two businesses   the business that transfers money out should write check in its qb file   the business that receives money should make deposit in its qb file in qb you write check even when you make the payment by some other means like ach   neither business should have the bank accounts of the other explicitly represented    on each side you will also need to classify the payment as having originated from gone to some other account to know what 's correct there we 'd need to know why your transferring the money in the first place and how you otherwise have your books established   i think that 's probably beyond the scope of what 's on topic feasible here money into your business from your personal account is probably owner 's equity unless you have something else going on   for example on the s corp you should be paying yourself a salary   if you overpay by accident then you might write a check back to the company from your personal account to correct the mistake   that 's not equity it 's probably a negative expense in some other account that tracks the salary payments

learn something new every day i found this interesting and thought i 'd throw my 2c in good description i hope from short selling what is short selling first let 's describe what short selling means when you purchase shares of stock in purchasing stocks you buy a piece of ownership in the company you buy sell stock to gain sell ownership of a company when an investor goes long on an investment it means that he or she has bought a stock believing its price will rise in the future conversely when an investor goes short he or she is anticipating a decrease in share price short selling is the selling of a stock that the seller does n't own more specifically a short sale is the sale of a security that is n't owned by the seller but that is promised to be delivered   still with us here 's the skinny when you short sell a stock your broker will lend it to you the stock will come from the brokerage 's own inventory from another one of the firm 's customers or from another brokerage firm the shares are sold and the proceeds are credited to your account sooner or later you must close the short by buying back the same number of shares called covering and returning them to your broker if the price drops you can buy back the stock at the lower price and make a profit on the difference if the price of the stock rises you have to buy it back at the higher price and you lose money so what happened the plan the reality lesson i never understood what shorting a stock meant until today seems a bit risky for my blood but i would assume this is an extreme example of what can go wrong this guy literally chose the wrong time to short a stock that was in all visible aspects on the decline   how often does a large company or individual buy stock on the decline and send that stock soaring how often does a stock go up 100 in 24 hours 600   another example is recently when bought 10 of weight watchers and caused the stock to soar 105 in 24 hours you would have the day you shorted that stock on that particular day if you believed enough to gamble on it going down in price

if you have enough medical expenses to empty your hsa tax free that is certainly an option however you have another option you could roll your hsa funds over to a different hsa that has better investment options doing this has a huge advantage over any other taxable account or retirement account it will grow tax free and you will be able to withdraw tax free at anytime as long as you accumulate enough medical expenses to cover your gains   if you do n't have a lot of money in your hsa now it might not be worth the effort to maintain an hsa and continue to track your medical expenses but if you have enough in there to invest moving it to an investable hsa is probably a better option than simply moving it to a taxable account

good question your assumptions are a bit off track though i am sure you would agree that automation will occur gradually allowing a new workforce that is with relevant skills to support automation tech and operations to bubble up this workforce will drive up consumer spending offsetting your assumption of diminishing consumer spending    the extent to which this new workforce will offset diminishing consumer spending of the being laid off is a matter of debate but one thing is certain consumer spending albeit relatively weaker or stronger will exist and businesses will continue to thrive another possibility is that the workforce getting laid off might be in other sectors of the economy or better yet some companies might re train some of it    the assumption that most of the jobs will be automated does n't necessarily imply that automation leads to job loss some automation will actually drive up productivity which will increase the margin of companies in light of this logic we can assume that employees will be paid more increasing their disposable income     the bottom line is that consumer spending is unlikely to bottom out it might weaken or strengthen for one or two reasons but people will continue consuming and businesses will thrive

my father this advice to me when i was a teenager and it has n't failed me yet > pay yourself first what this means is that the first bill you pay should always be your savings preferably in a way that automatically comes out of your paycheck or account without requiring you to take an active step to make it happen   i save a ton of money but i am no more disciplined than anyone else i just realized that over the years of progressing in my career that i gradually got higher and higher salaries yet never had a substantial increase in the money i had leftover in my bank at the end of the month despite the fact that i make about the money i used to live reasonably comfortably on therein is the point we spend whatever money we see so you almost have to hide it from yourself first participate to the fullest in your company 's 401k if they offer it after a while you will adjust naturally to the net take home pay and wo n't miss the savings you are accumulating absent that or in addition to that set up a separate bank or investment account and arrange an automatic transfer from your checking account every month then set up automatic investing in cd 's or some other less liquid than cash investment so you it is just enough hassle to get at the money that you wo n't do it on a whim it sounds too simple but it works

just to argue the other side 1.49 is pretty low for a loan let 's say you have the $ 15k cash but decide to get the car loan at 1.49 then you take the rest of the money and invest it in something that pays a ~4 dividend a utility stock etc you 're making money on the difference of course there 's no guarantee that the underlying stock wo n't drop in value but it might go up too and you 'll likely pay income tax on the dividends still you have a good chance of making money by taking the loan so i will argue that there are scenarios where taking advantage of a low interest rate loan can be good as an investment opportunity when the risk reward is acceptable be careful though there 's nothing wrong with paying cash for a car

getting the right diversity of investments helps buffer you from some of the short term market swings if you need advice it 's worth spending a small part of that money on a consultation with a financial adviser who can talk to you about your goals your time horizon and your risk tolerance and recommend a good starting distribution free advice from brokers risks being biased by their commissions once you have that plan need to decide how to execute it low fee index funds are a good way to get started until you learn more and for many of us that 's all we ever need then you need to decide whether to invest it all at once or dollar cost average i 've heard arguments both ways dca does mean you risk missing some gains but also reduces your risk of buying at a temporary high and taking some immediate losses for me dca seemed to make sense but that 's another decision for you to make

you 're not missing anything consumer protection in the us is very basic and limited if at all so if someone claims you owe them something it would be really hard for you to prove otherwise unless you actually drag them to court especially if there actually was a relationship and there probably is some paperwork to substantiate the claim i suggest talking to a consumer issues attorney

because you 've sold something you 've received cash or at least an entry on your brokerage statement to say you 've got cash so you should record that as a credit in your brokerage account in gnucash the other side of the entry should go into another account that you create called something like open positions and is usually marked as a liability account type if you need to mark it as such if you want to keep an accurate daily tally of your net worth you can add a new entry to your open positions account and offset that against income which will be either negative or positive depending on how the position has moved for against you you can also do this at a lower frequency or not at all and just put an entry in when your position closes out because you bought it back or it expired or it was exercised my preferred method is to have a single entry in the open positions account with an arbitrary date near when i expect it to be closed and each time i edit that value daily or weekly so i only have the initial entry and the current adjust to look at which reduces the number of entries and confusion if there are too many

individual product prices do not necessarily rise at inflation rates   what inflation means is that the purchasing power of one unit of currency decreases by x% in a year which is typically measured by looking at a broad spectrum of products in an economy and to all products   so for all products across an economy the aggregate price of all goods will on average be x% higher that they were this time last year   some products will be cheaper some will be more expensive but on average their prices will rise with inflation rates for the other part of your question inflation is an annualized percentage so an inflation rate of 12 means prices are 12 higher than they were a year ago so if you extrapolate that linear trend prices will rise again on average 1 in a month

the loss for b can be used to write off the gain for a.   you will fill out a schedule 3 with cost base and proceeds of disposition   this will give you a $ 0 capital gain for the year and an amount of $ 5 50 of the $ 10 loss you can carry forward to offset future capital gains   you can also file a and carry the losses back up to 3 years if you 're so inclined   it ca n't be used to offset other income unless you die your c and d trades ca n't be on income account except for very unusual circumstances   it 's not generally acceptable to the cra for you to use 2 separate accounting methods   there are some but you should probably just use capital gains    there is one caveat that if you do short sales of canadian listed securities they will be on income account unless you fill out form and elect to have them all treated as capital gains i just remembered one wrinkle in carrying forward capital losses   they do n't reduce your capital gains anymore but they reduce your taxable income   this means your net income wo n't be reduced and any benefits that are calculated from that line will not get an increase

what are reasonable administrative fees for an ira was recently discussed here my answer was zero   an ira is not an investment it 's a container representing the tax status of an account once you decide what to actually invest it in you 'll likely incur additional fees mutual funds for instance can range from .05 per year to 2.00 or more in your case you are telling us you are spending 2 per year even before you decide what to invest in   the real question i 'd like to see answered is what value can an advisor bring to one 's retirement account to deserve a fee   my final thought most financial types had been suggesting that a retiree can target a 4 per year withdrawal after retiring this rule of thumb has been debated since the lost decade of 2000 2009 and the safe number may be lower if an advisor is taking 2 off the top you are basically sharing half your income with him a million dollar ira you get $ 20 k he gets $ 20 k

the most tax efficient way to get some cash would be to sell some stocks from the fidelity account that have the lowest capital gains the tax will typically be 15 of the capital gains this will be a one time cost which should save you money compared to paying 7.5 on the loan year after year tax on selling the stock options will probably be higher since you imply there would be high capital gains and some of the proceeds might even be taxed as income not capital gains

this is a very trivial scam flow is like this send money to mr. x you in this case call mr. x and ask for the money back because mistake usually they ask for a wire transfer cash gift cards prepaid cards or something else irreversible mr. x initiates transfer back to scammer accept the transfer from mr. x dispute the original transfer or otherwise cancel it through the mr. x can not dispute his transfer to the scammer since it was genuinely and intentionally initiated by mr. x. end up with twice the money at the expense of mr. x in other countries this is usually done with forged checks but transfers can work just as well as long as the transfer can be retroactively canceled or reversed the scam works you mentioned money laundering this is definitely a possibility as well they transfer dirty money to you from sources and you send a gift to them with a clear paper trail when the audit comes the only proof is that you actually sent them the gift and no one will believe your story you 'll have to explain why the mr. z who 's now in jail sent you a $ 1 k of his drug money however in this case i think it is more likely a scam and the scammer did n't really know what he was doing

that depends where you put the top bracket but probably there is little way to jack income tax to anywhere near that without serious detrimental effect to the economy the real issue is not that the wealthiest earn too much but that they have too much there is a huge glut of massive savings at the top that is continually growing and taking money from the economy this savings drives the creation of public debt more than any other factor it is that which needs to be at least in the near term taxed aggressively

if for every buyer there 's a seller does n't that also mean that there were $ in outflows in the same time period yes for every buyer there is a seller the inflows are not being talked in that respect about there being $ in inflows to us equity markets since the election what does that mean lets say the index was at x. after a month the index is at   so lets say there are only 10 companies listed so if the index has moved x to then share price s1 has moved to so if you sum all such shares trades that have increased in value you will get what in inflow in the same period there could be some shares that have lost value i.e. the price or another share was s2 and has moved to the sum of all such shares trades that have decreased in value you will get outflow the terms are gross outflow gross inflow in net terms for a period it can only be inflow or outflow depending on the difference between inflow and outflow the stats are done day to day and aggregated for the time period required   so generally if the index has increased it means there is more inflow and less outflow at times this analysis is also done on segments fi 's inflow is more compared to outflow or compared to inflow of or institutional investors or foreign participants etc

theoretically this concept makes sense   however as recent numbers have shown i do not have the source handy but one can simply obtain this information via the ecb 's website banks have tapped this something in the likes of 500 billion or so and instead of buying sovereign debt they instead prefer to park this money with the ecb paying something like 25 bps on deposits   so instead of using this money to buy sovereigns or perhaps lend to other banks easing the strain on libor banks have just parked this money back with the ecb as the ecb has seen its deposits once again reach record amounts again see the ecb website for proof   just this speaks volumes about the carry trade and how it is evidently not going to achieve its long term goal of bringing spreads down in europe   perhaps in the short run yes but if you look at the fundamentals eurusd the eur basis swap and the libor spread they show how the situation in europe is far from over and the is nothing close to a long term and stable solution

buying and selling cars a lot is something that makes money if you are a dealer but usually does n't if you are not   the question to ask yourself is why you want to sell it    if it is because you are feeling poor and need money it might make sense to sell it particularly if you do n't need it   but $ 12k or whatever is not a ton of money   if you do need a car and will have to replace it if you sell it then selling it is likely not a good idea if it is because you want a nicer car and can afford to upgrade then selling it is likely a good idea   the fact that you have had it for years and not paid off the loan tells me this situation is unlikely you should think of the value of your car to you and the potential cost of replacing it and the amount of money you owe on it as two different things   the debt you have is a debt that you will need to pay no matter what you do with the car or how its value changes   the value of the car to you is pretty much a separate issue from how much you have outstanding in debt    if you want to sell the car to pay off the debt that is fine if you do n't need the car or if you can get a suitable replacement car for much less which i find unlikely

you did borrow money for the downpayment   when you apply for a mortgage loan on your new home you will be required to list all your assets and all your liabilities you must disclose the first mortgage as well as the second mortgage on your current condo as well as the monthly payment on each of these loans   if you took out the second mortgage five years ago you can truthfully say that you have not taken out any loans within the past year to get cash for the down payment when you apply for a mortgage for purchasing your new house but what the lender will be looking at is can   the applicants current income support monthly payments of    $ 1000 for the first mortgage on the condo plus $ 300 for the second    mortgage on the condo plus $ 1500 for the proposed mortgage on the    new house you might argue that you will be selling that condo soon or will be renting it out and that the rental income will cover the mortgage payments on the condo but will the lender give much to this the condo may not sell easily you might not be able to find a tenant right away or be able to rent the condo at a high enough rental to cover the costs etc if you simply save money from your current extra cash flow and use that to make the down payment the lender will be pondering the question can   the applicants current income support monthly payments of    $ 1000 for the mortgage on the condo plus $ 1500 for the proposed mortgage on the new house which deal will the lender be happier with if you are uncomfortable saving your extra cash flow in a savings account or cd or investing it in stocks and/or bonds until you need the money for the down payment on your new house put that money in a sock under your mattress and do n't smoke in bed

i do n't think it 's a coincidence that many of the people who voted for and continue to support trump also believe in the of   anything trump says is so vaguely worded it could mean almost anything   for instance his whole $ 12 a month thing could be construed with enough tweaking to mean medicare as that 's about what someone working part time in a minimum wage job would be paying for medicare   so you see it makes perfect sense

while acknowledging that the affordable care act aka obamacare had much success in providing coverage to low income americans particularly through the law 's expansion of medicaid commonwealth fund president david said the u.s. healthcare system is still not working as well as it could for americans and it works especially poorly for those with middle or lower incomes   this point the commonwealth fund 's analysis noted that in the u.s. 44 percent of lower income and 26 percent of higher income people reported financial barriers to care in the u.k. these percentages are seven and four   want to bet that a good chunk of those 44 were in states that did n't expand medicaid

you hit the nail on the head in the first paragraph the rest was good as well most data is garbage but even a large amount of garbage data can tell you something i would n't touch with a 9 million foot long poll but if 9 million people said was a good buy or said they were bullish on stock or twitter i d buy and sell it by the end of the day people are stupid there 's no argument there but if 9 million idiots are gon na be buying a shitty stock i 'm gon na join them let the price get driven up based on nothing but hive mind idiocy then drop it before they all realize they 've been fooled by their own ignorance    amd has been hilarious i 've been holding amd since 2013 any tech geek would know amd was a great buy back then now all i see are posts about why did amd go up today or will amd hit 100 dollars a share by the end of the year or something equally ludicrous people do n't want to read they just want to spew nonsense and be spoon fed the information by those who are spewing nonsense

government default does n't mean that all us money is immediately worthless   first the bondholders will get stiffed   following that interest rates will shoot up because the us is a bad credit risk at this point and the government will monetize its ongoing expenses i.e. fire up the printing presses if you 're concerned about not having access to your money start pulling out a little extra when you get cash at an atm   build it up over time until you have enough currency to weather through whatever emergency you envision with your bank account

i think it 's a silly statement if you are prepared from the start that you might lose it then you should n't invest you invest to earn not to lose most often losses are a result of fear   remember you only lose when you sell lower than you bought for   so if you have the patience you will probably regain i ask my clients many times how much do they want to earn and they all say as much as possible last time i checked that 's not an objective and therefore a strategy ca n't be built for that   if there is   a strategy then exiting a stock is easy   without a strategy you never know when to exit and then you are exposed to   losses i 've successfully traded for many years with large amounts of money i made money in the fc and in the bubble both times it was n't because i was prepared to lose but because i had an entry and exit strategy if you have both the idea of investing what u are prepared to lose has little value

the easiest options appear to be to open an account with one of the large multinational banks like citi they have options such as opening two separate checking accounts one in each currency and citi in particular has an international account that appears to make currency personal banking easier all of the options have minimum balance requirements or fees for conversion but if you need quick access this seems to be the best bet even if this is a one time event and you do n't need the account a bank like citi may be able to help you cash the check and get access to the funds quicker than a national or local bank alternatively if you know anyone with a us bank account you can deposit it with them and take the cash withdrawal from their account assuming they agree the check is n't too large etc

houses depreciate period things break the hot water heater explodes the ac cuts out in august the roof leaks the basement floods toilets back up dig up the garden each time something breaks the house loses value every year the paint fades a little the house loses value every time ge comes out with a more efficient washing machine the house loses value the only reason a house appears to maintain its value over time is because the money you spend repairing and improving it offsets this unavoidable depreciation even then over extended periods of time it will typically just track inflation so you 're water not that there 's anything wrong with that you need to live somewhere

as someone who used to be an it contractor in the uk and used to work from home my advice is to talk to your accountant in detail it 's been a few years but iirc you can write off some small stuff like proportional heating costs etc but in my case it was so minuscule that it was n't worth the effort you 're likely better off to just leave it < message > talk to your accountant < message >

if the portfolio itself is taxable then yes if you have two stocks and you 're rebalancing them without using new cash you are forced to sell one stock to buy another that sale is taxable unless you 're in some sort of tax deferred deductible account such as an ira    if you 're talking about you being in a mutual fund and the fund itself rebalances the same rules apply as above though indirectly you 'll have capital gains realized and distributed to you those gains will be taxed unless again your account is a retirement account

it would depend how the simulation is run   is all of your revenue coming through a r   is none of it being paid until the end of the credit term   are they simulating disruptions in revenue streams   if it 's simulating daily then cash flows can be all over the place depending on who pays when   in a real business if you set credit terms of net 30 you will find some people pay you the day after you send them the invoice some pay on a certain day of the month   some wait until day 30 some wait until you call them and a few do n't pay at all   they tend to simplify this in the classroom to longer intervals months and just have everyone pay you timely minus some allowance for bad debt     if that 's the case then whatever interval they have you on i would just assume you get paid of the a r due over that term

the state of california should n't be and given credit for removing shitty legislation that should n't have existed in the first place   also to repeat myself because it can not be stated enough the government does not create businesses   hell the state of california might be the most anti business state in the union   in no other state is it as expensive or as difficult to run a compliant business due to the mountains of unnecessary bullshit california makes businesses navigate through

good the quality of programming on tv seems to decrease year after year in an effort to combat people ignoring advertisements the shows now contain horrendous product watch?v = filler which is barely disguised watch?v = and the comedy becomes weaker and weaker as shows like two and a half men go on and on the same tired plots refusing to die as yet more filler appears e.g. mike and   tv is dying not only because people like the freedom of the internet but also because people do n't like shit you get 500 channels of cable 10 of them are those ten are only between 7 and 12 at night if even then   why is tv failing because tv sucks

depending on the student loan this may be improper usage of the funds   i know the federal loans i received years ago were to be used for education related expenses only   i would imagine most if not all student loans would have the same restrictions bonus answer you must have earned income to contribute to an ira e.g. money received from working see irs publication 590 for details   so if your earmarked money is coming from savings only then you would not be eligible to contribute   as far as whether you can designate student loans for the educational expenses and then used earned income for an ira i would imagine that is fine   however i have not found any documentation to support my assumption

you should check if your card issuer provides a bill pay service i have a capitalone card and i know they do n't but wells fargo may i do n't know however for that to work your biller must accept credit cards as payments at least that 's the restriction i have with such a feature on my card that means that if the company does n't accept credit cards directly they 're likely not to participate in the credit cards bill pay system as well some credit cards are actually mailing these balance transfer checks quite frequently trying to you into taking advantage of your available credit unless you really do n't have any other choice you should n't but if that 's the only way you have of paying go for it that not be treated as a cash advance but rather as balance transfer you can call the customer service and have them a check mailed to you you may want to consider talking to your bank and checking if they can give you a line of credit that would be similar to the credit card i.e. revolving credit line from your credit report score perspective but may have lower interest rates

here are the advantages to the hdhp hsa option over the ppo option some of which you 've already mentioned lower premiums saving $ 240 annually your employer is contributing $ 1500 to your hsa   as you mentioned this covers your deductible if you need it and if you do n't the $ 1500 is yours to keep inside your hsa the ability to contribute more to your hsa   you will be able to contribute additional funds to your hsa and take a tax deduction besides the medical expenses applied to your deductible hsa funds can be spent on medical expenses that are not covered by your insurance such as dental vision chiropractic etc   anything left in your hsa at age 65 can be withdrawn just like with a traditional ira with tax due but no penalty on anything not spent on medical expenses with the information that you 've provided about your two options i ca n't think of any scenario where you 'd be better off with the ppo   however you definitely want to look at all the rest of the details to ensure that it is indeed the same coverage between the two options   if you find differences i wrote an answer on another question that walks you through comparing insurance options under different scenarios

home care service providers are primarily there to administer care but they will also look to create a bond and build up compatibility with the person they are caring for for people who have been left by their sickness this could have a positive effect giving them with someone to talk to on a human level rather than an endless slew of medical jargon

this comment might sound like a circle jerk but i think it 's important to say indeed innovation is what creates more productivity which is fueled by debt but debt is fueled by real savings which comes from under consuming which is easier when your productivity is higher the government can stimulate innovation yes but only at the expense of someone else    what 's really scary is the federal reserve has been manufacturing all the savings for nearly a decade now so there 's a complete mismatch between credit and savings and the overall economy the actual price of money itself is manufactured too so just about all asset prices are inherently flawed in my view    i think it 's important to piggy back your point about innovation and how productivity ca n't really go down because inventions and new methods of producing goods do n't we come up with the engine or a new drug for example it 's now here forever ideally it 's work that we do n't have to do all over again   what brings on a crash or feeling like we 're going backwards in terms of progress comes when we somehow manage to go through a boom bust like in 2008 but then take on all this debt normally we can pay off debt but when the government manufactures it and credit is created out of nothing that 's when you get into problems like not being able to pay it back because it was n't truly real or representative of real savings i feel like i 'm ranting now but i think this stuff is super important and i think you understand it

the problem is that you do n't have the money now so they ca n't know with 100 certainty that you will have it on settlement day   what happens if you do n't file the paperwork in time or you change your mind because you think the company stock is going to go through the roof next quarter they would have to pull the funding for the loan the seller would be upset and could even file for damages if the deal falls through   it could even snowball because if they delay the sale then they ca n't buy the new place which impacts another closing frequently lenders want to see the money for the down payment long before settlement   they want to know the money is there and it is n't a hidden loan while you can point to the money in the espp they would still like to see the money in a regular bank account even if you do convince them to delay their evaluation you can count on being asked to prove the existence of the funds in the days before closing or they will delay giving the loan
