on june 30 2015 the value of a key should be exactly the expected revenue from selling the chest contents owing to the fact that the next day the keys become worthless   looking at the steam community market it seems like the value of a key is higher than this but lower than 2.50   if that 's true then since the price of a key is higher than the expected revenue from selling the chest contents as you say then you can see that at some point the value of a key will have to go down   and as you get closer to the cutoff date the price will fall faster   it 's not quite the same but this pattern is usually what you see in the ticket resale market on say   if there 's something about keys that keeps their worth above the expected value of selling chest contents some value to the flexibility that keys offer over other tradable items maybe then in the short run that wo n't change due to this distant deadline just because it 's so far off   people will still want the flexibility keys offer   orthodox economics might suggest sell sooner rather than later but certainly do n't wait too long   different people react differently though   if there are a lot of people who sell their keys after hearing this news it might be a good time to buy   of course it 's a gamble but if you trust in whatever force keeps keys priced above the expected value of the loot they can buy then that force should win out in the medium term and you could turn a profit

you do not need to inform your employer of your additional activity but it is your responsibility not to work for more than 48 hours per week as long as you are an employee so if you are working 38 hours for your employer you may not work for yourself for more than 10 hours it is however not so easy in practice to draw the line between work and a hobby as long as you are not being paid by the hour the main reason to present your employer with an addition to your work contract is to make it legally very clear that he holds no intentions to claim copyright to your work he may attempt to do something funky like claim your home computer is in fact a work computer because you used it once a month to work from home and your work contract may contain a paragraph that all work performed on a work computer results in copyright ownership for your employer i have no idea how likely this is in practice but this is the reason i know is commonly given as legal advice to have a contract so the normal contract you present your employer with says in order to earn user contribution money from a website you need to register as a sole proprietor and pay trade tax and sales tax alternatively you claim small trade exception which also makes a tax return mandatory i would guess however and this is not legal advice in any way just my guess that a couple of contributions towards server cost in a strictly non profit endeavor is not commercial at all but private in the same way that you may write an invoice to someone you sold your old bike to or a kid may get paid to mow someone 's lawn based on that guess my non legal advice recommendation is to take the contributions and do nothing else as long as the amount is nowhere near breaking even if you count your work input

this is assuming that you are now making some amount x per month which is more than the income you used to have as a student otherwise the question seems rather moot all figures should be net amounts after taxes first figure out what the difference in your cost of living is that is housing electricity utilities the basics that you need to have to have a place in which to live i 'm not considering food costs here unless they were subsidized while you were studying basically you want to figure out how much you now have to spend extra per month for basic sustenance then figure out how much more you are now making compared to when you were a student subtract the sustenance extra from this to get your net pay increase after that is when it gets trickier basically you want to set aside or invest as much of the pay increase as possible but you probably have other expenses now that you did n't before and which you can not really do that much about this be particular types of clothes commute fares car gas bus pass or something entirely different anyway decide on a savings goal as a percentage of your net pay increase compared to when you were a student this might be 5 10 or if you are really ambitious 50 or more whichever number you pick make sure it 's reasonable giving your living expenses and keep in mind that anything is better than nothing find a financial institution that offers a high interest savings account preferably one with free withdrawals and sign up for one each and every time you get paid figure out how much to save based on the percentage you determined if your regular case is that you get the same payment each time you can simply set up an automated bank transfer put that in the savings account and for the moment forget about that money try your best to live only on the remainder but if you realize that you set aside too much do n't be afraid to tap into the savings account adjust your future deposits accordingly and try to find a good balance at the end of each month deposit whatever remains in your regular account into your savings account and if that is a sizable amount of money consider raising your savings goal a little the ultimate goal should be that you do n't need to tap into your savings except for truly exceptional situations but still keep enough money outside of the savings account to cater to some of your wants yes bank interest rates these days are often pretty dismal and you will probably be lucky to find a savings account that especially after taxes will even keep up with inflation but to start with what you should be focusing on is not to make money in terms of real value appreciation but simply figuring out how much money you really need to sustain a working life for yourself and then walking that walk eventually this may take anywhere from a couple of months to a year or more you should have settled pretty well on an amount that you feel comfortable with setting aside each month and just letting be by that time you should have a decently sized nest egg already which will help you get over rough spots and can start thinking about other forms of investing some of what you are setting aside whenever you get a net pay raise of any kind gross pay raise lower taxes bonus whichever increase your savings goal by a portion of that raise maybe give yourself 60 of the raise and bank the remaining 40 that way you are hopefully always increasing the amount of money that you are setting aside while also reaping some benefits right away one major upside of this approach is that if you lose your job not only will you have that nest egg you will also be used to living on less so you will have more money in the bank and less monthly expenses which puts you in a significantly better position than if you had only one of those let alone neither

from every article i 've encountered the chicken and egg aspect suggests that iv is produced by looking at options pricing and calculating the iv from that   the implication is that whatever is known at that time is included in the price and that when you see a particular option trade an unusual number of contracts at a given price the implication is that someone thinks they know something that 's not already priced in i.e. that the current price is not accurate they can profit on the future event

there are two types of 529 programs   one where you put money aside each month the one offered by your state may give you a tax break on you deposits you can pick the one from any state if you like their options better during the next 18 years the focus the investment changes from risky to less risky to no risk this happens automatically the money can be used for tuition room board books fees the 2nd type of 529 is also offered by a state but it is geared for a big lump sum payment when the child is young this will cover full tuition and fees not room and board or books at a state school the deal is not as great if they child wants to go out of state or you move or they want to go to a private school you do n't lose everything but you will have to make up the shortfall at the last minute there are provisions for scholarship money if you kid goes to west point you have n't wasted the money in the 529 the money in either plan is ignored while calculating financial aid other options such as the coverdell education savings account also exist but they do n't have the options and state tax breaks accounts in the child 's name can impact the amount of financial aid offered plus they could decide to spend the money on a car the automatic investment shift for most of the state 529 plans does cover your question of how much risk to take there are also ways to transfer the money to other siblings if one decides not to go to college keep in mind that the funds do n't have to be spent as soon as they turn 18 they can wait a few years before enrolling in college

sorry i did n't mean to knock your post   i do think you have valid points   i think it 's great to see discussions on the pros and cons on the vc start up world   my previous work experience was at a start up that made it big sold 90 to news corp at $ 400 mm valuation but was funded by angel investors so it was a different situation   i 'm currently getting my mba now so am looking at the space from both the vc perspective and the start up perspective   vcs can provide real value to start ups and they can also harm them   however no one is forcing the start ups to take vc money most do because it provides a higher probability for a faster path to success   the investment does n't come free obviously as you pointed out   the hours are horrible and you lose significant control   in many situations founders are taken away from the main leadership role   that does n't seem fair   however if someone sold the voting shares of their company they are opting in for that risk   the truth of the matter is that a lot of the people who are amazing at the ideas that birth the start ups are horrible at the day to day management   sometimes vcs step in and make the necessary changes to ensure the best chance at company profitability   is it fair yes   does it suck for the person ousted absolutely   it 's an oversimplification to say this is all bad or all good   it all depends on the situation   however yes there are vcs who are predatory and use their superior knowledge of how business financing and whatever else work to extract as much as they can from their portfolio companies   yet there are also some who honestly love the industry and want to help companies grow     your article 's stance is good because it prompts a discussion   however as i originally felt it does not do it as effectively as it could in my opinion   that 's awesome you got a ton of re tweets but as you say on your blog it 's about substance not the glitter and     edit voting do n't count as glitter and

if you plan on holding the money for 15 years until your daughter turns 21 then advanced algebra tells me she is 6 years old i think the real question is what do you intend for your daughter to get out of this   if you want her to get a real return on her money mike has laid out the information to get you started deciding on that but at 6 is part of the goal also teaching her about financial principles of saving etc if so consider the following when the money was physically held in the piggy bank your daughter had theoretical control over it she was exercising restraint for delayed gratification even if she did not really understand that yet and even if she really did n't understand money did n't know what she would do with it by taking this money and putting it away for her you are taking her out of the decision making unless you plan on giving her access to the account letting her decide when to take it out   still you could talk her through what you 're doing and ask her how she feels about it but perhaps she is too young to understand what committing the money away until 21 really means and if for example she wants to buy a bike when she is 10 do you want her to see the fruits of her saved money finally consider that if you or you your daughter depending on whether you want her to help in the decision decide to put the money in a financial institution in some manner the risk you are taking on may need to be part of the lesson for her if you want to teach the general principles of saving then putting it in bonds savings etc may be sufficient even if inflation lowers the value of the money if you want to teach principles of investing then perhaps consider waiting until she can understand why you are doing that to a kid i think the principles of saving delayed gratification can be taught but the principles of assuming risk for greater reward is a bit more complex

one way to think of the typical fixed rate mortgage is that you can calculate the balance at the end of the month add a month 's interest rate times balance then divide by 12 then subtract your payment the principal is now a bit less and there 's a snowball effect that continues to drop the principal more each month   even though some might object to my use of the word compounding a prepayment has that effect e.g. you have a 5 mortgage and pay $ 100 extra principal if you did nothing else 5 compounded over 28 years is about so if you did this early on it would reduce the last payment by about $ 400 obviously there are calculators and spreadsheets that can give the exact numbers   i do n't know the rules for car loans but one would actually expect them to work similarly and no you are not crazy to expect that just the opposite

i would say yes it makes sense to keep some money in taxable accounts   retirement accounts are for retirement and the various early withdrawal penalties are designed to enforce that   if you 're anticipating using the money before retirement e.g. for home purchase it makes sense to keep it out of retirement accounts on the other hand be aware that regardless of what kind of account it is in you face the usual risk return tradeoff   if you put your money in the s&p 500 and the s&p 500 tanks just before you were going to buy a house your down payment evaporates and you will have to wait and buy a house later   you can manage this by shifting the allocation of this money and perhaps cashing it out if a certain amount is gained i.e. it grows to the level of your target down payment and you are close enough to the house purchase time that you do n't want to risk it anymore basically if you invest money for a pre retirement use you may want to keep it in a taxable account but you also need to take account of when you 'll need it and manage the risk accordingly

mortgage is a secured debt a combination of a promissory note and a security interest providing the mortage holder a secured interest in the property yes you are in debt but that depends upon whether you define the term in debt as a debt appearing on the balance sheet or the net of assets liabilities is less than zero whether you have a debt expense on the income statement budget or whether the net of income expenses is less than zero one person might look at their budget find the monthly mortgage payment listed and judge that they have a debt payment and thus are in debt or they might look at their expenses find they exceed their income and judge that they are in debt another person might look at their balance sheet compare assets to liabilities and only say they were in debt when their liabilities exceeded their assets some people view mortgage debt as good debt as they view certain debts as good and others as bad trust me having a high mortgage payment higher 30 of your net income is hard and over 40 is bad consider you balance sheet and your income statement   on your balance sheet the house appears on the asset side with an estimated value while the mortgage really the promissory note part of the mortgage appears on the liability side on your income statement your house does not appear on the income side but the mortgage promissory note payment appears on the expense side so you clearly have both a liability with a clearly defined value and an expense with a clearly defined payment but do you have an asset according to an accountant you have an asset and a liability but you do not have a business asset that is producing revenue income nor do you have a business asset that can be amortized and expensed to reduce taxable income when we think about an asset does the word have the connotation of some thing with value something that produces income   well by that measure a house only provides income when we rent it out and only has value when we consider selling it as millions of families discovered during the housing price collapse when the market price of your asset falls substantially your personal financial status can fall negative and you can be broke

my experience with owning a home is that its like putting down roots and can be like an anchor holding you to an area   before considering whether you can financially own a home consider some of the other implications once you own it you are stuck for awhile and can not quickly move away like you can with renting   so if a better job opportunity comes up or your employer moves you to another office across town that doubles your commute time you 'll be regretting the home purchase as it will be a barrier to moving to a more convenient location    i along with my fiancée and two children are being forced to move out of my parents home asap   do not rush buying a home   take your time and find what you want   i made the mistake once of buying a home thinking i could take on some diy remodeling to correct some features i was n't fond of   life and finding extra time for diy house updates does n't come easy especially with children    speaking of children consider the school district when buying a home too   often times homes in good school districts cost more   if you do n't consider the school district now then you may be faced with a difficult decision when the kids start school    if you are confident you wo n't want to move anytime soon and can find a house you like and want to jump into home ownership there are some programs that can help first time buyers but they can require some effort on your part   fha has a first time buyer program with a 3.5 down payment   you will need to search for a lender that offers fha loans and work with them   fha covers this program by charging mortgage insurance every month that 's part of your house payment fannie mae has the program where first time home buyers can purchase a foreclosed home from their inventory for as little as 3 down and possibly get up to 3 from the seller to apply toward closing costs   private mortgage insurance pmi is required with this program too   their inventory of homes can be found on the website there is also which requires attending workshops and creating a detailed plan to prove you 're ready for homeownership   this might be a good option if they have workshops in your area and you want to talk with someone in person

also almost by definition rebalancing involves making more trades    than you would have otherwise would n't the additional trading fees    you incurred in doing so reduce the benefits of this strategy you forgot to mention taxes rebalancing does or rather can incur costs one way to minimize the costs is to use the parts of the portfolio that have essentially zero cost of moving these generally are the funds in your retirement accounts in the united states they can be in iras or 401ks they can be regular or roth selling winners withing the structure of the plan does n't trigger capital gains taxes and many have funds within them that have zero loads   another way to reduce trading fees is to only rebalance once a year or once every two years or by setting a limit on how far out of balance for example do n't rebalance at to get back to 60/40 even if it has been two years   given that the ratio of investments is often rather arbitrary to begin    with how do i know whether i 'm selling high and buying low or just    sticking with a losing asset ratio the ratio used in an example or in an article may be arbitrary but your desired ratio is n't arbitrary you selected the ratio of your investments based on several criteria your age your time horizon your goals for the money how comfortable you are with risk as these change during your investing career those ratios would also but they are n't arbitrary   these decisions to rebalance are separate from the ones to sell a particular investment you could sell computer company x because of how it is performing and buy stock in technology company y because you think it has a better chance of growing that transaction would not be a re balancing selling part of your stock in domestic company a to buy stock in international company b would be part of a re balancing

the other answers have offered some great advice but here is an alternative that has n't been mentioned yet i 'm assuming that you have an adequately sized emergency fund in savings and that your cars are your only non mortgage debt since you still have car debt you probably do n't have anything saved for buying a new car when your current cars are at the end of life consider paying off your car loans early then begin saving for your next car having cash in the bank for a car is very freeing and it changes your mindset when it comes time to purchase a car as it is easy to waste a lot of money on something that depreciates rapidly when you are n't paying for it immediately   this approach might be counterintuitive if your car loan interest rate is less than your mortgage rate but you will probably need another car before you need another house and paying cash for a car is worth doing

with the standard i am not a lawyer disclaimer consider this question if you and your girlfriend split up sometime after purchasing the house but before getting married would you expect her to repay you for the closing costs and downpayment   that is if you write her a check for $ 5k and 6 months after she signs the papers for the house one of you decides to break up with the other would you expect her to write you a check for $ 5k in return    that is the difference between a gift and a loan disguised as a gift   if the answer is no you do n't expect it back then everything is fine and you 're in the clear it 's perfectly legal to give someone money   if the answer is yes you would want to be paid back then it 's not a gift and you run the risk of running afoul of the regulations    with respect to a previous answer about gifting money that is not taxed in the us one person can give another up to $ 14,000 without worrying about gift taxes and even in the event that you exceed that amount the excess would simply eat into the lifetime exemption of $   individual states may have different rules and exempt amounts that would apply to state taxes    please also consider the income issue for your rental agreement   your gf would be expected to declare that amount and pay income tax on it as a business   she might also declare part of that amount as expected income for purposes of securing the loan but that may run into its own issues you 're not a roommate and presumably the home is not a duplex or set up as apartments and presumably she would not offer a similar deal to someone other than you

the reason it 's broken out is very specific this is showing you how much interest accrued during the month   it is the only place that 's shown typically each month 's minimum payment is the sum of the interest accrued during that month and some principal say m = and b is your total loan balance   that i is fixed at the amount of interest that accrued that month you always must pay off the accrued interest   it changes each month as some of the principal is reduced if you have a 3 daily interest rate you owe approximately plus a bit as the interest on the interest accrues each month or 30 or 28   since b is going down constantly as principal is paid off i is also going down the p is most commonly calculated based on an amortization table such that you have a fixed payment amount each month and pay the loan off after a certain period of time   that 's why p changes each month because it 's easier for people to have a constant monthly payment m than to have a fixed p and variable i for a variable m. as such it 's important to show you the i amount both so you can verify that the loan is being correctly charged paid and for your tax purposes

it may seem weird but interest rates are set by a market risk is a very large component of the price that a saver will accept to deposit their money in a bank but not the only one essentially you are lending deposited cash to the bank that you put it in and they will lend it out at a certain risk to themselves and a certain risk to you by diversifying who they lend to corporations home buyers each other etc the banks mitigate a lot of the risk but lending to the bank is still a risky endeavour for the saver and the saver accepts a given interest rate for the amount of risk there is in having the money in that particular bank the bank is also unable to diversify away all possible risk but tries to do the best job it can if a bank is seen to take bigger risks and therefore be in greater risk of failing having a run on deposits it must have a higher interest rates on deposits compared to a lower risk bank savers therefore shop around for the best interest rate for a given level of risk which sets the viable interest rate for that bank any higher and the bank would not make a profit on the money that it lends out and so would not be viable as a business any lower and savers would not deposit their money as the risk would be too high for the reward hence competition or lack of it will set the rate as a trade off between risk and return note that governments are also customers of the banking industry when they are issuing fixed income securities bonds and a good deal of the lending done by any bank is to various governments so the price that they borrow money at is a key determinant of what interest rate the bank can afford to give and are part of the competitive banking industry whether they want to be or not since governments in most countries provide insurance for deposits the basic level of perceived risk for all of the banks in any given country is about the same that these banks lend to each other on an incredibly regular basis look into the overnight or repo money market if you want to see exactly how much the rates that these banks pay to and receive from each other are governed by interbank lending rates called libor and and are even more complicated than this answer simply compounds this effect because it makes all of the banks reliant on each other and therefore they help each other to stay liquid to some extent note that i have n't mentioned currency at all so far but this market in every country applies over a number of currencies the way that this occurs is due to arbitrage if i can put foreign money into a bank in a country at a rate that is higher than the rate in its native country after exchange costs and exchange rate risk i will convert all of my money to that currency and take the higher interest rate for an ordinary individual 's savings that is not really possible but remember that the large multinational banks can do exactly the same thing with billions of dollars of deposits and effectively get free money this means that either the bank 's interest rate will fall to a risk adjusted level or the exchange rate will move either of those moves will remove the potential for making money for nothing in this case therefore it is both the exchange rate risk and costs as well as the loan market in that country that set the interest rate in foreign currencies demand for loans in the foreign currency is not a major mover for the same reason companies importing from foreign entities need cash in foreign currencies to pay their bills and so will borrow money in other currencies to fulfil these operations which could come from deposits in the foreign currency if they were available at a lower interest rate than a loan in local currency plus the costs of exchange but the banks will be unwilling to loan to them for less than the highest return that they can get so will push up interest rates to their risk level in the same way that they did in the market before currencies were taken into account freedom of movement of foreign currencies however does move interest rates in foreign currencies as the banks want to be able to lend as much of currencies that are not freely deliverable as they can so will pay a premium for these currencies other political moves such as the government wanting to borrow large amounts of foreign currency etc will also move the interest rate given for foreign currencies not just because loaning to the government is less risky but also because they sometimes pay a premium in interest for being able to borrow foreign currency which may balance this out speculation that a country may change its base interest rate will move short term rates and can move long term rates if it is seen to be a part of a country 's economic strategy the theory behind this is deep and involved but the tl;dr answer would be the standard invisible hand response when anything market or arbitrage related is involved references i work in credit risk and got a colleague who is also a credit risk consultant and economist to look over it arbitrage theory and the repo markets are both fascinating so worth reading about

in the united states regulation of broker dealer credit is dictated by regulation t that for a non margin account 100 of a trade must be funded finra has supplemented that regulation with an rider rule rule which reads no member shall permit a customer other than a broker dealer or a designated      account to make a practice directly or indirectly of effecting transactions in a cash      account where the cost of securities purchased is met by the sale of the same securities      no member shall permit a customer to make a practice of selling securities with them in a      cash account which are to be received against payment from another broker dealer where      such securities were purchased and are not yet paid for a member transferring an      account which is subject to a regulation t 90-day freeze to another member firm shall      inform the receiving member of such 90-day freeze it is only funds from sold equities that are prohibited from being used to purchase securities this means that an equity in one 's account that is settled can be sold and can be purchased only with settled funds   once the amount required to purchase is in excess of the amount of settled funds no more purchases can be made so an equity sold by an account with settled funds can be repurchased immediately with the settled funds so long as the settled funds can fund the purchase margin a closed position is not considered a long or short since it is an account with one loan of security and one asset of security and one cash loan and one cash liability with the excess or deficit equity equal to any profit or loss respectively thus to the market only to the creditworthiness of the clearing settling chain only open positions are considered longs or shorts a long being a possession of a security and a short being a liability because they are exposed to the market since unsettled funds are not considered longs or shorts they are not by previous trades thus only the reg t rules apply to new and current positions cash vs margin a cash account can not purchase with unsettled funds   a margin account can   this means that a margin account could theoretically do an infinite amount of trades using unsettled funds   a cash account 's daily purchases are restricted to the amount of settled funds so once those are exhausted no more purchases can be made the opposite is true for cash accounts as well   unsettled securities can not be sold either in summation unsettled assets can not be traded in a cash account

you could talk to them but assuming you 're in the u.s. it 's highly doubtful any bank would honor a check from 26 years ago   most checks in the u.s. are only valid for 180 days mainly to help companies and banks keep accounting simple i would suggest talking to your late husband 's former employer   explain the situation and ask if they 'd be willing to research it and perhaps honor his memory and contribution to their company by issuing a new check   they might do it as a gesture of good will are they legally bound to do this   to my knowledge the answer is no   the check was issued and never cashed which is not all that unusual for companies in business for a long time   a good example of this would be rebate checks which you 'd be surprised quite frequently end up in a drawer and forgotten about   there has to be some closure for the issuing company in its accounting else they 'd have money in their bank accounts that does n't properly show in their ledgers this is an interesting question though   i hope others will reply and perhaps they have a more informed take than me   i 'm going to upvote it simply because i 'd like to see this discussion continue good luck

if one makes say $ 10k mo and the company will match the first 5 dollar for dollar a deposit of $ 1k mo will see a $ 500/mo match if the employee manages to request 90 get put into the 401(k after 2 months he 's done   if the company wished they could continue the $ 500/mo match i agree they typically do n't and in fact the true up you mention is n't even required one is fortunate to get it many companies that match are going the other way matching only after the year is over why why does any company do anything to save money i used to make an attempt to divide my deposit over the year to max out the 401(k in december and get the match real time not a true up

i 'm a finance major in finland and here is how it would go here as you loan money to the company the company has no income but gains an asset and a liability when the company then uses the money to pay the bills it does have expenses that accumulate to the end of the accounting period where they have to be declared these expenses are payed from the asset gained and has no effect to the liability when the company then makes a profit it is taxable how ever this taxable profit may be deducted from from a tax reserve accumulated over the last loss periods up to ten years when the company then pays the loan back it is divided in principal and interest the principal payment is a deduction in the company 's liabilities and has no tax effect the interest payment the again does have effect in taxes in the way of decreasing them on your personal side giving loan has no effect getting the principal back has no effect getting interest for the loan is taxable income when there are documents the giving the loan and accounting it over the years there should be no problem paying it back

the whole point of buying puts is cheaper cost and lower downside risk if you short the box you are assuming he already holds gold holdings to short against it 's not the same as short selling where you borrow shares   either way you are far more vulnerable to downside risk if you are short the stock whether you borrowed or shorted already owned shares if gold suddenly has a 20 pop over the next year which could be possible given the volatility and uncertainty in the marketplace you have big trouble whereas if you buy puts you only lose your costs for the contracts the amount that you miss by in your bet is n't going to factor into anything

sorry this is sensationalist bullshit escrow payments have been around forever they 're not specific to bofa or the mortgage bubble they 've probably been common practice for decades it 's a much easier way for many people to pay their taxes and insurance and banks do n't net any profit for doing rather it 's an easy way for them to keep tabs on whether homeowners have insurance or not if a home is uninsured by the owner the bank will have to insure it on its own    banks are entitled to collect some escrow overage i think it 's 8 in the event that taxes or insurance are higher than expected but that is still the homeowners money and would be cashed out in a payoff

you 've asked eleven different questions here   therefore the first thing i 'd recommend is this do n't panic seek answers to your questions systematically one at a time   search this site and others to see if there are answers to some of them   you 're in good shape if for no other reason than you 're asking these when you 're young investing and saving are great things to do but you also have time going for you   i recommend that you use your other eight hours per day to build up other income streams   that potentially will get you far more than a 2 deposit any investment can be risky or safe   it depends on both your personal context and that of the larger economy   the best answers will come from your own research and from your advisors since they will be able to see where you are financially and in life

very good answers as to how 0 loans are typically done   in addition many are either tied to a specific large item purchase or credit cards with a no interest period   on credit card transactions the bank is getting a fee from the retailer who in turn is giving you a hidden charge to cover that fee   in the case of a large purchase item like a car the retailer is again quite likely paying a fee to cover what would be that interest something they are willing to do to make the sale   they will typically be less prone to deal as low a price in negotiation if you were not making that deal or at times they may offer either a rebate or special low to zero finance rates but you do n't get both

when you place a limit sell order of $ 10.00 for a stock on an option you are adding your order to the book   anyone who places a buy at the market or with a limit price over $ 10.00 will have that order immediately fulfilled through the offer you have placed on the book on the other hand if that other person places a buy for $ 8.00 then the spread will now be $ 8.00 bid $ 10.00 ask priority is based on first the price all $ 9.99 asks will clear before $ 10.00 and within each bucket this is based on the time your order was submitted this is why in bidding markets including ebay buying at $ is way better than $ and selling at $ is better than $ source under first come first served

with enough money in the emergency fund to get rid of the car and still have a cushion i would definitely get rid of it as the car is not needed your car is only going down in value which makes the current setup even less desirable in essence you are paying over $ 300 a month for something that every month is worth less and less since you are paying over $ 300 a month and it will take about $ 3000 from your emergency fund to get rid of the car if you start putting that $ 300 + back in the emergency fund in a mere 10 months you will have replenished the emergency fund

would you mind adding where that additional value comes from if not from the losses of other investors   you asked this in a comment but it seems to be the key to the confusion    corporations generate money profits paid as dividends from sales   sales trade products for money   the creation of the product creates value   a car is worth more than general motors pays for its components and inputs even including labor and overhead as inputs   that 's what profit is   added value   the dividend is the return that the stock owner gets for owning the stock    this can be a bit confusing in the sense that some stocks do n't pay dividends   the theory is that the stock price is still based on the future dividends or the liquidation price which you could also consider a type of dividend   but the current price is mostly based on the likelihood that the stock price will increase rather than any expected dividends during ownership of the stock    a comment calls out the example of berkshire hathaway   berkshire hathaway is a weird case   it operates more like a mutual fund than a company   as such investors prefer that it reinvest its money rather than pay a dividend   if investors want money from it they sell shares to other investors   but that still is n't really a zero sum game as the stock increases in value over time    there are other stocks that do n't pay dividends   for example digital equipment corporation went through its entire existence without ever paying a dividend   it merged with compaq paying investors for owning the stock    overall you can see this in that the stock market goes up on average   it might have a few losing years but pick a long enough time frame and the market will increase during it   if you sell a stock today it 's because you value the money more than the stock   if it goes up tomorrow that 's the buyer 's good luck   if it goes down the buyer 's bad luck   but it should n't matter to you   you wanted money for something   you received the money    the increase in the stock market overall is an increase in value   it is completely unrelated to trading losses   over time trading gains outweigh trading losses for investors as a group   individual investors may from that but the overall gain is added value    if the only way to make gains in the stock market was for someone else to take a loss then the stock market would n't be able to go up   to view it as a zero sum game we have to ignore the stocks themselves   then each transaction is a payment loss for one party and a receipt gain for the other   but the stocks themselves do have value other than what we pay for them   the net present value of of future payments dividends buyouts etc has an intrinsic worth   it 's a risky worth   some stocks will turn out to be worthless but on average the gains outweigh the losses

first what structure does your index fund have   if it is an open end mutual fund there are no bid ask spread as the structure of this security is that it is priced once a day and transactions are done with that price   if it is an exchange traded fund then the question becomes how well are authorized participants taking advantage of the spread to make the fund track the index well   this is where you have to get into the creation and redemption unit construct of the exchange traded fund where there are in kind transactions done to either create new shares of the fund or redeem out shares of the fund   in either case you are making some serious assumptions about the structure of the fund that do n't make sense given how these are built index funds have lower expense ratios and are thus cheaper than other mutual funds that may take on more costs   if you want suggested reading on this look at the investing books of john c. bogle who studied some of this rather extensively in addition to being one of the first to create an index fund that became known as bogle 's where a couple of key ones would be common sense on mutual funds new for the intelligent investor and bogle on mutual funds new perspectives for the intelligent investor in the case of an open end fund there has to be a portion of the fund in cash to handle transaction costs of running the fund as there are management fees to come from running the fund in addition to dividends from the stocks that have to be carefully re invested and other matters that make this quite easy to note   vanguard 500 index investor has in cash as an example here where you could look at any open end mutual fund 's portfolio and notice that there may well be some in cash as part of how the fund is managed   it ’s the execution stupid would be one of a few articles that looks at the idea of tracking error or how well does an index fund actually track the index where it can be noted that in some cases there can be a little bit of active management in the fund just as a minor side note when i lived in the us i did invest in index funds and found them to be a good investment   i 'd still recommend them though i 'd argue that while some want to see these as really simple investments there can be details that make them quite interesting to my mind how is its price set then the price is computed by taking the sum value of all the assets of the fund minus the liabilities and divided by the number of outstanding shares   the price of the assets would include the closing price on the stock rather than a bid or ask similar pricing for bonds held by the fund derivatives and cash equivalents   similarly the liabilities would be costs a fund has to pay that may not have been paid yet such as management fees brokerage costs etc is it a weighted average of all the underlying stock spreads or does    it stand on its own and stems from the usual supply demand laws there is n't any spread used in determining the net asset value for the fund   the fund prices are determined after the market is closed and so a closing price can be used for stocks the liabilities could include the costs to run the fund as part of the accounting in the fund that most items have to come down to either being an asset something with a positive value or a liability something with a negative value something to consider also is the size of the fund   with over $ in assets a .01 amount is still $ 700,000 which is quite a large amount in some ways

gt;when a business entity is so large and powerful its failure threatens the safety and well being of the nation it is based present in   do n't you think we should approach this issue from the other side and say that the government should be enforcing these restrictions pre in other words firms should be prevented from attaining too big to fail status it seems a bit controversial to me for a government to go in after the fact and forcefully break up a private company where was the government beforehand   gt;the government should be able to forcefully break up the company into smaller groups or laws and regulations that promote competition and allow smaller businesses the ability to compete   how is management distributed across the new entities how is intellectual property distributed it is easy to say we should break these companies up but actually breaking them up is a nightmare each of the new companies will need a duplicate management structure and invariably they will have to source outside resources to fill these roles if one firm retains the more valuable management then it has an advantage over the other firm the same goes for intellectual property or any other rare or unique assets shareholders will not receive the same dividend yield from their shares because the two companies once split will lose out on some economies of scale should the government compensate shareholders for the lost value of their shares if not why not and how is this different from the government directly seizing assets of the shareholders even though they have not committed any crime bear in mind nearly every american citizen owns shares in these companies through their retirement funding and so any loss in market cap will affect normal people not just rich investors   preservation   once again i think we need to be asking a different question how did these firms come to exist in the first place its one thing to turn around and plead to the government to break the firms up but it as the government itself which was asleep on the job and allowed the firm to reach this point anyway should we really trust the government who let the firms come into being to break them up again

in my opinion it depends on the type of product i would get a warranty for a washing machine or tumble dryer or other product with lots of moving parts that is liable to break down i also take into account my luck the one washing machine i did n't get covered broke down 2 weeks outside the normal warranty period i would not get a warranty for a consumer electronics product like a tv pc or ipod because they devalue so quickly as a rule of thumb if the model you buy today is going to be on sale for the next few years for around the same price and has moving parts it is worth considering a warranty if it will be worth a small percentage of its value because newer faster models come along to replace it do n't bother i would also not get the warranty from the shop i bought the product from you can get warranties for consumer products from specialist third parties that will allow you to cover multiple products for a discount these work out a lot cheaper than the one the shop will give you for example in the uk will cover 3 appliances for £ and 6 for £

heh i really like your reply i agree with everything you 've said though i would tweak the final point i think if some random customer sees two competing products one with zynga gold and one without at the same price they 'd choose the one with the gold given that it 's a completely arbitrary inflation proof currency zynga can sell it in large quantities for reasonably cheap if nothing else it gives them more exposure offline   incidentally and

also unless i missed it and someone already mentioned it do keep in mind the impact of these credit cards balances on your credit score over roughly 75 usage on a given credit account reflects badly on your score and has a pretty large impact on how your worthiness is calculated it gives the impression that you are a person that lives month to month on cards etc if you could get both cards down to reasonable balances to where you could begin paying on them regularly and work them down over time that will not only look incredible for your credit report but also immediately begin making your credit worthiness begin to raise due to the fact that you will not have accounts that i 'm assuming here are at very high usage over 75 of your total limit if you have to get one card knocked out just to get breathing room and you 're boxed in here or honestly even if the mental stress is causing you incredible hardship day to day then i suppose blow one card out of the water reassess and start getting to work on that second card i hope this helped i 'm no expert but i have had every kind of luck with credit cards and accounts you could think of so i can only give my experience from the rubber meets the road perspective good luck

tl;dr go with something like barry 's all century portfolio 20 percent total u.s stock market 5 percent u.s. reits 5 percent u.s. small cap value 15 percent pacific equities 15 percent european equities 10 percent u.s. tips 10 percent u.s. high yield corp bonds 20 percent u.s. total bond uk property market are absurdly high and will be crashing a lot very soon the price to rent ratio is certainly very high in the uk     according to this article it takes 48 years of rent to pay for the same apartment in london   that sounds like a terrible deal to me   i have no idea about where prices will go in the future but i would n't voluntarily buy in that market i 'm hesitant to invest in stocks for the fear of losing everything a stock index fund is a collection of stocks   for example the s&p 500 index fund is a collection of the largest 500 us public companies apple google shell ford etc   if you buy the s&p 500 index the 500 largest us companies would have to go bankrupt for you to lose everything there would have to be a zombie apocalypse he 's trying to get me to invest in gold and silver but mostly silver but i neither know anything about gold or silver nor know anyone who takes this approach this is what jeremy siegel said about gold in late 2013 i ’m not enthusiastic about gold because i think gold is priced for either hyperinflation or the end of the world   barry also speaks much wisdom about gold   in short do n't buy it and stop listening to your friend    is buying a property now with the intention of selling it in a couple of years for profit and repeat until i have substantial amount to invest in something big a bad idea if the home price does not appreciate will this approach save you or lose you money   in other words would it be profitable to substitute your rent payment for a mortgage payment   if not you will be speculating not investing   here 's an articles that discusses the difference between speculating and investing   i do n't recommend speculating

gt the facebook ipo was n't a debacle    it really depends on how you see the markets   if they 're just a way for companies to rip off gullible investors then sure it was n't a debacle   but everyone except fb lost out of this one and it was n't just that the price went down it was also that nasdaq 's systems failed badly causing significant additional losses and impending lawsuits   i do n't think nasdaq could be happy about these results   i 'm really doubtful that early investors are happy about losing a chunk of value overnight   i doubt other companies who were trying to go public in this calendar year are by this   and frankly i doubt that fb overall is happy about this result   lots of people there have stock options options that they ca n't yet execute   lots more people there have options but decided to wait   some people who sold a lot of their stock are personally happy but is this good for facebook as a company   i do n't think so   after having an almost exclusively winning profile they become a public company and really badly right out of the gate it 'll take years to erase the bad perception created by this   so unless you 're one of a tiny number of fb insiders this was a debacle

you owe no tax on the option transaction in 2015 in this case   how you ultimately get taxed depends on how you dispose of the position   if it expires then you will have a short term capital gain on the option position at expiration   if it is exercised then the option is gone for tax purposes and your basis in the underlying is adjusted   from irs publication 550 if a call you write is exercised and you sell the underlying stock increase your amount realized on the sale of the stock by the amount you received for the call when figuring your gain or loss the gain or loss is long term or short term depending on your holding period of the stock in your case this will be a long term capital gain for completeness if you buy to cover the option back from the market before expiration or exercise then it is also a short term capital gain also keep in mind that this all assumes that this covered call is qualified so that it does not count as a straddle   you can find more about that in pub 550 all of this is for us tax purposes

inflation and stock returns are completely different things the cpi tracks the changes in the prices of a basket of goods a consumer might buy the s&p 500 tracks the returns earned by investors in the equity of large companies   the two are very different things and not closely linked example a world without inflation consider a world in which there was no inflation   prices are fixed   should stocks return zero   certainly not   companies take raw materials and produce goods and services that have value greater than that of the raw materials   they create new wealth   this wealth becomes profit for the company which then is passed on to the owners of the company equityholders either in the form of dividends or more commonly price increases example a world with no inflation and no economic growth note that i have not implied above that companies have to grow in order for returns to outperform inflation   total stock returns depend on the current and expected profit of the firm   firms can remain the same size and continually kick out profits   total returns will be positive in this environment even if there is no growth and no inflation   if the firms pay the money out as dividends investors get a cash flow   if they retain these earnings the value of the firm 's equity increases   total returns take both types of income into account   technically the s&p 500 is not a total return index but in our current legal and corporate culture environment there is a preference for retaining profits rather than paying them out   this causes price increases risk bearing in principle if profit was assured then investors would bid up stock prices so high that profit would have to compete with the risk free rate which often is close to inflation like right now   however profit is not assured   firm profit swings around over time and constitutes a significant source of risk   we can think of the owners of the firm as being the bondholders and equityholders   these assets are structured such that almost all the profit risk is born by equityholders   we can therefore think of equityholders as being compensated for bearing the risk that would otherwise   be born by bondholders   because equityholders are bearing risk stock prices must be low enough that stocks have a positive expected return above the risk free rate which is presumably not significantly below inflation   this is true for the same reason that insurance premiums are positive people have to be compensated for bearing risk see my answer to this question for a discussion of why risk means we should expect stock prices to increase indefinitely even if inflation the s&p is not a measure of firm size or value the s&p measures the return earned by investors not the size of us companies   true if constituent companies grow and nothing else changes the index goes up but if a company shrinks a lot it gets dropped out rather than dragging the index down by the way please note that dollars put into equities are not stuck somewhere   they are passed on to the seller who then uses it to buy something even if this is a new equity issuance and the seller is the firm itself   the logic that growth of firms somehow sucks money out of usage is incorrect

even if you can pull this off i think it is possible with creativity it is likely not worth it   the number of ways this can come crashing down is high and the benefits are marginal at best   the opportunity cost of carrying this out is likely higher than the saved interest from just carrying the $ 500 balance   do this with too much money and you can find yourself in real trouble if one card gets cancelled late fees penalties and no way to make repayment     basically this is theoretically possible but not worth it   just work an extra hour each month and pay the interest or if you do n't have a job just pay the interest and spend the time you save to look for a job

well i answered a very similar question credit card payment date where i showed that for a normal cycle the average charge is n't due for 40 days the range is 35 55 so if you want to feel good about the float just charge everything the day after the cycle closes and nothing else the rest of the month why is this so interesting it 's no trick and no secret   by the way this is n't likely to be of any use when you 're buying gas groceries or normal purchases but i suppose if you have a large purchase say a big tv $ 3000 this will buy you extra time to pay it would be of me to not clearly state that anyone who needs to take advantage of this trick is the same person who probably should n't use credit cards at all those who use cards are best served by charging what they can afford to pay at that moment and not base today 's charges on what paychecks will come in by the due date of the credit card bill

it depends where you are going to live and how you are going to pay for your new accommodation if you are moving within the uk and intend to buy another house you run into the problem that you will find it hard to get a second mortgage if you rent out the house in kent you will probably have to change the mortgage basis on it to a mortgage that allows for letting normal residential mortgages exclude that entirely which would allow you to take out a residential mortgage it depends how much equity you have in the house if most of the value of the house is mortgaged then you 'll 1 find it hard to re mortgage on a commercial mortgage 2 may find it hard to cover the costs by letting and 3 are very sensitive to house prices falling also bear in mind that for the past three months in a row house prices in the uk have mostly either stagnated or fallen so you can not guarantee any increase in value of the house in kent what i 'm saying is there is no crystal ball that will tell you what 's financially the best thing to do talk to estate agents find out how much the house would sell for how much it would rent for talk to your mortgage lender and find out if they will let you rent it out talk to other mortgage lenders and find out how much a commercial mortgage would cost do the sums find out if renting the house would cover the costs in which case you can gamble on the housing market continuing to rise do n't rely on house prices continuing to rise as they have done before certainly where i live due to the number of new houses being built and other economic issues house prices have fallen over the past few months and may well continue to fall as more and more new houses come on the market

first keep in mind that there are generally 2 ways to buy a corporation 's shares you can buy a share directly from the corporation this does not happen often it usually happens at the initial public offering the first time the company becomes public where anyone with access to the stock exchange can become a part owner plus maybe a few more times during the corporations existence in this case the corporation is offering new ownership in exchange for a price set the corporation or a broker hired by the corporation   the price used for a public offering is the highest amount that the company believes it can get this is a very complicated field and involves many different methods of evaluating what the company should be worth if the company sets the price too low then they have missed out on possible value which would be earned by the previous private shareholders they would have gotten the same share of a corporation which would now have more cash to spend because of increased money paid by new shareholders if the company sets the price too high then the share subscription might only be partially filled so there might not be enough cash to do what the company wanted you can buy a share from another shareholder this is more common when you see the company 's share price on the stock exchange it is this type of transaction buying out other current shareholders the price here is simply set based on what current owners are willing to sell at the bid price listed by an exchange is the current highest bid that a purchaser is offering for a single share the ask price is the current lowest offer that a seller is offering to sell a single share they currently own when the bid price = the ask price a share transaction happens and the most recent stock price changes

there are in fact two balances kept for your account by most banks that have to comply with common convenience banking laws   the first is your actual balance it is simply the sum total of all deposits and withdrawals that have cleared the account that is both your bank and the bank from which the deposit came or to which the payment will go have exchanged necessary proof of authorization from the payor and have confirmed with each other that the money has actually been debited from the account of the payor transferred between the banks and credited to the account of the payee   the second balance is the available balance this is the actual balance plus any amount that the bank is floating you while a deposit clears minus any amount that the bank has received notice of that you may have just authorized but for which either full proof of authorization or the definite amount or both have not been confirmed this is what 's happening here your bank received notice that you intended to pay the train company $ x. they put an authorization hold on that $ x deducting it from your available balance but not your actual balance the bank then for whatever reason declined to process the actual transaction insufficient funds suspicion of theft fraud but kept the hold in place in case the transaction was re attempted holds for debit purchases usually expire between 1 and 5 days after being placed if the hold is not subsequently settled by the merchant providing definite proof of amount and authorization before that time the expiration time mainly depends on the policy of the bank holding your account holds can remain in place as long as thirty days for certain accounts or types of payment again depending on bank policy in certain circumstances the bank can remove a hold on request but it is the bank and not the merchant that you must contact to remove a hold or even inquire about one

the different things in each calculator are showing you a bunch of different things in the roth ira calculator it is comparing what you would have in the end after contributing and withdrawing from a roth ira with what you would have in the end with a taxable account i.e. an investment outside of any iras in the traditional ira calculator the ira after taxes shows you what you would have in the end after contributing and withdrawing from a pre tax traditional ira the ira before taxes simply shows the same amount before you pay the taxes on withdrawal which is not a useful number so if you want to compare roth ira vs. traditional ira you want to compare the roth ira from the roth ira calculator and the ira after taxes from the traditional ira calculator but there are some things you need to be aware of to make a fair comparison because if you just plug in the same numbers you are going to get a very unfair comparison it will look like roth ira is a lot better even though it 's not the roth ira contribution is after tax whereas a pre tax traditional ira contribution is pre tax and an after tax dollar is much more than a pre tax dollar so if you put in the same nominal contribution amount you are actually contributing much more from your wallet in the roth ira case to make a fair comparison you would need to start with the same pre tax amount and put in a roth ira contribution amount that corresponds to the equivalent amount after taxes so for example a $ 5000 pre tax amount with 25 taxes is equivalent to $ 5000 0.75 = $ so you would put in $ 5000 for traditional ira contribution vs. $ for roth ira contribution note that if you have the same flat tax rate at contribution and at withdrawal pre tax traditional ira and roth ira are exactly the same and you can see this by putting in 25 for the retirement tax rate in the traditional ira calculator we already assumed 25 tax rate for roth ira when calculating the contribution you will see that traditional ira would be better in a lower retirement tax rate e.g. 15 whereas roth ira would be higher in a higher retirement tax rate

are you allowed to have two personal current accounts with a debit card attached to each one yes you may have as many current accounts you want but you should ask why should i have more than one it is cumbersome and time consuming to keep track of ongoing incoming credits and outgoing debits open to bank fraud too if you are n't careful if yes can a sole trader in the uk use the second personal account for business transactions yes but no payments to the business at the end of the year you file you even if you have a business bank account you would need to justify the expenses by keeping the bills and stuff as it will be a personal account you have to little more careful not to mix personal and business expenses   if you are allowed to use a second personal account for business transactions then why would someone choose to open a business bank account where you have to pay what are the benefits first of all no company will pay into you personal account for any transactions they need to pay you they will only pay to an account registered with the business with whom they are dealing with benefits are you have your business expenses sorted out in one account and personal expenses in other pure business expenses comes out of the business account rather than from your personal purse keeps the accounts smooth no need to sort out expenses at the end of each quarter or at the end of each month

nobody tracks a single company 's net assets on a daily basis and stock prices are almost never derived directly from their assets otherwise there would be no concept of growth stocks   stocks trade on the presumed current value of future positive cash flow not on the value of their assets alone funds are totally different   they own nothing but stocks and are valued on the basis on the value of those stocks   commodity funds and closed funds muddy the picture somewhat but basically a fund 's only business is owning very liquid assets not using their assets to produce wealth the way companies do a fund has no meaning other than the direct value of its assets    even companies which own and exploit large assets like resource companies are far more complicated than funds e.g. gold mining or oil extracting companies derive most of their value from their physical holdings but those holdings value depends on the moving price and assumed future price of the commodity and also on the operations efficiency of extraction etc still different from a fund which only owns very liquid assets

as for refinancing many institutions charge up front fees when doing any type of vehicle loan typically this is in the neighborhood of 1 the value of the loan with a floor of $ 100 although this may vary by lender however for the loan the be secured by the vehicle the principle value must be less than the collateral value in your case this means there is a collateral shortfall of $ 4,000 when working with a traditional bank you would have two options pay the difference up front reducing the principle value of the loan or obtaining a separate loan for the difference this separate loan would often have a higher interest rate unless you have some other form of collateral to secure it with i doubt carmax would do a separate loan all that being said if you plan on selling the vehicle within the next months do n't bother refinancing it wo n't be worth the hassle

the cayman islands has an income tax enacted it is just currently 0   it raises revenues from its tourism import duties and business registration   it is part of the uk commonwealth and therefore enjoys the military protection of that federation but does n't have to spend on it but unlike the us the uk does not have an umbrella federal income tax on its overseas territories so the cayman islands does n't have to pass that down to its citizens nor do its citizens residents have to be by one it was not taxed by the king when it was first incorporated hm might need to fact check that they also did n't go to war with the king over some small tax so they got treated differently than some other north american colonies you might think of the cayman islands is not the only government that raises revenues this way delaware also has a 0 income tax and raises the majority of its revenues on business registration and perpetual franchise taxes on those businesses allowing it to spare its citizens from passive income taxes but unlike a us state a citizen or business in a uk overseas territory does not have federal regulatory overhead making it more attractive as a worldwide financial center

excellent answers so far so i will just add one additional consideration liquidity money invested in a mutual fund exclusive of retirement accounts with early withdrawal penalties has a relatively high liquidity whereas excess equity in your home from paying down early has very low liquidity to put it simply if you get in a desperate situation long term unemployment it is better to have to cash in a mutual fund than try to sell your house on the quick and move in with your mother liquidity becomes less of an issue if you also manage to fund a decent sized rainy day fund 6 9 months of living expenses

the benefit of having gold to trade is that there is almost always someone that will take gold when the fiat currency is in trouble     the potential downfall of doing this is that when people think the fiat currency is in trouble they tend to buy up gold thus driving up the price   this means that you get less gold for each hour of work you perform deer basket of apples etc     even more if the financial crisis is limited to only one fiat currency you have a situation where that fiat currency devalues but others can gain in value as people try to sell their old currency for the new standard currency   if people also sell their gold to buy up this currency that lowers the price of gold in that currency     for example let us assume that gold was 1000 dollars an ounce and 1000 euros an ounce   suddenly people start thinking that the euro is in trouble so they start buying gold   the law of supply and demand kicks in more buyers same supply so higher prices and gold is suddenly worth 2000 dollars and 2000 euros an ounce   if you start buying at this point you get half as much gold as the person who bought in the beginning   suddenly the euro collapses   stores that used to take euros start demanding dollars   suddenly it costs 20,000 euros for an ounce of gold but an ounce of gold will only get you 1,000 dollars since everyone is selling their gold to get dollars     the people who buy gold in the panic end up losing half the value of their money if not more   the speculators that bought gold at $ 1,000 sold it at $ 2,000 and bought it back at $ 1,000 now have all their gold back plus the $ 1,000 the other people lost

i want to shop in the currency that will be cheapest in cad at any    given time how do you plan to do this if you are using a debit or credit card on a cad account then you will pay that bank 's exchange rate to pay for goods and services that are billed in foreign currency if you plan on buying goods and services from merchants that offer to bill you in cad for items that are priced in foreign currency e.g. buying from gbp priced goods but having amazon bill your card with equivalent cad then you will be paying that merchant 's exchange rate it is very unlikely that either of these scenarios would result in you paying mid market rates what you see on xe.com which is the average between the current ask and bid prices for any currency pair instead the business handling your transaction will set their own exchange rate which will usually be less favorable than the mid market rate and may have additional fees commission on as a separate charge   for example if i buy 100 usd worth of goods from a us vendor but use a cad credit card to pay the mid market rate on xe.com right now indicates an equivalent value of cad however the credit card company is more likely to charge closer to cad and add a foreign transaction fee of maybe $ 2 3 or a percentage of the transaction value alternatively if using something like amazon they may offer to bill the cad credit card in cad for those 100 usd goods no separate foreign transaction fee in this case but they are still likely to exchange at the less favorable rate instead of the mid market rates the only way you can choose to pay in the cheapest equivalent currency is if you already have holdings of all the different currencies then just pay using whichever currency gets you the most bang for your buck unless you are receiving payments wages in multiple currencies though you 're still going to have to refill these accounts periodically thus incurring some foreign transaction fees and being subject to the banker 's exchange rates where can i lookup accurate current exchange rates for consumers it depends on who will be handling your transaction amazon will tell you at the checkout what exchange rate they will apply if you are having them convert a bill into your local currency for you for credit debit card transactions processed in a different currency than the attached account you need to look at your specific agreement or contact the bank to see which rate they use for daily transactions and where you can obtain these rates whether they convert on the day of the transaction vs. the day it posts to your account and how much they add on $ and/or in fees and commission

a large number of bond holders decide to sell their bonds   if they all decide to do this at the same time then there will be a large supply of bonds being sold in the market   this will drive down the price of the bonds which will increase yields why do bond yields move inversely to bond prices you purchase a $ 100 bond today that yields 5   you spent $ 100   the very next day the same bonds are being sold with a yield of 10   if you wanted to sell your bond to someone you would have to sell it so it competed with the new bonds being sold   you could not sell it for $ 100 which is what you paid for it   you would have to sell it for less than the $ 100 you paid for it in order for it to have the equivalent yield of the new bonds being sold with a 10 yield   this is why bond yields move inversely to bond prices why does rising yields increase the cost of borrowing if someone is trying to sell new bonds they will have to sell bonds that compete with the yields of the current bonds already in the market if yields are rising on the existing bonds then the issuer of the new bonds will have to pay higher interest rates to offer equivalent yields on the new bonds the issuer is now paying more in interest making it more expensive to borrow money what are the incentives for the bond to sell his her bonds one reason a bond holder will sell his her bonds is they believe inflation will outpace the yield on the bond they are holding   if a bond yields 3 and inflation is at 5 then the bond holder is essentially losing purchasing power if they continue to hold onto the bond   another reason to sell would be if the bond holder has doubts in the ability of the issuer to repay the interest and/or principal of the bond

there are several tactics you might employ to help the situation   you have two options one is to increase your income the other is to reduce your expenditure   paying off debt will also help but that may not apply to you most people find it easier to reduce expenditure so i will explain that first of all then make sure you track your actual expenditure the budget check it daily and make sure it is accurate if you spend some money you did n't budget for then mark that down and make sure you budget for it going forward most people are surprised at how much they are actually spending especially on trivial things like coffee lunch at work etc   you will then find you can start to reduce this expenditure maybe by bringing lunch to work skipping coffee every other day etc by doing a budget you can reduce your expenditure and hopefully have some money left over to save put a line in your budget marked savings ideally on the day you get paid so you do n't spend it if you ned to save $ x by y date then work out how much that works out in a month and put that into your budget if you have n't got enough spare to do that then onto stage 2 with regards to increasing income the obvious way is to do some overtime at work can you do that alternatively you can get a part time job maybe a hobby that pays money   i personally enjoy building web sites as a hobby and i get about $ 20 a month from advertising on those it 's not much but it adds up over time finally how to actually save what methods are there lots of options here personally i buy shares with my savings making sure i pick stocks that are currently cheap this is quite risky and may not suit you but it works for me as i do n't sell the shares until i actually need the money other options are regular savings accounts that pay a bonus after you 've had the money in for usually 12 months etc   they tend to pay a bonus at the end so you are to not touch your cash but you can get it out if you really need it you can also work out how much spare cash you have monthly and then give yourself an allowance each month that you can spend on impulse items but make sure you stick to that good luck

phil 's answer is correct just to add to his response distributions are not taxable events you already paid your taxes so you can take out $ 50k or $ and the irs is not concerned you can simply write yourself a check for any amount you choose to answer your specific question to match your k1 losses and profit exactly you could take out $ 50k but that might leave the business strapped for cash one way to decide how much to take out is to use your balance sheet look at your retained earnings or just look at the business bank account balance subtract however much cash you think you need to keep on hand for operations and write yourself a check for the rest

from a budgeting perspective the emergency fund is a category in which you 've budgeted funds for the unexpected   these are things that were n't able to be predicted and budgeted for in advance or things that exceeded the expected costs   for example you might budget $ 150 per month for car maintenance and typically spend some of it while the rest builds up over time for unexpected repairs so you have a few hundred available for that   but this month your transmission died and you have a $ 3,000 bill you 'll then fund most of this out of your emergency fund   this does n't cover where to store that money though which leads me to my next point   emergencies are emergencies because they come without warning without you having a chance to plan the primary things you want in an emergency fund account are stability and quick access   you can structure investments to be whatever you think of as safe or stable but you do n't want to be thinking about whether it 's a good time to sell when you need the money right now   but the bigger problem is access when you need the funds on a weekend holiday anytime outside of market hours you 're not going to be able to just sell some stocks and go to an atm this is the reason why it 's recommended to have these funds in a checking or savings account usually the reason i mentioned the budgeting side first is because i wanted to point out that if you 're budgeting well most of the unexpected expenses you have should have been expected in a sense you can still plan for something without knowing when or if it will happen   so in the example of a car repair ideally you 're already budgeting for possible repairs if you own a home you 're budgeting for things that would go wrong budgeting for speeding tickets for surprise out of pocket medical costs etc these then become part of your normal budget they are n't part of the emergency fund anymore   the bright side about budgeting for something unexpected is that you know what that money is for and do you likely also know how quickly you 'll need it for example you know if you have unexpected medical costs that happen very quickly you 're not likely you need a bag of cash on a moment 's notice   so those last two points lead to the fact that your actual emergency fund the dollars that are for things you simply could not foresee will be relatively small a few thousand dollars or so in most cases if you 've got things structured like this you 'll be happy to have a few grand available at a moment 's notice   the bulk of the money you would use for other surprise expenses or things like 6 months of living expenses is represented in other specific categories and you already know the timeframe in which you need it probably enough time that it could be invested risk to taste in short by expecting the unexpected you can sidestep this issue and not worry so much about missed returns on the emergency fund

many folks use bonds to diversify their portfolio since bonds rise and fall in value at different times and for different reasons than stocks bonds pay interest on a regular basis usually monthly or quarterly and so some people invest in bonds in order to match the interest payments to some regular expense they might have the interest payment does not change fixed income   for individual bonds there is a maturity date at which you can expect to receive the face value of the bond the issuer 's creditworthiness is important here you can make a little money on a bond by buying it when its value is lower than its face value and either selling later for a higher value or waiting for it to mature   often the minimum investment for a single bond is high so if you do n't have a large enough amount you can still get the performance of bonds through a bond fund these do not mature so you do n't have a guarantee of a return of your investment however they have access to more bonds than retail investors so the funds can keep your money more fully invested if you do n't need the income you can reinvest the dividends and have a little extra capital growth this way

in your case i think you are doing just fine   index funds by their nature have lower transaction costs and fewer taxable events than actively managed funds good work    index funds do not preclude the generation of dividends and by their nature they probably generate slightly more than actively managed funds    you could take capital gain or dividend or both distributions rather than reinvest them if paying the taxes are a hardship   otherwise look at the taxes you pay as your contributions to these funds   it stinks but this is why 401k ira were rather revolutionary when they were formed   it was a really good deal to not have people 's capital gains eaten by taxes when they occurred   now its old hat but it was pretty darn cool at the time should you prefer rather than vfiax   we ca n't really make the call on that one   which one will perform better after taxes   its anyone 's guess it is kind of a good problem to have

as was stated households earning over $ 250k yr do n't all get their income one way below that threshold even in the six figure range most households are in one of two categories salary wage commission workers and those living off of nest eggs entitlements retired disabled welfare above $ 250k though are a lot of disparate types of incomes now you specifically mentioned wage earners above $ 250k wage earners typically have the same tax havens that most of us do the difference is usually that they are better able to make use of them in other words there are many ways for a high end wage earner to live the good life and write a lot of it off

as stated in the other answer debit card payments even contactless ones do not debit instantly or anywhere near instantly they can take several days or even longer however the fact that the payment was approved would indicate that the contactless device used by the retailer managed to connect to your bank account and could see there were sufficient funds   at this time the payment should also have reserved the funds so it will be pending as such   your online banking may not show all types of pending transactions it may only show direct debits for example if you ring the bank i expect they will be able to see this payment and advise accordingly out of interest who do you bank with if you can see your available funds you should find that includes this payment having been reserved ie you ca n't use that money but if it 's a small amount you may struggle to spot it   again this will vary by bank and how their internet banking system has been implemented i would expect this payment to debit your account the working day after you made it or at worst the day after that   in theory with faster payment technology it could happened within 2 hours but not all banks implemented that system in the same way so delays can and do occur   if the retailer merchant banks with the same bank you do in theory the transaction could be instantaneous again depending on the bank short answer short the transaction is fine it wo n't be void you just need to wait probably a day or two this link has more info especially useful if you bank with natwest as i say the technology is likely to vary by bank to some extent   your own bank should have their own version of this

the standard interpretation of can i afford to retire is can i live on just the income from my savings never touching the principal to estimate that you need to make reasonable guesses about the return you expect the rate of inflation your real costs remember to allow for medical emergencies major house repairs and the like when determining you average needs not to mention taxes if this is n't all tax sheltered and then build in a safety factor you said liquid assets and that 's correct you do n't want to be forced into a reverse mortgage by anything short of a disaster an old rule of thumb was that properly invested you could expect about 4 real return after subtracting inflation that may or may not still be correct but it makes an easy starting point if we take your number of $ 50k year today 's dollars and assume you 've included all the tax and contingency amounts that means your nest egg needs to be or $ i 'm figuring i need at least $ 1.8 m liquid assets to retire the $ 1.5 m you gave would under this set of assumptions allow drawing up to $ 60k year which gives you some hope that your holdings would mot just maintain themselves but grow giving you additional buffer against emergencies later having said that some folks have suggested that given what the market is currently doing it might be wiser to assume smaller average returns or you may make different assumptions about inflation or want a larger emergency buffer that 's all judgement calls based on your best guesses about the economy in general and your investments in particular   a good financial advisor not a broker will have access to better tools for exploring this using techniques like monte carlo simulation to try to estimate both best and worst cases and can thus give you a somewhat more reliable answer than this rule of thumb approach but that 's still probabilities not promises another way to test it find out how much an insurance company would want as the price of an open ended inflation adjusted $ 50k a year annuity making these estimates is their business if they ca n't make a good guess nobody can admittedly they 're also factoring the odds of your dying early into the mix but on the other hand they 're also planning on making a profit from the deal so their number might be a reasonable one for self insuring too or might not or you might decide that it 's worth buying an annuity for part or all of this paying them to absorb the risk in the end ya pays yer money and takes yer

i know of no generic formula for determining if an investment property is a good investment besides the trivial formula make sure your income is greater than your expenses and hope the value of the property does n't drop some people will tell you to expect the monthly rent to be a fixed percentage of the purchase price but that is a goal not a certainty it is also impossible to estimate the difficulty renting the property or how long the roof will last taxes ca n't be predicted as the value of the house increase so do the property taxes but you might not be able to increase the rent   you ca n't even predict the quality of the tenant will they damage the property or skip out early you will need somebody who knows the local market to estimate the local conditions and help you determine the estimated costs and income based on the actual property involved

i am neither a lawyer nor a tax accountant and if you 're dealing with serious money i suggest you consult a professional but my understanding is if you make a loan at zero interest or at below market rates the irs will consider the difference between the interest that you do charge and the market rate to be a gift that is if someone could get a loan from a bank and he 'd pay $ 1000 in interest for the year but instead you loan him the money as a friend interest free than as far as the irs is concerned you have given him a $ 1000 gift and you could potentially have to pay gift tax or they might the interest to you and tax you on $ 1000 of additional income if you have no agreement on repayment terms if it 's all hey joe just pay me back when you can then the irs is likely to consider the entire loan to be a gift there 's an annual exclusion on gifts i think it 's now $ 13,000 so if you loan your buddy fifty bucks to tide him over until next pay day the irs is n't going to get involved in that they 're worried about more serious money and yes the irs does police loan rates the irs examines exact numbers for all sorts of things if say you go on a overnight business trip and the company gives you $ 10,000 for travel expenses the irs is likely to say that this is not a tax deductible travel expense at all but a sham to hide part of your salary from taxes or if you donate a pair of old socks to charity and declare a $ 500 charitable contribution deduction the irs will say that that is not a realistic value for a pair of old socks and disallow the deduction etc a small discrepancy from market rates can be justified for any number of reasons if the book value of a used car is $ 5000 and you sell it to your neighbor for $ 4900 the irs is unlikely to question it there are any number of legitimate business reasons why you had to give a discount to make the sale but if you sell it to him for $ 50 they may declare that this is not a sale but a gift etc

so i 've been actively looking for work in my field education since graduation 2013 with little success but i 'll give it a shot since no one else has yet some tricks i 've picked up along the way with little success mind you   nothing nothing gained if you do n't do the work and begin the process of applying and feeling out their interest for a candidate you wo n't learn how much they are willing to buy your labor for    they have a price in mind before you apply they look at your credentials and determine if you will do the job and exceed expectations based on your status age current position other known facts of your life married kids they all bring and expectations to the table that they may or may not consider or know but can affect yours and their expectations and bring a or dynamic to the table depending on the at hand do you like them and can you see yourself liking to work for them   so what kind of do they want to be most likely they want to be on the bleeding edge if their new and cut away from the flock but realistically they can probably hardly afford to pay for a 's portion of your current position without some heavy backing them who is backing them   so you will need to go in expecting a dollar gained for the company is a dollar given to you hopefully down the road if you take 5 pay cut this year you better be getting a 5 20 increase in the following 5 years based on performance but how do you sell yourself as a facet of the team that achieves these longterm goals how do you fit therefore if you do n't gain this round make sure you have or written of compensation in the future to follow up with when due   on top of this dynamic look at similar advertised recently on various other websites to anchor your asking price aim higher and you 'll hopefully land on the moon if not the stars normally i would go to linkedin to check out the history and glassdoor but not sure that s needed in this case since you know them already and its a newer company with that in mind ask yourself is this a job i would and could see myself eager to be challenged by the next 3 years

all value given to products is subjective and is different from person to person   it can also vary for the same person from year to year month to month day to day or even hour to hour as a person analyzes different products and prices to determine which imparts the most value to him or her at a given point in time in regards to losing money in your investment accounts   this reminds of a book i read on jesse livermore   jesse was a famous stock broker who made millions in the 1920 's so he would be a billionaire in today 's money in the stock market multiple times   jesse felt like   you he felt like after a while the losses on paper did not seem to concern him as much as he thought it should   he thought it was due to the investment accounts being simply being numbers on papers and not cold hard cash so what did jesse do to remove the abstract nature of investment accounts    from here livermore always sold out all his positions at the end of every year    and had the cash deposited in his account at the chase manhattan bank    then he would arrange with the bank to have the money in cash in the    bank ’s vault in chests there was a desk a chair a cot and an easy    chair in the middle of the cash on the occasion described in    there was $ 50 million in cash   in the corner was a fridge with food    enough for a few days there was lighting installed then like    scrooge livermore would have himself locked in the vault with    his cash he would stay a couple of days and review his year from    every aspect   after his stay was over he would fill his pockets with cash and go on    a shopping spree    he would also take   a vacation and not re enter    the market until february but unlike scrooge this was not the act of a miser explains      livermore lived a world of paper transactions all year long    he believed that by the end of the year he had lost his perception of    what the paper slips really represented cash money and ultimately    power   he needed to touch the money and feel the power of cash it    made him re appraise his stock and commodity positions imagine the $ 60,000 from your investment account sitting on your kitchen table   imagine seeing $ 1,000 dumped into the trash can one day   i know i would appreciate the money much more seeing that happen

it would help if we had numbers to walk you through the analysis current balance rate remaining term and the new mortgage details   to echo and elaborate on part of ben 's response the most important thing is to not confuse cash flow with savings if you have 15 years to go and refinance to 30 years at the rate rate your payment drops by 1/3 yet your rate is identical in this example   the correct method is to take the new rate plug it into a mortgage calculator or spreadsheet using the remaining months on the current mortgage and see the change in payment this savings is what you should divide into closing costs to calculate the breakeven it 's up to you whether to adjust your payments to keep the term the same after you close   with respect to keshlam rules of thumb often fail there are mortgages that build the closing costs into the rate not the amount loaned the rate this means that as rates dropped moving from 5.25 to 5 made sense even though with closing costs there were 4.5 mortgages out there because rates were still falling and i finally moved to a 3.5 loan at the time i was serial refinancing the bank said i could return to them after a year if rates were still lower in my opinion we are at a bottom and the biggest question you need to answer is whether you 'll remain in the house past your own breakeven time last with personal finance focusing on personal the analysis should n't ignore the rest of your balance sheet say you are paying $ with 15 years to go your budget is tight enough that you 've chosen not to deposit to your 401(k assuming you are in the us or country with pretax retirement account options in this case holding rates constant a shift to 30 years frees up about $ 500/mo in a matched 401(k your $ is doubled to $ 12k year   of course if the money would just go in the market unmatched members here would correctly me for suggesting a dangerous game in effect borrowing via mortgage to invest in the market the matched funds however are tough to argue against

so like any market the housing market will on average trend upward but the extreme prices we 're seeing in toronto or san francisco are not part of the normal market growth there 's a lot of factors that can affect housing outside of just increased demand here 's a few of the big ones   1 low interest rates since 2008 i think interests rates have been really low meaning mortgages are really low if you can borrow money at 4 and the inflation rate is 8 you 've borrowed expensive dollars and are paying back in cheap dollars   not in my back yard if you have enough land to build 10 houses or one 100 apartment building what do you build theoretically the apartment building but in reality the people that already paid for their million dollar house do n't want a giant apartment complex bringing down the value of the neighborhood and ruining their views so they pass laws preventing new and bigger buildings meaning higher prices for the homes that already exist and as a bonus it 's easier on the city to have 10 people who make a million dollars a year than a 100 people who make 100,000 a year   foreign investment so there 's a lot of places where people have money but because of corruption or shaky economies it 's not safe to hold it there so you buy properties in the u.s. or canada because you know no one 's going to seize it and it 's generally not going to lose value so you end up with foreign dollars competing with the local markets for housing driving the price up

i 'm just began playing in the stock    market i assume you mean that you 're not using real money but rather you have an account with a stock simulator like the one investopedia offers i am hopeful that 's the case due to the high level of risk involved in short selling like you 're describing here is another post about short selling that expands a bit on that point to learn much more about the ins and outs of short selling i will point again to investopedia i swear i do n't work for them but they do have a great short selling tutorial   when you short sell a stock you are borrowing the stock from your broker the broker typically uses stock held by one or more of his clients to cover the loan since it 's basically a loan you pay interest of course the longer you hold it the more interest you pay also as joe mentioned there are scenarios in which you may be forced to buy the stock at a higher price than you sold it this tends to happen when the stock price is going against the short sell i.e. you lose money finally did anyone mention that the potential losses in a short sell are infinite

gt using debt to increase your intrinsic value is a wise investment   do you believe this kind of belief the problem if you look at the data roughly 20 of college graduates will do really well for themselves which is difficult to ignore but when you look at the remaining 80 of graduates the income distributions start to look a lot like those who have less education   you being a financial advisor i 'm sure you are aware that the early years are the utmost important ones for saving the prevailing idea has been that a degree will earn you more than the other opportunity costs over the remainder of your career but that is based on the aforementioned top 20 who really serve to skew the data to the casual calculator   with that the typical highly education person ends up getting hit with no only massive debt but loses a ton of early earning potential and often can not convert that education into a higher income than anyone else it comes as no surprise to me that this group has the biggest debt problems

yes this is possible in the most liquid securities but currently it would take several days to get filled in one contract at that amount there are also position size limits set by the occ and other self regulatory organizations that attempt to prevent people from a market through the options market getting loads of contacts without effecting the price of the underlying asset exercising those contracts and suddenly owning a huge stake of the asset and nobody saw it coming although this is still very very possible so for your example of an option of $ 1.00 per contract then the position size limits would have prevented 100 million of those being opened by one person account that is realistically you would spread out your orders amongst several options strike prices and expiration dates stock indexes are some very liquid examples so for the standard poors you can open options contracts on the spy etf as well as the s&p 500 futures as well as many other s&p 500 products that only trade options and do not have the ability to be traded as the underlying shares and there is also the saying liquidity liquidity meaning that because you are making the market more liquid other large market participants will also see the liquidity and want to participate where they previously thought it was too illiquid and impossible to close a large position quickly

they said the expected returns from the stock market are around 7   emphasis added the key word in your quote is expected   on average the market gains in the 7 9 range more if you reinvest dividends but there 's a great deal of risk too meaning that in any given year the market could be down 20 or be   up 30 your student loan on the other hand is risk free   you are guaranteed to pay lose 4 a year in interest   you ca n't directly compare the expected return of a risk free asset with the expected return of a risky asset   you can compare the risks of two assets with equal expected returns and the expected returns of assets with equal risks but you ca n't directly compare returns of assets with different risks   so in two years you might be better off if you had invested the money versus paying the loan or you might be much worse off   in ten years your chances of coming out ahead are better but still not guaranteed what 's confusing is i 've heard that if you 're investing you should be investing in both stocks and bonds since i 'm young i would n't want to put much in bonds though so how would that factor in   bonds have lower risk uncertainty than stocks but lower expected returns   if you invest in both your overall risk is lower since sometimes not always the gain in stocks are offset by losses in bonds   so there is value in diversifying since you can get better expected returns from a diversified portfolio than from a single asset with a comparable amount of risk   however there it no risk free asset that will have a better return than what you 're paying in student loan interest

i think the answer depends on whether you 're trying to get out of debt and stay out or if you just want this card paid off   that is are you changing the way you deal with money and debt for good if you just want this card paid off and you 're ok with going back into debt later then scott 's advice is one way to go   i 'd personally be nervous about leaving myself with no cash reserves at all    if you are planning to get out of debt and stay out then you do n't want to put yourself in a position where you 're tempted to go back into debt as soon as you hit a speed bump   so you need some cushion so that an emergency does n't push you right back to the credit cards   if you 've got a budget that you can live on and that covers your usual expenses and your job is relatively stable then $ 1000 is probably enough of a cushion for most things you can then pay off most of the credit card using the rest of your savings   if you 're in an unstable job situation then you 'll want to keep more if not all of your savings as protection against the instability   once the situation then throw the surplus savings at the debt $ 1000 does n't cover all possible emergencies but it 's generally a good tradeoff between prudence and paranoia

i disagree with those that claim an hsa is only useful for those that can afford it an hsa is useful for anyone that is eligible to contribute to one and also pays their medical bills this is true even if you are living paycheck to paycheck and have no money left over to contribute here 's how you do it this way even if you do n't have enough money to make regular contributions to the hsa you still get the tax advantage anytime you make a payment it 's effectively the same thing as regular contributions but without having to guess how much you 'll need you only contribute exactly the amount you need

carmax will be interested in setting a price that allows them to make money on the reselling of the vehicle they wo n't offer you more than that the determination of the value compared to the value is based on condition and miles the refinancing of the auto loan could lower your monthly payment but may not save you any money in the short term the new lender will also want an evaluation of the vehicle and if it is less than the payoff amount of the current loan they will ask you to make a lump sum payment this is addition to the cost of getting the new loan setup if you can pay the delta between the value of the car and loan then do so when you sell the car do n't refinance unless you plan on keeping the car for many months or you are just adding paperwork to the transaction

i have to ask at what point do people take into account their own financial responsibility when it comes to these fees do n't get me wrong i 've been in that overdraft fee loop before and it was brutal so i took my business else where what i did n't realize at the time was that i did exactly what the bank wanted me to do either pay up for the bank forwarding money on my behalf or gtfo   banks are n't obligated to do shit with our pennies by asking them to hold on to our cash they provide a service including all the attached fine print trickery is obviously foul play but so is constantly over drawing an account one or two should be red flag enough that you 're not paying attention to your money but this is n't the case for our culture we get penalized then act like victims

do you understand why private companies pay for their employees to travel in business or first class   it 's because coach class sucks   coach class gets you there weary from the trip   it 's like taking a bus in a lot of ways   lots of inconveniences crammed together with a bunch of people who if they did n't come in will be smelly by the time you 're at your destination   are you on a tight timetable   do you need to catch a red eye to be somewhere else and attend a meeting later that morning or afternoon without time to up   your associates will be grateful you took a better seat   is it worth it to the taxpayer to have their employees sharp and ready to work after the trip   i think so   it 's not foolish for the public sector to invest in their employees if we want capable public servants   the cheapest option merely shifts the costs onto the employee who will return the favor by not being able to do their best work

i think i understand what you 're trying to achieve you just want to see how it feels to own a share right to go through the process of buying and holding and eventually selling be it at a loss or at a gain   frankly my primary advice is just do it on paper just decide for whatever reason which stocks to buy in what amount subtract 1 for commissions i 'm intentionally staying on the higher side here and keep track of the price changes daily    instead of doing it on mere paper some brokers offer you a demo account where you can practice your paper trading in the same way you would use a live account as far as i know interactive brokers and saxo bank offer such demo accounts go look around on their web pages   the problem about doing it for real is that many of the better brokers such as the two i mentioned have relatively high minimum funding limits you need to send a few thousand pounds to your brokerage account before you can even use it of course you do n't need to invest it all but still the cash has to be there   especially for some younger and inexperienced investors this can them to gambling most of their money away which is why i would not advise you to actually invest in this way it will be expensive but if it 's just for trying it on one share use your local principal bank for the trade   hope this gets you started

form is to report to the irs withholding of capital gains tax that may be due from the seller foreign nationals do n't always file tax returns so they often did n't pay capital gains tax on properties that they sold congress decided to make the buyers responsible for this tax so that they would have a better chance of collecting it there is a penalty against the buyer if that tax is not withheld your attorney should have filed this form on your behalf as part of the closing papers i think your first step is to look at your copy of the closing papers and see if money was withheld from the sale there definitely should be disclosure of these requirements before the sale you should also follow up with your attorney to see whether he has already filed the forms and on your behalf if you had purchased for less than $ 300,000 and were purchasing for your primary residence you would not have to file that form but since the property was under $ 1,000,000 the withholding rate is only 10 rather than 15

my mortgage started out with an escrow but it seemed like they were it they often over collected it and locked up my money unnecessarily or under collected and had to catch up later to pay the tax bill despite what said i told them i would pay my own taxes and insurance and to stop the escrow and they did without argument keep in mind you should only do this if you are good about saving money the banks know that many people are n't and will have trouble at the end of the year when a multi thousand dollar tax or insurance bill comes due hence the reason they try to get you to do the escrow   in my case i just had the estimated tax escrow amount automatically deposited from my paycheck into a special interest bearing savings account that i manage

i am not a lawyer and i am assuming trusts in the uk work similar to the way they work in the us a trust is a legally recognized entity that can act in business transactions much the same way as a person would own real property a business insurance investments etc the short answer is the trust is the owner of the property the trust is established by a grantor who funds the trust by transferring ownership of items from him or herself or itself if another trust or business entity like a corporation to the trust   a trustee is appointed usually by the grantor to manage the trust according to the conditions and terms specified in the trust a trustee would be failing in their responsibility their fiduciary duty if they do not act in accordance with the purposes of the trust some trusts are written better than others and there may or may not be room for broad interpretation of the purposes of the trust    the trust is established to provide some benefit to the beneficiary the beneficiary can be anyone or anything including another trust in the us a living trust is commonly used as an estate planning tool where the grantor trustee and beneficiary are the same at some point due to health or other reasons a new trustee can be appointed since the trust is a separate entity from the grantor and trustee and it owns the assets it can survive the death of the grantor which makes it an attractive way to avoid having to probate the entire estate a good living trust will have instructions for the trustee on what to do with the assets upon the death of the

unfortunately it is not possible for an ordinary person to become an accredited investor without a career change gaining any legal certification in investments typically require sponsorship from an investment company which you would be working for there are reasons why these kinds of investments are not available to ordinary people directly and you should definitely consult an ria registered investment adviser before investing in something that is n't extremely standardized traded on an major exchange the issue with these kinds of investments is that they are not particularly standardized in terms of legal structure settlement terms registered investment advisers and other people who manage investments professionally are theoretically given specific training to understand these kinds of non standard investments and are theoretically qualified to analyze the legal documentation of these make well informed investment decisions and make sure that their investors are not falling into any kind of pyramid scheme   there are many many kinds of issues that can arise when investing in startups what of the the company 's profits are you entitled to how long can the company go without paying you a dividend do they have to pay you a dividend at all how liquid will your investment in the company be unfortunately it is common for startups to accept investment but have legal restrictions on their investors ability to sell their stake in the business and other non standard contract clauses for example some investment agreements have a clause which states that you can only sell your stake in the business to a person who already owns a stake in the business this makes your investment essentially worthless the company could run for an exponential amount of time without paying you a dividend if you are not able to sell your stake in the company you will not be able to earn any capital gains either the probability of a startup eventually going public is extremely small so in this scenario it is likely you will end up gaining no return investment though you can be happy to know you helped a company grow   overall the restrictions for these kinds of investments exist to protect ordinary folks from making investing their savings into things that could get them burned if you want to invest in companies on build a relationship with an ria and work with that person to invest your money it is easier less risky and not all that more expensive

you say   my work is steady even if i lost my job it 'd be easy to get another location has been static for a few years now but i 'm not sure that 'll extrapolate to the future i 'm lazy so i do n't want to move but for a significantly better job opportunity i would n't mind    the general rule of thumb is that you 'll come out ahead if you buy a house with a mortgage and live there for five years   what you lose in interest you make up in rent   and living there for five years you make back your closing costs in equity   if you 're there less than five years though you do n't make back the closing costs   you 'd have been better off renting    historically up to about twenty years ago your mortgage payment and rent payment for the same basic property would be about the same   i.e. if your current landlord sold you what you are renting your mortgage payment would be roughly the same as your rent   maybe a little lower or a little higher but about the same   more recently it has n't been strange to see a divergence in those   now it is not uncommon for a mortgage payment to be 50 higher than rent on the same property    this has some consequences   first your $ 1000 rent probably wo n't stretch as far as a $ 1000 mortgage payment   so you 'll be buying something that you 'd only pay $ 650 or $ 700 rent   second if you move and ca n't sell immediately you 'll get less in rent than you 'd pay in mortgage   rather than contributing to your income the property will require subsidy just to maintain the mortgage   and in the early years of the mortgage this means that you 're paying all of the principal equity and some of the interest    buying a duplex makes this worse   you have your side and their side   you can substitute your $ 1000 rent for half of the mortgage payment   meanwhile they are paying $ 700 in rent   you have to subsidize the mortgage by $ 300   plus you are talking about hiring a property management company to do things like lawn maintenance   there goes another $ 100 a month   so you are subsidizing the mortgage by $ 400    i do n't know real estate prices in utah but a quick search finds a median house price over $ 200,000   so it seems unlikely that you are buying new construction with new appliances   more likely you are buying an existing duplex with existing appliances   what happens when they fail   the renter does n't pay for that   the property management company does n't pay for that although they 'll likely arrange for it to happen   you pay for it    also it often takes a bit of time to clean up the apartment after one tenant leaves before the new tenant starts paying rent   that 's a dead weight loss   if this happens during a local recession you could be carrying the mortgage on a property with no offsetting rental income for months    there are some forces   for example if house prices in your area are increasing the rent will increase with them not necessarily at the same pace   but your mortgage payment stays the same   so eventually the rent may catch up with the mortgage payment   if you wait long enough in a strong enough market the rent on the other half of the duplex may cover the entire mortgage payment    if you currently have an urban apartment within walking distance of work and switch to a suburban apartment with a commute you have a better chance of finding a duplex where the entire mortgage payment is only the $ 1000 that you pay in rent   your half of the duplex wo n't be as nice as your apartment is and you 'll have a half hour or hour long commute every morning and the same to get home in the evening   but on strictly fiscal terms you 'll be doing about as well   plus you have the income from the other half   so even if your mortgage payment is more than your rent payment you can still break even if the rent covers it    consider a $ 1400 mortgage and $ 400 in rent from the other half after property management fees   so long as nothing goes wrong you break even   perhaps the agreement is that your parents take care of things going wrong broken appliances troublesome tenants time between tenants   or perhaps you drain your emergency fund and adjust your 401(k payment down to the minimum when that happens   once your emergency fund is replenished restore the 401(k    if you 're willing to live in what 's essentially a $ 500 apartment you can do better this way   of course you can also do better by living in a $ 500 apartment and banking the other $ 500 that you spend on rent   plus you now have the expenses of a commute and five hours less free time a week    you describe yourself as essentially living paycheck to paycheck   you have adequate savings but no building excess   whatever you get paid you immediately turn around and spend   your parents may view you as profligate   your apartment is nicer than their early apartments were   you go out more often   you 're not putting anything aside for later except retirement    it did n't use to be at all strange for people to move out of the city because they needed more space   for the same rent they were paying in the city they could buy a house in the suburbs   then they 'd build up equity   so long as they stayed in roughly the same work location they did n't need to move until they were ready to upgrade their house    the duplex plan leads to one of two things   either you sell the duplex and use the equity to buy a nicer regular house or you move out of the duplex and rent your half   now you have a rental property providing income   and if you saved enough for a down payment you can still buy a regular house    from your parents perspective encouraging you to buy a duplex may be the equivalent of asking you to cut back on spending   rather than reducing your 401(k deposits they may be you trading in your car for a cheaper one and trading in your nice but expensive apartment for something more reasonable in a cheaper neighborhood   rather than working with a property management company you 'll be out doing rather than with your friends   and maybe the new place would have more space to share when you meet someone you are n't going to provide many grandkids alone    if you get a mortgage on a duplex you are responsible for paying the mortgage   you are responsible even if something happens to the house   for example if a fire burns it down or a takes it away   or you just find that the house is n't solid enough to support that party where all of your friends are jumping up and down to the latest pop sensation   so beyond losing whatever you invest in the property you may also lose what you borrowed    now consider what happens if you invest the same amount of money in general motors as in the house   let 's call that $ 10,000 and give the house a value of $ 200,000   with general motors even if they go bankrupt tomorrow you 're only out $ 10,000   with the house you 're out $ 200,000   admittedly it 's much hard to lose the entire $ 200,000 value of the house   but even if the house loses $ 80,000 in value you are still $ 70,000 in the hole    you do n't need a disaster for the house to lose $ 80,000 in value   that 's pretty much what happened in the 2006 2010 period   people were losing all of what they invested in houses plus having to declare bankruptcy to get out of the excess debt   of course if they had been able to hold on until 2015 markets mostly recovered   but if you lost your job in 2008 they would n't let you not make mortgage payments until you got a new one in 2012    when you declare bankruptcy you do n't just lose the house   you also lose all your emergency savings and may lose some of your belongings    there are some pretty disasters too   for example you and your tenant both go away for a weekend   it rains heavily and your roof starts to leak due to weak maintenance so not covered by insurance   the house floods destroying all the electronics and damaging various other things   bad enough if it 's just you but you 're also responsible for the tenant 's belongings   they sue you for $ 20,000 and they move out   so no rent and big expenses   to get the house livable again is going to take $ 160,000   plus you have a $ 190,000 mortgage on a property that is only worth about $ 40,000   that 's at the extreme end

yes   this article describes opting out it is true i think that most banks will offer this as a courtesy by default but i believe that they must offer an option to opt out i checked my bank 's webpage and they explicitly describe how to opt out by calling a number or visiting a bank branch but it required digging carefully to find that information that being said are you sure that you 'd really want to opt out   the bank can still charge a fee for non sufficient funds nsf and whoever was expecting the payment may also charge you late fees and service fees   it 's much better just to make sure that you do n't overdraw through careful planning

i understand where you 're coming from but you 're mostly just quoting the plaintiff 's attorney that 's not going to be the source of unbiased information furthermore i do n't trust general news sources when it comes to complex financial reporting i do n't really even trust business journals as they are mostly filled with j degrees without real experience bankruptcy cases can get very complex and unpredictable because judge 's have significant leeway you really need to read the case opinion to see what really went down i work in finance and deal with bankruptcies on a semi regular case i am on the buy side the side that would be screwed in cases like this so my inherent bias goes your way against poor management    if this guy actually moved assets from company 1 to company 2 at a non arms length transaction then that is misconduct and assets can be recovered from company 2 usually if learning annex was with robert and he pulled dividends out to himself that is misconduct that will be punished by a bankruptcy court if he did these things they are not smart business practices and will be punished   your does not help your case i most likely know far more about this topic than you as i have seen the nuances corporate bankruptcies take on in the real world i just do n't trust grossly oversimplified reporting in a case that is ongoing

if you even qualify for a no down payment usda loan which i 'm not sure you would it would be extremely risky to take on a $ 250 k house loan and have near zero equity in the house for a good while if property values drop at all you are going to be stuck in that house which likely has a pretty high monthly payment insurance taxes hoa fees maintenance costs etc   my rule of thumb is that if you ca n't come up with a down payment then you ca n't afford the house especially with that much debt hanging over your head already if one major thing goes wrong with the house roof a c electrical etc you are going to put yourself in a world of hurt with no clear path out of that financial trap my suggestion keep renting until you have enough money for a downpayment even if this means downsizing your price range for houses you are considering

whatever you do you need to be saving a lot more to have a good chance at retirement at a reasonable age with a combined salary of $ 150,000 i 'd recommend in total that 's $ in tax advantaged accounts plus whatever you put into taxable accounts your $ 150,000 yearly income less $ in savings is still an income of $ 60,000 people live comfortably and raise families on a lot less consider how fortunate you are you could retire in 10 years if you wanted by increasing your savings and decreasing your expenses seriously i 'm speaking from first hand experience if you stay on your present course saving $ at a 7 real return you 'll need about 37 years to accumulate $ in today 's dollars which is enough to even if those student loans are forgiven that only knocks off about 2 years if you are in your late 30s now there 's a decent chance you 'll be dead before you retire as for buying a house or not this depends a lot on your personal circumstance and how the rental market in your city compares in your decision do n't forget to consider renting is not necessarily throwing money away any more than buying a house is if you take out a mortgage you 'll be throwing away a lot of money anyway look for a loan amortization calculator to see how much goes to interest versus principal for a $ 500,000 loan at a 3.5 rate you will be paying approximately $ 1400 per month in interest versus only $ 800 towards the principal when you deduct insurance taxes maintenance etc from that $ 800 you may find you are still throwing away most of your monthly payment on interest and expenses you would n't have if you rented the money you do save after interest and expenses is n't really saved housing markets go up and down but on average over the long term they go up just enough to keep up with inflation meaning a 0 real return if renting means less cash out of pocket per month you can put that extra cash towards investments that yield a much higher return sure you may need to continue making rental payments in perpetuity but you can save enough extra money to pay for the rental in investment income again it depends considerably on how the housing and rental markets compare where you live popular cities san francisco new york paris etc tend to favor renting unpopular cities detroit st. louis and rural areas tend to favor buying further reading mr. money mustache rent vs. buy if you have to ask you should probably rent

no insult detroit was to cars what glasgow was to ships it happened all over the west during the last 30 years   is funny though i live in a small town really a few miles out of glasgow is technically more accessible to me to the north   glasgow has been pretty much rebuilt from it 's and fame   still issues but they are getting there detroit will too   in south west we had a massive industry of lace and mining once   some of the best in the world apparently that all disappeared to the far east during the 50s during the we had a massive plant and even dec had production here   guess what as those could be automated that was all too   further north we had silicon i believe the pun was intended   ibm had a massive site of many thousand workers lenovo took them over and within a few years that was all gone too   the original ibm workers had great benefits they originally sold the site and off the staff and then re leased the site and took all the staff back on via an agency   the only difference being all the benefits of working for ibm were gone   that went on for a few years or so and then lenovo took over consumer hardware side     this being the side of things built for silicon and then hardly used     to be fair there is still a huge site at and we are supposedly getting another 3k workers back a bit like the cat story   this area will be very grateful for the work just like your southern states   the trend i interpreted is that as soon as things could be automated that was when things went away and when margins started to fall out of electronics that was just the excuse they needed   in theory a production line that had 100 staff might be doable with just 10 these days maybe with all the horrific horror stories of abroad companies are now being able to justify 10 plebs over here   it starts to sound like i 'm being slightly anti globalist here i 've no problem with globalism but the same thing that helps companies should allow me to buy shit from abroad at the cost i can find rather than being forced to buy region locked or crap   if it costs you £ 5 to make a shirt in india you should be selling it to me for £ 15 not £ 35   what you talk of does represent more what happened across europe rather than just the uk poland and the previous eastern bloc being your southern states   thatcher for good or bad the unions in the uk a new one when she was in power hence the only 1 time the natural gas powered plant was fired up   we have rights in the uk that are now being legislated from europe but to be honest they hardly seem worth the paper they are written on the unions like yours just do n't have the anymore   on thinking about it do you think the earthquake had anything to do with the migration of that cat site back to the us

i agree with that you may be well advised to pay off your loans first and go from there   even though you may not be required to make payments on your own loan based on your income that debt will play a large factor in your borrowing ability until it is gone which hinders your ability to move toward home ownership    if you are in a fortunate enough position to totally pay off both your loan and hers from cash on hand then you should   it would still leave you with more than $ and no debt which is a big priority and advantage for a young couple mind you this does n't keep you from starting an investment plan with some portion of the remaining funds the advice to keep six months income in the bank is very wise through perhaps a mutual fund if you do n't want to directly manage the investments yourself   the advantage of mutual funds is the ability to choose the level of risk you 're willing to take and let professionals manage how to achieve your goals for you   you can always make adjustments to your funds as your circumstances change again i 'd emphasize yourself of the student loan debt as the first move then looking at how to invest the remainder

given that utilizing all the funds available to you drains your retirement and leaves you with very little cushion for unforeseen events as already noted it may be best to use a smaller amount for closing and just deal with the pmi for a couple years pmi is likely less than the taxes penalties incurred from withdrawing a full 20 + closing costs let alone the lost earning on the accounts above your mortgage interest rate but personally i think the stability of significant home equity is worth more than anticipated stock gains i would recommend pulling enough to buy the house comfortably without dipping too deeply in any one area while still paying down your balance to where you can eliminate pmi quickly say 2 3 years your limits for each account are approximately roth iras   traditional iras brokerage non retirement checking things to consider    if you are current on your payments you can request pmi removal once your loan to value drops below 80 it also automatically when it is scheduled to drop below 78 not if it actually has many loans have a 2 year minimum pmi period though regardless of your loan to value ltv changes ltv changes could be from

they are basically asking for the name of the legal entity that they should write on the check you as a person are a legal entity and so you can have them pay you directly by name this is in effect a sole proprietorship arrangement and it is the situation of most independent contractors you 're working for yourself and you get all the money but you also have all the responsibility you can also set up a legal alias or a doing business as dba name the only thing that changes versus using your own name is well that you are n't using your own name to be honest you pay some trivial fee for the paperwork to the county clerk or other office of record and you 're now not only john doe you 're enterprises and your business checks can be written out to that name and the bank who will want a copy of the dba paperwork to file when you set the name up as a payable entity on the account will cash them for you an llc since it was mentioned is a limited liability company it is a legal entity that is your in the business world it not you is the entity that primarily faces anyone else in that world you become for legal purposes an agent of that company authorized to make decisions on its behalf you can do all the same things make all the same money but if things go pear shaped the company is the one liable not you sounds great right well there 's a downside and that 's taxes and the increased complexity thereof depending on the exact structure of the company the irs will treat the llc either as a corporation a partnership or as a disregarded entity most one man llcs are typically disregarded meaning that for tax purposes all the money the company makes is treated as if it were made by you as a sole proprietor as in the above cases and with the associated increased fica and lack of tax deductions that an employee would get nothing can be retained by the company because as far as the irs is concerned it does n't exist so whether the money from the profits of the company actually made it into your personal checking account or not it has to be reported by you on the schedule c. you can elect if you wish to have the llc treated as a corporation this allows the corporation to retain earnings and thus to own liquid assets like cash as opposed to only fixed assets like land cars etc it also allows you to be an employee of your own company and pay yourself a true salary with all the applicable tax rules including pre tax healthcare employer paid fica etc however the downside here is that some money is subject to double taxation any monies retained by the company or paid out to members as dividends is profit of the company for which the company is taxed at the corporate rate then the money from that dividend you receive from the company is taxed again at the capital gains rate on your own 1040 return this also means that you have to file taxes twice once for the corporation once for you as the individual you ca n't of course have it both ways with an llc you ca n't pay yourself a true salary and get the associated tax breaks then receive leftover profits as a distribution and avoid double taxation it takes multiple members owners to have the llc treated like a partnership and there are specific types of llcs set up to handle investments where some of what i 've said above does n't apply i wo n't get into that because the question inferred a single owner situation but the tax rules in these additional situations are again different

let 's divide all bank accounts into savings and checking the main difference is that checking is easy to get money from savings is hard to get money from because of this the federal reserve requires that banks keep more money on hand to cover transactions in checking accounts here is a related question from a banking customer regarding a recent notice on their bank statement deposit it seems that the bank was moving the customer 's money between hidden sub accounts to make it look like the checking account was really a savings account and thus reduce the amount of funds we are required to keep on deposit at the federal reserve bank if they did n't have to transfer the money many times the bank could keep less cash on hand but once they did 5 hidden transactions the rest of the money in the hidden savings account would be moved by the bank the 6 transaction limit is done to not allow you to treat savings like checking here is a relevant quote from the federal reserve savings deposits   savings deposits generally have no specified maturity    period they may be interest bearing with interest computed or paid    daily weekly quarterly or on any other basis the two most    significant features of savings deposits are the reservation of    right requirement and the restrictions on the number of    convenient transfers or withdrawals that may be made per month or    per statement cycle of at least four weeks from the account in order    to classify an account as a savings deposit the institution must    in its account agreement with the customer reserve the right at any    time to require seven advance written notice of an intended    withdrawal in practice this right is never exercised but the    institution must nevertheless reserve that right in the account    agreement in addition for an account to be classified as a savings    deposit the depositor may make no more than six convenient    transfers or withdrawals per month from the account convenient    transfers and withdrawals for purposes of this limit include    automatic transfers including but not limited to    transfers from the savings deposit for overdraft protection or for    direct bill payments and transfers and withdrawals initiated by    telephone or computer and transfers made by check debit     card or other similar order made by the depositor and payable to    third parties other less convenient types of transfers such as    withdrawals or transfers made in person at the bank by mail or by    using an atm do not count toward the six per month limit and do not    affect the account ’s status as a savings account also a withdrawal    request initiated by telephone does not count toward the transfer    limit when the withdrawal is disbursed via check mailed to the    depositor   should be particularly wary of a bank ’s practices    for handling telephone transfers as noted an unlimited number of    telephone initiated withdrawals are allowed so long as a check for    the withdrawn funds is mailed to the depositor otherwise the limit    is six telephone transfers per month the limit applies to    transfers to move savings deposit funds to another type of deposit    account and to make payments to third parties

for a two year time frame a good insured savings account or a low cost short term government bond fund is most likely the way i would go depending on the specific amount it may also be reasonable to look into directly buying government bonds the reason for this is simply that in such a short time period the stock market can be extremely volatile imagine if you had gone all in with the money on the stock market in say 2007 intending to withdraw the money after two years take a broad stock market index of your choice and see how much you 'd have got back and consider if you 'd have felt comfortable sticking to your plan for the duration since you would likely be focused more on preservation of capital than returns during such a relatively short period the risk of the stock market making a major or even relatively minor downturn in the interim would should be a bigger consideration than the possibility of a higher return the return of capital not return on capital rule if the stock market falls by 10 it must go up by 11 to break even if it falls by 25 it must go up by 33 to break even if you are looking at a slightly longer time period such as the example five years then you might want to add some stocks to the mix for the possibility of a higher return still however since you have a specific goal in mind that is still reasonably close in time i would likely keep a large fraction of the money in interest bearing holdings bank account bonds bond funds rather than in the stock market a good compromise may be medium to high yield corporate bonds it should n't be too difficult to find such bond funds that can return a few percentage points above risk free interest if you can live with the price volatility over time and as you get closer to actually needing the money shift the holdings to lower risk holdings to secure the capital amount yes short term government bonds tend to have dismal returns particularly currently it 's pretty much either that or the country is just about bankrupt already which means that the risk of default is quite high which is reflected in the interest premiums demanded by investors but the risk in most countries short term government bonds is also very much limited and generally when you are looking at using the money for a specific purpose within a defined and relatively short time frame you want to reduce risk even if that comes with the price tag of a slightly lower return and as always never put all your eggs in one basket a combination of government bonds from various countries may be appropriate just as you should diversify between different stocks in a well balanced portfolio make sure to check the limits on how much money is insured in a single account for a single individual in a single institution and for a household you do n't want to chase high interest bank accounts only to be burned by something like that if the institution goes bankrupt generally the sooner you expect to need the money the less risk you should take even if that means a lower return on capital and the risk progression ignoring currency effects which affects all of these equally is roughly short term government bonds long term government bonds or regular corporate bonds high yield corporate bonds stock market large cap stock market mid and low cap yes there are exceptions but that 's a rule of thumb

what exactly is call protection is no normal for a cd    a callable cd or one without protection can be revoked before maturity by the issuer for example if interest rates drop they might recall the cd since they can borrow money at a lower rate a callable cd should offer a better return in exchange for this is first coupon date the first time it actually pays interest    yes given that the first coupon date is in 6 months and it 's semiannual is it fair to assume that this pays every six months    yes given that the maturity date is this is really a 15-year cd right    it depends cds can be resold on the market so it is at least a 15 year cd it could also be a 20 year cd originally issued in 2005 what does price ask mean it says 100 does that mean you buy in chunks of $ 100    yes more accurately they are $ 100 per cd   what is yield to worst ask is this the worst yield that this cd will return    the lowest potential yield that can be received on a bond without the issuer actually defaulting 3.25 is the best yield i 've seen from something as stable as a cd would it be silly though to lock money up in an investment like this for 15 years      there is no way to really say without a crystal ball if you are n't willing to accept more risk and think that interest rates will remain at these historic lows for a long while then it is probably a good deal if you think interest rates are due to go up substantially then it is probably smarter to ladder your investments in shorter term cds in investment circles this is known as interest rate risk

this depends on here in the us where i am interest rates were around 3.9 when i fixed my mortgage this underperforms the market e.g. a total market etf like $ vti or an sp500 etf like $ voo have expected returns of the current market growth rate so in theory i am better off paying into the market and making returns greater than my interest rate rather than paying into the equity   however past market returns do not guarantee future market returns the market could reset it could crash are you willing to accept this risk you have to analyze what happens if the market suffers say a 30 correction and you lose a lot of money quickly   i would certainly not invest in individual non etf stocks or you are really exposing yourself to risk

my problem with this is that there 's no one size fits all approach to eliminating poverty these are very much middle class values and i do n't think imposing them on impoverished children is the right approach and besides poverty itself can be fluid most kids already in poverty are stuck in generational poverty but there 's also situational poverty that can affect anyone at any time for kids in generational poverty it 's about survival they do n't plan ahead because they do n't have the luxury to do that it 's day to day with them with each day bringing a new challenge    do i know what we have to do to eliminate poverty no and i do n't think anyone does but i do think whatever approach we take should be and take into account the environmental contexts that shape a person 's life this kind of lazy is n't gon na cut it

to expand on @joetaxpayer 's answer the devil is actually in the fine print all   the credit card checks that i have ever received in the mail explicitly says that the checks can not be used to pay off   or pay down the balance on any other credit card issued by the same bank whether the card is branded with the bank logo or is branded with a department store or airline logo etc the checks can be used to pay utilities or even taxes without paying the service fee that is charged for using a credit card for such payments the payee is paid the face amount of the check in contrast to charges on a credit card from a merchant who gets to collect only about of the amount on the   charge slip generally speaking balance transfer offers are a bad deal regardless    of whether you pay only the minimum amount due each month or whether    you pay each month 's statement balance in full by the due date or    anything in between the rest of this answer is an explanation in support of the above assertion feel free to tl;dr it if you like if you make only the minimum payment due each month and some parts of the balance that you are carrying has different interest rates applicable than other parts then your payment can be applied to any part of the balance at the bank 's discretion it need hardly be said that the bank invariably chooses to apply it to pay off the lowest rate portion by law card act of 2009 anything above the minimum payment due must be applied to pay off the highest rate part and then the next highest rate part etc but minimum payment or less is at the bank 's discretion as an illustration suppose that you are not using your credit cards any more and are paying down the balances due by making the minimum payment due each month suppose also that you have a balance of $ 1000 carrying 12 apr on card a and pay off the entire balance of $ 500 on card b transferring the amount at 0 apr to card a for which you are billed a 2 fee your next minimum payment   will be likely be $ 35 computed as $ 10 interest on $ 1000 + $ 10 transfer fee + $ 15 1 of balance of $ 1500 if you make only the minimum payment due that payment will go towards paying off the $ 500 and so for next month your balance will be $ 1500 of which $ will be charged 1 interest and $ will be charged 0 interest   in the months   that follow the balance on which you owe 1 interest per month will grow and the 0 balance will shrink   you have to pay more than the minimum amount due to reduce the amount that you owe in this example in the absence of the balance transfer the minimum payment would have been $ 20 = $ 10 interest on $ 1000 at 1 per month + $ 10 1 of balance and would have left you with $ 990 due for next month   to be at the same point with the balance transfer offer you would need to pay $ 30 more than the minimum payment of $ 35 due this extra $ 30 will pay off the interest and transfer fee $ 20 and the rest will be applied to the $ 1000 balance to reduce it to $ 990 there would be no balance transfer fee in future months and so the extra that you need to pay will be a little bit smaller etc if you avoid paying interest charges on credit cards by never taking any cash advances and by paying off the monthly balance   consisting only of purchases made within the past month in full by the due date then the only way to avoid paying interest on the purchases made during the month of the balance transfer offer is to pay off that month 's statement in full including the balance just transferred over and the balance transfer fee by the due date   so depending on when in the billing cycle the transfer occurs you are getting a loan of the balance transfer amount for 25 to 55 days and being charged 2 or 3 for the privilege if you are getting offers of 2 balance transfer fees instead of 3 you are probably among those who pay their balances in full each month and the bank is trying to tempt you into doing a balance transfer by offering a lower fee it is unlikely that they will make a no transfer fee offer they would prefer laughing all the way to themselves by collecting a 2 transfer fee from you and possibly interest too if you fail to read the fine print than having you decline such offers at 3 as being too expensive can you make a balance transfer offer work in your favor sure   do n't make any purchases on the card in the month of the balance transfer or during the entire time that the 0 apr is being offered in the month of the transfer pay the minimum balance due plus the balance transfer fee in succeeding months pay the minimum balance due typically 1 of the balance owed each month all of it will go to reducing the 0 apr balance because that is the only amount owing just before the 0 apr expires anywhere from 6 to 24 months pay off the remaining balance in full   but remember that you are losing the use of this card for this whole period of time put it away in a locked trunk in the attic because using the card to make a purchase will mean paying interest on charges from the day they post something that might be totally alien to you

there 's no objective definition of what your house is worth between sales   if you sell it for $ 107 k then that 's the current functional definition of its worth   there is not extra money to be had because you sold it for less than it was worth   if the buyer is able to flip it for more then the value of the house effectively went up and he will pocket the difference when he sells it edit this turned out to be unexpectedly controversial so let me be more precise in my answer   i think this is important because it seems like many people misunderstand equity and how it figures or does n't into the value of their home which then leads to significant confusion and errors in what 's many people 's largest single investment at any given time there are several possible ways to put a dollar value on your home   a non exclusive list that includes some of these obviously are more official than others it would not be strange for these different values to vary by quite a bit at any given time this is what i meant in my original answer when i said there 's no objective definition of what your house is worth between sales the interesting thing and what i meant in my original answer when i wrote current functional definition of its worth is that none of these factor directly into the transaction that the op described of selling his house except for the last   using the numbers from the op 's example that means the $   wherever the op got the number $ 155 k either from one of the options on my list above or somewhere else it wo n't be directly part of the sale between him and his friend for completeness with a nod to eric 's comments on my original answer some of these numbers may indirectly influence the sale   for example the buyer typically wo n't be able to get a mortgage for a value greater than the appraised value of the house and so that might influence what he 's willing and able to bid   there may also be tax consequences if the price is artificially low like say a gift   as further below however that 's not directly relevant to answering the op 's stated question now the op seemed to believe that there is an extra $ 48 k in cash up for grabs in this scenario   that comes from the $ 155 k value that the op claims his house has and the $ 107 k price of the actual proposed sale   this is a complete misconception   when the buyer and seller sit down at closing and the title agent sums up who owes and who receives cash in this transaction the $ 155 k theoretical value will not enter into the calculation and therefore no one will pocket it subsequently however after the buyer takes possession he may sell it   if it 's true that he got a deal on the transaction at $ 107 k then he maybe able to flip it and turn a profit   but if that happens it will be in a completely separate subsequent transaction even if you look to this hypothetical second sale however the $ 155 k does n't really figure   the new owner will have to find his own buyer and they will have to agree on a price   that might happen to be $ 155 k but there 's no real reason to believe that it will or it wo n't

your relatively young age and the current very low bond interest rates make annuities a very poor buy and most of the other suggestions you have mentioned have very low diversification which exposes you to imprudent risks buying shares for dividend income can solve the diversification problem by averaging out your totals as different shares change by different amounts there is no really good solution to the problem of share price volatility except to ignore it take your dividends and pretty much ignore the bouncing around of the share price they usually recover in a year or three owning shares of companies that reliably increase their dividend payouts is the only investment type that gives you both diversification and regularly increasing income to counteract inflation over the years read some investment books and consider consulting with a financial advisor who charges a fee for the advice i.e. you do n't want free advice

gt you are the one using false equivalency   no i am using a rather simple parallel to show that consent is socially created and can exist non explicitly   your response is simply to assert your own opinion that you have not consented to the state without any reason to take that view seriously you grew up under the rule of your state you were educated about the implications of that long before you were expected to start paying taxes and there is nothing preventing you from leaving the state 's jurisdiction at any time your opinion that this does not indicate consent is irrelevant because the whole rest of society thinks that it does if arbitrarily asserting that you have n't consented to things was an argument literally anything can be oppressive i can walk into your home and set up camp in your living room and say i did n't consent to this being your house all social rules are instantly out the window is that how society works   i 've jumped through these hoops before i know how you people try and pull this off it does n't work your position is not it 's just a series of language tricks that people who have n't thought it all the way through   you 're either a charlatan or you 've been deceived by one and i do n't really care to learn which   quoting myself from weeks ago   gt gt gt gt i 'd like to know how exactly i opt into paying    gt gt gt by choosing to occupy the territory ruled by your state despite being fully informed about the implications of doing so and having been made informed well before you had an obligation to start paying    gt gt that 's not an agreement    gt let 's say i walk into a shop say i 'll have a medium coke please they hand me one i walk out of the building am i stealing well i did n't specifically agree to pay for it did i but that argument would n't hold much weight in an actual legal dispute because obviously i understand that when you ask for an item in a shop you 're implicitly agreeing to pay for it at some point   gt   gt but what about some less obvious cases if a put a small sign near the that said entry fee ten dollars entering the store constitutes agreement to pay you could reasonably argue this is invalid because you walked into the store without noticing the sign and the practice is quite unusual but if instead of a shop it were a theater performance you walked into maybe that argument would n't hold up because you should be expected to understand there 's an entry fee at a theater and maybe if you were from a country that does n't have theaters and you were thus genuinely unaware of this particular social custom they would make an exception and you 'd get away with it this is the kind of problem a judicial system exists for to take social context into account   gt   gt the point is whether something constitutes agreement or not and thus what are the legal repercussions to your actions is a matter of opinion and in this case i do n't see any particular reason to think that your opinion about the government ought to overrule that of the rest of society your actions are interpreted as indicating consent for the system you 're acting in and this being so if you took the government to court on the charge that it 's stealing from you you would obviously lose so how is it an argument to just say but that 's not an agreement in my opinion that 's as irrelevant as me saying but i did n't agree to pay for this food i just ate officer i just walked in and asked for food and they gave it to me and i ate it that 's not an agreement in my opinion   gt

i think you can do it as long as those money do n't come from illegal activities money laundering etc the only taxes you should pay are on the interest generated by those money while sitting in the uk bank account since i suppose you already paid taxes on those money in greece while you were earning those money about being audited in my own experience banks do n't ask you much where your money are coming from when you bring money to them they are very willing to help and happy it 's a story when you ask to borrow money when i opened a bank account in us i did not even have an ssn but they did n't care much they just took my passport and used the passport number for registering the account obviously on the interest generated by the money in the us bank account i had to pay taxes but it was easy because i simply let the irs via the bank to the 27 on the interest generated not on the capital deposited i did n't put a huge amount of money there i had to live there for 1 year or some more maybe if i deposited a huge amount of money someone would have come to ask me how did i make all those money but those money were legally generated by me working in italy before so i did n't have anything to be afraid about btw in italy i was thinking to move money to a german bank in germany the risk of default is a nightmare something of new now in compared to the past where each state had its own currency according to muro history says that in case of default it happened that some government prevented people from withdrawing money form bank accounts yes historically governments have    shut down banks to prevent people from    withdrawing their money in times of    crisis see argentina circa 2001 or us    during great depression the    government prevented people from    withdrawing their money and people    could do nothing while their money    rapidly lost value but in case greece prevents people from money those money are still in euro so i 'm wondering what would be the effect i mean would it be fair that a greek guy can not withdraw is euro money an italian guy can withdraw the same currency money in italy

to add to mrchrister 's answer   canada also has a consumer price index cpi used to measure inflation that is distinct and separate from that maintained by the united states there are differences in inflation between the u.s. and canada because our currencies are different and there may be different items in the basket of goods that constitutes the index you can find current information on the canadian cpi at statistics canada here latest release from the consumer price index also the bank of canada our central bank maintains a free online inflation calculator   the boc 's inflation calculator is handy because you can enter a dollar amount for a past date and it will figure out what that would be in today 's dollars   for instance $ 100 in 1970 dollars had the same purchasing power under the cpi as $ in 2009 dollars and you 're right if you get a salary increase that is less than the rate of inflation then in theory you have lost purchasing power   so anybody really looking for a raise ought to make an effort to get more than the increase in cpi   of course some employers are counting on you not knowing that because any increase that 's less than cpi is effectively a salary decrease which could mean more profit for them if they are able to increase their prices revenues at inflation or better finally consider that salary wage increases also contribute to inflation   perhaps you 've heard of the wage price inflation spiral   if you have n't there 's more on that here and here

the difficulty with investing in mining and gold company stocks is that they are subject to the same market forces as any other stocks although they may whether those forces better in a crisis than other stocks do because they are related to gold which has always been a flight to safety move for investors some investors buy physical gold although you do n't have to take actual delivery of the metal itself   you can leave it with the broker dealer you buy it from much the way you do n't have your broker send you stock certificates   that way if you leave the gold with the broker dealer someone reputable of course like or then you can sell it quickly if you choose just like when you want to sell a stock if you take delivery of a security share certificate or commodity gold oil etc then before you can sell it you have to return it to broker which takes time   the decision has much to do with your investing objectives and willingness to absorb risk   the reason people choose mutual funds is because their money gets spread around a basket of stocks so if one company in the fund takes a hit it does n't wipe out their entire investment   if you buy gold you run the risk low in my opinion of seeing big losses if for some reason gold prices plummet   you 're all in on one thing which can be risky it 's a judgment call on your part but that 's my two cents worth

the laws as written at the time required a pretty high burden of proof to show fraud   there were a lot of words like having to show intent or of the risks for it to be illegal those are always tough cases to win and the regulators themselves were reluctant to ride the banks too hard because that just reinforces the regulators own incompetence

i can think of one short term solution lower your debt to credit ratio   even if you pay off your credit card before the due date the balance you owe is registered as a debt on your credit score for that statement period   if you pay off your balance before the statement period closes the amount will be zero debt to credit ratio is one of highest impact factors used in computing the credit score the dip from the hard pull should be only temporary   additionally there are different fico scoring models that lenders use which can provide significant variance   once your score is in the mid however that and sufficient income should be sufficient for a prime rate loan credit card or other service for which the credit score is relevant

not an amazon fanboy by any means but part of their philosophy is basically that if we do n't sell low somebody else will the low prices and service are the advertising and the volume helps them push efficiencies further there is n't anything stopping them from raising prices but its sort of runs counter to their whole business mantra

a good quick filter to see if a property is worth looking at is if the total rent for the property for the year is equal to 10 of the price of the property   for example if the property is valued at $ 400,000 then the rent collected should be $ 40,000 for the entire year   which is $ per month if the property does not bring in at least 10 per year then it is not likely all the payments can be covered on the property   it 's more likely to be sinking money into it to keep it afloat you would be exactly right as you have to figure in insurance utilities taxes maintenance repair mortgage payments new roof new furnace etc paint etc also as a good rule of thumb expect a vacancy rate of at least 10 or 1 month per year as a precaution if you have money sitting around look into real estate investment trusts   iirc the average dividend was north of 10 last year   that is all money that comes back to you   i 'm not sure what the tax implications are in australia however in canada dividends are taxed very   no mortgage property tax tenants to find or maintenance either

dummy example to explain this suppose your portfolio contained just two securities a thirty year us government bond and a tesla stock both of those position are currently valued at $ 1 mm the tesla position however is very volatile with its daily volatility being about 5 based on the standard deviation of its daily return whole there bond 's daily volatility is 1 then the tesla position is of your risk while being only 1/2 of the portfolio    now if in month the tesla stock tanks to half is values then then it 's risk is half as much as before and so it 's total contribution to risk has gone down

some adrs have standardized options that trade on us exchanges   if your stock adr is one of those then you find the put option through most brokerages that deal with stock options and trade the option like you would on a regular stock   if your adr does not have standardized options then your options will depend on where the adr trades   if it 's otc you might not even be able to short it   if it trades on a major exchange the shorting the adr may be a viable choice

i really think the government should have a few elite groups inside of each of their big divisions filled with mathematicians statisticians computer scientists and experts in the fields    i 'm thinking a group pursuing medicare fraud a group pursuing sec violations a group pursuing dod etc   it 's not like these criminals are especially competent they just rely on staying under the radar    hiring a team of 50 or 100 or whatever top notch analysts and then giving them a cut of the fraud they 've exposed would go a long way toward attracting top talent in a way that is politically defensible the sec does n't work because being an sec lawyer pays about a of what being a lawyer for a hedge fund does imagine that same sec lawyer getting 1 or 5 of the settlements penalties that are levied against fraudulent companies you could still become fuck you rich while working for the government and the us would be a lot better off

i can not speak for the specific jurisdictions but you will generally pay income tax in each jurisdiction and be required to declare your foreign income in both your annual assessment takes into account both domestic and foreign income so sadly there is no tax windfall to you i would imagine that finland and belgium have tax treaties so you will not have to pay tax twice you need an accountant in both countries to sort this for you

wait correct me if i 'm wrong but this is how i thought it worked   say you work 40 hours a week during a recession no one gets fired instead they cut your hours from say 40 to 32 then unemployment benefits make up the difference in that eight hours you 're not working then you get hired again   this seems like the best system ever and something america should do no one gets fired and companies save of money not training new workers

what exactly would the financial institution need to see to make them    comfortable with these regulations the llc operating agreement the should specify the member 's allocation of equity assets income and loss and of course managerial powers and signature authorities in your case it should say that the llc is single member entity and the single member has all the managerial powers and authorities what is called member managed every llc is required to have an operating agreement although you do n't necessarily have to file it with the state or record it if you do n't have your own default rules will apply depending on your state law however the bank will probably not take you as a customer without an explicit

if you 're simply a futures speculator then yes it does seem like gambling if you 're a farmer producing a few thousand bushels of wheat futures can be a mechanism for you to hedge against certain kinds of market risk same if you 're running a heating oil company etc i just read somewhere that the bad spring weather in south dakota has prevented farmers from getting corn planted nothing is in the ground yet this is objective data from which you might infer that this year 's corn harvest could be late and/or smaller than normal so maybe if you 're a buyer for general mills you use corn futures to control your costs in this case you 'd have some idea based on experience what to expect for the price of corn what your production line requires for input how much you can charge for finished product etc these all factor in to the price you 'd be willing to pay for corn futures

the money from the employer is counted as income for you and should be included in the numbers on your w-2   you also have tuition you paid that is an educational expense that would generally be a tax credit if you qualify for those educational tax credits if the money from the employer was counted as income you can use also claim tuition expenses if the money was n't included as income you then ca n't claim the tuition as an educational expense my experience has been that expenses such as books have not been covered but could be paid for with the money from a 529 money to cover mandatory fees such as lab fees and a fee that all students must pay can be counted as tuition expenses regarding customized books those are much harder to prove if you were to count that particular book as a tuition expenses and were audited you would have to show them the book to prove it most books are n't mandatory also if you do want to claim the books as an expense remember to account for the money that is returned if any are sold back to the bookstore at the end of the term

this is an answer grounded in reality not advice most states have no means of enforcing their foreign business entity registration statutes some states never even codified consequences california is a notable exception some states have business licenses that you need in order to defend your entity in court but will retroactively apply the corporate veil when you get the license the do i have to register question is analogous to asking a barber if you need a haircut but this does n't absolve you of looking in the mirror doing your research registration and income taxes are different stories if a state calls their fee a franchise tax and it is applicable and there are real consequences for not then you will have to pay that tax anyway this is n't advocating breaking the law but since it describes ignoring state chartered agencies then there are people that will disagree with this post despite being in line with business climate in the united states hope that helps

i honestly think lowering the corporate tax rate and allowing money to be brought back into the us are both good for the average american i also think his main point is regarding the post 08 rules regarding mortgages and business loans being unnecessarily burdensome and restrictive which has limited the amount of capital he 's able to give those same people mind you this is coming from the guy who did n't take advantage of the too loose regulations as well so i can understand where he 's coming from
