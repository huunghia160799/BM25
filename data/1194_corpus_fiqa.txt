if the employer provides housing to the employee the employer has to identify whether it is taxable or not if it is the amounts would be added to the taxable income on your w2 all the withholding and fica tax calculations will be performed based on that taxable income if the employer fails to do that and you get audited you can be left on the hook for the unpaid taxes on the unreported income in some cases employee housing is a non taxable fringe benefit in others it is taxable your tax adviser will help identify which case applies to you after you added in a comment that you 're trying to see if you should be asking your boss to pay your personal expenses vs. giving you a raise as i said in the comments your personal expenses are not deductible neither for you nor for anyone else if your boss pays your rent instead of a raise its taxable income for you

i feel that op 's question is fundamentally wrong and an understanding of why is important the stock market as a whole in the usa has an average annualized return of 11 that means that a monkey throwing darts at a board can usually turn 100 k into over three million in thirty five years the analog i 'm drawing is a 30-year old with 100 k randomly picking stocks will be a multi millionaire at 65 so to be good at investing in the stock market you need to be better than a monkey most people are n't why what mistakes do people make and how do you avoid them a very common mistake is to buy high sell low this happened before and after the 08 's recession people rushed into the market beforehand as it was reaching its peak sold when the market bottomed out then ignored the market in years it was getting returns a bogle approach for this is to simply consistently put a   part of your income into the market whether it is raining or shining paying high fees going back to the monkey example if the monkey charges you a 2 management fees which is low by canadian standards the monkey will cost you one million dollars over the course of the thirty five years if the monkey does a pretty good job it is a worthy expenditure but most humans including professional stock pickers are worst than a monkey at picking stocks another mistake is adjusting your plan many people when the market was giving bull returns before the 08 's crash happily had a large segment of their wealth in stocks they thought they were risk tolerant crash happened they moved towards bonds then bonds returns were comically low while stocks soared had they had a plan almost any consistent plan they 'd have done better another genre of issues is just doing stupid things do n't buy that penny stock do n't trade like crazy do n't pay 5 $ commission on a 200 $ stock order do n't fail to file your taxes   another mistake and this burdens a lot of people is that your long term investments are for long term investing what a novel idea you 're 401 k does n't exist for you to get a loan for a home many people do liquidate their long term savings do n't especially since people who do make these loans or say i 'll pay myself back later do n't

there 's already an excellent answer here from but i wanted to expand a bit on types of investments with some additional actionable information you can invest in stocks bonds mutual funds which are simply    collections of stocks and bonds bank accounts precious metals and    many other things discussing all of these investments in one answer    is too broad but my recommendation is this if you are investing for    retirement you should be investing in the stock market however    picking individual stocks is too risky you need to be diversified in    a lot of stocks stock mutual funds are a great way to invest in the    stock market so how does one go about actually investing in the stock market in a diversified way what if you also want to diversify a bit into bonds fortunately in the last several years several products have come about that do just these things and are targeted towards newer investors these are often labeled robo advisors most even allow you to adjust your allocation according to your risk preferences here 's a list of the ones i know about while these products all to achieve similar goals of giving you an easy way to obtain a diversified portfolio according to your risk they differ in the buckets of stocks and funds they put your money into the careful investor would be wise to compare which specific etfs they use e.g. looking at their expense ratios capitalization and spreads

i worked in the service industry for over 10 years and this came up every now and again   mostly in hypothetical situations    i 'm not a tax expert but my general understanding is that it is viewed as income by the irs if you performed a service of any kind in exchange for the money   in other words if you waited on the table and they left you a gift for doing so it is taxable    you 'll probably also find that if you pool tips with other employees or have to tip out the bartenders cooks or dishwashers they 'll generally agree with the irs that you clearly received a tip and want their fair share while the concept of gifting money to others in a situation like this is intriguing especially in the service industry it really does n't meet the definition of a gift in the eyes of the irs for it to truly be a gift the person would have had to intend to gift you the money even if they had n't come into your restaurant at all that night   that clearly is not the case here

the best advice i can give you is that you need to start on math now*. i made the same mistake as op and did n't realize that going up in finance would require as much math as it does granted i was undergrad finance not marketing like him so maybe it was a little better for me but if you really want to do upper level finance do not on math   it 's easy to fall into the trap doing cal 2 your sophomore year and thinking i wo n't really need this and just doing the minimum to get through it for undergrad that 's true for master 's you 'll need it this happened to me and i suffered a lot because of it your professors in the master 's program will likely give you a crash course in what you need to know but you wo n't have a real understanding of it unless you took and did really well in those math classes beforehand   to answer your question    1 maybe you should definitely take cal 1 early depending on how you can hold on to the information cal 2 can wait a bit so it 's fresher when you start doing upper level finance your second half of junior year senior year   2 upper level finance is a whole different beast from lower level finance same with economics if you 're not good at math if you do n't enjoy math it might not be the best choice i 'm not good at math and the undergrad finance was n't too bad however the master 's program was very very not fun    edit ymmv but i do n't recommend going straight into the master 's program straight out of undergrad work in industry for a bit first the jobs you need to a master 's for wo n't hire you straight out of undergrad so it 'll be dead weight experience is what you need

a company 's return on equity roe is its net income divided by its shareholder 's equity   the shareholder 's equity is the difference between total assets and total liabilities and is not dependent on the stock price what it takes to have a roe over 100 is to have the income be greater than the equity   this might happen for a variety of reasons but one way a high roe happens is if the shareholder 's equity the divisor is small which can occur if past losses have eroded the company 's capital the original invested cash and retained earnings   if the equity has become a small value the income for some period might exceed it and so the roe would be over 100 operating margin is not closely related to roe   although operating income is related to net income to calculate the margin you divide by sales which is completely unrelated to shareholder 's equity   so there is no relationship with roe to be expected   operating margin is primarily dependent on market conditions and can be substantially different in different industries

i would actually disagree with mrchrister on this you can afford yourself the car in this price range paid cash i do n't know how exactly you spend your income but from my experience in expensive california saving $ 20 k a year from $ 70 k income with $ 800/mo rent is feasible having a loan on your credit report which is paid on time and in full will definitely help you rebuilding your credit your calculations re the costs of the loan are based on the assumption that you 're going to keep the loan for the whole period do n't do that see 1 you can repay this loan much quicker than the 3 years it should originally have been 6 months of the loan which is then paid off will do to your credit report and credit score yes it is going to cost you some but in your particular case i would argue that its worth it you 're an adult now you need credit cards you 'll need a mortgage at some point you need to rent a place to live all these require a good credit report just waiting as mrchrister suggests will help but much much slower   having said that a seller that can not discuss the terms over the phone is most likely a dishonest person once you 're there and in front of him it is harder for you to verify information resist signing papers and negotiating

it would be quite the trick for a the government to run all year and get all its revenue in april when taxes are due and b for people to actually save the right amount to be able to cut that check each year w2 employers withhold the estimated federal and state taxes along with the payroll social security tax from each paycheck since the employer does n't know how many kids you have or how much mortgage interest etc you will take deductions for you can submit a w4 form to adjust withholdings    the annual form 1040 in april is to reconcile exact numbers some people get a refund of some of what they paid in others owe some money   if one is self employed they are required to pay quarterly estimated taxes and they too reconcile exact numbers in april

if they return to their earlier prices assuming i do n't make too many poor choices that 's your problem right there you have no guarantee that stocks will in fact return to their earlier prices rather than go down some more after the time you buy them your strategy only looks good and easy   in hindsight when you know the exact point in time when stocks stopped going down and started going up but to implement it you need to predict that time and that 's impossible i would adopt a guideline of sell when you 've made x% even if it looks like it might go higher congratulations you 've come up with the concept of technical analysis now go and read the hundreds of books that have been written about it then think about why the people who wrote them waste time doing so rather than getting rich by using that knowledge

first of all i am sorry for your loss at this time worrying about money is probably the least of your concerns it might be tempting to try to pay off all your debts at once and while that would be satisfying it would be a poor investment of your inheritance when you have debt you have to think about how much that debt is costing you to keep open since you have on your student loan it does not make sense to pay any more than the minimum payments you may want to look into getting a personal loan to pay off your other personal debts the interest rates for a loan will probably be much less than what you are paying currently this will allow you to put a payment plan together that is affordable you can also use your inheritance as collateral for the loan getting a loan will most likely give you a better credit rating as well you may also be tempted to get a brand new sports car but that would also not be a good idea at all you should shop for a vehicle based on your current income and not your savings i believe you can get the same rates for an auto loan for a car up to 3 years old as a brand new car it would be worth your while to shop for a quality used car from a reputable dealer if it is a certified used car you can usually carry the rest of the new car warranty the biggest return on investment you have now is your employer sponsored 401(k account find out how long it takes for you to become fully vested being vested means that you can leave your job and keep all of your employer contributions if possible max out or at least contribute as much as you can afford to that fund to get employee matching you should also stick with your job until you become fully vested the money you have in retirement accounts does you no good when you are young there is a significant penalty for early withdrawal and that age is currently 59 1/2 doing the math it would be around when you would be able to have access to that money you should hold onto a certain amount of your money and keep it in a higher interest rate savings account or a money market account you say that your living situation will change in the next year as well take full advantage of living as cheaply as you can do n't make any unnecessary purchases try to brown bag it to lunch instead of eating out etc save as much as you can and put it into a savings account you can use that money to put a down payment on a house or for the security and first month 's rent try not to spend any money from your savings and try to support yourself as best as you can from your income make a budget for yourself and figure out how much you can spend every month do n't factor in your savings into it your savings should be treated as an emergency fund since you have just completed school and this is your first big job out of college your income will most likely improve with time it might make sense to job hop a few times to find the right position you are much more likely to get a higher salary by changing jobs and employers than you are staying in the same one for your entire career this generally is true even if you are promoted at the by the same employer if you do leave your current job you would lose what your employer contributed if you are not vested even if that happened you would still keep the portion that you contributed

i think you 're missing a couple of things first why do you think its a reverse mortgage more likely than not its a regular mortgage home equity loan if so if they expect the stock market to rise significantly more than the amount of interest they pay on the loan then its a totally sensible course of action second the purchase in cash only to take out a loan later can definitely be a sensible way to do things for example if the seller wants to close fast or if there are competing offers where not having a contingency is the tipping point another reason might be purchasing in an entity name for example holding the title as an llc and in this case it is easier to get a loan if you already have the house since the banks see the owner 's actual commitment and not just promises

there are a few considerations purely financial if you think you can make more than 6 adjusted downward for the tax benefits of home interest deductions on that $ 150 k then no otherwise yes   update a good point was made in another answer if the 401 k is not a roth the tax consequences of withdrawing a lump sum like that will probably tip the balance in most situations towards not paying off the house risk paying off a mortgage reduces your liquidity that is it is much harder to pull your money out of a house note than to sell off some stocks funds cds put simply if you run into trouble and need a lot of money quickly would you rather have a paid off house or $ 150 k in the bank near cash investments

how do treasury auctions work first the us government will issue a notice indicating how much money it would like to borrow below is an actual announcement issued by the treasury department that it will be having an auction to raise $ 23 billion   the announcement indicates the date of the auction march 8th 2011 in the example as well as deadlines for competitive am and noncompetitive am bids if you would like to participate in the auction then your bids must be submitted before these times competitive bid the bidder specifies the maximum price they will pay for the security all treasuries are priced in $ 100 so bids are submitted in terms of buying a security that will repay the owner $ 100 when the security matures $ 100 is the face or par value noncompetitive bid the bidder does not specify any maximum price requirement these bidders are first in line to be issued a bill but they will get whatever price is determined at auction there is a limit of $ 5 million that can be submitted as a noncompetitive bid per bidder per auction for competitive bids any one customer can be awarded a maximum of 35 of the total offering in order to better illustrate the mechanics of the auction let 's go back to the example the table below is a hypothetical list of bids for the $ 23 billion being issued the bids include the total amount the bidder is willing to purchase as well as the maximum price the bidder will pay based on a $ 100 par value note bid 1 $ 5 billion max price do n't care bid 2 $ 10 billion max price do n't care bid 3 $ 5 billion max price $ 98 bid 4 $ 5 billion max price $ 95 bid 5 $ 10 billion max price $ 92 bid 6 $ 5 billion max price $ 90 notice there is a total of $ 40 billion in bids the auction is only for $ 23 billion this means some bids will go unfilled the ratio between bids and the amount of the auction is called the bid to cover ration for our example it is $ a high bid to cover ratio indicates a strong demand for the bonds since there are a lot of bidders a low ratio indicates weak demand a ratio under 2.0 is considered weak the bids are filled in the following manner results of our example auction bid 1 $ 5 billion max price noncompetitive all $ 5 billion filled at $ 95 bid 2 $ 10 billion max price noncompetitive all $ 10 billion filled at $ 95 bid 3 $ 5 billion max price $ 98 all $ 5 billion filled at $ 95 bid 4 $ 5 billion max price $ 95 only $ 3 billion filled at $ 95 bid 5 $ 10 billion max price $ 92 not filled bid 6 $ 5 billion max price $ 90 not filled once the auction is completed the treasury will post the results of the auction below is the actual results of the auction   there are some additional items that are reported from the auction high rate this is the highest yield or the lowest price that was accepted at the auction for our example this would be $ 95 allotted at high this is the percentage of the total that was filled at the highest accepted yield or lowest accepted price for our example the last $ 3 billion we filled was at the lowest price so our allotment at high would be $ = 13 price price as determined by the auction median rate half of the competitive bids were submitted below this rate while the other half were above low rate the lowest yield or highest price submitted for the competitive bids the announcement also shows the breakdown of the amount of bids submitted versus competitively and how much was rewarded for those same categories there is an entry in the middle of the results announcement listed as this stands for system open market account this represents treasuries that are held by the federal reserve if the federal reserve has treasuries that are maturing then it is expected that they will use the proceeds from those maturing treasuries to buy new treasuries for our example auction the fed had no bills maturing at the time if they did then the fed would also get the same price determined at the auction here is an article i wrote with a little more detail on the auction process   i 've included my sources at the end of the article as for treasuries being a safe investment   i 'm not so sure   right now the yield on 10 years is around 2.5   who in their right mind would lend money to the government for 10 years at 2.5   not me

applying for a mortgage is a bit of paperwork but not too bad of an experience rates are pretty tight if one lender were more that 1/4 lower than another they 'd be inundated with applications above a certain credit score you get the best rate a search will show you the rates offered in your area   if you are a first time buyer there are mortgages that might benefit you if you are a vet for non native english readers a veteran who served in the us armed forces not a who is an animal doctor there are mortgages that offer low to no down payment with attractive rates   yes avoid pmi it 's a crazy penalty on your overall expense of home purchase if banks qualify you for different amounts it should n't be a huge difference a few percent variation but the standard ratios are pretty liberal even today and getting the most you 'd qualify for is probably too much   using the standard 28/36 ratios a bank will qualify you for 4x your income as a loan e.g you make $ 50 k they 'll lend you $ 200k. this is a bit too much in my opinion   if you come up short you are really looking to borrow too much and should probably wait if you owe a bit on loans it should squeeze in between those two ratios 28/36 but i would n't borrow on a credit line to add to the purchase that 's asking for trouble

some sample prices for straightforward pay for hours or planners i think i 've seen some similar rates elsewhere too i 'd feel like you might get something and boilerplate for too much less than $ 1000 how could the person afford to spend much time and i 'd feel like lots more than $ 1000 for just a standard straightforward plan might be a ripoff basically you 're paying $ 1000 for a day or two of work you do n't want just a couple hours of work but you do n't need a week of work either anyway extracting the general guideline since prices may vary or over time you could figure it takes a day or two to do a decent job on a basic complete financial plan without a lot of complexities in it from there you can decide what 's fair adding or subtracting time if you need less than a complete plan or have complex issues this is assuming you 're paying for time and which is not a given the biggest factor in how much you pay is probably how they charge a couple of the most common models there are other models but these are the ones i 've seen most the difference between these two models is a lot of money over time hourly is going to be much cheaper because it 's a one time cost instead of ongoing and unrelated to what you have in assets however you wo n't get investment management which can be valuable if you are n't the kind to stick to an investment plan or you want someone else to completely take care of it for you the investment management planners have the potential to make a lot more money and are more likely to be in it for the money hourly planners do n't really have as good a business from a business owner 's perspective but they are cheaper from a customer perspective as long as you 're happy to diy a bit one thing i like about hourly planners is that i do n't really feel investments are the main place planners can add value so it makes me nervous to have the compensation based on that insurance estate planning taxes etc are where it 's harder for a to know all the ins and outs and diy from what i 've seen the cheapest planners are the ones that you can get free or discounted from companies like usaa or vanguard if you have an account with them however they will only recommend products from the company in question so that 's a downside and you probably wo n't get to meet them in person this question may be useful too what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money

if the buyer exercises your option you will have to give him the stock   if you already own the stock the worst that can happen is you have to give him your stock thus losing the money you spend to buy it   so the most you can lose is what you already spent to buy the stock minus the price the buyer paid for your option if you do n't own the stock you will have to buy it   but if the stock skyrockets in value it will be very expensive to buy it   if for instance you buy the stock when it is worth $ 100 sell your covered call and the next day the stock shoots to $ 1000 you will lose the $ 100 you got from the purchase of the stock   but if you had used a naked call you would have to buy the stock at $ 1000 and you would lose $ 900 since there is no limit to how high the stock can go there is no limit to how much money you may lose

it also depends on where you work if you move your home and your job then the date you establish residency in the new state is the key date all income before that date is considered income for state 1 and all income on or after that date is income for state 2   if there is a big   difference in income you will want to clearly establish residency because it impacts your wallet if they had the same rates moving would n't impact your wallet but it would impact each state so make sure when going from high tax state to low tax state that you register your vehicles register to vote get a new drivers license it becomes more complex if you move your home but not your job in that case where you work might be the deciding factor same states have agreed that where you live is the deciding factor in other cases it is not for virginia maryland and dc you pay based on where you live if the two states involved are dc md va but if you live in delaware and work in virginia virginia wants a cut of your income tax   so before you move you need to research reciprocity for the two states from massachusetts information for nonresident and part year resident income exemptions deductions and credits massachusetts gross income includes items of income derived from    sources within massachusetts this includes income a few questions later massachusetts residents and part year residents are allowed a credit    for taxes due to any other jurisdiction the credit is available only    on income reported and taxed on a massachusetts return nonresidents    may not claim the taxes paid to other jurisdiction credit on their    massachusetts form the credit is allowed for income taxes paid to the credit is not allowed for taxes paid to the u.s. government or a    foreign country other than canada city or local tax and interest and    penalty paid to another jurisdiction the computation is based on comparing the massachusetts income tax on    income reported to the other jurisdiction to the actual tax paid to    the other jurisdiction the credit is limited to the smaller of these    two numbers the other jurisdiction credit is a line item on the tax form but you    must calculate it on the worksheet in the instruction booklet and also    enter the credit information on the schedule so if you move your house to new hampshire but continue to work in massachusetts you will owe income tax to massachusetts   for that income even after you move and establish residency in new hampshire

i 'd suggest you start by looking at the mutual fund and/or etf options available via your bank and see if they have any low cost funds that invest in high risk sectors   you can increase your risk and potential returns by allocating your assets to riskier sectors rather than by picking individual stocks and you 'll be less likely to make an avoidable mistake it is possible to do as you suggest and pick individual stocks but by doing so you may be taking on more risk than you suspect even unnecessary risk   for instance if you decide to buy stock in company a you know you 're taking a risk by investing in just one company   however without a lot of work and financial expertise you may not be able to assess how much risk you 're taking by investing in company a specifically as opposed to company b.   even if you know that investing in individual stocks is risky it can be very hard to know how risky those particular individual stocks are compared to other alternatives this is doubly true if the investment involves actions more exotic than simply buying and holding an asset like a stock   for instance you could definitely get plenty of risk by investing in commercial real estate development or complicated options contracts but a certain amount of work and expertise is required to even understand how to do that and there is a greater likelihood that you will slip up and make a costly mistake that negates any extra gain even if the investment itself might have been sound for someone with experience in that area   in other words you want your risk to really be the risk of the investment not the personal risk that you 'll make a mistake in a complicated scheme and lose money because you did n't know what you were doing   if you do have some expertise in more exotic investments then maybe you could go this route but i think most people including me do n't on the other hand you can find mutual funds or etfs that invest in large economic sectors that are high risk but because the investment is diversified within that sector you need only compare the risk of the sectors   for instance emerging markets are usually considered one of the highest risk sectors   but if you restrict your choice to low cost emerging market index funds they are unlikely to differ drastically in risk at any rate far less than individual companies   this eliminates the problem mentioned above when you choose to invest in emerging markets index fund a you do n't need to worry as much about whether emerging markets index fund b might have been less risky most of the risk is in the choice to invest in the emerging markets sector in the first place and differences between comparable funds in that sector are small by comparison   you could do the same with other targeted sectors that can produce high returns for instance there are mutual funds and etfs that invest specifically in technology stocks so you could begin by exploring the mutual funds and etfs available via your existing investment bank or poke around on morningstar   fees will still matter no matter what sector you 're in so pay attention to those   but you can probably find a way to take an aggressive risk position without getting bogged down in the details of individual companies   also this will be less work than trying something more exotic so you 're less likely to make a costly mistake due to not understanding the complexities of what you 're investing in

the $ 20k limit seems to be from another answer the threshold for gofundme to report the campaign however such a report does not change the taxability of the income the income is either taxable or non taxable regardless of whether the amount is $ or $ this is a common misconception commonly seen when people think that income or gambling winnings are not taxable below $ 600 when in reality $ 600 is the threshold for issuing a form 1099 given that it would be foolish to close a wildly successful gofundme campaign because closing the campaign wo n't change the taxability of the income but it will probably cut off the continued donations you may have received with the amount of money at stake you should spend the couple hundred dollars to hire a cpa to look at your specific situation your uncle 's comments are not specific to your situation at best incorrect at worst so do n't hire him i do n't know what the median gofundme campaign raises but i strongly suspect it 's well below the $ donor reporting limit just because you have one campaign that 's gone viral enough to approach that limit does n't mean if you close that one and start a new one that it will go viral again especially if it 's under a new username

while there is no age limit bear in mind that saving money makes sense only if it does n't delay your paying off expensive debt if you have credit cards or expensive loans you would be best placed to focus on paying them down before saving a lot if you save and keep debt you 'll effectively lose money as the interest on your debt will usually be higher than you can earn on savings having said that it 's worth saving a small amount anyway to have as an emergency fund as you pay off your debt start saving the money you no longer have to pay out and it will soon pay dividends

according to your numbers you just stated that you spend approximately $ 1500 in discretionary expenditures per month yet are unable to save i fully realize that living in a big city is usually expensive but on your presumably after tax salary i think you can easily save a substantial portion of your income as others have already noted enforcing saving of a significant portion of your discretionary income is the most obvious step   it 's easy to say but i suspect that if you are like most people who have difficulty saving the psychological impact of quitting your previous spending habits cold turkey is likely to be very harsh all the more so if you have an active social life   you may find yourself becoming depressed or at having to save   you may lose motivation to work as hard because you might think that you 're putting away all this money for the distant future whereas you are young now and want to enjoy life while you can it is in this context then that i looked at your other financial obligations   paying $ to your parents is a lot   it 's over 20 of your after tax salary   you do not specify the reasons for doing this other than a vague sense of familial duty but my recommendation is to see if this could be reduced somewhat   if you can bring it down to $ 1000/month that $ 300 would go into your savings and you would psychologically feel a lot better about putting say $ 600 of your own discretionary income into savings as well   now you have all told about $ 1000/month of savings without severely your extra expenditures but i would start with that $ 1500/month of luxury spending first   and yes you do need to view it as luxury spending   the proper frame of mind is to compare your financial situation to someone who is truly unable to save because their entire income is spent on actual necessities   food and shelter their effective tax rate is 0 because they earn too little and they usually find themselves in debt because they can not make ends meet   now look back at that $ 1500/month   can you honestly say that you can not afford to cut that spending

economically it does n't make much difference but i like to control the account because i can adjust the amount i put aide each month based on the new tax rates that come out each spring this allow me finer control i also know that the bills have been paid i had one lender years ago that failed to pay the property tax bill i had to end the money in to the county and then months fighting the lender to get the money back now i avoid escrow accounts   the money being collected by the mortgage servicing company for property taxes and property insurance goes into a separate account the company insists on handling the funds to make sure that these bills are paid on time thus protecting their investment the failure to pay the taxes leaves the property subject to forfeiture via tax lien   the failure to pay property insurance leaves the house unprotected if there is a fire or other incident you can avoid the use of an escrow   account if you have enough equity in the account some lenders ask for you to provide proof of payment each year if you are going to pay it yourself   at the end of each year the servicing company will provide you with an accounting for interest on the loan and the amount of money spent on taxes and insurance also expect that they will make adjustments to the monthly withholding based on estimated increases for taxes and insurance   depending on your financial situation the interest taxes may be included on schedule a. if you have a rental property the interest taxes and insurance are considered expenses that you can write off the biggest issue with escrow accounts is that the company can have a buffer built in to protect them from unexpected increases many people view the calculation of the buffer a confusing and feel that they are overpaying   if you want to avoid the escrow account you should make sure that each month you put the money into a separate account so that when the property tax bill is due you can pay it on time when savings accounts earned significant interest it was possible to make a little money in the deal but that has n't been true for the last few years

this question is indeed rather complicated let 's simplify it a little bit paying down your mortgage makes sense if your expected return in the rest of your portfolio is less than the cost of the mortgage in many cases people may also decide to pay down their mortgage because they are risk averse and do not like carrying debt there 's no tax benefit to doing so though canada does n't generally allow you to write off mortgage interest unlike the u.s. as to keeping money in the corporation or not i 'm not going to address that i do n't have a firm enough understanding of corporate taxation canadian couch potato advises treating all of your investment assets as one large portfolio that is what you are trying to do here however let 's consider a different approach if you do not have enough money to max out your rrsp or tfsa you may choose to keep your tfsa for an emergency fund where the money is kept highly liquid keep your cash in an interest bearing tfsa or perhaps invest it in the money market inside your tfsa then use your rrsp for the rest of your investment money split according to your investment goals this is not the most tax efficient approach but it is nice and simple but you are looking for the most tax efficient approach so let 's assume you have enough to more than max out your tfsa and rrsp contributions and all of your investments are going toward your retirement which is at least a decade away because you are not taxed on your investment income from rrsps until you withdraw the money or tfsa it makes sense to hold the least tax efficient investments there tax advantaged investments such as canadian equities should be held in your investment accounts outside of tfsa and rrsps again the canadian couch potato has a great article on where to put your investment assets that article covers interest dividends foreign dividends and capital gains as well as rrsps resps and tfsas that article recommends holding canadian equities in a taxable account reits in a tax sheltered account tfsa or rrsp bonds gics and money market funds in a tax sheltered account as these count as interest the article goes into rather more detail than this and is worth checking out it mentions the 15 withholding tax on us listed etfs for example in addition to that website i recommend the following three books the above three resources strongly advocate passive indexed investments which i like but not everyone agrees with all three specifically discuss tax implications which is why i include them here

one explanation is that movie patrons are considering their total willingness to pay for the movie experience so that if the ticket price plus the market price of popcorn is less than their willingness to pay the theater has an opportunity to extract more consumer surplus by charging higher than market prices for the popcorn that is price discrimination there is a working paper on the subject by and 2008 the abstract of which reads prices for goods such as blades for razors ink for printers and concessions at movies are often     set well above cost   theory has shown that this could yield   a profitable price discrimination     strategy often termed metering   the idea is that a customer ’s intensity of demand for     aftermarket goods e.g. the concessions provides a meter of how much the customer is willing to     pay for the primary good e.g. admission   if this correlation in tastes for the two goods is     positive a high price on the aftermarket good allows firms to extract a greater total price     admissions plus concessions from higher type   customers   this paper develops a simple     aggregate model of discrete continuous demand to motivate how this correlation can be tested     using simple regression techniques and readily available firm data   model simulations illustrate     that the can be used to predict whether aftermarket prices should be above below or     equal to their marginal cost   we then apply the approach to box office and concession data from     a chain of spanish theaters and find that high priced concessions do extract more surplus from     customers with a greater willingness to pay for the admission ticket   and 1992 make a similar argument in a article   they essentially argue that purchases of things like movie tickets are made by groups once individuals are constrained by the group 's choice the firm has additional market power we present models in which price discrimination in the context of   a    two part price can occur in some competitive markets purchases   take    place in groups which choose which firms to patronize while   firms    are perfectly competitive with respect to   groups they have   some    market power over individual consumers who are constrained   by their    groups choices we find that firms will charge an entry fee   that is     below marginal cost   and   the   second part of   the   price is   marked    up   above marginal cost the   markup not only is positive   but    increases with the quality of the product the quote you are looking for is similar and again attributes the discrepancy to price discrimination   from the armchair economist p. the purpose of expensive popcorn is not to extract a lot of money from    customers that purpose would be better served by cheap popcorn and    expensive movie tickets instead the purpose of expensive popcorn is    to extract different sums from   different customers popcorn lovers    who have more fun at the movies pay more for their additional    pleasure that is some people like popcorn more than others   the latter idea is that the movie experience for popcorn lovers is worth more than the sum of its parts that a movie ticket + popcorn is worth more than either of them separately for some people

if you only have to pay 23k federal taxes on 100k that means you are in the long term capital gains tax rate which is the lower of the tax rates available first you get your federal income tax marginal tax rate and then find the matching long term capital gains tax rate for example if your marginal federal income tax rate is 28 your capital gains tax rate would be 15 or rather if the amount of the gain would put you in the 28 rate then your long term capital gains tax rate is 15 you can reduce that by having more losses if you have anything else invested anywhere that is taking a loss then you can sell that this year and it will offset the other gains you have realized the only note is that your losses have to be long term capital losses too tax loss harvesting takes this to an extreme where you sell something at a loss to lock in the tax loss but you did n't really want to get rid of that investment so then you buy a nearly identical investment ie if you owned shares of tech sector etf and it was at a loss you would sell that and then immediately buy tech sector etf the competing product that does the exact same thing then there is charity this still requires spending money and you not having it any longer if you feel that a cause can use the money more directly than the us government you can donate an appreciated asset to the charity not report a gain and also take a charitable deduction

being the geek that i am i actually developed a financial model of a few different career salary scenarios when i graduated in 2000 while it may not matter from a financial pov it 's a nice thing to reference later on to help you stick with your financial goals my recommendation would be to not factor in inflation upfront build a model based on the current value of money you course correct things in the future when inflation starts kicking in also your retirement income requirements will vary dramatically depending on other decisions that you make ie kids mortgage college etc if achieving the lifestyle that you desire 10 20 or 30 years down the road looks difficult because your salary is n't keeping up with your earnings savings goals you need to either re evaluate your priorities or look for better compensation

for starters the risk free rate has nothing to do with stocks   it would be independent of anything   it pays out the same return in all states of nature   the definition of a risk free asset is that regardless of how the universe turns out including a striking the earth killing everyone but the recipient then the payout would happen exactly as planned   one could imagine a computer still being on connected to a power supply and printing a check   most people use the 90-day t bill as the risk free rate   a beta greater than one implies it is more volatile than the market not that it moves more perfectly the capm should not be used for this   cryptocurrencies should not be used with this model because they have valuation dynamics related to the new issue of coins   in other words they have non market price movements as well as market price movements in general you should not use the capm because it does n't work empirically   it is famous but it is also wrong   a scientific hypothesis that is not supported by the data is a bad idea   my strong recommendation is that you read the intelligent investor by benjamin graham   it was last published in 1972 and it is still being printed   i believe warren buffett wrote the current forward for it   always go where the data supports you and never anywhere else no matter how elegant finally unless you are doing this like a trip to vegas for fun and willing to take the losses i would avoid cryptocurrencies because you do n't know what you are doing yet   it is obvious from the posting   i have multiple decades working in every type of financial institution and at every level bottom to top   i also have a and i am an incredible researcher   i am professionally qualified in three different disciplines if you want to learn how to do this start with the intelligent investor   get a basic book on accounting and learn basic accounting   pick up economics textbooks at least through intermediate for both microeconomics and macroeconomics   get william 's book introduction to bayesian statistics   you will need them for reasons that go very far beyond this post   trust me you want to master that book   find a statistician and ask them to teach it to you as a special topics course   it will help you as both either a marine officer or a naval officer   then after that pick up a copy of security analysis   either the 1943 copy yes it is in print by benjamin graham if you feel good about accounting or the 1987 copy by under the graham dodd   then if you are still interested in cryptocurrencies and they will be by then then pick up an economics textbook on money   if i were you i would learn about money commodity money and prison money first then you might understand why a cryptocurrency may not be an investment for you

yes you must file north carolina and south carolina income tax if you live in one state and work in another the income is potentially taxed twice most states give a credit for taxes paid to the other state often you pay the tax in the state where you worked and then if the tax rate in the state where you live is higher you pay the difference but the details depend on the tax laws of the two states involved i 'm not an expert on either carolina 's tax laws start by getting the forms and instructions from both states and see what they say or if you 're using tax software see if it handles this case if someone else on here knows the specifics of the tax laws for the i gladly yield many states establish reciprocity agreements with other states usually the neighboring states that generally say that if the state you live in and the state you work in are both party to the agreement then you only pay tax in the state you live in this simplifies things a lot unfortunately neither north carolina nor south carolina have such agreements with each other or with any other state

for insight on what will happen i suggest looking at the situation from the lender 's perspective if your setbacks are temporary and you are likely to get back on your feet again they will protect their investment by making accommodations and probably charging you extra fees along the way if your financial hardship seems they probably try to squeeze you for as much as possible and then eventually take your house protecting their investment as best they can if they are going to foreclose they may be reluctant to do it quickly as foreclosure is expensive takes man power and looks bad on their books   so it may get pushed off for a quarter or a fiscal year but if you are asking if they 'll help you out from the goodness of their heart well a bank has no heart and creditors are interested in roi   they 'll take the easiest path to profit or failing that the path to minimum financial losses    the personal consequences to you are not their concern once you realize this it may change your thinking about your own situation    if you think you have a path to financial recovery then you need to make that clear to them in writing with details   make a business case that working with you is in their own best interests if you can not make such a case recognize that they 'll likely squeeze you for as much as possible in penalties fees interest payments etc before eventually foreclosing on you anyway   do n't play that game if your home is a lost cause financially plan how to get out from it with the smallest losses possible   do n't pay more than you need to and do n't throw good money after bad

first let me answer the question the best way i can i do n't know if there are any studies other than those that have already been mentioned now let 's talk about something more interesting you do n't need to base your behavior on any study even if it is scientific let 's pretend for example that we could find a scientifically valid study that shows that people spend 25 more when using a credit card than they do when spending cash   this does not mean that if you use a credit card you will spend 25 more   all it means is that the average person spending with a credit card spends more than the average person paying cash   but there are outliers   there are plenty of people who are being frugal while using a credit card and there are others who spend too much cash   everyone 's situation is different   the idea that you will automatically spend less by using cash would not be proven by such a study when hearing any type of advice like this you need to look at your own situation and see if it applies to your own life   and that is what people are doing with the anecdotal comments   some say yep i spend too much if i use a card others say actually i find that when i have cash in my wallet i spend it on junk   and both are correct   it does n't matter what the study says the average person does because you are not average now let 's say that you are a financial counselor who helps people work through disastrous financial messes   your client has $ 20,000 in credit card debt and is having trouble paying all his bills   he does n't have a budget and never uses cash   probably the best advice for this guy is to stop using his card and start paying cash   it does n't take a scientific study to see that this guy needs to change his behavior for what it is worth i keep a strict budget keeping track of my spending on the computer   the vast majority of my spending is electronic   i find tracking my cash spending difficult and sometimes i find that when i have cash in my wallet it seems to disappear without a trace

all else being equal you should look for more volatile riskier stocks technically it was all time value the entire value of an out of the money option is time value    what 's confusing is that time value is affected by numerous variables only one of which is time the reason volatility is the one to look at is that all the rest are likely already intuitive to you or are too minor an influence to worry about current risk free interest rates and a stock 's dividend payout during the life of the option affect the value of the call but are usually minor    higher interest rates makes call values higher and higher dividend yield makes call values lower longer time to expiration will increase the value of the call but you 're pretty likely already focused on that the strike price 's proximity to the current price affects the call 's value agreeing to sell a stock 5 above current levels will pay more than agreeing to sell it 10 above current levels but again this is likely obvious to you volatility or the percent by which the stock is likely to move up or down on a given day is almost certainly the variable that 's not already obvious stocks that jump all over the place have higher volatility than those that move more predictably      the reason that options calls and puts cost more on higher volatility names is that options payout is   in the case of calls the option holder gets all the upside but none of the downside other than what they paid for the      if one stock goes up or down $ 5 every day and another goes up or down $ 20 every day and you could pay some fixed amount to get that stock 's upside but not have any exposure to its downside other than that fixed amount you 'd pay more for the one that pays you $ 20 or $ 0 than you would for the one that pays you $ 5 or $ 0     that 's why higher volatility meaning larger daily moves makes optimum prices higher

october 18 2017 by john goldman sachs making too little money is not the worst of the world ’s problems but inside the investment bank ’s new york headquarters it feels like an insult   goldman is not suffering a financial crisis as it did in 2008 when it officially converted to being a bank holding company amid panic that the whole of wall street could collapse it faces something deeper an identity crisis   it used to be the role model for many rival banks even while for its single minded focus on investment banking and trading but as tuesday ’s disclosure of a 26 per cent fall in its bond trading revenues confirmed banking has changed instead of lenders such as jpmorgan chase wanting to become as glamorous as goldman it needs to be more like them   this is a telling moment albeit less dramatic than 2008 investment banking enjoyed a lucrative two decades spurred by globalisation and financial goldman ’s revenues rose from its initial public offering in 1999 to 2007 and boomed in 2009 it could do no wrong financially although it turned out to have done wrong to some of its customers   but guess what regulation works governments and central bank supervisors set out to make complex trading in bonds and derivatives the securities business in which goldman specialised more expensive and less profitable the rules now favour deposit taking and lending instead of   no one really planned the second aspect of the bank ’s difficulty the huge dose of monetary easing since the crisis has volatility and made markets more predictable hedge funds themselves under pressure no longer need to reward goldman and others for taking on financial risk   goldman ’s bond and commodities trading division from which emerged a of leaders including lloyd blankfein its chairman and chief executive tells its own story it used to occupy two floors of the new york office but has shrunk to one as wall street ’s total bond trading revenues have halved since 2009 more prices are calculated by computers than humans   when you rely heavily on one engine and that engine you are in trouble the bank ’s financial advisory and capital raising division is performing well and it has an investment management arm but it lacks a consumer powerhouse like morgan stanley ’s wealth management operation or the lending and credit card activities that drive banks such as jpmorgan   the truth for goldman is that us retail banking has become not only more reliable than investment banking but more profitable jpmorgan ’s balance sheet is three times the size of goldman ’s and its retail banking arm made a 19 per cent return on equity in the third quarter compared with goldman ’s 11 per cent   the best historical comparison for goldman ’s predicament is ironically the jpmorgan of the 1990s jpmorgan was a blue chip corporate bank but found that this business was no longer profitable enough as lending margins fell it launched an effort to return to investment banking having been separated from morgan stanley in by the glass steagall act   jpmorgan had a good stab at it compensating for the fact that goldman and others dominated wall street ’s bulge bracket by credit derivatives which later turned out badly but it could not make enough progress alone and settled for being bought by chase manhattan in 2000   both banks have struggled to keep pace with the rapid growth of the leading investment banks which are in businesses that have been far more lucrative than the lending business at the core of commercial banking the new york times noted in its account of the merger years and one financial crisis later jpmorgan has reversed this order of profitability   so goldman is now trying to do the opposite of the old jpmorgan by adding banking to investment banking jpmorgan ’s former dilemma has not gone away lending to blue chip companies is not much of a a more tempting target is the high margins that banks make on credit cards   hence marcus goldman ’s online lender named after its founder marcus goldman which offers loans to prime us consumers as an alternative to credit card debt marcus which will launch next year in the uk accounts for $ of the $ in new lending and financing planned by goldman in the next three years as it diversifies   but it is no simpler for goldman to break into main street than it was for the old jpmorgan to break back into wall street $ on a balance sheet of $ is an interesting financial experiment not a revolution it would need to inflict on consumer banking with technology what amazon did to the retail industry to rival fully jpmorgan and bank of america   we ’re a bank and we ’re committed to being a bank says one partner firmly but selling personal loans and mortgages which could be marcus ’s next target is not a job designed for masters of the universe this is goldman ’s identity crisis regulation and economics are rendering it ordinary

after learning about things that happened in the flash crash i always use limit orders in an extremely rare instance if you place a market order when there is a some glitch for example some large trader adds a zero at the end of their volume you could get an awful price   if i want to buy at the market price i just set the limit about 1 above the market price if i want to sell i set the limit 1 below the market price i should point out that your trade is not executed at the limit price if your limit price on a buy order is higher than the lowest offer you still get filled at the lowest offer if before your order is submitted someone fills all offers up to your limit price you will get your limit price if someone perhaps by accident fills all orders up to twice your limit price you wo n't end up making the purchase i have executed many purchases this way and never been filled at my limit price

no he wo nt he is a very good business man and has been since   he split from top rank circa 2006   like most fighters before 2006 he fought under a promo company top rank   he would get his guaranteed purse for fights and that was that instead of taking an $ 8 m payday he decided to cut out the middle man bob and bought out his contract for k and decided to promote the fights himself mayweather promotions   instead of just getting his purse he now got a cut of every revenue stream involved in a fight ppv tickets broadcasting rights etc     after this he co promoted fights with golden boy since they had a license   he would still retain control and get his cut but then he got his promoters license and stopped co promoting entirely leaving himself with an even bigger cut    he has a stable of fighters who fight regularly and he gets revenue from that he has a strip club a clothing line music stuff marketing brand firm and of course a crap ton of real estate   i heard he will be opening up a marijuana soon   he will have more than enough money to last a life time even at the rate he spends it    edit now is a guy who will be broke very soon or already is he fought a no named with like 17 fights under his belt this past june in australia and he lost to little fan fare

on june 30 2015 the value of a key should be exactly the expected revenue from selling the chest contents owing to the fact that the next day the keys become worthless   looking at the steam community market it seems like the value of a key is higher than this but lower than 2.50   if that 's true then since the price of a key is higher than the expected revenue from selling the chest contents as you say then you can see that at some point the value of a key will have to go down   and as you get closer to the cutoff date the price will fall faster   it 's not quite the same but this pattern is usually what you see in the ticket resale market on say   if there 's something about keys that keeps their worth above the expected value of selling chest contents some value to the flexibility that keys offer over other tradable items maybe then in the short run that wo n't change due to this distant deadline just because it 's so far off   people will still want the flexibility keys offer   orthodox economics might suggest sell sooner rather than later but certainly do n't wait too long   different people react differently though   if there are a lot of people who sell their keys after hearing this news it might be a good time to buy   of course it 's a gamble but if you trust in whatever force keeps keys priced above the expected value of the loot they can buy then that force should win out in the medium term and you could turn a profit

no it is n't generally believed that inflation is caused by individual banks printing money   governments manage money supply through central banks which may or may not be independent of the state there are a number of theories about money supply and inflation from monetarist to keynesian and so on the quantity theory of inflation says that long term inflation is the result of money supply but short term inflation is related to events local conditions short term inflation is a symptom of economic change   it 's like a cough for a doctor   it simply indicates an underlying event when prices go up it encourages new producers to enter the market create new supply which will then act to lower prices   in this way inflation is managed by ensuring that information travels throughout the economy   if prices go up for specific goods then all things being equal supply should go up since the increase implies increasing demand   if prices go down then this implies demand has gone down and so producers will reduce supply obviously this is n't a perfect relationship   there is which can be caused by a whole bunch of market conditions from banning of short selling to of demand supply your question is n't about quantitative easing which is a state led way of increasing money supply and which could increase inflation but is hoped to increase expenditure and investment so i wo n't cover that here the important take away is that inflation is an essential price signal to investors and business people so that they can assess market cycles   without it we would end up with vast or under supply and much greater economic disruption

how to start is pretty simple    with your next pay check set aside an amount and open a separate savings account   since this is an emergency fund you want it someplace where you can get to the money quickly so a cd or mutual fund is not good but you want it in a separate account so that you do n't accidentally use it     once the account is opened i 'd recommend setting up an automatic transfer or make it part of the direct deposit if you do that so that you put in some money regularly every pay check   by adding to it regularly and not using it you 'll more quickly achieve your goal    i 'd recommend stopping or slowing any retirement savings or other investing until you get the emergency fund in place   if you have an emergency the money in the retirement fund is n't going to do you much good as it costs too much to do an early withdrawal   the whole point of the emergency fund is to have liquidity when you need it so that you do n't incur the costs of your longer term investments also do n't worry overly much about making money on this money   this is n't an investment it is there for emergencies

there is no need to get an auto loan just to try and affect your credit score it is possible to have a score over 800 without any sort of auto loan if you can afford to pay for the vehicle up front that is the better option even with special financing incentives it is better to pay up front if you can yes it is possible to use the funds to make more if you finance with a silly low interest rate however it 's also possible to lose a job or have some other financial disaster happen and need that money for something else making it more difficult to make the payment   it may be just me but i find the peace of mind not having the payment to be worth a lot

as the owner of the s corp it is far easier for you to move money in out of the company as contributions and distributions rather than making loans to the company loans require interest payments 1099-int forms and have tax consequences whereas the distributions do n't need to be reported because you pay taxes on net profits regardless of whether the money was distributed if you were paid interest disregard this answer i do n't know if or how you could re categorize the loan once there 's a 1099-int involved if no interest was ever paid you just need to account for it properly if the company did n't pay you any interest and never issued you a 1099-int form i.e. you wrote a check to the company no promissory note no tax forms no payments no interest etc then you can categorize that money as a capital contribution you can likewise take that money back out of the company as a capital distribution and neither of these events are taxable nor do they need to be reported to the irs in quickbooks create the following equity accounts one for each shareholder making capital contributions and distributions when putting money into the company deposit into your corporate bank account and use the capital contribution equity account when taking money out of the company write yourself a check and use the distributions account at the end of every tax year you can close out your contributions and distributions to retained earnings by making a general journal entry for example debit retained earnings and credit distributions on dec 31 every year to zero out the distributions account for contributions do the reverse and credit retained earnings there are other ways of recording these transactions for example i think some people just use a member capital equity account instead of separate accounts for contributions and distributions and qb might warn you about posting journal entries to the special retained earnings account at the end of the year in any case this is how my cpa set up my books and it 's been working well enough for many years still never a bad idea to get a second opinion from your cpa be sure to pay yourself a reasonable salary you ca n't get out of payroll taxes and just distribute profits that 's a big red flag that can trigger an audit if you 're simply distributing back the money you already put into the company that should be fine

one of the best answers to this question that i 've ever read is in a paper published by robert lucas in the journal of economic perspectives that journal is meant to a be a place for experts to write about their area of expertise in economics for a general but still technically minded audience they recently opened up the journal as free to the public which is a fantastic resource you no longer need a subscription to or whatever to read it   you can read the abstract to the paper and find a link to it here one of the things that i like a lot about this paper is that it strips out absolutely everything even slightly unnecessary to thinking about a and just discusses what one can arrive at with a very very simple model of course with great simplicity come sacrifice about details however it does a great job of answering your question why do people care about growth a quick note the key to understanding the answer to your question is to think about things in terms of the long term   not even looking forward to the future because we 'll be dead by then but looking back to the past the key to the importance of growth is that for the last years the us has on average had maybe 2 3 real growth per year i 'm pulling these numbers out of my head i think much better numbers are in that paper somewhere on average over that period of time this growth has meant that the quality of life that one has if one lives in a country experiencing this growth is enormous compared to countries that do not experience this average growth over that period   statistically speaking growth is also somewhat auto correlated roughly speaking if it was low the last few periods you can expect it to be low the next period same thing if it 's high    then the reason we care about growth right now if you have too many periods of low growth pretty soon the average over the long term growth will be pulled down and then quality of life ca n't be higher in the future which quickly becomes someone 's present the paper above makes this point with a very simple model of course none of this touches on issues which are another issue entirely with respect to the economy needs to grow to just keep up with its debt repayments i think the answer is along the lines of sometimes countries get into debt expecting that growth will increase their resources in the future and thus they can pay back their debt that strategy is of course the strategy that anyone borrowing taking out a loan should be employing you should expect that your future income will be enough to pay back your on a loan you took otherwise you 're irresponsible at the aggregate level production is the nation 's income it is what you have all that you have as a nation to pay back any debt you 've incurred at the national level

it sounds like there are no provisions in the loan document for how to proceed in this case    i would view this as creating a brand new loan the amount owed is going to be principal remaining + interest from 2 years + penalties   if you created a new loan for 13 years that would not be how i would expect a lender to behave i would expect most repayment plans to be something like make double payments until you are caught up or pay an extra $ 1000 per month until caught up and then resume normal payments

each candlestick in a candlestick chart represents the open close high and low for a period of time if you are looking at a daily chart it represents the open price close price high price and low price for that day if you are looking at an hourly chart then a single candlestick represents the open close high and low prices for an hour if looking at a weekly chart then a single candlestick will represent the opening price on monday morning the closing price on friday afternoon and the highest and lowest price for that week the diagram below represents the two main types of candle sticks   when the price closes higher than they open for the period of the candlestick it is called a bullish candle and the main body is usually represented in green when the price closes lower than they open for the period of the candlestick it is called a bearish candle and the main body is usually represented in red in a bullish candle with a large real body and small shadows or where prices open near the low of the period and close near the top of the period it represents a very bullish period especially if volume is high an example of this situation could be when good news is released to the market and most market participants want to buy the shares driving prices higher during the period an example of a bullish candle with a small real body and a large upper shadow or wick could be when market participants start buying early during the period then some negative news comes out or prices reach a major resistance level then prices drop from their highs but still close higher than the open the large upper shadow represents some indecision in prices moving higher in a bearish candle with a large real body and small shadows or where prices open near the high of the period and close near the low of the period it represents a very bearish period especially if volume is high an example of this situation could be when bad news is released to the market and most market participants want to sell the shares driving prices lower during the period an example of a bearish candle with a small real body and a large lower shadow or wick could be when market participants start selling early during the period then some positive news comes out or prices reach a major support level then prices move up from their lows but still close lower than the open the large lower shadow represents some indecision in prices moving lower these are just some examples of what can be derived from looking at candlestick charts there are plenty more and too much to include in this answer   another type of candle is the doji represented in the diagram below   the doji candle represents indecision in the market prices open then move up to the high of the period then start falling past the open before reversing again and closing either at the open or very close to the open the market participants ca n't decide whether the price should move up or down so prices end up closing very close to where they opened a doji candle close to a market high or low could represent a turning point in the short term trend and could mean that over the next period or two prices could reverse and go in the opposite direction there are many more definitions for candlestick charts and i would recommend an introductory book on candlestick charting like one from the dummies series the main things to keep in mind as a beginner it that a strong bullish candle with small shadows and large real body could represent further price movement upwards a strong bearish candle with small shadows and large real body could represent further movement downwards and any candle with large shadows could represent indecision and a reversal from the direction of the large shadow

while jb king says some useful things i think there is another fundamental reason why stock markets go down after disasters either natural or man made   there is a real impact on the markets in the case of something like 9/11 due to closed airport higher security costs closer inspections on trade goods tighter restrictions on visas real payments for the rebuilding of destroyed buildings and insurance payouts for killed people and eventually the cost of a war but almost as important is the uncertainty and risk nobody knew what was going to happen in the days and weeks after an attack like that is there going to be another one a week later or every week for the next year will air travel become essentially impractical will international trade be severely restricted all those would have a huge massive effect on the economy you may argue that those things are very unlikely even after something like 9/11 but even a small increase in the likelihood of a catastrophic economic crash is enough to start people selling there is another thing that drives the market down even if most people are sure that there wo n't be a catastrophic economic crash they know that other people think there might be and so will sell that will drive the market down if they know the market is going down then sensible traders will start to sell even if they think there is zero risk of a crash this makes the effect worse eventually prices will drop so far that the people who do n't think there is a crash will start to buy so they can make a profit on the recovery but that usually does n't happen until there has been a substantial drop

either way letting these institutions fail would have undoubtedly produced a worse result best case scenario complete credit freeze i.e no credit cards   worst case scenario even the most financially sound banks fail as part of a financial domino effect and we 're back to trading deer skin for   the best way to prevent these kinds of situations is to never get in them in the first place   placing graduated capital constraints on larger and larger financial institutions i.e.   the larger your balance sheet the greater the percentage of capital you must retain to offset risk is the best way to protect against financial collapse   this way competitive market forces would remain intact while reducing risk   basel 3 addresses some of these issues but i speculate more will need to be done to prevent another collapse from happening in   the future

i believe it is so   it does n't sound like they did anything outright illegal just a pushy upsell   you can complain to the bank manager   if you want you can mention the employee by name if you know who they are   ultimately you can change banks   from what you say it sounds like you are with this bank so i think you should at least begin evaluating other banks and consider switching   you can also let your current bank know you are planning to take all your money away from them specifically because of their poor customer service you could consider filing a complaint with the consumer financial protection bureau alleging that the bank engaged in some kind of deceptive marketing of their financial products   of course you can also file a complaint with something like the better business bureau or even just write a negative yelp review   but these actions wo n't really result in any penalty for the bank as a result of what they did in your specific case they just express your in a way that will be recorded and possibly made public e.g. in a list of complaints to protect future consumers if you 're really gung ho and have time and money to burn you could hire a lawyer and get legal advice about whether it is possible to sue the bank for fraud or misuse of your personal information   needless to say i think this would be overkill for this situation   i would just cancel the credit card tell the bank you 're switch banks and move on

i encourage you to think of this home purchase decision as a chance to buy into a community that you want your children to grow up in   try to find a place where you will be happy for the next 20 years not just the next 2 or 7 years in your situation option 1 seems like a bad idea   it will create an obstacle to having children instead of establishing a place for them to grow up in option 2 is close to buying a house on a layaway plan   it offers the most financial flexibility   it also could result in the best long term outcome because you will buy in an established area and you will know exactly what quality house you will have   but you and your fiancé need to ask yourselves some hard questions   are you willing to put up with the mess and hassles of   are you good at designing such projects   can you afford to pay for the projects as they occur   or if you need to finance them can you get a heloc to cover them especially if you and your fiancé do much of the work yourselves break down the projects into small enough pieces that you can quickly finish off whatever you are working on at the time and be happy living in the resulting space   you do not want to be your husband about an unfinished project forever or silently that a project never got wrapped up   i posted some suggestions for incrementally finishing a basement on the home improvement stack exchange if you are up to the job of option 2 it is less risky than option 3   option 3 has several risks you do n't know what sort of people will live in the neighborhood 5 20 years from now   will the homes be owner occupied   or rentals   will your neighbors care about raising children well   or will lots of kids grow up in broken homes    will the schools be good   disappointing   or dangerous   whereas in an established neighborhood you can see what the neighborhood is currently like and how it has been changing unless you custom build or remodel you do n't control the quality of the construction   some neighborhoods built by in the last 10 years were riddled with construction defects you will be paying up front for features you do n't need yet   you might never need some of them   and some of them might interfere with what you realize later on might be better in stable markets new homes especially ones with lots of upgrades often decline in value during the first few years   this is because part of the value is in the and being up to date with the latest fads   this part of the value wears off over time are the homes at the edge of town already within reasonable walking distance of parks schools church grocery stores et cetera   might the commute from the edge of town to work get worse over the next 5 20 years

do you have a separate bank account for your business   that is generally highly recommended i have a credit card for my single member llc   i prefer it this way because it makes the separation of personal and business expenses very clear using a personal credit card but using it for only business expenses seems to be a reasonable practice   you may be able to do one better though for your sole proprietorship you can file a dba which establishes the business name   the details of this depend on your state   with a dba i believe you can open a bank account in the name of your business and you may also be able to open a credit card account in the name of the business   i 'm not sure what practical difference it makes but it does make the personal business distinction clearer   though at that point you might as well just do the llc

you would need to check with bank as it varies from bank to bank   you can break the fd 's generally you do n't loose the interest you have earned for 1 years however the rate of interest will be reduced i.e. if the rate was 7 for 1 year fd and 8 for 2 years fd when you break after a year you will get only 7 generally this can happen in few hours but definitely in 2 days you can get a loan against fd 's generally the rate of interest is 2 higher than fd rate there is also initial processing fee etc check with the bank it may take few days to set things up

i could n't find historical data either so i contacted vanguard canada and barclays vanguard replied that   this index was developed for vanguard and thus historical information is available as of the inception of the fund unfortunately that means that the only existing data on historical returns are in the link in your question vanguard also sent me a link to the methodology barclay 's uses when constructing this index which you might find interesting as well   i have n't heard from barclays but i presume the story is the same even if they 've been collecting data on canadian bonds since before the inception of this index they probably did n't aggregate it into an index before their contract with vanguard and if they did it might be proprietary and not available free of charge

you should always invest if your investment rate of return is higher    than your interest rate your next line about standard deviation is dead on   there are too many variables to give an exact answer here in my opinion the main reason is that one variable is n't easy to quantify one 's risk tolerance   clearly there 's one extreme the 18 credit card unless you are funding type rates of it 's safe to say that 18 debt should take priority over any investments except for the matched 401(k deposits   what i think you 're talking about is something we 've addressed here in multiple threads   do i prepay my sub 4 mortgage or invest in this case and to noah 's comment the question is whether you can expect a post tax return of over 3 during your time horizon i look at the return for 15 years from 1998 2013 and see a 6 cagr for the s&p. i chose 15 years as the choice is often one of paying a 30 year mortgage faster as fast as 15 the last 15 years offer a pretty bad scenario 2 crashes and a mortgage crisis 6 after long term gains would get you 5.1 net   you can pull the data back to 1871 and run cagr numbers for the timeframe of your choosing i have n't done it yet but i imagine there 's no 15 year span that lags the 3 target i cite   what makes it more complex is that the investment is n't lump sum it may not be obvious but cagr is a dollar invested at t=0 and returns calculated to t = final year it would take a bit of to invest the extra funds every month year over your period of analysis   in the end there are still those who will choose to pay off their 4 mortgage regardless of what the numbers show even if the 15 year result showed worst case 3.5 almost no profit and an average 10 the feeling of risk is more than many will want

do you have other things you might want to spend that cash on in the near future like a down payment on a house beyond having emergency cash the only reason to keep a pile of cash around is because you might need it for another purchase unless you are going to have other expenses that will require higher interest loans to cover them there 's no need to sit on a big pile of cash as long as you are getting the full match on your 401(k that 's the free money that might be worth more than the interest you are paying on the loans in any case i suggest you aim for at least 10 into your 401(k account moving forward in your life so that you can properly fund retirement 15 would be even better it does n't sound like you would be losing anything by paying the student loans and you could then use the money freed from your loan payments to pay down your car faster

if you have 100 of your money in one security that is inherently more risky than splitting your money 50/50 between two securities regardless of the purported riskiness of the two securities the calculations people use to justify their particular breed of diversification may carry some assumptions related risk reward calculations   but these particular do n't change the fact that spreading your money across different assets protects your money from value variances of the individual assets   splitting your $ 100 between apple and microsoft stock is probably less valuable less well diversified than splitting your money between apple and whole foods stock but either way you 're carrying less risk than putting all $ 100 in to apple stock regardless of the assumed rates of return for any of these companies stock specifically edit i 'm sure the downvotes are because i did n't make a big deal about correlation and measuring correlation and standard deviations of returns and detailed portfolio theory   measuring efficacy and justifying your particular allocations that generally uses data from the past to project the future is all well and good   fact of the matter is if you have 100 of your money in stock that 's more stock risk than 25 in cash 25 in bonds and 50 in stock would be because now you 're in different asset classes   you can measure to your hearts delight the effects of splitting your money between different specific companies or different industries or different market or different countries or different fund managers or different whatever metrics and doing any of those things will reduce your exposure to those specific allocations    it may be worth pointing out that currently the hot recommendation is a plain vanilla market tracking s&p 500 index fund that just buys some of each of the 500 largest us companies without any consideration given to risk correlation over standard deviation calculating actively managed funds   if you ask me that speaks volumes of the true efficacy of hyper analyzing the purported correlations of various securities

by basic public pension i assume you mean social security which is pretty much the only quasi universal pension like thing in the usa   if she has any other sort of pension e.g. from a job you 'd need to get more specific info about that as for social security as described here while you are working your earnings will reduce your benefit amount only until you reach your full retirement age according to the calculator on that site if she is 65 now her full retirement age would be 66 so if she retires after that age her ss benefit wo n't be reduced due to extra income as described here if she has considerable income apart from ss she may have to pay taxes on her ss income   this would not reduce her income but means the benefit of her extra blog income would be reduced   this page describes how to calculate your provisional income to determine whether ss benefits will be taxed   according to that page if your provisional income is less than $ 25,000 for single or head of household returns or $ for joint returns then your social security benefits will not be taxed based on the numbers you gave this suggests she would not incur an ss tax   however she should probably take a look at the social security retirement estimator and other tools on that site if she has n't already done so to get a sense of what sort of income ss will be providing her i 'd suggest that she talk to a retirement planner and/or cpa to get a handle on what her finances would be like   at the least she should find someone knowledgeable about social security policies and tax issues in the usa   as you say you are unfamiliar with the way these matters work in the usa so your ability to help her make financial decisions is limited

when you withdraw money from an rrsp account it is added to your current year 's taxable income it does not matter what year the money was previously deposited in if you deposited money into an rrsp this year and withdrew the same amount of money then the net effect is that you have $ 5000 rrsp contribution and $ 5000 extra income and the two effects should cancel out the only remaining effect is that you wasted $ 5000 of contribution room which can never be regained the exception to this rule is that after 90 days you can withdraw funds from an rrsp for the hbp and llp without adding to your taxable income

glad my question got bumped i took it as a sign to get a solid answer out of schwab first the rep gave me the same line that it was impossible to provide paperless statements for a 401(k plan because of regulations i pressed the issue and got this from the rep i just spoke with our dedicated small business plan team they told me    that there are regulations that state that a qualified plan such as    this require to have a statement sent it is a schwab policy that we    have decided to only allow paper statements for this account type so to clarify it is a schwab business decision to have the statements    available only by mail hope someone from schwab with some authority sees this post and is pushed toward helping change their policy i ca n't imagine what a colossal waste of paper postage and hassle it is for everyone involved

i think it comes down to whether you are happy with the investment choices in the 401k   if you are there is no reason not to invest there   additionally it does n't have to be an either or choice   you can invest up to the maximum in both accounts btw congratulations on thinking about retirement at your age   i wish i had been in a position to do that

the new mortgage qualification rules were introduced to cool a hot canadian housing real estate market the rules are a pre measure intended to avoid a bubble and later crash in real estate the government wants to make sure anybody buying a house can handle higher interest rates those rates currently at record lows are expected to go up later this year and into the future the tighter mortgage rules include borrowers will need to qualify against a minimum standard 5-year fixed rate mortgage even if they 'll contract their mortgage at a lower or variable rate   previously the 3-year fixed rate mortgage was used as the minimum qualification standard the amount a homeowner can borrow in a refinanced mortgage drops to 90 of the home value down from 95 of the home value   a home is not meant to be an atm machine anybody wanting to borrow to buy an investment property i.e. a property that wo n't be their principal residence will need a 20 downpayment instead of a 5 downpayment the new rules go into effect april 19th 2010   however according to the see below exceptions would be allowed after    april 19 where they are needed to    satisfy a binding purchase and sale    financing or refinancing agreement    entered into before april 19 2010 definitive information about the new rules can be found at the department of finance of canada   specifically refer to some additional news media sources

that 's just his base salary for last year   keep reading in the article he also received $ 1.6 million worth of plus he 's probably earned plenty in salary bonuses and other compensation in previous years to more than keep up his lifestyle   he can also sell relatively small amounts of the stock he already owns to get millions in cash without raising an how are people able to spend more than what they make without going into debt well people ca n't spend more than they have without going into debt certainly money can be saved won inherited whatever without being earned   other than that debt is the only option that said many wealthy people will spend way more than they have by going into debt   this can be done through huge mortgages personal loans using stock real estate or other assets as collateral etc   i do n't know about bezos specifically but it 's not uncommon for wealthy people to live beyond their means they just have more assets behind them to secure personal loans or bankers are more willing to lend them unsecured money because of the large interest rates they can charge   their assumption is presumably that the interest they 'll pay on these loans is less than the earnings they 'll get from the asset e.g. stock real estate   while it may be true in some cases it can also go bad and cause you to lose everything

the issue with college is the current business model which is to get as many asses in seats as possible colleges were initially designed to teach a select few and not intended for mass attendance    the day colleges went from being institutions geared towards attracting like minded people interested in intellectual pursuits into education factories crumbling under the weight of administrative bloat is when the classical concept of a college education died we do n't educate people anymore we process them to fit a particular mold in the labor pool   that being said if you are someone who is genuinely interested in educating yourself college is still the way to go just be aware of what you 're getting yourself into and understand that a degree is not a ticket to employment

you should start by making a written complaint to the insurance company itself you have two angles of attack what was discussed when she was sold the policy make sure you set out exactly what you believe you were told and highlight that they did n't ask about commuting assuming that 's the case ask them to preserve any recordings they have of the call and to send you a copy the nature of the journey where the accident happened from the description unless it was part of a journey to and from work there 's no good reason for them to classify it as commuting make sure you make good written notes now of anything that happened verbally phone calls etc and keep doing this as the process goes along if that written complaint does n't work your next step is to go to the financial ombudsman who are a neutral service if the ombudsman does n't support your case you could go to court directly but it 'll be expensive and a lot of effort and by this stage it 'd be unlikely you would win the ombudsman 's rejection would n't count against you directly but it 'd be a strong indication that your case is weak see for a more detailed walk through

ca n't i achieve the exact same effect and outcome by exchanging currency now and put that amount of usd in a bank account to gain some interest then make the payment from one year from now sure assuming that the company has the money now   more commonly they do n't have that cash now but will earn it over the time period presumably in euros and will make the large payment at some point in time   using a forward protects them from fluctuations in the exchange rate between now and then otherwise they 'd have to away usd over the year which still exposes them to exchange rate fluctuations

as a new graduate aside from the fact that you seem to have the extra $ to pay more towards your loan we do n't know anything else   i wrote a lengthy article on this in response to a friend who had a loan but was also pondering a home purchase in the future student loans and your first mortgage discusses the math behind one 's ability to put a downpayment on a house vs having that monthly cash to pay towards the mortgage in your case the question is whether in 5 years the $ 8500 would be best spent as a home down payment or to pay off the 6.8 loan   if you specifically had plans toward home ownership the timing of that plan would affect my answer here as i discuss in the article   the right answer to your question can only come by knowing far more of your personal situation   meanwhile the plan comes at a cost your plan will get rid of the loan in about 5 years but if you simply double up the payments advising the servicing company to apply the extra to principal it would drop to just a couple month over over 4 as you read more about personal finance you 'll find a lot of different views some people are fixated on having zero debt others will focus on liquidity in the end you need to understand each approach and decide what 's right for you

if you have decided to do the degree and are simply deciding whether to accept employer funding for it or not take the funding i see no difference between my employer does n't pay my tuition and my employer paid my tuition but i had to pay it back because i moved on therefore there is no downside to letting them pay the tuition if you want to move on before the two years or whatever is up you pay back that interest free loan you are still ahead over self funding the degree if you have not decided to do the degree and are letting the employer funded tuition figure into your decision process stop that right now doing a degree is hard work you will either work much longer hours than you do now or live on a lower salary or more likely both you might enjoy it you might be worth more afterwards and it might open the door to a of careers available only to those with the degree the actual cost of the tuition is unlikely to be significant in this decision process removing it by assuming the employer pays it should still not be done if it 's worth doing when you self fund then do it and relax knowing you wo n't feel trapped at your employer even if you let them pay it or lend you the money for it if you end up leaving

i think that assuming that you 're not looking to trade the fund an index mutual fund is a better overall value than an etf the cost difference is negligible and the ability to dollar cost average future contributions with no transaction costs you also have to be careful with etfs the spreads are wide on a low volume fund and some etfs are going more exotic things that can burn a novice investor track two similar funds say vanguard total stock market vtsmx and vanguard total stock market etf vti you 'll see that they track similarly   if you are a more sophisticated investor etfs give you the ability to use options to hedge against declines in value without having to incur capital gains from the sale of the fund ie 20 years from now can use puts to make up for short term losses instead of selling shares to avoid losses   for most retail investors i think you really need to justify using etfs versus mutual funds if anything the limitations of mutual funds no intra day trading no options etc discourage speculative behavior that is ultimately not in your best interest edit since this answer was written many brokers have begun offering a suite of etfs with no transaction fees that may push the cost equation over to support index etfs over index mutual funds particularly if it 's a big etf with narrow spreads

if you do business in a state then you need to register your business in that state   i suspect that you have a misconception of what it means to do business in a state   if you are a shop then you very likely are not doing business in any state except the one state where you work examples of when you are doing business in a state include having an office in the state or having employees in the state   merely selling something to a client in that state is not enough to be doing business in the state each state is different but unless you are doing something that is in some sense close to having an office or an employee in a state then you have nothing to worry about   for example if you regularly travel to a state to do work for a client then it is possible that you could be doing business in that state i have no idea if that would be sufficient in any state   but if you are just working out of your basement running a website then you are only doing business in your own state

what kind of financial analysis would make you comfortable about this decision the heloc and arm are the biggest red flags to me in your current situation   while i do n't expect interest rates to skyrocket in the near future they introduce an interest rate risk that is easy to get rid of   getting rid of the heloc and converting to a fixed mortgage would be my first priority if you also want to upgrade to a new home at the same time meaning buy a new home contingent on the sale of your first paying off the heloc and mortgage that 's fine but make sure that you can comfortably afford the payment on a fixed rate mortgage with at least 20 down i would not take additional cash out of your equity just to save it   you 're going to pay more in interest that you 're going to get in savings    from there things get trickier    while many people would keep the first property on a mortgage and rent it out i am not willing to be a landlord for a part time job especially when the interest on the mortgage my return on the rent   plus leverage increases the risks as well all it takes is to go one or two months without rent and you can find yourself unable to make a mortgage payment wrecking your credit and possibly risking foreclosure so my options in order of precedence would be at what point does it make sense to become a landlord the complicated answer is when the benefits rent appreciation relative to the costs maintenance interest taxes etc and risks lost rent bad renters home value variance give you a better return that you could find in investments of similar risk   the simple answer is when you can pay cash for it   that takes interest and lost rent out of the equation    again some are willing to take those risks and pay 20 down on rental property   some are able to make it work   some of those go broke or lose their properties    when calculating the 20 down of a new property does that need to be liquid funds or can that be based on the value of the home you are selling you can make the purchase of the new home contingent on the sale of the first if you need to get the equity out of it to make the 20   do not refinance the first just to pull out the equity to make a down payment   it 's not worth the fees of a refinance

let 's divide all bank accounts into savings and checking the main difference is that checking is easy to get money from savings is hard to get money from because of this the federal reserve requires that banks keep more money on hand to cover transactions in checking accounts here is a related question from a banking customer regarding a recent notice on their bank statement deposit it seems that the bank was moving the customer 's money between hidden sub accounts to make it look like the checking account was really a savings account and thus reduce the amount of funds we are required to keep on deposit at the federal reserve bank if they did n't have to transfer the money many times the bank could keep less cash on hand but once they did 5 hidden transactions the rest of the money in the hidden savings account would be moved by the bank the 6 transaction limit is done to not allow you to treat savings like checking here is a relevant quote from the federal reserve savings deposits   savings deposits generally have no specified maturity    period they may be interest bearing with interest computed or paid    daily weekly quarterly or on any other basis the two most    significant features of savings deposits are the reservation of    right requirement and the restrictions on the number of    convenient transfers or withdrawals that may be made per month or    per statement cycle of at least four weeks from the account in order    to classify an account as a savings deposit the institution must    in its account agreement with the customer reserve the right at any    time to require seven advance written notice of an intended    withdrawal in practice this right is never exercised but the    institution must nevertheless reserve that right in the account    agreement in addition for an account to be classified as a savings    deposit the depositor may make no more than six convenient    transfers or withdrawals per month from the account convenient    transfers and withdrawals for purposes of this limit include    automatic transfers including but not limited to    transfers from the savings deposit for overdraft protection or for    direct bill payments and transfers and withdrawals initiated by    telephone or computer and transfers made by check debit     card or other similar order made by the depositor and payable to    third parties other less convenient types of transfers such as    withdrawals or transfers made in person at the bank by mail or by    using an atm do not count toward the six per month limit and do not    affect the account ’s status as a savings account also a withdrawal    request initiated by telephone does not count toward the transfer    limit when the withdrawal is disbursed via check mailed to the    depositor   should be particularly wary of a bank ’s practices    for handling telephone transfers as noted an unlimited number of    telephone initiated withdrawals are allowed so long as a check for    the withdrawn funds is mailed to the depositor otherwise the limit    is six telephone transfers per month the limit applies to    transfers to move savings deposit funds to another type of deposit    account and to make payments to third parties

you need to talk to your bank   if you 're unable to contact your bank until monday then wait until monday   do n't on the idea that the transaction may hard post on monday   if it happens it happens but it 's not the end of the world even if the transaction posts it 's not the end of the world   if the retailer is legit they will refund your money although it may take some time for things to get sorted out even if the transaction posts and the retailer is not legit it 's still not the end of the world   your bank may help you in trying to recover the funds   that 's why you need to talk to your bank as you have realized blindly calling the number in the email is not a good idea because if it 's fake you 're calling the scammers   instead what you should do is try to contact your bank through known trusted channels   that is look on your bank 's website   do they have a phone number listed for fraud reporting or related inquiries   is it the same number you see in the email   if so you can call it   if it is not the same number but the number on your bank 's website is a number you can call them at that number and tell them the situation based on what you 've described my own guess would be that the retailer is legit but that the unusual large transaction was flagged by your bank as potentially fraudulent which is why you got the email   the fact that you happened to get the email just after canceling the order could be a coincidence   this is especially true if all this happened in a short time   information about these transactions ca n't be transmitted and analyzed instantaneously nor can emails be sent instantaneously there may have been a delay in sending the email so it only arrived after the cancellation as far as your worries about how got your info it is likely a fraud detection service used by your bank   doing a bit of googling reveals that it appears to be a legit service but there have also been instances of phishing attacks using faked emails   however from what i see these worked by trying to get you to click on a link not call a phone number   also if a scammer is able to send you a scam email that includes your actual order details that 's not a it 's an outright hack   in that case the bank and/or retailer whichever was hacked would certainly want to know about it and would likely fall all over themselves trying to refund your money to avoid negative pr

capital surplus is used to account for that amount which a firm raises in excess of the par value nominal value of the shares common stock investopedia has a much simpler answer somebody has tried to be smart on wikipedia and have done the calculations without much explanation the portion of the surplus of a business arising from sources other than earnings   all surplus other than earned surplus usually including amounts received from sale or exchange of capital stock in excess of par or stated value profits on resale of treasury stock donations to capital by stockholders or others or increment arising from revaluation of fixed or other assets the number of shares a company wants to issue is decided and agreed with the regulators they decide the par value and then decide how much premium will be charged extra money above the par value take out any of an issue and you find all these details par value = 1   issue at which investors buy = 10 premium = 9 for a single share the capital surplus is 9 multiply it by the number of shares issued and you have the total capital surplus

us bank deposits over $ 10 k only need to be reported to fincen financial crimes enforcement a bureau of the us department of treasury if the deposits are made in cash or other money instruments where the source can not be traced money orders traveler checks etc regular checks and wires do n't need to be reported because there is a clear bank trail of where the money came from if your family member is giving you money personally not from a business from a bank account which is outside of the us then you only need to report it if the amount is over $ 100k. note you would need to report that regardless of whether the money was deposited into your us bank account or paid directly to your credit cards on your behalf and there are stiff penalties if you play games to try to avoid reporting requirements neither deposit method would trigger any taxable income for the scenario you described

as other people have said a few thousand dollars is n't going to make any significant difference in what you pay if you put an extra 1 down and redraw all the documents accordingly your payments are going to be roughly 1 less per month   so for example $ 1800 per month would become $ or so per month    you 're much better off keeping the money as an emergency fund when you buy a house there are a lot of things that can go wrong as is the case with your car if you have one and with medical expenses and helping out a relative not to mention losing your job and so on   it does n't sound like you have all that much money because if you did you would have put 20 down and avoided private mortgage insurance saving yourself a lot more money than 1 so having a few more thousand in the bank sounds like a good thing

to understand the answer we first have to understand what goodwill is goodwill in a companies balance sheet is an intangible asset that represents the extra value because of a strong brand name good customer relations good employee relations and any patents or proprietary technology an article from the economist explains this very well and actually talks about time warner directly the goodwill the bad and the ugly when one firm buys another the target ’s goodwill essentially the    premium paid over its book value is added to the combined entity ’s    balance sheet goodwill and other intangibles on the books of    companies in the s&p 500 are valued at $ 2.6 trillion or 10 of their    total assets according to analysts at goldman sachs as the economy and more firms trade down towards or even    below their book value empire builders are having to mark down the    value of assets they out on in times a recently    announced $ 25 billion goodwill charge is expected to push time warner    into an operating loss for 2008 for instance michael of    goldman sachs thinks such hits could amount to $ 200 billion or more    over the cycle investors have so far paid little attention to    intangibles but as write downs they are likely to become    increasingly wary of industries with a high ratio of goodwill to    assets such as health care consumer goods and telecoms how bad things get will depend on the american firms    used to be allowed to goodwill over many years since 2002    when an accounting rule change ended that practice goodwill has had    to be tested every year for impairment in this environment    with auditors than ever to avoid being seen to go easy on    clients companies are being told to mark down assets if there is any    doubt about their value the point out that this has no effect on cashflow since such    charges are non cash items moreover some investors take goodwill    write offs with a pinch of salt preferring to look past such    non recurring costs and accept the higher earnings    numbers to which managers understandably cling the largest companies    are thus able to survive blows that might otherwise floor    them such as the $ 99 billion loss that the newly formed but    ill conceived aol time warner as it then was reported for 2002 but    the impact can be all too real as write downs reduce overall book    value and increase leverage ratios a particular concern in these    debt averse times

the short answer is that you would want to use the net inflow or net outflow aka profit or loss    in my experience you 've got a couple different uses for irr and that may be driving the confusion   pretty much the same formula but just coming at it from different angles    thinking about a stock or mutual fund investment you could project a scenario with an up front investment net outflow in the first period and then positive returns dividends then final sale proceeds each a net inflow in subsequent periods   this is a model that more closely follows some of the logic you laid out thinking about a business project or investment you tend to see more complicated and less smooth cashflows   for example you may have a large up front capital expenditure in the first period then have net profit revenue less ongoing maintenance expense then another large capital outlay and so on    in both cases you would want to base your analysis on the net inflow or net outflow in each period   it just depends on the complexity of the cashflows trend as to whether you see a straightforward example initial payment then ongoing net inflows or a less straightforward example with both inflows and outflows    one other thing to note you would only want to include those costs that are applicable to the project   so you would not want to include the cost of overhead that would exist even if you did not undertake the project

sure just saying it does exist    also i do n't understand why people need to return stuff so much only thing i can see it being needed so much is people buying something solely to use it for a one time use then getting their money back or simply over shopping and not controlling their budget and need their money back after they realize they spent too much on shit they do n't need   i mean if i need to buy something i do some research find the best product for the price and get the best offer the first time unless it 's broken or defective i 've never had to return anything then again i 'm also not a compulsive shopper that blows my budget on shit i do n't need   i do n't know does n't seem like a make or break feature for me and wo n't sway which service i use either way

the way i approach afford to lose is that you need to sit down and figure out the amount of money you need at different stages of your life i can look at my current expenses and figure out what i will always roughly be paying bills groceries rent mortgage   i can figure out when i want to retire and how much i want to live on i generally group 401k and other retirement separately to what i want to invest with these numbers i can figure out how much i need to save to achieve this goal maybe you want to purchase a house in 5 years figure out the rough down payment and include that in your savings plan continue for all capital purchases that you can think you would aim for subtract your income from this and you have the amount of money you have greater discretion over subtracting current liabilities 4th of july holiday christmas presents and you have the amount you could afford to lose as to the asset allocation you should look at as others have mentioned that the younger you the greater your opportunity is to recoup losses personally i would disagree you should have some plan for the investment and use that goal to drive your diversification

frequently people saving money for a down payment or for their emergency fund feel that they need to find a way to the process via methods that will generate more interest than a bank account or a cd once they have reached their goal they also feel that having the money sitting around not generating income is a missed opportunity all investments that are n't 100 safe introduce risk to entice you to invest they offer the opportunity make more money than a bank account or cd but the downside is that the extra money is n't guaranteed in fact the introduced risk also opens up the investment to the possibility of losses including a total loss you have identified risks with bank accounts and cds with the bank account you will generally lose money vs. inflation with a cd the investment is less liquid if you sell early or you want need to sell 1/2 a cd you will give up some of that extra income also if rates on a cd rise next month you are locked into your current rate til the cd ends putting some or all of the money you are saving for the house into a risky investment means that you may shorten or extend the time period nobody knows   by investing in real estate we can offset the risk of real estate    going up in the next couple years if real estate goes up we will    still be able to use our down payment for a comparable house as of    now inversely if real estate goes down we will lose on the down    payment but be able to get a house cheaper unless the reit matches the market of residential real estate in your city metropolitan region there is no guarantee that home prices in your city will move the same way the reit does   a recent listing of the 10 largest holdings of the index is none of these tell me what home prices in my neighborhood will do next year

better financial analyst on paper or to improve your own ability   in my opinion what makes a good analyst is a thorough understanding of macro and financial statements intellectual curiosity and ability to think independently   to be able to look at a dataset and come to your own conclusions without outside bias   to not just want to learn how but also why   you ca n't improve if you do n't question the status quo   everyone lists excel as a skill on their resume but it is amazing how few people really know it   more employable what i would want to see is experience in bloomberg factset and thomson reuters   and how you have utilized the tools   i want to see that you can think independently   show me you are capable of completing a task just by being given the starting point and the ending point without needed to be told every step in between   as i said previously everyone claims to be excel experts show me that you really do have advanced knowledge

i 've tried looking for sources and i 've found a few but none of them seem to nail the exact material of what i 'm asking about   i feel that these visceral questions about what is value in our world and how we can redefine it outside the definitions from both governments and corporations is an important to our modern era     nobody asked me to do this i am just drawn drawn to wonder about not only the workings of the world but its possibilities the same way adam smith tesla hayek and a few others have been drawn to in their lifetimes even though they were criticized   they began asking questions and developing them over years in order to help others and build the world and that is what i am and i was trying to do here   not just to get the old formulas from a book but to get real opinions in real time because that 's what matters how our own kind define revolution or because are n't and entrepreneurs the same thing   the risk takers and idea makers that want to make a new world for everyone   the problem is when the definition of value by one entity is made the definition of everyone by force and its causes only     give me control of a nation ’s money supply and i care not who makes its   it is not by augmenting the capital of the country but by rendering a greater part of that capital active and productive than would otherwise be so that the most judicious operations of banking can increase the industry of the country adam smith   ironically what both adam smith and karl marx agreed on was a fear that money would become an end to itself which many people fear is true today   should n't we ask these questions more often   i feel it 's

it would essentially make goods from other countries more cheaper than goods from us and it would make imports from these countries to china more expensive   the below illustration is just with 2 major currencies and is more illustrative to show the effect it does not actually mean the goods from these countries would be cheaper 1 gbp = 1.60 usd   1 eur = 1.40 usd 1 cny = 0.15 usd lets say the above are the rates for gbp eur cny the cost of a particular goods assume in international market is 2 usd this means for the cost of manufacturing this should be less than gbp 1.25 in uk less than 1.43 in euro countires less than cny in china only then export would make sense if the real cost of manufacturing is say 1.4 gbp in uk 1.5 eur in euro countires clearly they can not compete and would loose now lets say the usd has appreciated by 20 against other currencies the cny is at same rate 1 gbp = usd 1 eur = usd 1 cny = 0.15 usd now at this rate the cost of manufacturing should be less than gbp gbp less than eur in euro countires in effect this is more than the cost of manufacturing so in effect the goods from other countires have become cheaper and goods from china have become expensive similarly the imports from these countires to china would be more expensive

for whatever it 's worth   judging from the comments in the other answers i think everyone is addressing your question how can you possibly lose money   there are a lot of ways to possibly lose money in the stock market   here are my thoughts   this is a chart of the s&p 500 from about 1996 to about 2012   at the top from the first arrow the entire s&p500 index fell about 45   from the top of the second arrow the entire s&p500 index fell about 52   it is really easy to look at our sustained bull market and feel   and while i 'll concede that not every company in the index fell over these two periods bear in mind that the s&p500 index is a collection of the 500 largest companies in the united states and the entire index lost half it 's value twice   as the companies contained in the index shrink in value they were replaced by companies that are the new biggest 500 in the country then those fell too and so on and so forth until the entire index lost half value is a funny thing because it is n't necessarily tied to the performance of the business look at the current rosy valuations of all these non earnings tech companies   it could be that a company is still performing very well but there are just no buyers for the stock    so how can you lose money in the stock market   very easily   in a practical sense it 's when you need the money and can no longer weather the storm   people who went out for retirement around 2000 could n't sit around and wait until 2007 for their account values to be replenished   this is why you roll off your stock exposure as you age   as you get older you do n't have time and if you stop having income you can find yourself selling your assets at the least opportune time

theoretically when a company issues more shares it does not affect the value of your shares   the reason is that when a company issues and sells more shares the proceeds from the sale of those shares goes back into the company using your example you have 10 out of 100 shares of the company for a 10 stake   let 's say that the shares are valued at $ 1,000 each meaning that the market value of the company is $ 100,000 and your stake is worth $ 10,000 now the company issues 100 more shares at $ 1,000 each   the company receives $ 100,000 from new investors and now the company is worth $ 200,000   your stake is now only 5 of the company but it is still worth $ 10,000 the authorized share capital is the amount of shares that a company has already planned on selling   when you buy stock in a company you can look up how many shares exist so you know what your percent stake in the company is   when a company wants to sell more shares this is called an increase of authorized share capital   in order to do this the company generally needs the approval of a majority of the existing shareholders

let me ask you something else if you knew about a company that makes $ 1 million of profit per year and growing with costs that are half that would you not be interested to have a stake in this company   of course you would and because the shares can be publicly bought you can i do n't think you 'd care if it 's an asset manager or some other company   an asset manager can do a lot with the capital it raises it could get bigger and better offices invest in a better computer system maybe get faster access to exchange information better information terminals have more money for marketing and road shows but the really big cash usually goes to acquire new talent you might not need that much money for support staff but a sales manager can be expensive and a good fund manager can easily cost a high 7 to 8 figure number per year

the ruble was is and will be very unstable because of unstable political situation in russia and the economy strongly dependent of the export of raw resources what you can do i assume you want to minimize risk the best way to achieve that is to make your savings in some stable currency euro and swiss franc are currently very stable currencies so storing your surpluses in them is a very good option if you want to keep your money safe to prevent political risk you should keep your money in countries with stable political regime which are unlikely to nationalize the savings of the citizens in predictable future as for your existing savings in rubles it 's a hard deal i assume as the web developer you have a plenty of money which have lost a lot of value if you convert them to euro or francs you will the current value after the loss you 'll safe them ruble falling down but in case the ruble will return to previous value you 'll loose   keeping savings in currencies is however speculation like investing in gold etc so if you can mentally accept the loss and want to sleep good convert them you have also option to invest in properties for example buy an extra appartment it 's a good way to deal with financial surplus in europe in us however you should be aware in it 's connected with the political risk the real estates can be confiscated in any moment by the state and you ca n't run away with it the savings can also be confiscated but there 's a fair chance you 'll manage to rescue them if you act quickly

gt say you repeal a tax without reducing public spending then if you analyze the economic impact that does not fairly represent the impact of the tax now does it   you are right but my issue is that you are accounting for changes that are not happening   if you are comparing a country 's tax structure before and after a wealth tax then i would agree however in this case all the subjects are separate economies and have presumably found some sort of equilibrium   the wealth tax policy is not changing for them so there is no surplus or deficit of public spending to adjust for

so this is n't always the case but in the example provided the option is most likely in the money or near the money since the delta is nearly 1 indicating that a $ 1 move in the underlying results in a $ move in the option this will happen when the expiration is very far out or the option is in the money as expiration gets closer movements in the underlying become more pronounced in the options because the probability of the stock price moving from its current position is lower     as the probability of the stock price moving goes down the delta of in the money options approaches 100 eventually reaching 100 at expiration another way to word this is that the premium on in the money options shrinks as expiration approaches and the intrinsic value of the option increases as percentage of total value so that movements in the underlying stock price become a greater influence on the option price hence a greater delta again if the option is out of the money this is not the case

the problem with your math is that your assumptions are all sorts of fucked up you have him living in a 700 sqft apartment in but paying $ 1400 in indianapolis i live here $ 1400 in indy is enough to rent a 3 bedroom house or a 3 bedroom luxury apartment downtown and a front end dev is n't going to be making 70 k in indy with 5 years experience that 's the average of salaried employees in indy web developers make more my friend 's starting job out of a no name local college here was with 5 years experience you can find a job paying a lot more than that your salary scale is automatically going to be skewed since tech pays more and a greater percentage of the population is going to be in tech in sf than indy the dude would probably be making more like 90k if he was competent and paying $ 500 a month for a 700 sqft apartment if he had some money for a down payment for $ 1400 a month he could afford the mortgage of like a 300 k house and could actually be putting that money into an investment rather than sinking that money into rent good luck buying a house in sf for less than 1m. but for sport let 's assume he does n't buy a home and is renting a small apartment so he is now paying only $ 6000 a year for housing and is making 20 k more than your estimate which after taxes is like what at least 16 k in take home money plus the 11 k he is paying less in rent than you assumed so he is actually making 27 k more than you are assuming in your math and now instead of making 20 k less a year than he would in sf he is making 7 k more again if he was smart and bought a house which is n't possible for 99 of people in sf the monetary gain is n't even close   and do n't get me started on the perks of california people from cali all seem to be under the assumption that things like nature restaurants and entertainment only exist in california

this is completely disgusting utterly unethical deeply objectionable and yes it is almost certainly illegal the federal trade commission has indeed filed suit halted ads etc in a number of cases but these likely only represent a tiny percentage of all cases this does n't make what the car dealer 's do ok but do n't expect the swat team to bust some heads any time soon which is kind of sad but let 's deal with the details let 's see what the federal trade commission has to say in their article are car ads taking you for a ride deceptive car ads here are some claims that may be deceptive and    why vehicles are available at a specific low price or for a specific    discount what may be missing the low price is after a downpayment often    thousands of dollars plus other fees like taxes licensing and    document fees on approved credit other pitches the discount is only    for a pricey fully loaded model or the reduced price or discount    offered might depend on qualifications like the buyer being a recent    college graduate or having an account at a particular bank only $ what may be missing the advertised payments are temporary teaser    payments payments for the rest of the loan term are much higher a    variation on this pitch you will owe a balloon payment usually    thousands of dollars at the end of the term so both of these are what the ftc explicitly says are deceptive practices has the ftc taken action in cases similar to this yes they have if auto dealers make advertising claims in headlines they ca n’t take    them away in fine print said jessica rich director of the ftc ’s    bureau of consumer protection these actions show there is a    financial cost for violating ftc orders in the case referenced above the owners of a 20 + dealership chain was hit with about $ 250,000 in fines if you think that 's a tiny portion of the unethical gains they made from those ads in the time they were running i 'd say you were absolutely correct and that 's little more than a cost of doing business for unscrupulous companies but that 's the state of the us nation at this time and so we are left with caveat emptor as a guiding principle what can you do about it competitors are technically allowed to file suit for deceptive business practices so if you know any honest dealers in the area you can tip them off about it try saying that out loud with a serious face   but even better you can contact the ftc and file a formal complaint online i would n't expect the world to change for your complaint but even if it just generates a letter it may be enough to let a company know someone is watching and if they are a big business they might actually get into a little bit of trouble

separate from some of the other considerations such as the legality it is likely going to be worth your will if you employer has company matching even if you have to pay the early withdraw penalty because the matching funds from your employer can be viewed as gains on the money deposited for example using round numbers to make the math easy no 401(k deposit with 401(k deposit so as you can see there is a benefit to deferring some of the earnings to the 401(k account due to the employer matching but the actual dollar amount that you would be able to take home will be different based upon your own circumstances depending upon what the take home would be at the end of the day the percentage return may or may not be worth the time involved with doing the paperwork however all of this only applies if you have to pull the money out early as once you hit 59.5 years old you can start withdrawing the money without the tax penalty in which case the returns on your initial deposit will be much more

whoa these things are on two dimensions   it 's like burger and fries you can also have chicken sandwich and fries or burger and onion rings    you can invest in an taxable brokerage account and/or an ira   and then within each of those   you can buy index funds and/or anything else all 4 combinations are possible   if someone says otherwise take your money and run   they are a shady financial advisor who is ripping you off by steering you only into products where they get a commission those products are more expensive because the commission comes out of your end   not to mention any names       if you want financial advice that is honest find a financial advisor who you pay for his advice and who does n't sell products at all   or just ask here   but i would start by listening to suze orman dave ramsey whomever you prefer   and read john bogle 's book    they can tell you all about the difference between money market bonds stocks managed mutual funds ripoff and index funds ira accounts roth ira accounts and taxable accounts are all brokerage accounts   within them you can buy any security you want including index funds   the difference is taxation   suppose you earn $ 1000 and choose to invest it however   later you withdraw it and it has grown to $ 3000   investing in a taxable account you pay normal income tax on the $ 1000 when you later withdraw the $ 3000 you pay a tax on $ 2000 of income   if you invested more than a year it is taxed at a much lower capital gains tax rate   with a traditional ira account you pay zero taxes on the initial $ 1000   later when you take the money out you pay normal income tax on the full $ 3000   if you withdrew it before age 59 1/2 you also pay a 10 penalty $ 300   with a roth ira account you pay normal income tax on the $ 1000   when you withdraw the $ 3000 later you pay nothing in taxes   provided you followed the rules    you can invest in almost anything inside these accounts money market funds terrible return   you wo n't keep up with the market   bonds   low return but usually quite safe   individual stocks   good luck    managed mutual funds   you 're paying some genius stock picker to select high performing stocks he has a huge staff of researchers and   good social connections   he also charges you 1.5 per year overhead as an expense ratio which is a total loss to you   the fact is he can usually pick stocks better than a monkey throwing darts   but he 's not 1.5 better   index funds   these just shrug and buy every stock on the market   there 's no huge staff or genius manager just some intern making small adjustments every week   as such the expense ratio is extremely small like 0.1     if any of these investments pay dividends you must pay taxes on them when they 're issued if you 're not in an ira account   this problem gets fixed in etf 's   index etf 's   these are index funds packaged to behave like stocks   dividends increase your stock 's value instead of being paid out to you which simplifies your taxes   if you buy index funds outside of an ira use these   too many other options to get into here

if one has established a liquid emergency fund of 3 to 6 months income as suggested in several places here as well as being recommended by many financial planners then a savings account is a great place to keep that money all things being equal between the savings and checking account the limited transfers should be a non issue since ideally you wo n't be using that money and if you need to in an emergency you could move a whole months worth of expenses to checking in one transfer   the savings account gives you a place to keep the emergency fund segregated from your normal funds out of sight out of mind as it were a savings account also gives you a place to stash funds intended for short term goals away from normal use funds one such example i can use is that i am purchasing several plane tickets for various family members to come visit for christmas i have those funds set aside in a savings account so they do n't interfere with my budgeting of my normal living expenses while these are just examples and your situation may vary they are both examples of where a savings account would be useful even if it is identical to a checking account   edit   using other types of accounts can also accomplish the same thing since we are using the assumption that the checking and savings accounts are identical the benefit of using a savings account is that it is usually inherently linked to the associated checking account without any additional effort on the part of the account holder any other account type would require additional effort however minor on the part of the account holder to link them in such a way that would make transfers between accounts as easy as possible

nowhere to back up a bit mutual funds are the stock market and the bond market that is when you invest in a mutual fund your money is ultimately buying stocks on the open market some of it might be buying bonds the exact mix of stocks and bonds depends on the mutual fund but a mutual fund is just a basket of stocks and/or bonds and/or other more exotic investments at 25 you probably should just be investing your roth ira in index stock mutual funds and index bond mutual funds you probably should n't even be doing peer to peer lending unless you 're willing to think of any losses as the cost of a hobby the higher interest rate you 're getting is a reflection of the risk that your borrowers will default i 'm not even sure if peer to peer lending is allowed in roth ira 's   investing in just stocks bonds and cast is boring but these are easy investments to understand the harder the investment is to understand the easier it is for it to be a scam or just a bad investment there 's not necessarily anything wrong with boring

bernie from what i read i thought it was something like a fixed on each   you are right there does need to be an enforcement agency however i do not believe it has to be government   i think like finra and sec need to exist however there is no reason to believe that they could n't exist without government   please do n't even get started on kansas trust me i know it far too well i do not like brownback but his tax experiment was by no means what he was claiming republicans claim   he lowered taxes sounds great on businesses wrong policy mainly llcs and while it was nice for some farmers and smaller business owners to not have to pay those taxes however there was an actual increase is ks sales tax from to 6.5 which will obviously further disincentive buying it was n't much of a for regular people   here is what i do not understand if you are going to stimulate growth it should be done with the consumers the consumers are what creates the demand for business products services i 've always been a proponent of expanding the standard deduction perhaps even adding back county and local sales tax deductions or other regressive taxes etc   to all of my knowledge i do n't know of really any big deregulation they have done here they did not shut down schools there were schools that had to at some points but that option on the table but i do not believe any ever did    since the doe has been created test scores have virtually been flat despite increasing education spending nationwide by 4 5x   my high school spent tens of thousands of dollars on macbook pros and ipads the same year they started having these big paper shortages the students screwed around on the computers and tablets we did n't use them for anything and besides even if we did studies show that using them does n't really help anyway schools school boards do not know how to appropriate funds whatsoever   there is no reason to believe that increased school funding helps students learn any more than others in fact more funding per student goes to a lot of inner city schools than rural in the state of ks and they actually school a slight negative return   i agree and i will if become rich enough to first sustain myself i will or perhaps i will move to peter thiel 's island

at your age heck at my age i would not think about doing any of those types of investments not savings on your own unless you are really interested in the investment process for its own sake and are willing to devote a lot of time to investigating companies in order to try to pick good investments instead find a good mutual fund from say vanguard or put your money in there and relax   depending on your short term goals e.g. will you expect to need the money for college you could pick either an index fund or a low risk mostly bond fund

i think your question is pretty wise and the comments indicate that you understand the magnitude of the situation    first off there could be nothing that your friend could do   step parent relationships can be strained and this could make it worse add the age of the girl and grief and he could make this a lot worse then it potentially is   she may spend it all to spite step dad secondly there is a need to understand by all involved that personal finance is about 75 90 behavior   very high income people can wind up bankrupt and lower income people can end up wealthy   the difference between two people 's success or failure often boils down to behavior    thirdly i think you understand that there needs to be a why not only a what to do   i think that is the real tricky part   there has to be a teaching component along with an okay this is what you should do    finding a person will be difficult   first off there is not a lot of money involved   good financial advisers handle much larger cash positions and this young lady will probably need to spend some of it down   secondly most are willing to provide a cookie cutter solution to the problem at hand   this will likely leave a bad taste in the daughter 's mouth    if it was me i would encourage two things both of those things buy time   if she comes out of this with an education in a career field with a 50 60 k starting salary a nice used car and no student loans that would be okay   i would venture to say mom would be happy    if she is very savvy she might be able to come out of this with a down payment on a place of her own or if she has education all locked up perhaps purchasing a home for mostly cash    in the interim period a search for a good teaching fa could occur   finding such a person could also help you and your friend in addition to the daughter   now my own step daughter and i have a good financial relationship   there are other areas where our relationship can be strained but as far as finances we relate well   we took financial peace university   $ 100 offered through many local churches together when she was at the tender age of 16   the story of ben and arthur really spoke to her and we have had many subsequent conversations on the matter   that may work in this case a youtube video on part of the lesson

i started a business a few years ago   at one point it was n't going so well and my father loaned me an amount not too dissimilar to what you 've done from a personal perspective the moment i took that loan there was a strain the relationship   especially when i was sometimes late on the interest payments   unfortunately thoughts like he does n't need this right now but if i do n't pay the car loan then that is taken away came up a few times and paying the interest fell to the bottom of the monthly bill payment stack at some point my wife and i finally took a hard look at my finances and goals   we got rid of things that simply were n't necessary car payment cable tv etc and focused on the things we needed to   doing the same with the business helped out as well as it helped focus me to to turn things around   things are now going great that said two of my siblings ran into their own financial trouble that our parents helped them on   when this happened my father called us together and basically everyone 's debt by an equal amount which covered everything plus wrote a check to the one that was doing fine   this cleared the air with regards to future inheritance questions about how much one sibling was being helped vs another etc   honestly it made family gatherings more enjoyable as all that underlying tension was now gone i 've since helped one of my children   although i went about it an entirely different way    rather than loan them money i gave it to them   we also had a few discussions on how i think they ought to manage their finances and a set of goals to work towards which we co developed   bearing in mind that they are an individual and sometimes you can lead a horse   given the current state of things i consider it money well spent

an option is a financial instrument instrument that gives you the right but not the obligation to do some transaction in the future at a given price an employee stock option is a kind of call option it gives you the right but not the obligation to buy the stock at a certain price the exercise price usually set as the price of the stock when the option was granted the idea is that you would exercise the option buy the stock at the given price as provided by the option if the value of the stock is higher than the exercise price and not if it is lower the option is gifted to you but that does not mean you get any stock if and when you choose to exercise the option you would buy the stock with your own money at what time you can exercise the option and how many shares you can exercise at a given time will be specified in the agreement usually you can only exercise a particular share after it has vested according to some vesting schedule and you lose the ability to exercise after you no longer work for the company plus perhaps a grace period or after the option expires

disclaimer i am not an accountant nor a tax pro etc etc yes a canadian corporation can function as a partial income tax shelter   this is possible since a corporation can retain earnings profits indefinitely and corporate income tax rates are generally less than personal income tax rates   details if you own and run your business through a corporation you can choose to take income from your corporation in one of two ways   as salary or as dividends salary constitutes an expense of the corporation i.e. it gets deducted from revenue in calculating corporate taxable income   no corporate income tax is due on money paid out as salary   however personal income taxes and other deductions e.g. cpp would apply to salary at regular rates the same as for a regular employee dividends are paid by the corporation to shareholders out of after tax profits   i.e. the corporation first pays income tax on taxable income for the fiscal year and resulting net income could be used to pay dividends or not at the personal level dividends are taxed less than salary to account for tax the corporation paid   the net effect of corporate + personal tax is about the same as for salary leaving out deductions like cpp the key point dividends do n't have to be paid out in the year the money was earned   the corporation can carry profits forward retained earnings as long as it wants and choose to issue dividends or not in later years given that here 's how would the partial income tax shelter works at some point for you to personally realize income from the corporation you can have the corporation declare a dividend you 'll then have to pay personal income taxes on the income at the dividend rates   but for as long as the money was invested inside the corporation it was subject only to lesser corporate tax rates not higher personal income tax rates   hence the partial aspect of this kind of tax shelter or if you 're lucky enough to find a buyer for your corporation you could qualify for the lifetime capital gains exemption on proceeds up to $ 750,000 when you sell a qualified small business corporation   this is the best exit strategy unfortunately not an easy one where the business has no valuable assets e.g. a client base or intellectual property the major sticking point   you need to have real business revenue   a regular employee of another company ca n't funnel his personally earned employment income into a corporation just to take advantage of this mechanism   sorry

there is no general theory to support the notion that larger companies will be more profitable than smaller companies   economies of scale are not always positive one can have of scale too    it is more common to talk about an optimal firm size even going back to 's the economies of scale   intuitively if economies of scale extended indefinitely then natural monopolies would dominate all industries in the long run a profit ratio unfortunately would n't quite get at scale economies   consider for example that the denominator of your metric would be and that you are trying to get at the cost reduction that derives from scale   then you are measuring the size of a company by the exact metric that should be reduced if scale economies exist so the calculation would be a bit it is my understanding that such assessments are usually conducted at the industry level by determining whether the industry is becoming increasingly concentrated among fewer firms over time again see    if concentration is increasing there is an implication that at current firm sizes there are economies of scale in the industry

i would n't say you should have any particular limit but it ca n't hurt to have a higher limit i 'd always accept the increase when offered and feel free to request it sometimes just make sure you find out if it will be a hard or soft inquiry and pass on the hard inquires from my own experience there does n't seem to be any or reason to the increases i believe each bank acts differently based on the customer 's credit income and even the bank 's personal quotas or goals for that period here is some anecdotal evidence of this i got my first credit card when i was 18 years old and a freshman in college it had a limit of $ 500 at the time i never asked for a credit line increase but always accepted when offered one and sometimes they did n't even ask and in the last 20 years it worked it 's way up to $ 25k. another card with the same bank went from $ 5 k to $ 15 k in about 10 years about 6 years ago i added two cards one with a $ 5 k limit and one with a $ 3 k limit i did n't ask for increases on those either and today the 5 k is up to $ 22 k and the 3 k is still at $   an even larger disparity exists on the business side years ago i had two business credit cards with different banks at one point in time both were maxed out for about 6 months and only minimums were being paid bank 1 started lowering my credit limit as i started to pay off the card eventually prompting me to cancel the card when it was paid in full at the same time bank 2 kept raising my limit to give me more breathing room in case i needed it obviously bank 1 did n't want my business and bank 2 did less than a year later both cards were paid off in full and you can guess which bank i chose to do all of my business with after that

i think what the person meant to say is that gold is not a one stop solution there 's nothing wrong with having gold in an otherwise diversified portfolio but you need to be aware about the potential downsides the problem with gold is that its value nowadays depends mainly on investor confidence or the lack of it actual demand for gold can not explain the rise in value gold had after the crisis if people are afraid the world and currencies with it will go to hell the gold price will go up why because if currencies seize to exist gold will still be accepted it can replace currencies what many people tend to forget let 's consider the extreme example and currencies really cease to exist and all hell breaks lose what good are gold bars at the bank or even at home for that matter you 'll be better off with gold coins to use in barter and to pay off but that 's not about investing anymore that 's

gt the base value from infrastructure is derived on a per capita basis it is a fixed cost as opposed to a variable one in other words roads are just as useful to me as they are to you regardless of my net worth      a1 misleading infrastructure is useful to those who use it more independently of classifying it as fixed vs wiki take the faa for example the poor who can not afford a plane ticket and/or order things via next day air derive very little benefit from the faa compared to a person who owns their own aircraft and can fly out at a moments notice knowing full well they can file a flight plan and communicate with a network of airports to ensure their plane will not crash into any other jets    gt;a tank a missile a police officer protects me the same as it does anyone else    a2 but a person with more net worth has more to lose than a person with low net worth therefore even independent of a1 above your statement is false those examples protect those with more property net worth etc more so than those with less    gt b as a percentage of income infrastructure is far more valuable to low income individuals than high income individuals   it depends on the infrastructure but there is far more infrastructure protecting the wealthy than the poor your example is the stock market why should the vast majority of people pay for sec and rules and regulations to require enforce honest filings when they can not afford stock who benefits from sec infrastructure you and i do    value to poor as a percentage of income = 0 value to rich gt 0   your roads argument as an example of poor using more infrastructure than the rich is a bad one the poor are more likely to take public transportation and/or work    within 5 miles of their residence the rich are more likely to have multiple cars live in areas far from work and take long road trips staying at home to work is a function of more than just owning stock there are at home parents it professionals programmers voip operators etc all working from home and completely independent of road use    gt c the activities of business owners generate massive tax revenues these far outweigh their personal utility from infrastructure   personal utility you are mixing corporate and personal taxes and yet calling out personal utility unless you are talking about business owners flowing income to personal income e.g. s corp the mixing of terms is unfortunate because both business and people use infrastructure and both should pay for it    far outweigh not true see examples a1 and a2 above and i 'll go one more taxes on businesses are on net revenue not gross revenue ignoring things like ss and fica you probably invest in businesses with dividends and there is an incentive to keep a net revenue that can be distributed to stockholders but in the private world there is no such motivation in fact there is an anti motivation to show profit as low as possible to limit tax liability this has led to many hacks of the tax code expenses to make sure that businesses end up with negative tax liability or an effective rate that is close to 0 how many poor people can claim negative tax liability again 0 gt not zero     society captures the majority of individual commercial efforts estimates vary but typically 85 in other words if i generate $ 10.00 of value as an entrepreneur i will realistically be able to capture only $ 1.50 of that   d1 wat vague not all commercial efforts have a positive impact on the community   irrelevant since we are talking about use vs cost etc

there is nothing fair unfair in such deals it is an art than a science   what kind of things should be considered to work out what would be a fair percentage stake a true fair value is take the current valuation of the company this can be difficult if it is small and does not maintain proper records divide by number of shares that is the value of share and you should 20 k worth of such shares but then there is risk premium you are taking a risk that an small start up may do exceedingly well or it may close off this risk premium is what is negotiated it depends on how desperate the owner of the small company is who all are interested in this specific deal if you want 30 share someone else is ready to offer 20 k for 15 of share or there is no one willing to lend 20 k as they do n't believe it will make money and the owner is desperate you may even get 50

when i read that part of his post it reminded me more of credit companies rather than banks people default on credit all the time i have no idea what the regulations are on the amount of credit that a company can issue though   and this is sort of part of what actually happened in the beginning of the economic crunch a bunch of people began to trade for credit debt against what they thought the future value of their house or other real estate would be after a while people stopped being able to afford property at its future value so they stopped buying it when people then tried to sell their property for the future value that they had borrowed against they could n't so they could n't pay back their debt   because real estate had become a popular investment vehicle for the middle class this was able to reach a kind of critical mass and shortly afterward the effects back into the credit market which also had its own crunch a bunch of credit just disappeared overnight because so many people had assumed a level of debt that they could not actually fulfill their promises on once the future value of their home became completely imaginary

the market moves faster than ratings agencies   everyday the market is trying to figure out the true value of assets liabilities and thus its overall equity value   the financial crisis illustrated this perfectly when bear got stuck in a liquidity trap   it 's was still highly rated likewise its overall credit rating was sound however in reality the value of assets were much higher due to coming default credit providers realized assets bear had posted as collateral were falling in value quickly   this started the death spiral or feedback loop in which it is n't clear if the tail the dog or the dog the tail but as equity value fell bear could no longer get access to credit markets to fund daily operations once it got margin called and could n't pay it was all over   when it was sold to jpm they basically stole the entire company at a fire sale price everyone knew they were getting a deal as reflected in the post buyout price jump of jpm stock     so in a technical sense you are right they have nothing to do with each other   but in a practical sense as we see equity value collapse we are approaching bankruptcy and thus default and credit ratings should represent likelihood of default so the two should have a positive correlation to one another assuming equity value is the true value

in general there are two types of futures contract a put and call   both contract types have both common sides of a transaction a buyer and a seller   you can sell a put contract or sell a call contract also you 're just taking the other side of the agreement   if you 're selling it would commonly be called a sell to open meaning you 're opening your position by selling a contract which is different from simply selling an option that you currently own to close your position a put contract gives the buyer the right to sell shares or some asset commodity for a specified price on a specified date the buyer of the contract gets to put the shares on someone else    a call contract gives the buyer the right to buy shares or some asset commodity for a specified price on a specified date the buyer of the contract gets to call on someone for shares american options contracts allow the buyer can exercise their rights under the contract on or before the expiration date while european type contracts can only be exercised on the expiration date to address your example   typically for stock an option contract involves 100 shares of a stock   the value of these contracts fluctuates the same way other assets do   typically retail investors do n't actually exercise their contracts they just close a profitable position before the exercise deadline and let unprofitable positions expire worthless   if you were to buy a single call contract with an exercise price of $ 100 with a maturity date of august 1 for $ 1 per share the contract will have cost you $ 100   let 's say on august 1 the underlying shares are now available for $ 110 per share   you have two options option 1 on august 1 you can exercise your contract to buy 100 shares for $ 100 per share   you would exercise for $ 10,000 $ 100 times 100 shares then sell the shares for $ 10 profit per share less the cost of the contract and transaction costs option 2 your contract is now worth something closer to $ 10 per share up from $ 1 per share when you bought it   you can just sell your contract without ever exercising it to someone with an account large enough to exercise and/or an actual desire to receive the asset or commodity

gt you failed to address the part where i said tesla wants major car companies to compete that has been the entire point all along from the very start and competition would be good for tesla because instead of tesla alone having to spend resources on educating the ignorant public e.g. you this way other auto manufacturers would be able to help and tesla would have other to compare to and to say see we 're better than them tesla welcomes this    i did n't address it because there is no need to   for the electric car industry to work as a whole yes there needs to be more competition   tesla 's competitors however are going to wipe the floor with tsla because tsla is committing massive capital to old tech   gt auto companies are behind the times because they 've outsourced nearly all of their engineering expertise they are good at volume production and engines that 's most of what 's left of any major auto manufacturer so take away the engine and they have nothing to make a compelling ev they need to start from scratch and it takes years to develop a car this is why competition has n't come and why compelling competition is n't coming the only companies with somewhat compelling offerings are those who started very early bmw and nissan or those who have partnered with tesla mercedes and sort of toyota porsche has a chance since they still have engineers but they 're dragging their feet everyone else is basically fucked and not just because of the lack of engineering but because of the nature of large companies it takes a lot to right a large ship   i 'm not sure how to answer that   it 's all just speculation   the competition is waiting for the first big mover to do just what tsla is going being the first mover then coming in and wiping the floor with them     gt;companies will be loathe to release compelling evs because they will compete against themselves they will have to advertise the evs as if they are better than their gas offerings which still make up 99 of their sales this puts them in a sort of paralysis and they ca n't do anything about it someone is going to take bites out of their market share and it 's either going to be them or it 's going to be tesla   that 's just silly   car companies are in the market to sell cars   every new car model competes with an existing model       gt in the real world there is specialization some companies design cars others design batteries gt have you seriously never heard of vertical integration my previous paragraph talks about the perils of the sort of specialization you 're talking about because automakers have spun off all their expertise they are not nimble enough to compete in a changing market vertical integration is not the answer to everything but it is a very good way to make your company nimble and keep costs down if you can do it that 's what tesla is aiming for it 's not a new concept and the fact that you 've never heard of it confirms my view that you do n't understand the issues   if you want to argue that all of the last 30 years of free markets and the value of specialization is wrong go ahead    gt the actual battery companies would n't do it but you think musk knows more about batteries than the actual battery companies gt tesla has particular expertise about automotive batteries yes they do their own battery research and have their own ip and patents which they 've opened related to it and they have a partner panasonic who is the leader in batteries did you know that did you know that panasonic is partnering in the battery factory because it sounds like you did n't which confirms my view that you do n't understand the issues gt panasonic is partnering in their battery factory and will be responsible for much of the production and panasonic has been making quite a tidy profit on their battery manufacturing for several years thanks to tesla   they are committing massive capital to old technology   that 's a loser play but it will help the industry as a whole and those that are going to come in with the next generation of batteries while tsla is stuck with massive capital in lithium ion    gt gt literally in the same exact call that this article is about on the same day panasonic and tesla announced that panasonic is spending massive capital for a plant to supply tsla cars not only have they increased production at their own plant tremendously over the course of the last few years they will end up spending a billion dollars on the tesla plant so no you really really do n't understand it    we have n't decided yet on the specifics of when or how much investment we will be making panasonic chief financial officer said at a news conference in tokyo     it seems panasonic is not as optimistic about the plant as you are   so the question is why bother the big about a plant when all it is is a rough idea   to keep the sucks putting up money

broadly speaking a traditional account is better if you will be in a lower tax bracket in retirement see for instance here   when you put the money in now you pay no taxes on it at your current high rate when you take it out you will pay taxes at your future low rate   you push the taxes onto your future lower rate self this is assuming you can deduct the contribution on the traditional ira   if you ca n't e.g. because you have an employer sponsored plan and make too much money the traditional ira does n't really gain you anything see here that is the basic story but there are some other differences to consider as well   for instance if your income is too high you can not contribute to a roth at all   also with a traditional ira you 're required to start taking money out at a certain age whereas with a roth you never have to this can make a difference if you have other retirement income and want to leave the money in the roth e.g. to pass on to your heirs without having to pay an intermediate tax at withdrawal on a more speculative level there is the possibility that tax rates may change between now and your retirement some people try to hedge against this possibility by strategically allocating their retirement assets based on whether they think tax rates will rise or fall

so some time goes by and people start catching onto this system of credit worthiness and farmers and fishermen and so on start to realize that they can get better value for their ious by demonstrating credibility people with reputations or dubious prospects may not be able to issue money or might only be able to do so at very high interest e.g. a new farmer with no track record might have to promise me twice as many potatoes in exchange for a deer due to the risk that i might never see any potatoes at all    this obviously gets very messy fast as different and potato certificates have different values depending on whether they were issued by bob or jane and everyone has to keep track of and evaluate whose future apples are worth what    some enterprising person maybe the merchant who runs the trading post comes up with the idea to just issue one note for all the farms in town he calls a meeting with all the farmers and proposes to have the town priest keep a book of certificates and so on and the farmers will get notes just like everyone else in exchange for the crops they contribute to the pool and the merchant will keep a cut of the crops with which to hire some accountants and farm to estimate the total crop yields across town and so on    everyone agrees or at least enough farmers agree to kind of force the other ones to get on board if they want to participate meaningfully in the town economy and we now have something like a central bank issuing something like fiat currency that is currency whose value is decided by some central authority as opposed to the kind of straight up exchange certificates that can be traded for an actual apple from the issuer for example   now we have something that looks a lot like a modern monetary system the town can set up audit committees or whatever but the idea is that there is some central authority basically tasked with issuing money and regulating the supply of that money according to the estimated size of ongoing and future economic activity future crop yields    if they issue too much money we get inflation where more apple certificates are issued than apples grown and each apple note ends up being worth only three quarters of an apple come harvest time if they issue too little currency economic activity is needlessly restricted the farmers are not able to hire enough workers to maximize crop yields and so on the hunter starts hunting less because his deer meat is going bad since nobody has money to buy it and so on    at this point you may be asking why the hell go through all this complexity just to trade apples for deer and shoes is n't this more trouble than it 's worth    the answer is because this is a vastly more efficient system than pure barter i as a hunter no longer need to trade a physical deer for a bushel of apples to carry over to the shoemaker in order to get shoes you as an apple farmer can hire workers before the crop is harvested and therefore can grow more and your workers can eat year round instead of just getting a huge pile of apples at harvest time to try and trade for for whatever they will need for the rest of the year    so back to money   the thing to remember is that all throughout from the initial trade to this central banking system all of this money is it is ious except instead of being an iou that says will give one bushel of apples to the bearer of this bond in october it says anyone in town will give you anything worth one bushel of apples in trade   the money is not an actual thing that you can eat or wear or build a house with it 's an iou that is redeemable anywhere for anything from anyone it is a promise to pay equivalent value at some time in the future except the holder of the money can call on anybody at all to fulfill that they do n't have to go back to the original    this is where it starts getting interesting and where we can start to answer your question   for the sake of simplicity let 's stop calling these notes apple certificates and pretend that the village has decided to call them loddars    so now you 're still growing apples but instead of trading them for deer and shoes you trade them for loddars so far so good    once again you want some meat except harvest time has n't come yet so you do n't have any loddars to buy meat with you call me up cellphones have been invented in this newly efficient economy hey otherwiseyep any chance you could kill me a deer and i 'll give you ten loddars for it at harvest time   i say jeez i 'd love to but i really need all the cash i can get for every deer right now my kid is out growing shoes like crazy tell you what if you can write me a promise to pay twelve loddars in october i can give that to the shoe maker you about the interest rate but agree    did a lightbulb just go off you and i have once again created money*. twelve loddars now exist in the town economy that have not been printed by the central bank counting all the money trading hands in the village there are now a all the loddars that have ever been printed plus b twelve more that you have promised to produce    this is important to understand i just spent money on shoes which you spent on deer meat that has never been it 's obviously not any of the banknotes that have already been issued but it 's definitely real money because i traded it for new shoes and you traded it for a dead deer    once you and i and others start to catch on that this is possible that we can spend money that we do n't have and that has n't even been printed yet it is entirely possible for a situation to arise where the total amount of money changing hand in the village vastly exceeds the number of loddars that have actually been printed and this can happen without fraud or inflation or anything like that and can be perfectly legitimate    now what happens if another wildfire hits your orchard those twelve loddars are destroyed they are gone the shoe maker is twelve loddars poorer without spending it and without anyone else getting twelve loddars richer    the money that bought your deer and my shoes has simply vanished from the economy as though it never existed despite the fact that it bought stuff with genuine economic utility and value

the economic utility of markets results from price discovery and the corresponding capital allocation information which changes the material value of a business can come to light be processed by sentient beings capable of rational thought and conveyed to the market in the form of a price in an hour that ca n't happen in a millisecond   and do n't try to argue about liquidity because hft liquidity evaporates in milliseconds in adverse conditions i.e. when liquidity matters

they will credit your account and it will be applied to future purchases if the credit card is not used for several months they will send you a check or transfer it to your bank account some people on this site have actually considered sending money to the credit card company in advance so that the amount that can be charged is temporarily inflated keep in mind they will eventually refund the money plus you will not earn interest on the refund

i 'm going out on a limb and calling bullshit   here 's a fact reddit has never turned a profit and how will it unless you put up ads or allow many more sponsored posts a la twitter it 's very difficult to see a monetization strategy for this site heck most reddit users are offended at the very suggestion that reddit might be used gasp to make money

unless i 'm misunderstanding something you do n't need to move your assets into a new type of account to accomplish your goal of letting your money grow in a low cost vanguard index fund simply reallocate your assets within the inherited ira if the brokerage you 're in does n't meet your needs high transaction fees no access to the vanguard funds you 're interested in you can always move to a low cost brokerage the new brokerage can help you transfer your assets so that the inherited ira remains intact you will not have a tax burden if you do this and you 'll be able to feel good about your diversification with a low cost index fund you will however have to pay taxes on your rmd since you 're young i ca n't imagine that your rmd will be greater than the $ 5k you can invest in a roth ira if it is you can open a personal account and keep letting the the money grow

you can not withdraw funds from a 401(k while still employed with your company to access your contributions that would be treated as a loan against the 401(k in which case you 'd pay an upfront fee and then have to repay the amount loaned plus interest over a set period of time in essence you are paying back yourself typically there is also a minimum amount you must take out as a loan should you leave the job and still have an outstanding loan against your 401(k it will be treated as a withdrawal after a certain date at which point a 10 penalty plus taxes applies unless you pay back the full amount of the loan remaining before that certain date your friends should seriously consider contributing the minimum amount necessary to get that full 50 matching amount it 's free money as you said it 's like leaving money on the table
