a re financing or re fi is when a debtor takes out a new loan for the express purpose of paying off an old one this can be done for several reasons usually the primary reason is that the terms of the new loan will result in a lower monthly payment debt consolidation taking out one big loan at a relatively low interest rate to pay off the smaller higher interest loans that rack up like credit card debt medical bills etc is a form of refinancing but you most commonly hear the term when referring to refinancing a home mortgage as in your example to answer your questions most of the money comes from a new bank that bank understands up front that this is a re fi and not new debt the homeowner is n't asking for any additional money but instead the money they get will pay off outstanding debt therefore the net amount of outstanding debt remains roughly equal even then a re fi can be difficult for a homeowner to get at least on terms he 'd be willing to take first off if the homeowner owes more than the home 's worth a re fi may not cover the full principal of the existing loan the bank may reject the homeowner outright as not creditworthy a new house is a huge ding on your credit score trust me or the market and the homeowner 's credit may prevent the bank offering loan terms that are worth it to the homeowner the homeowner must often pony up cash up front for the closing costs of this new mortgage which is money the homeowner hopes to recoup in reduced interest however the homeowner may not recover all the closing costs for many years or ever to answer the question of why a bank would do this there are several reasons the bank offering the re fi is usually not the bank getting payments for the current mortgage this new bank wants to take your business away from your current bank and receive the substantial amount of interest involved over the remaining life of the loan if you 've ever seen a mortgage summary statement the interest paid over the life of a 30-year loan can easily equal the principal and often it 's more like twice or three times the original amount borrowed that 's attractive to rival banks   it 's in your current bank 's best interest to try to keep your business if they know you are shopping for a re fi even if that means offering you better terms on your existing loan often the bank is itself on the hook to its own investors for the money they lent you and if you pay off early without any penalty they no longer have your interest payments to cover their own and they usually ca n't pay off early bonds which are shares of corporate debt do n't really work that way the better option is to keep those scheduled payments coming to them even if they lose a little off the top often if a homeowner is working with their current bank for a lower payment no new loan is created but the terms of the current loan are this is called a loan modification especially when the government is requiring the bank to sit down at the bargaining table or in some cases a streamlining if the bank and borrower are meeting in more circumstances without the government forcing either one to be there historically the idea of giving a homeowner a break on their contractual obligations would be comical to the bank in recent times though the threat of foreclosure the bank 's primary weapon does n't have the same teeth it used to someone facing 30 years of budget busting payments on a house that will never again be worth what he paid for it would look at foreclosure and even bankruptcy as the better option as it 's theoretically all over and done with in only 7 10 years with the government having a vested interest in keeping people in their homes making whatever payments they can to keep some measure of confidence in the entire financial system loan modifications have become much more common and the banks are usually as they 've found very quickly that they 're not getting anywhere near the purchase price for these toxic assets sometimes a re fi actually results in a higher apr but it 's still a better deal for the homeowner because the loan does n't have other associated costs lumped in such as mortgage insurance money the guarantor wants in return for underwriting the loan which is in turn required by the fdic to protect the bank in case you default the homeowner pays less the bank gets more everyone 's happy including the guarantor they do n't really want to be underwriting a loan that requires pmi in the first place as it 's a significant risk the u.s. government is spending a lot of money and putting a lot of pressure on fdic insured institutions including virtually all mortgage lenders to cut the average joe a break banks get tax breaks when they do loan modifications the fed 's buying at risk bond packages backed by distressed mortgages and where the homeowner has n't walked away completely they 're negotiating mortgage mods directly all of this can result in the homeowner facing a lienholder that is willing to work with them if they 've held up their end of the contract to date

since there was no sale where does the money actually come from from the refinancing bank it 's a new loan how does a bank profit from this i.e. why would they willingly help someone lower their mortgage payments because they sell a new loan big banks usually sell the mortgage loans to the institutional investors and only service them so by creating a new loan they create another product they can sell the one they previously sold already brought them profits and they do n't care about it the investors wo n't get the interest they could have gotten had the loan been held the whole term but they spread the investments so that each refi does n't affect them significantly credit unions usually do n't sell their mortgages but they actually do have the interest to help you reduce your payments you 're their shareholder in any case the bank that does n't sell the mortgages can continue making profits because with the money released the paid off loan they can service another borrower

you owe $ 20,000 to a 1 per week interest   i 'm happy to get 1 per month and trust you to pay it back so i lend you the $ 20,000   the first lender got his money and now you are paying less interest as you pay the loan back this is how a refi works only the first bank wo n't try to break the legs of the second bank for moving into their business   this line reinvested the money into the mortgage to lower his monthly payments implies he also paid it down a bit the new mortgage is less principal than the one before

you ca n't directly contribute more however it seems that there is something you can do that can achieve a similar effect you can withdraw your entire account principal + earnings though in your case that 's less than the principal and then contribute up to the $ 5500 contribution limit again the end result is that you put in a net amount of $ 500 and the account ends up with $ 5500 which is what you want the first step is a return of contributions made for the contribution year before the tax filing deadline for that year this kind of withdrawal is not subject to tax and counts as if you never made the contribution at all since you are considered to have never made a contribution you still have $ 5500 that you can contribute before you hit the limit

generally when you open a new account you 'd be given a checkbook usually starter checks with no personal information but some banks will later mail you a proper checkbook with your personal details and a debit card again some banks will give you a starter one on the spot with a personalized following up in the mail others will mail you with the debit card you can use your bank 's atm to withdraw cash from your account or use it for purchases will debit as the name says directly from your account you can also use it in other atms but that will usually be with significant fees $ per withdrawal to both the atm owner and your bank checks you can write a check to someone or use the check to go to the cashier in the bank and withdraw money although usually they have special withdrawal slips for that in the branches so you do n't really need to waste your own checks as to how to deposit money in your home country you 'll have to check with the bank you have an account at back at home usually you can wire transfer money from your boa account to the account back home but that is usually comes at a fee of about $ per transfer in the us additional fees may be charged at the receiving end + currency conversion costs you can also write yourself a check and deposit that check at the home country bank but that depends on the specific bank whether it is possible how much it would cost and how long it would take for them to credit the money to your account after they take your check may take weeks with personal checks

a value of zero or a negative value makes the percent change meaningless saying 100 when going from 0 to some other value is simply wrong i have seen a similar situation several times when looking at a public company with a loss last quarter on google finance or some other service the pe ratio will be blank n a or something like that if the company does not currently have earnings then the pe ratio is meaningless likewise if the company previously did not have earnings then the percent change of the earnings is meaningless also consider the example where the previous value was negative if the previous value was negative 1 and the current value is positive 99 then this happens a negative change but the value went up obviously that value does not make sense and should not be shown

in an attempt to express this complicated fact in lay terms i shall focus exclusively on the most influential factor effecting the seemingly bizarre outcome you have noted where the price chart of vix etfs indicates upwards of a 99 decrease since inception other factors include transaction costs and management fees   some vix etfs also provide leveraged returns describing themselves as two times vix or three times vix etc regarding the claim that volatility averages out over time this is supported by your own chart of the spot vix index edit it should be noted that almost nobody holds vix etfs for anything more than a day or two   this will the effects described above   typical daily volumes of vix etfs are in excess of 100 of shares outstanding   in very volatile markets daily volumes will often exceed 400 of shares outstanding indicating an overwhelming amount of day trading

the other answers are good i would just like to add certain points taking this question together with the previous ones you have asked here how can a person measure how much to spend on food car bills or rent    from his salary is there a formula to keep in check basically it may well be that your best option would be to move to a smaller apartment or worse location to bring down rent possibly forget about your own study in the worst case sell the car and use public transportation eat as many meals as possible at home bring boxed lunch from home to work if this applies etc whatever makes a saving and sense to you regarding food this is the point where it is usually possible to save a very significant amount if you are prepared to make food at home unless you are already doing it look around for articles such as living on 20 pounds a week or so maybe they will give you ideas you can use eg how to eat on 10 pounds a week shopping list and recipes where you are shopping is crucial here as similar items can differ in price significantly between different chains if the electricity bill is significant and you are at home a lot you could try to bring it down by changing all bulbs in your home to led ones unless it has already been done yes they can cost 2 3 more than eg ones but they use 5 10x less electricity forget credit cards if possible use debit cards so you know the money you spend does not get you into more debt one question you asked here was about exchange rates if you work with different currencies a lot there are several companies such as revolut or which offer accounts with debit cards that use near fx rates in my i could save around 10 15 on currency conversion eur gbp using revolut compared to my local bank rate for example i find myself looking at my account every single day and get    and sad because almost whenever the money pay comes in i freak out    that after everything there is nothing for us to enjoy or save well yes that is nearly the definition of too much debt the point about going to the extremes of reducing expenses i outlined above is that the more you can reduce your expenses while struggling with debt the faster you 'll get out of it it might be hard to adapt but it will be better if you can calculate how long it will take to get you back on feet and know that eg in 6 months i can start to think of savings and carefully upgrading my lifestyle back   in turn the smaller the reduction of expenses the more prolonged the process you might be looking at 2 3 years of insecure constantly frustrating risking more debt lifestyle instead of 6 months of severely reduced one alternatively if things go too bleak you might consider declaring bankrupcy although i am not sure how feasible it is in the uk

if someone gains access to these data he could use social engineering approach to you i.e. call the american express and ask tell he he is you and he lost the access to the account and he needs the access to be reset and sent to certain email and if they doubt it 's you he would send them the statement data even on company letterhead which he would be able to fake since he has the data from the statements and ae has no idea how the authentic letterhead looks like he could also do the opposite trick like calling your assistant or even yourself and saying something like i 'm from american express calling about the transaction at this and this date and this and this time this amount please confirm you are your name and your address is your address i need to confirm something which would make it appear as he is really from ae since he knows all these details and then ask you some detail he 's missing for security like your birth date or last digits of or anything like that and then use these details to you to ae   so putting all this info together where it can be accessed by strangers does have risks it may not work out if both you and ae personnel are vigilant and follow instructions to the letter but we know it not always so

the fundamental issue with leverage of any sort really is that the amplified downsides are extremely likely to more than cancel out amplified equivalent upsides example without using a major swing 2x leverage on a 5 decline so a 10 decline   the 5 decline needs a increase to get back level   however the 2x leverage needs an increase to get back   so a cycle for the unleveraged returns of -5 + 5.4 would see the unleveraged asset go up by a net + but 2x leverage would leave you at   conversely imagine leverage it 's easy to do that 50 cash allocation after an underlying -5 the leverage needs only + to reach par   this is basically the argument for low volatility funds of course if you can leverage an asset that does n't go down then the leverage is great   and for an asset with an overall positive compound return a little leverage is probably not going to hurt simply because there are likely to be enough upsides to cancel out downsides

the true answer is it depends because   it is up to the credit card issuer to follow the right path when issuing a replacement credit card typically issuers will transfer the account history to the new trade line says barry the consumer operations manager at fico the creator of the fico scoring formula the new account should have the old open date so you should retain your payment history he says the credit limit and balance should also stay the same how issuers report replacement cards we asked the major card issuers how they report replacement cards to credit reporting agencies american express the new card has the same open date and member since year as the previous card the balance on the old account number is transferred to the new account number all payment history transfers over bank of america all transactions and account history are transferred to the new account number when there is a card replacement or renewal capital one the new account number with all the original account data original open date etc is reported along with a notification to the bureaus that the new account number is replacing the old   the two can then be into one so that all the applicable payment history balance etc is now under the new account number chase the original does not change the history on the account remains just the account number field is updated with the new account number there is no new in this scenario

yeah well and corporations used to only be chartered by states for the express purpose of fulfilling some public function on the order of building a bridge etc   now anybody at all gets the limited liability advantages of a corporation without any of the corresponding duty to serve the public good   now i 'm sure the overall fix that will be floated will be the government basically dismantling capitalism and principles enjoyed by all private businesses instead of just going back and fixing what was handed to corporations in the first place

in the uk do n't specify anything more than records which leads me to think that a digital copy might be acceptable with regards to bank statements individuals i.e. not self employed or owning a business need to keep them for between 12 and 15 months after your tax return depending on when you filed it source record keeping individuals and directors

as you know the market is in turmoil today at this moment am the s&p is down 2.3 45 points but it was down 100 points   now i heard jim cramer say today is not the day to use market orders yes on mad money he seems a bit eccentric but he does offer some wise advice at times   in my opinion your stock had some people that did just that a market order and regardless of the fundamentals of this company buyers had no orders to buy except a couple wise guys in both senses that put in buys at crazy prices and they filled with an apple trading around $ 100 the book probably has millions of shares on order with a buy at $ 80 or higher just an example i 'd bet there were a number of stocks that had the profile of yours i.e. a chart reflecting trades similar to a flash crash there are some traders smiling ear to ear and some crying in their beer      note i use the phrase in my opinion this is the only explanation i can imagine occam 's razor

i 've been short the euro for several months now against the usd could be various others as well i got in at sold on a bounce up to 1.36 bought back at and now will probably ride it out lower    regardless of whether or not the eurozone breaks up i see it breaking through the 1.30 mark in the near term after that i 'm not sure how low it goes but there is certainly potential for it to head towards in order to reduce the burden the ecb needs to devalue the currency    although germany really does n't want this due to their anti inflationary ideology if italy comes crashing down so does france when france goes germany goes into a deep recession if not a depression they have to devalue some   as for a collapse i have no idea it probably depends on how many if any countries retain the currency and who they are

now what if i were to spend the entire $ 2,000 limit on a single purchase i 've been saving up in anticipation of this purchase and therefore have the money already set aside in the bank so i could pay off the entire $ 2k immediately there is no problem with doing this   there 's a bit of a time delay in credit reporting so if you pay immediately in the middle of your statement period it will never even be reported that your card was maxed out    make the purchase some time in the middle of the billing period then log in to your account and pay the total before the statement period closes   if you let it roll to the next statement period it will be reported that your account is maxed out and possibly you will be charged interest and potentially a fee for exceeding your limit   your utilization is only calculated in a snapshot there is no history kept   even if you let your card be reported at 100 utilization you could pay the balance that month with 0 then reported and your score will bounce back as though nothing ever happened separately if you have had this card for a long while you may want to request a credit line increase

there could be an impact on facebook because just before the ipo morgan stanley apparently sent information to selected clients that their analysts had just lowered their valuation of the company   there were also reports yesterday that the lowered valuation came about because facebook sent some revised preliminary estimates of second quarter earnings showing lower than expected earnings to morgan stanley and least one talking head said that facebook might also face charges depending on what the cover letters and the e mails back and forth between facebook and morgan stanley said investigations have already been opened   yes a company wants to sell the stock being offered at the ipo at the highest price possible but if it misled the public when offering the stock for sale through its underwriters it can also be liable possibly even criminally liable material added in edit in fact a lawsuit has already been filed   in the us district court in manhattan in this matter whether the sec ever does anything about the matter remains to be seen

i wrote this in another thread but is also applicable here in general people make some key mistakes with property not factoring in depreciation properly houses are perpetually falling down and if you are renting them perpetually being trashed by the tenants as well particularly in bad areas accurate depreciation costs can often run in the 5 20 range per year depending on the property area add insurance to this as well or be prepared to lose the whole thing in a disaster related to 1 they take the index price of house price rises as something they can achieve when in reality a lot of the house price rise is just everyone having to spend a lot of money keeping them standing up no investor can actually track a house price graph due to 1 so be careful to make reasonable assumptions about actual achievable future growth in your example they could well be lagging inflation barely growing if you are not pricing in upkeep and depreciation properly failure to price in the huge transaction costs often per sale and capital gains other taxes depends on the exact tax structure where you are these add up very fast if you are buying and selling at all frequently costs in either time or fees to real estate rental agents having to fill check evict fix and maintain rental properties is a lot more work than most people realise and you either have to pay this in your own time or someone else ’s again has to be factored in liquidity issues selling houses in down markets is very very hard they are not like stocks where they can be moved quickly houses can often sit on the market for years before sale if you are not prepared to take low prices as the bank owns your house if you fail to pay the mortgage rents collapse loss of job etc they can force you to fire sale it leaving you in a whole world of pain depending on the exact legal system negative equity etc these factors are generally correlated if you work in the same cities you are buying in so quite a lot of potential long tail risk if the regional economy collapses finally if you ’re young they can tie you to areas where your earnings potential is limited renting can be immensely beneficial early on in a career as it gives you huge freedom to up sticks and leave fast when new opportunities arise locking yourself into 20 contracts landlord activities when young can be hugely inhibiting to your earnings potential without more details on the exact legal framework area house type etc it ’s hard to give more specific advise but in general you need a very large margin of safety with property due to all of the above so if the numbers you ’re running are coming out close and they are here it ’s probably not worth it and you ’re better of sticking with more hands off investments like stocks and bonds

i 'd recommend an online fx broker like xe trade at xe.com   there are no fees charged by xe other than the spread on the fx conversion itself which you 'll pay anywhere they have payment clearing facilities in several countries including uk bacs so provided you 're dealing with a major currency it should be possible to transfer money free of wire charges at least   the fx spread will be much better than you would get from a bank since fx is their primary business the additional risk you take on is settlement risk   xe will not pay the sterling amount to your uk bank account until they have received the euro payment into their account   if xe went bankrupt before crediting your uk account but after you 've paid them your euros you could lose your money xe is backed by custom house which is a large and established canadian firm so this risk is very small indeed there are other choices out there too is another that comes to mind although xe 's rates have been the best of those i 've tried

would love to see it happen but unfortunately agree with you there is already demand for a non cable isp but telecoms have dug in for the long fight and are actively fighting these out of existence   combine this with the fact that new media still needs to get it 's content from somewhere and a ton of this content is owned by cable providers they were willing to experiment with these new media sources when they were a tiny slice of the pie but now that new media is gaining mass market appeal they want to massively overcharge for content to either a drive the companies out of business or b continue reaping their insane profits the telecoms essentially have a monopoly and are using that to prolong the existence of dying businesses   i see this playing out in one of several ways   1 the government up and either breaks up the monopolies or allows internet to become available through other means as a public utility or allowing these mom and pop isp 's to exist do n't know about the rest of the world but it will be a while before this happens in the us   2 new media providers find way to distribute and market independent content and rid themselves of at least one factor holding them back unfortunately most people do n't seem to be interested in independent content i would suspect this is largely due to these companies owning the vertical and telling you what you should watch as well   3 these companies die a long slow and painful death at the hands of piracy at which point a sane and legal way of getting content is free to exist without being out of existence

i use online banking as much as possible and i think it may help you get closer to your goal   i see you want to know where the money goes and save time so it should work for you like it did for me i used to charge everything or write checks and then pay a big visa bill   my problem was i never knew exactly how much i spent because neither visa or check writing are record systems they just generate transactions records   i made it a goal use online banking to match my spending to the available cash and ended up ok usually 9 10 months out of the year i started with direct deposit of my paycheck   each saturday i sit down and within a half hour i 've paid the bills for the week and know where i stand for the following week   any new bill that comes in i add it to online banking even if it 's not a recurring expense   i also pull down cash from the atm but just enough to allow me to do what i have to do   if it 's more than $ 30 or $ 40 bucks i use the debit card so that expense goes right to the online bank statement my monthly bank statement gives me a single report with everything listed   mortgage utilities car payment cable bill phone bill insurance newspaper etc   it does not record these transactions in generic categories they actually say verizon or comcast or shop rite   i found this serves as the only report i need to see what 's happening with my budget    it may take a while to change to a plan like this one but you 'll now have a system that shows you in a single place where the money goes   move all bills that are auto pay to the online system and watch your visa bill go down   the invested time is likely what you 're doing now writing checks   hope this helps

does that mean that 30 of my monthly payment goes to interest no it 's much worse then that the apr is the annual percentage rate an apr of 30 on $ 23,000 in debt that means you 'll be charged $ in interest for the year you 'll actually owe slightly less since you are reducing your principal slightly over the course of the year if your monthly payment is $ 800 $ 575 of that will be going to interest that means that over 70 of your monthly payment is going just to interest this deal makes no sense at all you 'd be better off simply transferring all of your balances on to the credit card with the highest interest rate you 'd be paying almost $ 200 a month for the convenience of writing one check rather than three

a few thoughts you said   to me it makes sense that if he accidentally put his own money in when he was n't supposed to he could just take it out and pay the tax on it and be fine in this case he would be putting his own after tax money in and would n't be able to deduct it so the act of putting it in and taking it back out in the same tax year would be as if the transaction never occurred at all he would not have to pay the tax on it as for this question is there any penalty to his employer if they contribute to an hsa on his behalf knowing that he is not eligible and that the money will be an excess contribution it 's good that your son is prepared to treat it as regular income and pay the appropriate taxes however the employer should be the one doing that they should be treating it as regular income and taking out fica and paying their end of fica too if they are n't doing that technically they are breaking the law the employer really should n't be making the contributions at all and if they ever bothered to correct this this article suggests that the employer may be legally allowed to drain the hsa account and take their money back out of it but only for the same tax year apparently they can do this without your son 's consent if that 's true it may make sense to withdraw all money from that account immediately as soon as the money arrives since they can not take the money back if it is no longer there once the money leaves the hsa account the employer has no choice but to change it to income and if they do n't your son must declare it as such which it sounds like he is prepared to do this does n't really answer your question of whether or not the employer can be i would assume yes but not too badly the worst case scenario for them would probably be just having to pay all the back fica on those funds if they are n't doing so already maybe an interest penalty as well all that being said i 'd recommend talking to an accountant the most important thing you want to be sure of is that your son can not possibly be liable for any wrongdoing particularly i would get confirmation on pulling money out of the hsa that you know should n't be there in the first place just to make sure there is no possible way to get dinged for that

no matter what you owe taxes on the gains known as capital gains how much depends on how long you invested it for in your example each month is treated separately each month you contribute starts a new clock on that set of investments if you hold it for longer than a year the taxes are treated as long term and less than a year is short term short term taxes are at your marginal rate and long term taxes are different usually 15

you might convert all your money in local currency but you need take care of following tips while studying abroad here are some money tips that can be useful during a trip abroad know about fees when you use a debit card or credit card in a foreign country there are generally two types of transaction fees that may apply understand exchange rates the exchange rate lets you know the amount of nearby money you can get for each u.s. dollar missing any expenses there are sell rates for individuals who are trading u.s. dollars for foreign currency and the other way around purchase rates it 's a smart thought to recognize what the neighborhood money is worth in dollars so you can comprehend the estimation of your buys abroad   sites like x rates offer a currency converter that gives the current exchange rate so you can make speedy comparisons you can utilize it to get a feel for how much certain amount say $ 1 $ 10 $ 25 $ 50 $ 100 are worth in local currency remember that rates fluctuate so you will be unable to suspect precisely the amount of a buy made in a foreign currency will cost you in u.s. dollars to get cash check for buddy banks if you already have an account with a large bank or credit union in the u.s. you may have an advantage   being a client of a big financial institution with a large atm system may make it easier to find a subsidiary cash machine and stay away from an out of system charge   bank of america for example is a part of the global atm alliance which lets clients of taking an interest banks use their debit cards to withdraw money at any alliance atm without paying the machine 's operator an access fee in spite of the fact that you may at present be charged for converting dollars into local currency used for purchases   citibank is another well known bank for travelers because it has 45,000 atms in more than 30 countries including popular study abroad destinations such as the u.k. italy and spain atms in a foreign country may allow withdrawals just from a financial records and not from savings so make sure to keep an adequate checking balance also atm withdrawal limits will apply just as they do in the u.s. but the amount may vary based on the local currency and exchange rates weigh the benefits of other banks for general needs online banks and even foreign banks can also be good options   with online banks you do n’t have to visit physical branches and these institutions typically have lower fees use our checking account tool to find one that ’s a good fit foreign many american debit cards may not work in europe asia and latin america especially those that do n’t have an emv chip that help prevent fraud or some cards may work at one atm but not another one option for students who expect a more extended stay in a foreign country is to open a new account at a local bank this will let you have better access to atms and to make purchases more easily and without as many fees see our chart below for the names of the largest banks in several countries guard against fraud and identity one of the most important things you can do as you plan your trip is to let your bank know that you ’ll be abroad include exact countries and dates when possible to avoid having your card flagged for fraud unfortunately incidents may still arise despite providing ample warning to your bank bring a backup credit card or debit card so you can still access some sort of money in case one is canceled are also critical not just for traveling from place to place but also as identification to open a bank account and for everyday purposes you ’ll want to make two and give one to a friend or family member to keep at home and put the other in a separate secure location just in case your actual passport is lost or stolen

it makes no sense to spend money unnecessarily just for the purpose of improving your credit score   you have to stop and ask yourself the question why do i need a good credit score   most of the time the answer will be so i can get a lower interest rate on abc loan in the future   however if you spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars in the present just so that you can save a few points on a loan you 're not going to come out ahead the car question should be considered strictly in the context of transportation expenses   it cost me $ x to get around last year using lyft if instead i owned a car it would have cost me $ y for gas insurance depreciation parking etc   if you come out ahead and y < x then buy the car   do n't jump into an expensive vehicle which is never a good investment or get trapped into an expensive lease which will costs you many times more than the depreciation value of a decent used car just so that you can save a few points on a mortgage your best option moving forward would be to pay off your student loans first getting rid of that interest expense   place the remainder in savings then start to look at a budget   setting aside a 20 down payment on a home is considered the minimum to many people and if that is out of reach you might need to consider other neighborhoods less than 400 k   if you 're still concerned about your credit score a good way to build that up once you have a budget and spending under control is to get a credit card with no annual fees   start putting all of your expenses on the credit card groceries etc and paying off the balance in full every month   by spending only what you need to within a reasonable budget and making payments on time and in full your credit rating will begin to gradually improve   if you have a difficult time tracking your expenses or sticking to a budget then there is potential for danger here as credit cards are notorious for high interest and penalties   but by keeping it under control and putting the rest toward savings you can begin to build wealth and put yourself in a much better financial position moving into the future

good post just to note to self to add my comments this weekend   a couple thoughts that came to mind sorry was working on an idea this weekend   when comparing companies reviewing accounting policies in detail for any substantive differences a notable example would be telecom companies who expense wireless subsidies vs. capitalizing them obviously makes a large difference in a ebitda based i always approach a company from a perspective hidden assets or otherwise many businesses have various segments which if they can be reliably broken off provide good insight into underlying op performance if appropriate i.e. will never be reinvested tax adjusting cash balances that are offshore cyclical industries always compare on a mid cycle basis dynamic schedules i.e. at various prices for instruments and proceeds thereof for most large caps this is not relevant but for certain industries it is much more popular e.g. resource tech

i 'm surprised no one has picked up on this but the student loan is an exception to the rule it 's inflation bound for now you only have to pay it back as a percentage of your salary if you earn over £ 15k 11 on any amount over that i believe you do n't have to pay it if you lose your job and it does n't affect your ability to get credit except that your repayments will be taken into account    my advice which is slightly different to the above is if you have any shares that have lost more than 10 since you bought them and are n't currently recovering sell them and pay off your debts with those the rest is down to you are they making more than 10 a year if they are do n't sell them if your dividends are covering your payments carry on as you are otherwise it 's down to you

maybe i am a bit jaded but i do n't spend a lot of time trying to convince friends or family members to avoid mlm schemes even though i personally see them as scams if they specifically ask for my advice i will walk them through the economics of the particular mlm that they are interested in i have found that if you get to pushy in showing your friends or family members that their new business is actually a fraud they tend to get defensive and it becomes counter productive to continue trying to convince them of their mistake you waste your time and anger your friend or family member it 's just not worth it there are a few key questions i like to ask people about their mlm business   what does the business do how do you make money how do they make money you would be amazed at the number of people that sign up and pay money to get into a business and they do n't even have the slightest clue what the business actually does even fewer have an idea about how they can actually make money because the entire sales presentation focuses on what they could with all of the money they are going to make why does this business need you what do you bring to the table that the business does n't already have skills contacts money most mlm 's and especially the pyramid schemes focus more on recruiting people than selling products because they make their money on over priced initiation fees and their products are mediocre at best

when you add points a break even date comes into play that date varies depending on the rate and number of points as an approximate example having one point at those rates would have a break even point of about 5 years at that time the amount you save with the lower rate makes up for the extra cash you paid for points after that you are saving money if you do n't plan on having the loan that long the points are not worth it also you need to calculate the break even date based on your own parameters i suggest searching for an online calculator or spreadsheet that supports point calculations you may also be able to deduct of your points every year ask you accountant about that

their income is from the two sources you mentioned they charge the merchants for each use and they make interest money on people who carry a balance this is one reason a lot of merchants will be willing to give you a discount if you pay cash they do n't have to give a portion to visa or mastercard    i would n't be able to speak to the relative proportions between the two income sources but when many cards are at 30 interest for balances carried and many people have tens of thousands of dollars owed on their cards the interest income is not insignificant   they 'll also charge interest immediately on cash advances a few cards also make money off of annual fees although i 'd suspect this is not very much in the full scheme of things the way to get the most out of a card is to always pay it off fully at the end of each month

you should never have to pay a fee to find out what has happened to a transaction in progress you might sometimes have to pay for duplicate copies of a statement or similar but not just to find out what is going on it sounds like you are being scammed your friend tells you they have transferred you money but they have not done anything in reality then they give you a customer care number to call and try to get you to pay them money in order to find out what has happened to the non existent transaction if you think this is plausibly what is happening for example if you google the company who is supposedly doing the transfer and find that they do not exist or that the number you have been given is not really their customer care line then you should cease all contact with your friend and pass all communications to your local law enforcement

a combination of market research and tax law would likely be the combination used to set the salary an of each taxes in canada and the us there can be differences in how payments are treated if they are salary e.g payroll taxes such as cpp social security and others may apply in this case as well as personal income tax rates or dividends which may have different treatments in some jurisdictions i believe if salary above $ 250,000 is taxed at 40 and dividends are taxed at 15 which rate would you rather pay this is hypothetical as no jurisdiction has been noted here yet most provinces and states in north america will tax the first few dollars at rather low rates and so it is n't bad to take a nominal rate of $ 1 or so in salary as usually the higher rates exist for higher salaries executive compensation has come under scrutiny in recent years though it is usually a mix of salary bonuses and stock either restricted or options market research some companies may research what other small public companies would pay executives as the salary may have to be approved by a board of directors in some cases at least this would be how i remember things being decided in small companies i worked for in washington state and the province of alberta in a lot of company cases excess earnings are stored and if there is enough of a pile then a special dividend may be given out though some corporate structures like reits force dividends to maintain their tax status note the payment in dividend here requires that the president be able to dictate what happens with the cash in the bank of a company which is n't going to be the case for the regular employee also the dividends here would go to all the shareholders and thus if there are people besides the president owning shares they would also get their portion based on what they own

no   if the share price drops to $ 0 it 's likely that the company is in bankruptcy usually debt holders especially holders of senior debt are paid first and you 're entitled to whatever the bankruptcy proceedings decide to give holders of equity after the debt holders are paid off more often than not equity holders probably wo n't get much to give an example corporate bankruptcy usually involves one of two options liquidation or reorganization in the us these are called chapter 7 and chapter 11 bankruptcy respectively canada and the united kingdom also have similar procedures for corporations although in the uk reorganization is often referred to as administration many countries have similar procedures in place i 'll use the us as an example because it 's what i 'm most familiar with in chapter 7 bankruptcy the company is liquidated to pay its debts investopedia 's article about bankruptcy states during chapter 7 bankruptcy investors are considered especially low on the ladder usually the stock of a company undergoing chapter 7 proceedings is usually worthless and investors lose the money they invested if you hold a bond you might receive a fraction of its face value what you receive depends on the amount of assets available for distribution and where your investment ranks on the priority list on the first page in chapter 11 bankruptcy the company is turned over to a trustee that guides it through a reorganization the investopedia article quotes the sec to describe what happens to stockholders when this happens during chapter 11 bankruptcy bondholders stop receiving interest and principal payments and stockholders stop receiving dividends if you are a bondholder you may receive new stock in exchange for your bonds new bonds or a combination of stock and bonds if you are a stockholder the trustee may ask you to send back your stock in exchange for shares in the reorganized company the new shares may be fewer in number and worth less the reorganization plan spells out your rights as an investor and what you can expect to receive if anything from the company the exact details will depend on the reorganization plan that 's worked out local laws court agreements etc for example in the case of general motor 's bankruptcy stockholders in the company before reorganization were left with worthless shares and were not granted shares in the new company

a balance transfer is paying one debt instrument with another   while this is typically seen in credit card offers it is n't necessarily confined to credit cards obviously the only reason to do this is refinancing debt to a lower interest rate   you need to watch for loads on the incoming money there may be an upwards of 5 fee   this calculation is materially different than your apr   monthly interest charges can be estimated by taking your apr divided by 12 times your balance   so a 15 apr will have a rough monthly interest charge of 1.25   the 5 balance transfer fee is 4x your normal interest charge   that fee is added to your balance and now you pay interest on the whole amount   you need to ensure the new rate is low enough to actually benefit you after the incoming fee

free huh from their commission and fee schedule   so if you literally bought two shares then the sec added one penny in fees and finra added one penny as a trading activity fee note that there are several other fees on their schedule that may not apply to you if you had bought 100 shares instead your total fees would have still been only 2 cents but you would have lost $ 4 on the trade   so the fees are minuscule when you start doing larger orders    however that should not discourage you from experimenting and learning   i 'd rather pay 2 cents in fees on a 4 cent loss than 2 cents in fees on a $ 400 loss   just chalk it up to the cost of experience

short answer go to the bank and ask them about your options for opening a business account talk to an attorney about the paperwork and company structure and taxes long answer you and your buddies jointly own an unincorporated business this is called a partnership yes there is paperwork involved in doing it properly and the fact that you guys are minors might complicate that paperwork a little bit in terms of what type of account to open a business account running a business through a personal account joint or otherwise is a sure way to get that account shut down your bank will want to know the structure of the business and will require documentation to support that for a partnership they will probably want a copy of the partnership agreement for an llc they 'll probably want a copy of the filing with ohio secretary of state as well as the operating agreement etc that said pop into a local bank and ask a business banker directly what you should do they deal with new businesses all the time and would probably be best qualified to help you figure out the bank account aspect of it regarding business structure this really impacts a lot more than just the type of bank account to open and how you file your taxes it is something you guys should really discuss with an attorney what happens if down the road one of you quits what happens if you want to bring in a new partner later   what if there is a disagreement about something   these are all things that the attorney can help you address ahead of time which is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper than trying to figure it out later you 're in enough that you should certainly be able to buy a couple hours of a lawyer 's time getting the formation stuff right could save all of you a lot of money and later

it depends if cost of tuition + income forgone during studying years is less than your lifelong discounted incremental cash flows you receive thanks to your education then it is not worth it   if your studies are say 150 k and you forego another 60k y during 4 years of university you will need to make roughly 39 k more per year until you retire than you otherwise would have or more for your degree to be worth it i do n't see that as very realistic scenario for 90 of the people who get degrees    obviously cheaper more expensive degrees different discount rate assumptions and different salaries before during after university are different from person to person that 's why everyone has to make their own calculation and then decide whether or not to make such a risky investment in themselves

it sounds good but perhaps they 've overlooked several things that would need to be addressed before anything like this could work well   1 if there is a leak in the overall flow such as a hft hedge fund sucking money out of the markets at an enormous rate into a tax haven such a system would just perpetuate the existing rise of the entities they still get richer without spending much in return   2 as described they have only talked about one government one nation one monetary recycling system as if nations are closed boxes they are not money flows across borders with ease nations compete to maximise the amount of assets they hold within their borders at any given time these can be fixed capital assets too so nothing prevents the global equity investment they mention from starting to resemble all the powerful corporations concentrated in a single nation over time that would represent a lot of political power concentrated in ways that are not necessarily favourable to individual sovereign national legal systems elsewhere   it is possible that this could mean that nations would compete to lower taxes to zero to attract corporations thereby risking bankrupting governments unless the income from the global equity index compensated enough at 6 it wo n't match current tax rates   the second point also means that nations can not unilaterally decide to implement this unless they have a guaranteed additional income from activities that could compensate for excessive outflow

i do n't know what the op means when he says i want to invest in health insurance from now on so that i can use the policy after i retire generally a health insurance policy covers costs incurred during the current calendar year or specific period such as july 1 of one year through june 30 of the next year and does not cover future periods indeed many policies do not guarantee renewal when the current period ends with exceptions for employer provided coverage through cobra in case employment ends so investing in a health insurance policy meaning that you pay the premiums now and the insurance company provides the policy in the distant future is   something that is new to me besides what will the policy include if someone had bought such a policy many years ago say before cat scans and were developed would the policy cover such new developments or the policy would cover only those procedures tests and medications that are available when the policy is written and the insurance premiums start to be paid the long term health of the insurance company is also of some concern   when something is offered to me with a lifetime guarantee i ask my lifetime or the device 's life time or the company 's lifetime

wells fargo wfc + amp co. has fired four foreign exchange bankers amid an investigation into that business by both the bank and regulators according to people familiar with the matter and the bank   the firings and investigation are the latest problem to hit wells fargo which has been for the past year with the fallout from its sales practices scandal this summer the bank disclosed that a review of its businesses in the wake of that scandal had also revealed problems related to improperly charging customers for certain auto insurance and mortgage products   the bank ’s issues though had mostly been confined to the retail banking business the foreign exchange investigation now shows there is also trouble in wells fargo ’s investment banking arm the issues have emerged separate from a review of business practices in the wake of the sales practices scandal according to a person familiar with the matter   a wells fargo confirmed the firings after inquiries from the wall street journal   separately the office of the comptroller of the currency earlier this week sent a confidential report to wells fargo about the auto insurance product issues that said the bank may need to refund to customers more than the $ 80 million the bank had previously cited according to a person familiar with that matter   the foreign exchange firings come just weeks after wells fargo chief sloan was during a senate banking committee hearing for the bank ’s conduct and culture such as how problems happened for many years and why more was n’t done to stop them elizabeth warren d. mass. said more had to be done at the bank in light of recent problems that have emerged and she called for mr. sloan ’s firing   mr. sloan defended the bank and its handling of problems pointing to a number of changes he has made over the past year in the operations of the retail banking business   it is n’t yet clear what issues drove the firings in wells fargo ’s foreign exchange business but the bankers involved were fired for cause according to a person familiar with the matter   the occurred as the bank is conducting an internal investigation and as federal regulators have been examining practices in the business according to a person familiar with the matter   those fired the people said were simon recently head of foreign exchange trading bob recently head of foreign exchange sales recently a regional head of foreign exchange and michael chief spot dealer   the bankers did n’t immediately respond to requests for comment or declined to comment   the prior head of the foreign exchange group smith was moved to a different role at the bank the people said ms. smith ’s linkedin profile refers to a role beginning in october leading part of wells fargo ’s financial institutions group she had held several roles in the bank ’s foreign exchange group after joining wells fargo in 1995 and led the group for the past decade   ms. smith did n’t respond to requests for comment   the bank said ms. smith accepted a new position as americas regional leader in wells fargo ’s financial institutions group she added that the bank ’s foreign exchange business will continue to serve our clients under the leadership of ben   wells fargo ’s investment banking securities and markets division known as wells fargo securities is a fraction of the size of its u.s. big bank peers its u.s. investment banking market share is just about 4 as of september according to research firm   and wells fargo ’s foreign exchange desk does n’t do as much business as other banks industry participants have said wells fargo does n’t break out financial results or metrics for that group   unlike many other big banks wells fargo ’s foreign exchange operations were n’t caught up in investigations into collusion between market participants to move foreign currency rates for their own financial benefit those investigations led to more than $ 5 billion in combined penalties at u.s. and european banks and a guilty plea to criminal charges    in regard to the retail bank problems the report sent to the bank by the occ this week said wells fargo was too slow to identify and correct problems related to auto insurance products known as collateral protection insurance a person familiar with the matter said the occ report was first reported by the new york times   the occ did acknowledge that the bank has ended the auto insurance practices changed management and restructured the group responsible for the sales   an occ spokesman declined to comment on ongoing supervisory matters   another wells fargo that the bank discontinued the product at issue   we will continue to work with regulators on the remediation and will make improvements to our auto lending business the said

this is ridiculous of course some companies do n't pay taxes each year off the top of my head nol 's net operating losses can be carried forward 20 years and will definitely reduce tax liability for that matter a loss during any year prevents paying income tax though sales property ad and other taxes may apply other companies may get capital credits green credits or other subsidies that might prevent a tax liability none of these indicate that a corporation is getting away with anything the irs is a lot better at its job than most people think   the point is you ca n't look at any individual year and make an accurate assessment of a company 's or even an individual 's tax burden it 's completely dishonest reporting   source i 'm a state tax auditor and my job is to make sure corporations pay what they are supposed to   edit additionally 2010 was the heart of the recession for a lot of companies there were a lot of corporations that took losses that year so to say that ge took in billion and paid no taxes is misleading you have to say why they paid no taxes or you 're just blowing hot air taxes are assessed on income not there is a big difference

you 're not going to like this answer   you might be able to get out of the car you probably wo n't be able to get out of the loan   option 1 sell the car privately you 'll get more in a private sale and get a private loan for the difference between the sale price and what you owe   option 2 if you go to a dealership that advertises that they will take any trade no matter how much you owe they will roll your balance less your trade in value into your new loan so for example let 's say you buy a car for and borrow $ 20,000 the dealership gives you $ 6,000 for your trade because that 's what they do that leaves $ 9,000 on your loan and you will end up borrowing $ to buy a $ 20,000 car dealerships can be surprisingly accommodating but a lot of car buyers do n't understand the terms of what they 're getting into i actually knew someone a few years ago who left a dealership with a new car and could n't tell you anything about the deal beyond her monthly payment   option 3 hang on to the car and throw every extra penny at it to get the balance down on the loan until you can get it to the point where you can sell it trade it in or refi it without putting out a big one time cash payment

both models understand that the value of a company is the sum total of all cashflows in the future discounted back to the present they vary in their definition of cash the gordon growth model uses dividends as a proxy for cashflow under the assumption that this is the only true cash received by shareholders in theory counting cash is meaningless if there 's no eventual end game where the accumulated cash is up amongst the owners the gordon model is best used to value companies that have an established reliable dividend the company should be stable and the payout ratio high will underestimate the value of firms that consistently maintain a low payout ratio and instead accumulate cash there are multiple dcf models a firm valuation measures all cash available to both equity and debt holders a traditional equity valuation measures all cash that can be claimed by shareholders while the latter seems most intuitive and pertinent to a shareholder the former is very good at showing what a company can do regardless of their choice of capital structure a small add on to a firm valuation is the concept of eva or economic value add where the return on capital all capital both debt and equity is compared to the blended cost of capital the dcf model is more flexible optimistic than the gordon in its approach to cash the approach can be applied to many types of companies at every stage in their maturity even if they do n't pay a dividend a simplistic or single stage dcf is similar to the gordon the assumption is that the company is fully mature growing at a rate perhaps just slightly above inflation forever for younger companies a multi stage dcf can be employed where you forecast fairly confident numbers for the next 3 5 years then 3 5 years beyond that the forecast is less certain but assumed to be slowing growth and a generally maturing stabilizing company and then the steady state stage is tacked on to the end you 'll want to check out professor damodaran 's website he addresses all this and so much more and has a big pile of spreadsheets freely downloadable to get you started i also highly recommend his book investment valuation it 's the bible on the topic

i agree with all that was said here but i have to add something another point i will add is stimulus while you still can at some point you can no longer take on more debt even if you wanted to if global and domestic investors think you are going to be a risky investment then they cut you off the people who argue that greece should n't be implementing austerity do n't seem to understand the situation they are in far fewer wanted to lend money to them even before they started their haircut people think the government should spend more but how are they supposed to do that if no one wants to lend more money they also criticize germany and co. for insisting on austerity what they sometimes seem to forget is that germany does n't have an infinite supply of money to bail out greece they have their own bills to pay and any politician who was dumping ever larger amounts of money into greece would be looking at being voted out or even if they let things get too bad for the german people i am being a little hyperbole here to make a point but i honestly feel it is a very real possibility in this kind of economic climate at this point there is no reason to discuss whether greece should choose to spend more money because that choice is no longer even available to them   we are not as bad off as greece right now we should spend more money but we need results we need to identify the structural problems ailing our economy and get them fixed with the money we have direct spending is n't always a great idea if it is done in a nonsensical way people defending the bike paths and other shit argue that all spending is good in a depression i am not against bike paths and roads because they can certainly create jobs and generate value to the economy but every dollar you spend on them is one dollar that ca n't be spent on the biggest problems assuming of course that kind of infrastructure is n't one of those   after spending trillions of dollars on spending our gdp is still growing at only 2 it was increasing about 3.5 every year from 2012 our jobs creation rate is still less than half the 250,000 jobs a month we created in the last 10 20 years ca n't remember the exact number we definitely need to spend differently to address the problems and get people back to work as said we need middle class jobs we particularly need those among america 's youth so they can move out of their parents houses and buy their own which could really help the housing economy and create jobs for the lower class in turn and get us out of this depression my thoughts are that we should use stimulus in new new industries such as those in high tech i intentionally stated that very broadly because we have many millenials who need to get to work   investing in different high growth industries could create jobs for people in any number of occupations but if we do n't do that while people still want to lend us money then we are going to be fucked in a few years when we are out of options and land in the same position as greece   edit let me clarify the infrastructure thing there was a town that spent millions rebuilding a sidewalk that was five years old that no one in the community wanted everyone there thought it was a nonsensical way of spending tax dollars and would have thought that money could have been better spent in another community that really needed problems resolved would n't it have made more sense to spend money somewhere where it was needed then you could have created jobs and created lasting value to an economy by fixing a structural problem that was holding the economy back why do n't our politicians realize this

keep in mind that if you choose a loan for the boat you may be required by the lender to maintain a minimum coverage of insurance during the term of the loan further some states require you to carry some level of liability insurance on your boat and some entities require liability insurance when using certain bodies of water within their jurisdiction if neither apply to you and if you could suffer the loss of the boat itself could you similarly suffer the damages caused by your boat if you lose control   let 's say you hit a much larger more expensive boat or your boat breaks free from it 's dock and damages the dock well beyond the cost of your boat are you also able to withstand these costs if not you may want to invest in minimum liability insurance if at this point you are still convinced that you are not at financial risk due to the boat i 'd strongly suggest a plan of self insurance   take the money you would normally spend on insurance and invest it in low risk investments that can be liquidated in a matter of months   if you do have a problem with the boat your risk is mitigated by the self insurance   if you do n't then you have not only saved that money but increased its value

the main difference between a mutual fund and an etf are how they are bought and sold from the investors perspective an etf is transacted on the open market this means you normally ca n't buy partial shares with your initial investment having to transact on the open market also means you pay a market price the market price is always a little bit different from the net asset value nav of the fund during market hours the etf will trade at a premium discount to the nav calculated on the previous day morningstar 's fund analysis will show a graph of the premium discount to nav for an etf with a mutual fund on the other hand your investment goes to a fund company which then grants you shares while under the hood buying the underlying investments you pay the nav price and are allowed to buy partial shares usually an etf has a lower expense ratio but if that 's equal and any initial fees commissions are equal i would prefer the mutual fund in order to buy partial shares so your initial investment will be fully invested and so you do n't have to worry about paying premium to nav

the classic definition of inflation is too much money chasing too few goods   within a tight range say 1 3 inflation is somewhat benign   there 's a nice inflation widget at the inflation calculator which helps me see that an item costing $ 1000 in 1975 would now 2010 be about $ 4000 and $ 1000 from 1984 till now just over $ 2000 i chose those two years to make a point first i am 48 i graduated college in 1984 so in my working life i 've seen the value of the dollar drop by half on the other hand it only took 9 years from 75 84 to see a similar amount of inflation occur   i 'd suggest that the 26 year period is far more acceptable than the 9 savers should be aware of their real return vs what was a result of inflation i 'm not either way but logically have to acknowledge the invisible tax of inflation i get a say 6 return pay 2 in tax but i 'm not ahead by 4 3 may be lost to inflation on the flip side my mortgage is 3.5 after taxes that 's but less than 0 after long term inflation so as a debtor i am benefiting by the effect of inflation on what i owe   interesting also to hear about deflation as we 've grown used to it in the case of electronics but little else perhaps the ipad wo n't drop in price but every year it will gain features and competitors will keep the tablet market moving yet people still buy these items   right now there 's not enough spending i 'd suggest that good financial advice aside people as a whole need to start spending to get the economy moving the return of some inflation would be a barometer of that spending starting to occur

check how long you have to hold the stock after buying it if you can sell reasonably soon and your company is reasonably stable you 're unlikely to lose and/or be taxed and/or pay enough in fees to lose more than the 30 free money they 're giving you   whether you hold it longer than the minimum time depends partly on whether you think you can better invest the money elsewhere and partly on how you feel about having both your salary and part of your investments tied to the company 's success the company would like you to double down that way in the theory that it may make you motivated but some investment would advise keeping that a relatively small part of your total investments basically for the same reasons you are always advised to diversify

generally speaking if you have significant revenue outside the us then you 're better off incorporating out of the us the us has significantly higher corporate tax rates and taxes on worldwide income not just revenue in the us setting up in an offshore country would have no corporate tax but would cost about $ 1000 a year in fees    for any non us company your us partner would need to file a form with his us personal tax which reports the company 's finances that costs about $ 1000 a year for an accountant to prepare so you still need accounting on the company even if you are not paying corporate tax   setting up the company is reasonably easy you just use a broker the bank account may be more difficult but they can help with that too   you may find that your optimal personal tax strategy and your us partner 's strategy are different for example if your partner is living overseas then they are not taxed on salary in the us but are taxed on dividends so they would prefer to take any money out of the company as salary resulting in no corporate profits you on the other hand might prefer dividends

i would n't advocate it but one reason to pay a lower interest rate is if you have $ 990 on a $ 1000 limit credit card with 6 interest and $ 5000 on a $ 15k limit card at 10 interest having $ 500 to pay in a month and putting it on the lower interest would free up a greater percentage of credit on that card and could potentially help your credit rating i believe i think having $ 1000 on 10 different credit cards w/ $ 15k limit reflects better than $ 10k on one $ 15k card regardless of interest rates personally i think that 's dumb b c having the extra credit available is an opportunity to get into trouble a lot easier

if i invest x each month where does x go an existing low yield    bond or a new bond at the current interest rate this has to be viewed in a larger context   if the fund has outflows greater than or equal to inflows then chances are there is n't any buying being done with your money as that cash is going to those selling their shares in the fund   if though inflows are greater than outflows there may be some new purchases or not   do n't forget that the new purchase could be an existing bond as the fund has to maintain the duration of being a short term intermediate term or long term bond fund though there are some exceptions like or high yield where duration is n't likely a factor does that just depend on what the fund manager is doing at the time    buying selling no it depends on the shares being created or redeemed as well as the manager 's discretion if i put y into a fund and leave it there for 50 years where does y    go when all of the bonds at the time i made the purchase mature   you 're missing that the fund may buy and sell bonds at various times as for example a long term bond fund may not have issues nearing maturity because of what part of the yield curve it is to mimic does y just get reinvested in new bonds at the interest rate at that time y gets mixed with the other money in the fund that may increase or decrease in value over time   this is part of the risk in a bond fund where nav can fluctuate versus a money market mutual fund where the nav is somewhat fixed at $ 1/share

my ups guy said that amazon and ups are basically merged at this point   their major hubs work in the same buildings   sometimes amazon does n't even touch a product it goes right into the ups system   so all amazon really needs to do is push inventory down to the existing local ups centers which really only requires some more warehouse space at an existing site   with some intelligent data mining could figure out which products to offer with same day shipping which with 1-day etc

first step is determine how much equity is in the car positive or negative then for your car payments has that been paid out of money that has already been split or is it from a pool that is still to be if the later then it is irrelevant to this discussion since it was from a joint pool if the money has already been split then adjust her half of the equity in the car by what you have been paying an make her that offer for her half of the car   i recommend showing her the calculations so as to explain how you came with what she is owed and then let her make a counter offer

yes the borrower is responsible for paying back the full amount of the loan foreclosure gives the bank possession of the property which they can and do sell any shortfall is still the borrower 's responsibility but no the bank ca n't sell the property for a dollar they have to make a reasonable effort usually the sale is done through a sheriff 's sale that is a more or less carefully supervised auction bankruptcy will wipe out the shortfall and most other debts but the downside is that most of the rest of your assets will also be sold to help pay off what you owe details of what you can keep vary from state to state if you want to go this route hire a lawyer

the retailer can sell for whatever price they like with the caveats that if they consistently sell at a loss they will go out of business and if they set the price too high they will not sell anything as you mentioned rrp is only a recommended price the manufacturer can not it at all for legal reasons having said that i used to work in retail not cars and if we discounted a certain manufacturers products and they found out about it we would find they had suddenly run out of stock when we tried to order more so manufacturers do have some control over this type of thing depending on how they want to be about it my background is in retail management but not selling cars but my understanding is the law regards rrp is the same

summary the fees used to differ but no longer do fees are the same if you have a personal account feel free to upgrade it to premier to get access to more features longer answer the two account types used to differ but that changed a few years ago maybe circa 2011 paypal wants person to person payments to be free except where they must pass along credit card charges or else they would loose their shirt but wants to charge merchants for receiving payments originally paypal required merchants to have premier or business accounts and charged fees for payments made to those account types personal accounts had significant limitations on receiving payments but did not pay fees upon receiving payments   eventually paypal the question of is this a person to person payment or a payment to a merchant for goods and services from the paypal account type so now the same account can receive both a p2p payment e.g. splitting lunch costs on which it will not pay fees and can receive a payment for goods or services e.g. from a web checkout on which it will pay fees regardless of the account type

as far as trading is concerned these forward curves are the price at which you can speculate on the future value of the commodity   basically if you want to speculate on gold you can either buy the physical and store it somewhere which may have significant costs or you can buy futures etfs typically hold futures or hold physical and store it for you   if you buy futures you will have to roll your position every month meaning you sell the current month 's futures and buy the next month 's   however these may not be trading at the same price so each time you roll your position you face a risk   if you know you want to hold gold for exactly 1 year then you can buy a 1-year future which in this case according to your graph will cost you about $ 10 more than buying the front month   the forward curve or sometimes called the futures term structure represents the prices at which gold can be bought or sold at various points in the future

no it is n't generally believed that inflation is caused by individual banks printing money   governments manage money supply through central banks which may or may not be independent of the state there are a number of theories about money supply and inflation from monetarist to keynesian and so on the quantity theory of inflation says that long term inflation is the result of money supply but short term inflation is related to events local conditions short term inflation is a symptom of economic change   it 's like a cough for a doctor   it simply indicates an underlying event when prices go up it encourages new producers to enter the market create new supply which will then act to lower prices   in this way inflation is managed by ensuring that information travels throughout the economy   if prices go up for specific goods then all things being equal supply should go up since the increase implies increasing demand   if prices go down then this implies demand has gone down and so producers will reduce supply obviously this is n't a perfect relationship   there is which can be caused by a whole bunch of market conditions from banning of short selling to of demand supply your question is n't about quantitative easing which is a state led way of increasing money supply and which could increase inflation but is hoped to increase expenditure and investment so i wo n't cover that here the important take away is that inflation is an essential price signal to investors and business people so that they can assess market cycles   without it we would end up with vast or under supply and much greater economic disruption

cash has zero value until it is transformed into something material    cash hoarders realize no improvement in their lifestyle by gaining more cash than they need    if corporations are already so flush with cash they only inflate the stock market why would further tax breaks improve anything    an inflated stock market only improves income for very few    people who need money will spend it and put it back into circulation    people will not hoard cash if they know more will show up regardless of their ability to perform    less financial pressure and less resentment of the rich for their preferential treatment would create a more positive attitude among the population and improve productivity    a happier work force is a more productive work force    people should only work part time anyway so they can have a life outside of work to enjoy their lives while they have the health to do it    your life away until you ca n't do the things you always wanted to do does not improve a person 's outlook    life according to me    was a reduction in unemployment compensation medicare and snap payments included in the study    there may be a reduction in spending on crime and addiction as well

one surprising thing in your analysis was classifying applebees as quick service restaurant do people really think like that personally i always thought applebees as a regular restaurant just one of the cheap ones the time it takes to eat at applebees vs another restaurant is really not that different unless you are talking about very expensive restaurants with multi course menus so when comparing places time is usually not a factor and it boils down to quality and price   applebees suck at quality and their price is n't really that different from other bar restaurants in our area

there 's absolutely nothing wrong with unskilled labor   but walmart is such a large part of the us economy that an increase in their wage base would definitely have an impact on inflation so that any broad based increase they gave would likely have a marginal impact on quality of life   it would also make their items more expensive two times over one because it would cause inflation that other employers have been raising wages to keep pace with and the more direct route of increased costs     whatever you pay unskilled labor the market will simply raise prices to a level where unskilled labor still have a tough time affording a comfortable lifestyle   look at australia as an example of what happens when you raise the minimum wage too high

first thing to do when you notice a credit card fraud is to call the respective banks who issues the credit card and most banks immediately as far as my experience goes twice they will cancel the credit card and issue a new card with different number your credit card account will remain the same no effect on credit score as the account is still active its just the credit card number is changed if you are more concerned about identity theft there are two further options you can pursue place a fraud alert ask 1 of the 3 credit reporting companies to put    a fraud alert on your credit report they must tell the other 2    companies an initial fraud alert can make it harder for an identity    thief to open more accounts in your name the alert lasts 90 days but    you can renew it as per federal trade commission credit freeze if you ’re concerned about identity theft those reported mega data breaches or someone gaining access to your credit    report without your permission you might consider placing a credit    freeze on your report as per federal trade commission

new york city is high cost of living and i have absolutely no clue why people live there   it 's a tough place and the taxes are oppressive   people buy a studio apartment for $ 150,000 that has 175 square feet that 's not a typo plus a $ maintenance fee that continues after the mortgage is paid off   and that 's just what the fee is now our rental house which used to be our primary residence at 1,300 square feet has a 15-year mortgage payment of about $ 800 and $ 1,000 per year in property taxes   and my area is n't particularly low cost of living high cost of living is just that   more money flies out the door just for the privilege of living there   you make good investments with real estate by buying property at a good price in a good location   those deals are everywhere but in high col locations you 're probably more susceptible to price fluctuations which will trap you in your property if your mortgage goes underwater anyway that 's a long way of saying that i do n't buy your recommendation to get property in high col areas   there are desirable low col places to live too

this is copying my own answer to another question but this is definitely relevant for you a bid is an offer to buy something on an order book so for example you may post an offer to buy one share at $ 5 an ask is an offer to sell something on an order book at a set price for example you may post an offer to sell shares at $ 6 a trade happens when there are bids asks that overlap each other or are at the same price so there is always a spread of at least one of the smallest currency unit the exchange allows betting that the price of an asset will go down traditionally by borrowing some of that asset and then selling it hoping to buy it back at a lower price and pocket the difference minus interest going long as you may have guessed is the opposite of going short instead of betting that the price will go down you buy shares in the hope that the price will go up so let 's say as per your example you borrow 100 shares of company x expecting the price of them to go down you take your shares to the market and sell them you make a market sell order a market ask this matches against a bid and you receive a price of $ 5 per share now let 's pretend that you change your mind and you think the price is going to go up you instantly regret your decision in order to pay back the shares you now need to buy back your shares as $ 6 which is the price off the ask offers on the order book similarly the same is true in the reverse if you are going long because of this spread you have lost money you sold at a low price and bought at a high price meaning it costs you more money to repay your borrowed shares so when you are shorting you need the spread to be as tight as possible

well that 's the clever part of it   if you only dole out effective surpluses to those who have squandered a bunch of energy then you 've incentivized a certain lifestyle and robbed people who do n't live that lifestyle to finance it   it 's what we 've been doing for 40 years give or take with consumer goods   they keep getting cheaper and higher quality so if you 're not budgeting a healthy portion of your annual income on consumer goods then you 're missing out on the effective surplus   that incentivizes participation in the mass production consumer culture   which in turn keeps the wheels of the economy turning and keeps all the little worker bees in line   if you just handed people more money they might get crazy ideas like starting their own businesses organizing labor unions running for political office taking a day off work to go vote or attend council meetings and generally being a nuisance to the people that run everything   you would n't want that would you

never trust a single source to give you a fair price especially if they are not in competition moreso if they know that 's the case   i would want to get a quote from at least one other broker in terms of what they feel they can sell the bonds for   and let them know they are not the only one you are getting a quote from   to start with you need information such as when is the last time a bond like the ones you have traded and what did it sell for also sources for where you can sell the bonds and more info on the entire subject the securities industry and financial markets association has a pretty helpful website called   i find it has a wealth of information and is relatively free of bias on the municipal markets at a glance page you can get history for various bonds if you have the pronounced que sip numbers for the bonds if these bonds are as good as the advisor is telling you they are then they should be selling for a premium and the recent sales history would reflect that   i 'd find one or two other potential sellers and get prices from each of them compare that against recent history and go with whichever one seems to be offering you the best deal in terms of choosing someone and how to go about selling bonds the same website has some excellent information and guidance on buying and selling bonds and how to choose an investment professional which includes how to check up on them to see if they have ever faced action etc   i would also consider any gains you might have to declare if you sell these for more than face value and if that would be taxable etc i would also question your too safe judgement   just because something is safe i would not necessarily throw it out   you need to look at the return relative to the risk and if you are not investing in a tax sheltered account the affect of taxes on your net return   if these are earning a really good return for fairly low risk they might be worth keeping especially if in today 's market you need to take substantially more risk to get a comparable return   taking more risk to get nearly the same return is n't very wise since an aspect of the risk is perhaps not getting any return or losing money    in a volatile market there can be a substantial benefit to having a lower risk foundation that you build upon with more risky investments in order to provide some risk diversity in your portfolio you might want to consider for example how these bonds have done over the last 13 years compared to a similar investment in the type of less safe vehicles you are considering   perhaps you 'd be better off just holding these to maturity instead of gambling on something with a lot more risk that could go south on you

any etf has expenses including fees and those are taken out of the assets of the fund as spelled out in the prospectus   typically a fund has dividend income from its holdings and it deducts the expenses from the that income and only the net dividend is passed through to the etf holder    in the case of qqq it certainly will have dividend income as it a large stock index   the prospectus shows that it will adjust daily the reported net asset value nav to reflect accrued expenses and the cash to pay them will come from the dividend cash   if the dividend does not cover the expenses the nav will decline away from the modeled index note that the nav is not the etf price found on the exchange but is the underlying value   the price tends to track the nav fairly closely both because investors do n't want to overpay for an etf or get less than it is worth and also because large institutions may buy or redeem a large block of shares to profit when the price is out of line   this will bring the price closer to that of the underlying asset e.g. the nasdaq 100 for qqq which is reflected by the nav

it sounds like gross receipt tax is essentially the same thing most states call sales tax which is always handled this way prices displayed are pre tax tax is added when the final price is calculated   one reason for doing it that way is that most prices result in taxes that involve fractions of pennies and calculating from the total produces a more accurate result than calculating tax on each item individually it is theoretically possible to set prices so the numbers come out evenly when tax is added but that requires that the prices be in fractional cents   potentially to many decimal places and in fact in some places it is illegal to display only the with tax price otherwise i 'm sure some stores and restaurants would be willing to deal with the mils and purely on principle or as a marketing gimmick since customers have learned to expect sales tax it really is n't worth the effort to fight it the closest i 've seen has been occasional we 'll pay your sales tax offers or statewide sales tax holidays once a year

doing what you suggest may actually be helpful today you have wealth of and debt of 140k for net wealth of 5k your interest incurred is $ and your interest earned is $ for a total loss of $ just below the 491 $ you are saving so your total saving is $ currently however even though in total you have more money each month than the month before you are getting more debt and thus more interest to pay each month your interest earned is increasing much slower that $ you are currently able to save by the time you hit 51 that has become $ and is still dropping by 60 your debt has overtaken your retirement savings that $ 5 net worth you have now is gone if you were to withdraw money from your retirement to pay off your debt with the $ penalties you would have wealth of 70k and debt of for a net wealth of i.e. net debt obviously the above is not good however you reduce your monthly interest paid to $ while also reducing your interest earned to $ 102 this is a total loss of $ so you are saving $   note that in this case your $ 491 monthly repayment is higher than the interest you have to pay on the account this means that each month your interest payment becomes lower thus you pay off more and more each month your balance would be getting better each month and at a faster rate each month your net wealth would be back in positives and above your wealth on your current trajectory before you hit 62 by 65 you will have $ 9000 of net wealth if you use your retirement savings now as opposed to $ 9000 net debt if you do n't and just adding a few things on to the end 1 this is just the maths of it and does not take into account your behaviour if having that debt accruing is helping to motivate you to give up on luxuries then this analysis does not apply i am assuming that the $ is literally all you can save and that no matter what changes you will always deposit that $ 491 if you do not think you can continue to deposit that $ 491 if you stop seeing such high interest accruing then do not do this 2 i am assuming your interest earned on your ira is 1.75 if this is not the case then please let me know and i can adjust my numbers accordingly from 3 i 'm assuming all numbers you mentioned are accurate and will stay constant interest rates may not 4 this is not professional financial advice i am just a person on the internet   5 this goes without saying and will probably go down as well as let them eat cake did but saving more money each month will be a more powerful risk free way to get out of this problem work a 2nd job cut costs however you can 6 sorry if you were looking for something more motivational or sugar coated   7 best of luck feel free to ask any questions graph below in red is your current trajectory and blue is if you withdraw from your retirement to pay off your debt

the issue with your point is that government has does move to make decisions in the markets to institute their political views or agendas of which these views and agenda do not often take into consideration any of the unforeseen consequences in the light of market realities the market realities which i speak of are everything affected by government action from businesses dealing with the cost of extra added government regulation on their bottom line employee costs taxes the impact of subsidies and price controls etc in a competitive market where everyone is looking for an edge over their competitors however with government many times these market realities are often ignored when making broad and over reaching governmental polices based on political agendas and the whims of the public rather then on solid and sound economic decisions   which in turn these governmental polices effect many many more people then businesses acting for their own needs to ensure their survival in the marketplace thus having a president who does not or willfully will not acknowledge how government interaction in the market place can create unintended and often negative results is worse in respects to having a president who does understand how the bottom line is effected via government action and attempts to reconcile both in light of making a decisions that effects the economy as a whole

get a credit card is not the answer the reason people have a bad or no credit score is often because they 're new to the country have just turned 18 have previously fallen into arrears or are just bad with money getting a credit card is risky because if you do n't stay on top of your payments it 'll just damage your score even more   now it sounds like i hate credit cards but i do n't and they do have their benefits but avoid them if possible because they can be more hassle than they 're worth ie paying the credit back on time cancelling accounts when the interest comes in moving money in and out of accounts it 's risky borrowing money from anywhere whether it 's a payday lender a bank a credit card etc so use them as a last resort if you 've got your own income then that 's amazing try not to live outside of your means and your credit score will look after and increase itself it takes time to build a good credit score but always make sure you pay the people you owe on time and the full amount i 'd stick with paying your phone provider and any other direct debits you have setup and avoid getting a credit card i 'd recommend to keep track of your credit score and read their faq on how to help build it unlike experian it 's free forever so not quite as detailed but are owned by one of the biggest credit reference agencies in the uk so they should have the latest information on yourself in conclusion if you already have financial commitments like a mobile phone bill gym membership store cards anything that gets paid monthly by direct debit your credit score will increase provided you pay the full amount on time    i hope this helps ps i do n't work for any of the companies here but i 've been working in the finance sector more specifically short term loans for 3 + years now

do i make money in the stock market from other people losing money not normally the stock market as a whole on average increases in value over time so if we make the claim that the market is a zero sum game and you only make money if other people lose money that idea is not sustainable there are n't that many people that would keep investing in something only to continue to lose money to the winners the stock market and the companies inside it grow in value as the economy grows and the economy grows as workers add value with their work   here 's an analogy i can buy a tree seed for very little and plant it in the ground if i do nothing more it probably wo n't grow and it will be worth nothing however by taking the time to water it it weed it it and harvest it i can sell the produce for much more than i purchased that seed for no one lost money when i sell it i increased the value by adding my effort   if i sell that tree to a they can cut the tree into usable lumber and sell that lumber at a profit they added their efforts and increased the value   a carpenter can increase the value even further by making something useful a door for example a retail store can make that door more useful by transporting it to a location with a buyer and a builder can make it even more useful by installing it on a house   no one lost any money in any of these transactions they bought something valuable and made it more valuable by adding their effort   companies in the stock market grow in value the same way a company will grow in value as its employees produce things an investor provides capital that the company uses to be able to produce things and as the company grows it increases in value as the population increases and more workers and customers are born and as more useful things are invented the economy will continue to grow as a whole   certainly it is possible even common to profit from someone else 's loss   people lose money in the stock market all the time   but it does n't have to be this way   the stock market goes up on average over the long term and so long term investors can continue to make money in the market even without profiting from others failures an investor that purchases a share from another investor does not directly provide capital to the company   however this second investor is rewarding the first investor who did provide capital to the company   this is the reason that the first investor purchased in the first place without the second investor the first would have had no reason to invest and provide the capital   relating it to our tree analogy did the builder who installed the door help out the tree farmer   after all the tree farmer already sold the tree to the and does n't care what happens to it after that   however if the builder had not needed a door the would have had no reason to buy the tree

from the letter you link our performance relatively is likely to be better in a bear market than in a bull market so that    deductions made from the above results should be tempered by the fact that it was the type of year when we    should have done relatively well in a year when the general market had a substantial advance i would be well    satisfied to match the advance of the averages putting those two sentences together the word relatively means that his funds perform better than the market in bear markets and perform about the same as the overall market in bull markets it does not mean that absolute performance is better in bear markets than bull markets later on he states   this policy should lead to superior results in bear markets and average performance in bull markets

no chance cars are much easier to repossess and the cost of doing so is less people are n't quite as leveraged on autos as they were on homes even with a worst case scenario 7 year loan people are usually in par within 3 4 years in that timeframe on a 30 year mortgage you 've barely started paying the interest down even at the height of the housing crisis auto loan losses were manageable when people were losing their homes at a record pace you 'd think they would skip the car payments to make the mortgage that was n't the case people generally kept paying their car notes even when the house was going away losing your car is actually much more troublesome to most people they will make that payment over all others

hi accounting major here   a lot of people mentioned both tax advantages and cheap money money you can borrow at a low interest rate   another reason businesses do this is to reward investors generally people with stock in a company want to see some of its operations financed with debt instead of all of it financed from investors money or profit this way the company can grow more and still pay better dividends to its investors however you do n't want too much debt either it 's a balance and a way to see how much debt vs equity a company has is called a leverage ratio leverage = debt hope this helps

frequently people saving money for a down payment or for their emergency fund feel that they need to find a way to the process via methods that will generate more interest than a bank account or a cd once they have reached their goal they also feel that having the money sitting around not generating income is a missed opportunity all investments that are n't 100 safe introduce risk to entice you to invest they offer the opportunity make more money than a bank account or cd but the downside is that the extra money is n't guaranteed in fact the introduced risk also opens up the investment to the possibility of losses including a total loss you have identified risks with bank accounts and cds with the bank account you will generally lose money vs. inflation with a cd the investment is less liquid if you sell early or you want need to sell 1/2 a cd you will give up some of that extra income also if rates on a cd rise next month you are locked into your current rate til the cd ends putting some or all of the money you are saving for the house into a risky investment means that you may shorten or extend the time period nobody knows   by investing in real estate we can offset the risk of real estate    going up in the next couple years if real estate goes up we will    still be able to use our down payment for a comparable house as of    now inversely if real estate goes down we will lose on the down    payment but be able to get a house cheaper unless the reit matches the market of residential real estate in your city metropolitan region there is no guarantee that home prices in your city will move the same way the reit does   a recent listing of the 10 largest holdings of the index is none of these tell me what home prices in my neighborhood will do next year

simply if your stock is still rising in price keep it if it is falling in price sell it and pay off your mortgage to know when to do this is very easy if it is currently rising you can put a trailing stop loss on it and sell it when it drops and hits your stop loss a second easy method is to draw an uptrend line under the increasing price and then sell when the price drops down below the uptrend line as per the chart below   this will enable you to capture the bulk of the price movement upward and sell before the price drops too far down you can then use the profits after tax to pay down your mortgage of course if the price is currently in a downtrend sell it asap

our current economic situation is a mess and our current tax system is the problem but the problem is too little wealth taxation not too much     you are correct in asserting that land value tax is not the solution since we do n't live in a society where farmland is the primary source of ownership based income   if you want to look at what you can own to earn money these days look at the holdings of apple google microsoft amazon exxon mobile verizon etc it 's not farmland anymore it 's ip and it goes entirely untaxed   taxing property is completely appropriate but the problem is that we live in a world where the taxes even taxes designed to tax wealth like property taxes fall almost entirely on the individual since high value capital can move jurisdictions to dodge taxes and thus taxing wealth like we should creates a competitive disadvantage     when you push back on real estate property taxes you do n't make things better for most people   property values rise since the value of an asset is proportional to how much money it can earn for it 's owner driving affordability down rent up homeownership rates down and generally worsening the quality of life for everyone   pushed to the extreme you get a 2 class system where land ownership is for the entitled and everyone else are worthless   history is littered with examples which is why we know the word serf   for a modern day cautionary tale look at what happened in california since the reagan property tax changes   they still seem convinced it was a great change but the california real estate market is pure insanity

this is either laundering money or laundering non money   all the other answers point out how a cheque or bank transfer will take days to actually clear   that is a red herring there are lots of ways to illegally transfer real money out of existing accounts   stolen cheque books stolen banking details partly in connection with stolen smartphones and credit cards and cards money transfers from other people duped in a similar manner as you are it is much easier to steal money than invent it and it takes quite longer until stolen rather than invented money will blow up at the banks all of those payments will likely properly clear but not leave you in actual legal possession of money   people will notice the missing money and notify police and banks and you will be on the hook for paying back all of it cheques and transfers from non existing accounts in contrast tend to blow up very fast and thus are less viable for this kind of scam as the time window for operating the scam is rather small whether or not the cheque actually clears is about as relevant of whether or not the rolls royce you are buying for $ 500 because the owner has an toe nail and can not press down the accelerator any more has four wheels better hope for the rolls to be imaginary because then you 'll only be out of $ 500 and that 's the end of it   if it is real your trouble is only starting

in addition to the prior answer talking from experience you get into trouble if you surpass the contribution limit and your employer continues to deposit money above the irs maximum allowed when that happens you have until april to take out the excess contribution and earned interest on that chunk of money and included in your tax return or else you get a steep tax penalty in addition to being double taxed for the current and next tax year also from experience payroll departments will most likely get this wrong and it will end up in a compliance mess with you picking up the tab on your tax bill do n't let it happen

in the us we have social security taxes where for a full time employee the company pays half and the employee pays half   when you work as a business what we call 1099 for the form that the wages are reported on then the contractor pays the full amount of social security tax there are times when a contractor can negotiate a higher rate because the company does not have to pay that tax   however most of the time the company just prefers to negotiate the rate based on your value   if you are a 60 k year guy then that is what they will pay you   from the company 's perspective it does not matter what your tax rate is only the value you can bring to the company   if you can add about 180 k to the bottom line then they will be happy to pay you 60 k and you should be happy to get it here in the us a contractor can expect to make about 7.5 more of an equivalent employee because of the social security tax savings to the company   however not all companies are willing to provide that in compensation   some companies see the legal and administrative costs of employees as normal and the same costs with contractors as extra so they do n't perceive a cost savings   there are other things that would preclude employers from giving the bump although it is logical to do so first you will really have to feel out your employer for the attitude on the subject   then i would make a logical case if they are open to providing extra compensation in return for tax savings   if i am an employee at 60 k you would also have to pay the government   how about you pay me 75 k as a contractor instead that would be a great deal for all in the us

all things being equal a defined benefit pension is far better than an ira or a 401(k   think about it this way let 's say you can have a guaranteed $ 100 a month or the chance at $ 100 a month   which is better    now obviously your tolerance for risk is the difference but this is the beauty of a defined benefit plan your employer is picking up the risk   assuming that the pool of investments is about the same which unless if their funds are tremendously under performing they are the question is who takes the risk you or them especially if you are moving into a new position having a defined benefit plan is like having a risk free asset in your portfolio   it increases your safety   the only reason to roll this over into a 401(k or ira is if your expected value risk payout is better   a worked example if half the time you would earn more than $ 100 and half the time less then you could imagine the two as being equally good only if you really love risk would you take that chance   in reality only half the investments out there will beat the average and as such you actually have less than a 50/50 shot of beating a db unless if there are really low returns to it   more likely i suspect you are over estimating your ability to get a higher return

is there any instance in which a large company whose corporate bonds are investment grade find it more attractive to take out a bank loan to raise finance rather than underwrite bonds    to my knowledge i ’m a first year at university so i ’m not 100 sure bonds are comparatively cheaper lower effective interest rate does not have the same caveats and regulations involved with usage of the loan i.e. no need to buy insurance and allow them to raise far more than most banks would be willing to risk i know loan exists but it ’s still rare to my knowledge    why would a such a company have any bank loan debt whatsoever if issuing bonds are objectively better the only one i can fathom is if the loan is so incredibly small that it ’s more time consuming to underwrite bonds but 1 i do n’t know if that ’s the case 2 why would a large company do this if they could simply pay out less dividends and reinvest a slightly larger portion of profits

neither party gives an f about the consumer    the real issue is class action lawsuits in which the consumer gets shafted and the lawyers make a killing    real class action reform would not come in the form of favoring arbitration over lawsuits or vice versa but in requiring that fees in class action suits be paid in the same form as the payment to consumers and requiring that people opt in to join a class rather than having to actively opt out ending payment of fees in cash but consumers getting coupons which are only good one buys more of the alleged wrong doing products services would ensure consumers get a fair shake   this would hurt the lawyer lobby and thus most democrats and many republicans would never support it requiring people to opt in to class action suits rather than go through a long process of opting out would reduce the number of frivolous class action suits   again this would hurt the lawyer lobby and thus most of our politicians would n’t support it in short it comes down to most democrats favoring the lawyer lobby over the business lobby and most republicans favoring the opposite neither cares about the consumer citizen

after doing a little research i was actually surprised to find many internet resources on this topic including sites from intuit gave entirely incorrect information the information that follows is quoted directly from irs publication rules for dependents first i will assume that you are not living on your own and are claimed as a dependent on someone else 's tax return such as a parent or guardian if you were an minor that would be a completely different question and i will ignore this less common case so how much money can you make as a minor who is someone else 's dependent well the most commonly quoted number is $ 6,300 but despite this numbers popularity this is not true this is how much you can earn in wages from regular employment without filing your own tax return but this does not apply to your scenario selling your products online as an independent game developer would generally be considered self employment income and according to the irs a dependent must also file a tax return if he or she had wages of $ or more from a church or qualified church controlled organization that is exempt from employer social    security and medicare taxes or had net earnings from self employment of at least $ 400 so your first $ 400 in earnings triggers absolutely no requirement to file a tax return blast away and good luck after that you do not necessarily owe much in taxes however you will need to file a tax return even if you owe $ 0 as this was self employment income if you had for instance a job at a grocery store you could earn up to $ 6,300 without filing a return because the store would be informing the irs about your employment anyway as well as deducting medicare and social security payments etc how much tax will you pay as your income grows beyond $ 400 based upon the irs pages for self employment tax and family businesses while you will not likely have to pay income tax until you make $ 6,300 in a year you will still have to pay social security and medicare taxes after the first $ 400 roughly this should be right about 16 of your income so if you make $ 6000 you 'll owe just under $ 1000 and be keeping the other $ 5000 if your income grows even more you may want to learn about business expense deductions this would allow you to pay for things like advertisement software a new computer for development purposes etc and deduct the expenses out of your income so you pay less in taxes but do n't worry having such things to wonder about would mean you were raking in thousands of dollars and that 's an awfully good problem to have as a young entrepreneur so should you keep your games free or try to make some money well first of all realize that $ 400 can be a lot harder to make when you are first starting in business than it probably sounds second do n't be afraid of making too much money tax filing software even totally free versions make filing taxes much much easier and at your income level you would still be keeping the vast majority of the money you earn even without taking advantage of special business deductions   i 'd recommend you not be a afraid of trying to make some money i 'd bet money it will help you learn a lot about game development business and finances and will be a really valuable experience for you whether you make money or not having made so much money you have to pay taxes is not something to be afraid of it 's just something adults like to complain about good luck on your adventures and you can always come back and ask questions about how to file taxes what to do with any new found wealth etc

will buying a flat which generates $ 250 rent per month be a good decision whether investing in real estate is a good decision or not depends on many things including the current and future supply demand for rental units in your particular area there are many questions on this site about this topic and another answer to this question which already addresses many risks associated with owning property though there are also benefits to consider i just want to focus on this point you raised i personally think yes because rent adjusts with inflation and the rise in the price of the property is another benefit could this help me become financially independent in the long run since inflation is getting adjusted in it in my opinion the fact that rental income general adjusts with inflation is a hedge against some types of economic risk not an absolute increase in value first consider buying a house to live in instead of to rent   if you pay off your mortgage before your retire then you have reduced your cost of accommodations to only utilities property taxes and repairs this gives you a relatively known fixed requirement of cash outflows if the value of property goes up by the time you retire it does n't cost you anything extra because you already own your house if the value of property goes down by the time you retire then you do n't save anything because you already own your house if you instead rent your whole life and save money each month instead of paying off a mortgage then when you retire you will have a larger amount of savings which you can use to pay your monthly rental costs each month by the time you retire your cost of accommodations will be the market price for rent at that time if the value of property goes up by the time you retire you will have to pay more on rent if the value of property goes down by the time you retire you will save money on rent you will have larger savings but your cash outflow will be a little bit less certain because you do n't know what the market price for rent will be you can see that because you need to put a roof over your own head just by existing you bear risk of the cost of property rising so buying your own home can be a hedge against that risk this is called a natural hedge where two competing risks can mitigate each other just by existing this does n't mean buying a house is always the right thing to do it is just one piece of the puzzle to comparing the two alternatives see many other threads on buying vs renting on this site or on google now consider buying a house to rent out to other people   in the extreme scenario assume that you do everything you can to buy as much property as possible maybe by the time you retire you own a small apartment building with 11 units where you live in one of them as an example and you have no other savings before owning your own home was among other pros and cons a natural hedge against the risk of your own personal cost of accommodations going up but now the risk of your many rental units is far greater than the risk of your own personal accommodations that is if rent goes up by $ 100 after you retire your rental income goes up by $ 1,000 and your personal cost of accommodations only goes up by $ 100 if rent goes down by $ 50 after you retire your rental income goes down by $ 500 and your personal cost of accommodations only goes down by $ 50 you can see that only investing in rental properties puts you at great risk of fluctuations in the rental market this risk is larger than if you simply bought your own home because at least in that case you are guaranteeing your cost of accommodations which you know you will need to pay one way or another this is why most investment advice suggests that you diversify your investment portfolio that means buying some stocks some bonds etc if you invest to heavily in a single thing then you bear huge risks for that particular market in the case of property each investment is so large that you are often if you invest heavily in it you ca n't just buy a house $ 100 at a time like you could a stock or bond of course my above examples are very simplified i am only trying to suggest the underlying principle not the full complexities of the real estate market note also that there are many types of investments which typically adjust with inflation cost of living real estate is only one of them

as others have said the decision is a very personal one personally i think you have a good idea for those of us that thrive in structured systems having a detailed breakdown and distribution of assets is a great idea i recommend going one step further however instead of having a single necessities account have a division here 1 account for bills and another for living expenses your bills account should recieve the funds to pay your monthly expenses such as rent utilities insurance living expenses is for day to day spending i recommend this because your bills are generally a fairly fixed expense keeping your flexible spending separate allows you to manage it more carefully and helps prevent overspending   i keep my living expenses in cash and divide it up by the number of days before my next check every day i put my portion of the living expenses in my wallet this way i know that i can spend as much money in my wallet and still be fine for the rest of the pay period i also know that if i want to go out to a nice dinner on friday it would be helpful if i have money left over at the end of the day monday through thursday

it seems to be that your main point is this no matter what my chances can not be worse than random and if my trading system has an edge that is greater than the percentage of the transaction that is transaction cost then i am probabilistically likely to make a profit in general yes that is true but consider this very bad strategy buy one share of stock and sell it one minute later and repeat this every minute of the day obviously you would bleed your account dry with fees however even this horrible strategy still meets your criteria because if this bad strategy had an edge beyond the transaction fees you would likely still make a profit in other words your conclusion reduces to an uninteresting statement if there were no transactions fees then if your trading system has an edge then you will likely make a profit sorry to be the bearer of bad news but imho that statement and others made in the question are just obvious things stated in convoluted ways i do n't want to discourage you from thinking about these things though i personally really enjoy these type of thought experiments i just feel you missed the mark on this one

pay off the highest interest loan rate first you must be doing something funky with how long your terms are if you give a bit more info about your loan 's such as the term and how much extra you have right now to spend it could be explained in detail why that would be the better choice using your numbers you have to make sure when you are analyzing your different loan options that you make sure you are comparing apples to apples ie make sure that you are either comparing the present value future value or amortization payments   edit using some of your numbers lets say you have 5000 dollars in your pocket you have 3 options excel makes these calculations easier do nothing in 80 months your student loan will be payed in full and you will have owing on your mortgage and 5000 in your no bank interest   for mortgage pay off student loan and allocate student loans amortization to mortgage in 80 months you will have $ owing on mortgage and student loan will be paid in full for mortgage pay 5000 on mortgage in 80 months student loan will be paid in full and you will have $ owing on mortgage for mortgage

the truth is anyone can sue anyone for anything   so yes you could be sued but the more important part to measure is the probability of success    while this is probably more of a legal stack exchange question in order for a successful suit there has to be proven at least some negligence on your part in the situation you cite   the very fact that the landlord is not willing to turn on the heat is probably enough to absolve you from any liability   once you go down to a local store and purchase a certified heater then a suit would have a very low probability of success    perhaps a case could be made if you made your own heater and it burned down the house   but that would require finding a jury that is sympathetic to landlords that will not provide heat for their tenants highly unlikely could the landlord sue the heater company   yes and would likely receive an out of court settlement    even in the case that liability can be proven on your part it is very unlikely you would be targeted   these type of suits target deep pockets or those with wealth   unless something is specifically known about you having a high level of net worth a civil suit will not be brought against a room renter because of the lack of funds   people in your demographic tend not to have a lot of money   no offense intended i was there myself once   in the case that you do have a high net worth then get renters insurance and possibly an umbrella policy   it is a small price to pay to protect a significant amount of assets    if i was in your shoes here is what i would do

your basic point is correct the savvy move is to use insurance only to cover losses that would be painful or catastrophic for you otherwise self insure in the specific example of car insurance you may be missing that it does n't only cover replacement of the car it also covers liability which is a hundreds of thousands of dollars risk the liability coverage may well be legally required it may also be required as a base layer if you want to get a separate umbrella policy up to millions in liability so you have to be very rich before this insurance stops making sense in the us at least you can certainly buy car insurance that does n't cover loss of the car or that has a high deductible and in fact if you can afford to self insure up to a high deductible on average as you say that should be a good idea same is true of most kinds of insurance a high deductible is best as long as you can afford it unless you know you 'll probably file a claim health insurance in particular is weird in many ways and one is that you often can estimate whether you 'll have claims on our auto policy the liability and uninsured coverage is about 60 of the cost while damage to the car coverage is 40 i 'm sure this varies a lot depending on the value of your cars and how much you drive and driving record etc on an aging car the coverage for the car itself should get cheaper and cheaper since the car is worth less while liability coverage would not necessarily get cheaper

okay that makes sense but even if you accept that i do n't see how that 's the same as moviepass if people start going to the gym a lot more pf can buy more equipment and facility space it would be expensive but their costs would n't rise dollar for dollar with the increase in usage with moviepass they are paying the full ticket price for each movie that a customer wants to see that means for each customer that sees more than one movie a month they ca n't make a profit just from the subscription fee on that customer their costs rise in direct proportion to use    i consider some of those costs more fixed than variable though the labor and equipment costs do n't rise in direct proportion to the number of people who go to the gym sure if the attendees jumped 30 they would likely need to buy more equipment but they are n't changing their labor or equipment costs for each person that comes in it 's fixed within a certain level of activity and only becomes variable if the level of activity changes beyond that threshold

i like muro questions no i do n't think they do   because for me as a personal finance investor type just trying to save for retirement they mean nothing if i can not tell what the basic business model of a company is and how that business model is profitable and makes money then that is a no buy for me   if i do understand it they i can do some more looking into the stock and company and see if i want to purchase i buy index funds that are indexes of industries and companies i can understand   i let a fund manager worry about the details but i get myself in the right ballpark and i use a simple logic test to get there not the word of a rating agency if belong in the system as a whole i could not really say   i could not possibly do the level of accounting research and other investigation that rating agencies do so even if the business model is sound i might lose an investment because the company is not an ethical one   again that is the job of my fund manager to determine   furthermore and i mitigate that risk by buying indexes instead of individual stock

now my own answer   if you join and receive equity do the 1/3 split as a max truthfully if it were my company i would try to negotiate with you to only give you because as an advisor you 're not going to be involved in executing the idea to turn it into a business   if you contribute capital do it as a loan end of story   you do n't own more because you financed growth you should n't the growth will have come because of the collective performance of the whole team you should get paid back at a fair rate for your investment if the company can handle it i would argue something like 10 interest is reflective of the risk you 're taking with your money   if the finances are so tight that the interest repayment is n't an option do the math behind what you should be paid for the loan in interest and convert that to shares or equity somehow and get paid back for the invested capital   if the company ca n't repay your loan the business model may not be sound enough or developed enough to be investing in to begin with

i feel like he 's just doing this for the kicks and does n't really believe in it but then i see the numerous talks the book etc and i ca n't decide his entire basis for a idea meritocracy is that everyone should be truthful or radical transparency i do not see the connection at all you can not build an idea meritocracy because it inherently means you can judge if an idea succeeds or fails before implementing it if you want to bias yourself toward successful ideas it requires nothing more than allowing people to implement what they think and then rewarding the ones who succeed basically i can not see the point of this radical transparency etc   except for one possibility his computer algorithm i feel like that is his grasp at and the algorithm requires stupid tons of data to function so why not give it to the best source for such data top ivy league graduates and brilliant people hired by the one of the biggest hedge funds on the planet and then sell them on this idea that radical transparency is the basis for all success in the firm and ask them to start data on it

so my advice for your financial situation depends on your aims are you aiming to    completely clear your debt    clear one card to free up more monthly income      clear some debt to allow further controlled spending    clear one card and focus on just using one having 2nd as emergency there are other things you may wish to do but you said to pay off some all of 2 credit card bills if you want to contact me i can plan this more precisely some seem the same but other factors can come into play as well differing rates of interest make the options clearer my first advice would be to call the card companies and see if you can get better rates first scenario some figures made up for visual credit card debts     8,000        8,000 monthly payment        100            100 apr 10              10 ignoring apr this will be 80 months to repay otherwise 140 months using my example amounts above £ 28,000 repaid over 11 years 8 months   your suggestion as per your suggestion originally paying off cards equally will allow smaller debt on both cards credit card debt       3,000       3,000 monthly payment        100           100 apr 10             10 with a 0 apr this would be paid off in 2 years 6 months cards are available to get free balance transfers need to look into this with the 10 apr this would take 3 years 1 month £ 10,000 lump and £ repaid over 3 years 1 month saving £ and 8 years 7 months aim to clear debt completely my advice here is to use the £ 10,000 lump sum to pay off one credit card the remaining £ 2,000 can then come off the other card this will free up your outgoings was 2 x £ 100 by £ 100 but then use this £ 100 to pay off the card this will result in the following credit card debt       6,000 monthly payment        200 apr 10 with a 0 apr this would be paid off in 2 years 6 months cards are available to get free balance transfers need to look into this with 10 apr this would take roughly 3 years 1 month £ 10,000 lump and £ repaid over 3 years 1 month saving £ and 8 years 7 months    this option is the same as above but you have the options on the odd tight month to reduce payments to £ 100    this also will allow the 2nd card to be used interest free for an emergency purchase to be paid off without any interest charge    if rates are different pay of the one with the higher apr aim clear one card to free up more monthly income   aim clear one card and focus on just using one having 2nd as emergency same as above but do n’t increase to £ 200 leave monthly payment at £ 100 credit card debt       6,000 monthly payment        100 apr 10 with a 0 apr this would be paid off in 5 years with the 10 apr this would take 88 months 7 years 4 months £ 10,000 lump and £ repaid over 7 years and 4 months saving £ and 4 years 4 months    this also allows for some extra spending even racking back up the debt although not advised aim clear some debt to allow further controlled spending as above apart from this will allow you to spend to get back up to full £ 16,000 debt note my figures are theoretical paying off £ 500 £ a month instead of the £ 100 would take lump sum 10,000 remaining 6,000 14 months £ 17,000 paid lump sum 5,000 remaining 2 x 5,500 26 months £ 18,000 paid lump sum 0 remaining 2 x 8,000 40 months £ 20,000 paid now i have finished i hope you have an idea on what you are aiming to achieve and a better idea of what to do when you receive the income stephen

if you want a do it yourself solution look to a vanguard account with their total market index funds    there 's a lot of research that 's been done recently in the financial independence community   basically there 's not many money managers who can outperform the market index either s&p 500 or a total market index   actually no mutual funds have been identified that outperform the market after fees consistently   so there 's not much sense in paying someone to earn you less than a low fee index fund could do   and some of the numbers show that you can actually lose value on your 401k due to high fees that 's where vanguard comes in   they offer some of the lowest fees if not the lowest and a selection of index funds that will let you balance your portfolio the way you want   whether you want to go 100 total stock market index fund or a balance between total stock market index fund and total bond index fund or a lazy 3 fund portfolio vanguard gives you the tools to do it yourself   rebalancing would require about an hour every quarter or time span you declare yourself a simple path to wealth is my favorite blog about financial independence   also warren buffet recommended that the trustees for his wife 's inheritance when he passes invest her trust in one investment   vanguard 's s&p500 index fund   the same fund he chose in a 10 year $ 1 m bet vs. hedge fund managers   proceeds go to charity   that was about 9 years ago   so far buffet 's s&p500 is beating the hedge funds   investopedia article

if they are truly long term investments i would not put a stop loss on them the recent market dive related to the brexit vote is a prime example of why not to have one that was a brief dive that may have stopped you out of any or all of your positions and it was quite short lived you would likely have bought your positions back or new positions entirely and run the risk of experiencing a loss over what turned out to be a non event that said i would recommend evaluating your positions periodically to see if they still make sense and are performing the way you want

i do n't think there 's any federal law prohibiting them from allowing you to autopay more than your minimum   certainly there are federal laws telling them what to do with payments more than the minimum they must apply the leftover to the principal by default so the law does n't assume you ca n't overpay however federal law does require them to advance your next payment date if you overpay by a multiple of your minimum payment i.e. if your payment is $ 50 and you send them $ 100 you do n't have to make your next payment though interest still accrues of course   it 's possible navient is n't interested in implementing this functionality in their autopay who knows in any event assuming you have a bank that has functionality you may want to consider using that either for the extra or for the whole amount if navient is n't giving you a discount for autopay if so use that at least   your bank is happy to cut a check in any amount and send it on and navient is required to apply it to the principal   though if you do the autopay and billpay and are sending an extra amount less than a whole payment verify that they 're willing to accept amounts less than a full payment first not all lenders are

the biggest problem with the company was that they had really good employees for a long time who were passionate about their jobs but they then made progressing through the company awful in certain regions for instance at one point if you wanted to become an assistant manager of your department you had to agree to a rotation within your metro stores for what was basically a two dollar raise you might start at a store two miles from your home and then end up 30 miles from home then six months later be 40 miles away so a lot of people who were intelligent looked at that and said yeah i can just stay here and make two dollars less i live down the street   but the worst part was their employees were able to make the shitty systems work most of the time so they were never viewed as shitty despite the fact that their employees routinely told them of their and how awful they were to use   then they laid off the several thousand people they used some very interesting calculations to come up with their 1500 person layoff figure a while back who were responsible for keeping the ship afloat and put all those duties on the backs of other people   disclosure i was out before the layoffs left of my own free will and still like the people i worked with i left because i looked at moving up and was like nope these people are morons

the problem is i do n't understand how such sites work is that scam or not some of my friends told me that they 've actually received the revenue after they deposited a bit of money to similar sites and i do n't have any evidence not to trust them yes there are scam stay away quite likely people got real money back into bank account or more likely it shows that there is more notional money in the sites account   if such sites really work then how and why these sites work because there are quite a few people who believe in free easy money the site could be classic pyramid ponzi scheme they could also be involved in some kind of money laundering why would anyone trust them so much to give them money for absolutely no reason okay i 'm not so clever but they ca n't make profit only because of stupid people can they the same way you did at times just for fun to experiment at times because they believe there is easy get rich way there is a reward that works so that if you see 120 you start believing in it if you try and withdraw there will be quite a few obstacles under the of holding period withdrawal fees etc but mostly they will encourage you to keep depositing small amounts and see it grow this of it this way if one can make 20 day on day one does not need someone else 's money the power of compounding would mean very quickly $ 100 would become 88 billion in 120 days

you might consider learning how the matching or pairing system in the market operates   the actual exchange only happens when both a buyer and a seller overlap their respect quotes    sometimes orders go to market for a particular volume   eg get me 10,000 microsoft shares now   which means that the price starts at the current lowest seller and works up the price list until the volume is met   like all market it trades it has it 's advantages and it 's dangers   if you are confident microsoft is going to bull you want those shares now confident you 'll recoup the cost   where if you put in a priced order you might get only none or some shares same as when you sell   if you see the price which is the price of the last completed successful trade   and think i 'm going to sell 1000 shares then you give the order to the market or broker and then the same as what happened as before   the highest bidder gets as much as they asked for if there 's still shares left over they go to the next bidder and so on down the price and the last completed successful trade is when your last sale is made at the lowest price of your batch if you 're selling and selling 100,000 shares and the highest bidder wants 1,000,000 shares you 'll only see the price drop to that guys bid   why will it drop off the quoted price   because the quoted price is the last sale clearly if there 's someone still with an open bid on the market then either he wants more shares than were available the price stays same or his bid was n't as high as the last bid so when you sale goes through it will be at the price he 's offering    which is why being able to see the price queues is important on large traders it is also why it can be important put stops and limits on your trades een through you can still get gapped if you 're unlucky   however putting prices open orders vs orders can mean that you 're sitting there waiting for a bounce spike while the action is all going on without you safer but not as much gain maybe that 's the excitement of the market for every option there 's advantages and risks eg missing out there are also issues with stock movement and stop hunting which can influence the price but the stuff in the long paragraphs is the technical reasons

the price of a bond goes up when yields go down   for example you purchase a 5 bond today for $ 100 and the very next day the same bond is being offered with a rate of 10   will you be able to sell you bond for the $ 100 you paid   no you must compete with the 10 bonds being sold so you will have to sell your bond for less than the $ 100 you paid to compete with the new bonds being sold   thus bond prices are inversely related to bond yields the 20-year index you cited tracks bond prices and bond prices have gone up over the last 10 years which means bond yields have gone down   why have bond prices gone up   demand   more investors are moving their savings into bonds   why   i believe there a couple of reasons   one us treasuries are thought to be one of the safest investments   with the financial crisis and increased stock market volatility see chart below more investors are allocating more of their portfolios to safer investments   two a large portion of the us population is approaching retirement see chart below   these folks are not interested in watching their retirement portfolios potentially shrink in the stock market so they move into bonds

with a 401k you will be taxed when you withdraw the money upon retirement just like an ira but conventional wisdom had it that you 're likely to be in a lower tax bracket at that time that may not necessarily be the case though in which case a roth ira would be a better option because you 're paying for it with after tax dollars and distributions are untaxed if you wanted to hedge your bets you could have both an ira/401k and a roth ira   an ira has income limits above which the contributions are no longer tax deductible i do n't believe a 401k has the same limitations for completion 's sake a roth ira has income limits above which you ca n't contribute to one and like you said the employer match is free money

risk is the problem as others have pointed out your fixed mortgage interest rate is for a set period of time only let 's say your 3 might be good for five years because that 's typical of fixed rate in canada so what happens in five years if your investment has dropped 50 due to a prolonged bear market and interest rates have since moved up from 3 to 8 your investment would be underwater and you would n't have enough to pay off the loan and exit the failed strategy rather you might just be stuck with renewing the mortage at a rate that makes the strategy far less attractive being more likely to lose money in the long run than to earn any leverage or borrowing to invest amplifies your risk considerably if you invest your own money in the market you might lose what you started with but if you borrow to invest you might lose much more than you started with there 's also one very specific issue with the example investment you 've proposed you would be borrowing canadian dollars but investing in an index fund of u.s based companies that trade in u.s. dollars even if the index has positive returns in u.s. dollar terms you might end up losing money if the canadian dollar strengthens vs. the u.s. dollar it has happened before multiple times so while this strategy has worked wonderfully in the past it has also failed in the past unless you have a crystal ball you need to be aware of the various risks and weigh them vs. the potential rewards there is no free lunch

in some cases it might be rational to pay low interest debt first because the consequences of defaulting on that debt are worse    consider this simplified example   suppose you have two debts a low interest mortgage secured by your house and a high interest unsecured credit card debt both of which are within a few years of being paid off   there is a chance that sometime between now and then something will happen to disrupt your income e.g. medical problems and it wo n't be possible to make the payments on either loan    defaulting on the credit card loan will result in a lower credit score and calls from collection agencies   defaulting on the mortgage will result in the foreclosure or forced sale of your house at best forcing you to move and at worst leaving you homeless at a time when you are also facing other e.g. medical problems   so you might rationally judge that losing your house is much worse than bad credit   therefore you might rationally conclude that it would be better to direct extra income toward paying down the mortgage to increase the chances that if and when an income disruption might occur the mortgage would already be paid off   in other words you shorten the window of time where income disruption results in foreclosure you might decide that this increased security is worth the extra interest you will pay compared to the strategy where you pay the high interest loan first this is a fairly special situation but you asked why might it be a good idea to do this and i am just giving an example where it could rationally be considered a good idea    of course in a real life version of this example there might be other options available such as refinancing the mortgage   if you like you could imagine a more extreme example where the lower interest debt is owed to the who will come and break your if you miss a payment

for the mortgage you 're confusing cause and effect loans like mortgages generally have a very simple principle behind them at any given time the interest charged at that time is the product of the amount still owing and the interest rate so for example on a mortgage of $ 100,000 at an interest rate of 5 the interest charged for the first year would be $ 5,000 if you pay the interest plus another $ 20,000 after the first year then in the second year the interest charge would be $ 4,000 this view is a bit of an over simplification but it gets the basic point across in practice you would actually make payments through the year so the actual balance that interest is charged on would vary different mortgages would also treat compounding slightly differently e.g. the interest might be added to the mortgage balance daily or monthly so it 's natural that the interest charged on a mortgage reduces year by year as you pay off some of the mortgage mortgages are typically setup to have constant payments over the life of the mortgage an schedule calculated so that by the end of the planned mortgage term you 'll have paid off all of the principal it 's a straightforward effect of the way that interest works in general that these schedules incorporate higher interest payments early on in the mortgage because that 's the time when you owe more money if you go for a 15-year mortgage each payment will involve you paying off significantly more principal each time than with a 30-year mortgage for the same balance because with a 15-year mortgage you need to hit 0 after 15 years not 30 so since you pay off the principal faster you naturally pay less interest even when you just compare the first 15 years in your case what you 're talking about is paying off the mortgage using the 30-year payments for the first 15 years and then suddenly paying off the remaining principal with a lump sum but when you do that overall you 're still paying off principal later than if it had been a 15-year mortgage to begin with so you should be charged more interest because what you 've done is not the same as having a 15-year mortgage you still will save the rest of the interest on the remaining 15 years of the term unless there are pre payment penalties for the car loan i 'm not sure what is happening perhaps it 's the same situation and you just misunderstood how it was explained or maybe it 's setup with significant pre payment penalties so you genuinely do n't save anything by paying early

you ca n't get there from here   this is n't the right data   consider the following five year history   2 16 32 14 1   that would give a 13 average annual return   now compare to 26 15 2 16   that would give a 4 average annual return    notice anything about those numbers   two of them are in both series   this is n't an accident   the first set of five numbers are actual stock market returns from the last five years while the latter five start three years earlier   the critical thing is that five years of returns are n't enough   you 'd need to know not just how you can handle a bull market but how you do in a bear market as well   because there will be bear markets    also consider whether average annual returns are what you want   consider what actually happens in the second set of numbers    but if you had had a steady 4 return you would have had a total return of 21 not the 8 that would have really happened   the point being that calculating from averages gives misleading results   this gets even worse if you remove money from your principal for living expenses every year    the usual way to compensate for that is to do a 70 bond mix or with five years of expenses in cash equivalent savings   with cash equivalents you wo n't even keep up with inflation   the stock bond mix might give you a 7 return after inflation   so the five years of expenses are more and more problematic as your nest egg shrinks   it 's better to live off the interest if you can   you do n't know how long you 'll live or how the market will do    from there it 's just about how much risk you want to take   a current nest egg of twenty times expenses might be enough but thirty times would be better   since the 1970s the stock market has n't had a long bad patch relative to inflation   maybe you could through with ten   but if the are like the 1970s you 'd be in trouble

there are too many nuances to the question asked to explore fully but here are a few points to keep in mind if you are a cash basis taxpayer most individuals are then you are not required to pay taxes on the money that has been billed but not received as yet   if you operate on an accrual basis then the income accrues to you the day you perform the service and not on the day you bill the client you can make four equal payments of estimated tax on the due dates and if these together with any income tax withholding from wage paying jobs are at least 90 of your tax liability for that year then you owe no penalties for underpayment of tax regardless of how your income varied over the year if your income does vary considerably over the year even for people who only have wages but who invest in mutual funds the income can   vary quite a bit since mutual funds typically declare dividends and capital gains in december then you can pay different amounts in each quarterly installment of estimated tax this is called the method a part of form 2210 that is best avoided unless you really need to use it   your annualized income for the payment due on june 15 is 2.4 = times your taxable income through may 31 thus on form 2210 you are allowed to assume that your average monthly taxable income   through may 31 will continue for the rest of the year you then compute the tax due on that annualized income and you are supposed to have paid at least 45 of that amount by june 15 similarly for september 15 for which you look at income through august 31 you use a multiplier of 1.5 = and need to pay of the tax on the annualized income and so on   if you these numbers and pay too little tax in any installment then you owe penalties for that quarter   most people find that the tax due for the entire year and paying it in equal installments is simpler than keeping track of nuances of the annualized method even simpler is to pay 100 of last year 's tax in four equal installments 110 for high earners and then no penalty is due at all if your business is really taking off and your income is going to be substantially higher in one year then this of last year 's tax deal could allow you to postpone a significant chunk of your tax bill till april 15

it is different this time but i think the risk of asset prices rising is almost as equal as them falling qe caused asset price inflation but qe was only to calm support the market they 're probably not going to stuff that qe money back into the central bank for a very long time either maybe they 'll just keep rolling over the bonds out to maturity while relying on deficits to inflate away the assets at the fed     my bet is the main risks going forward are political risks and continued modest inflation among things not measured by cpi

first of all the only thing they can do to force you to pay is sue you if they do n't sue you then they ca n't force you to do anything all they have right now is just a written agreement you signed promising to pay that by itself does n't have legal power to take money from you the worst they can do without suing you is put negative information on your credit report which has probably already happened anyway if they sue you within the statute of limitations they will almost certainly win and get a judgment against you because you did agree to pay with that judgment the court can force you to reveal your income and asset information and they can take the judgment to do things like seize money from your bank accounts and/or garnish your wages and the judgment does not go away however if you have no money in the bank and/or income they ca n't take any money from you because you have none they ca n't take more from you than you have in other words if you have no money or income and wo n't have money or income soon the judgment they can get by suing you and winning is n't worth the paper it 's on since serving you and suing you takes money and effort they will make a calculation on whether it is worth suing you based on the amount of debt and what amount of money they think they can get from you based on what they know about you this is the reason why you may not be sued at all if they calculate that it is not worth it and also why they may offer you a settlement for a lesser amount because is saves the cost of suing and the risk that they wo n't be able to get you to pay the amount you mentioned several thousand dollars may be small enough for it to be not worth it another thing is the statute of limitations i mentioned earlier which varies by state and is several years long if they sue you after the statute of limitations passes then you can raise the statute of limitations and get the lawsuit dismissed so basically after this amount of time passes you are pretty much free from this debt note that the statute of limitations resets if you acknowledge the debt which includes paying any amount on the debt or agreeing that you owe them this debt so if the collection agency ever offers you benefits if you just sign a promissory note or just pay a token amount do n't fall for the trap they are trying to reset the statute of limitations even though it 's true that you owe them the debt never let them hear you acknowledging it unless it 's part of a final settlement finally if they get a judgment against you and you do n't want them to have the ability to take your money indefinitely in the future until the debt is satisfied there may be the option of bankruptcy however a few thousand dollars may not be worth the cost and negative consequences of bankruptcy since as a young man you should be able to earn that amount quickly whenever you start working

i started a business a few years ago   at one point it was n't going so well and my father loaned me an amount not too dissimilar to what you 've done from a personal perspective the moment i took that loan there was a strain the relationship   especially when i was sometimes late on the interest payments   unfortunately thoughts like he does n't need this right now but if i do n't pay the car loan then that is taken away came up a few times and paying the interest fell to the bottom of the monthly bill payment stack at some point my wife and i finally took a hard look at my finances and goals   we got rid of things that simply were n't necessary car payment cable tv etc and focused on the things we needed to   doing the same with the business helped out as well as it helped focus me to to turn things around   things are now going great that said two of my siblings ran into their own financial trouble that our parents helped them on   when this happened my father called us together and basically everyone 's debt by an equal amount which covered everything plus wrote a check to the one that was doing fine   this cleared the air with regards to future inheritance questions about how much one sibling was being helped vs another etc   honestly it made family gatherings more enjoyable as all that underlying tension was now gone i 've since helped one of my children   although i went about it an entirely different way    rather than loan them money i gave it to them   we also had a few discussions on how i think they ought to manage their finances and a set of goals to work towards which we co developed   bearing in mind that they are an individual and sometimes you can lead a horse   given the current state of things i consider it money well spent

yes it should come out tax free however you should have reported it   to the irs at the time currently it is done on form 8606 if you have n't done it the irs may disagree with you on that and require taxes if you have proper documentation of the contribution then when you withdraw from your ira you use that same form 8606 to calculate the non taxable portion note that you can not just take $ 2 k out of the 1099-r the non taxable portion will be prorated through all of your ira withdrawals also keep in mind that only the actual after tax portion will be tax free the gains will be taxable i.e. if you deposited $ 2 k after tax and nothing else and they have now grown to $ 100 k you will only have 2 of your distribution tax free k distributed amount

in the united states if someone refers to the interest rate especially if heard on news or talk radio in particular they are almost always referring to the federal funds rate a rate set forth and maintained by the united states federal reserve the fed for short if the fed opts to raise or lower this rate it subsequently effects all interest rates whether by being directly connected in a chain of loans   or by market demand through the efficiency of financial markets in the case of bond auctions the fomc meets eight times each year to determine the target for the federal funds rate   the federal funds rate effects all interest rates because it is the originating rate of interest on all loans in the chain of loans because of this significance as a benchmark for all interest rates it is the rate most commonly referred to as interest rate when used alone that is why other rates are specified by what they actually are e.g. mortgage rates 10 year 30 year for 10 year treasury and 30 year treasury bond yields respectively savings rate auto rate credit card rate cd rate all rates of interest effected by the originating loan that is the federal funds rate   this is true in the united states but will vary for other countries in general though it will almost always refer to the originating rate for all loans in a given country institution etc   note that bonds have yields that are based on market demand that is in turn based on the federal funds rate it is because of the efficiency of financial markets that the demand and thus the yields are correlated to the federal funds rate

edit after reading one of the comments on the original question i realized that there is a much more intuitive way to think about this if you look at it as a standard pv calculation and hold each of the cashflows constant really what 's happening is that because of inflation the discount rate is n't the full value of the interest rate really the discount rate is only the portion of the interest rate above the inflation rate hence in the standard perpetuity pv equation pv = a r r becomes the interest rate less the inflation rate which gives you pv = a i g that seems like a much better way to get to the answer than all the machinations i was originally trying original answer i think i finally figured this out the general term for this type of system in which the payments increase over time is a gradient series annuity in this specific example since the payment is increasing by a percentage each period not a constant rate this would be considered a geometric gradient series according to this link the formula for the present value of a geometric gradient series of payments is where p is the present value of this series of cashflows    is the initial payment for period 1 i.e. the amount you want to withdraw adjusted for inflation    g is the gradient or growth rate of the periodic payment in this case this is the inflation rate    i is the interest rate    n is the number of payments this is almost exactly what i was looking for in my original question the only problem is this is for a fixed amount of time i.e. n periods in order to figure out the formula for a perpetuity we need to find the limit of the right side of this equation as the number of periods n approaches infinity luckily in this equation n is already well isolated to a single term 1 + + and since we know that the interest rate i has to be greater than the inflation rate g the limit of that factor is 0 so after replacing that term with 0 our equation simplifies to the following note i do n't do this stuff for a living and honestly do n't have a fantastic finance iq it 's been a while since i 've done any calculus or even this much algebra so i may have made an error in the math

that 's why it ca n't be left for taxpayer to decide everyone follows their narrow personal interests even if that means the downfall of society that is what governments are for to watch out for the public interests of society as a whole

i 'm no fan of go daddy and less of a fan of sopa but why the hell is go daddy getting singled out microsoft and apple are two huge supporters but you do n't hear anything about them   keeping it on topic to this subreddit i do n't think a boycott of godaddy will have any effect they are a behemoth and the people they attract do n't give two shits about sopa or internet activism

russia has become more risky as an investment thus investors basically the market wants to be paid more for investing in or owning those bonds as yields go up prices go down so right now you can buy a low priced russian bond with a high yield because the market views the risk involved as higher than risks involved in other similar securities

i understand the answers addressing the question as asked yes inheriting a 401(k can be a convoluted process   in general it 's best to transfer the account to an ira after separation from the company to avoid the issues both of my esteemed colleagues have referenced   given the issue of allowed by not required the flexibility is greater once the account has been transferred to an ira with few exceptions there 's little reason to leave the account with the 401(k after leaving that company   note i understand the original question as worded can mean the account holder passes while still working for the company in that case this would n't be an option

this is slightly opinion based is it appropriate to invest small amounts for short periods of time   at your age and the time period i would say no this is because although the index fund do return 6 7 on average there are several times it and goes negative as well stock markets in short periods like 6 months can be unpredictable at times a downturn will remain stagnant for periods of 2 3 years before suddenly zoom ahead if you are not to particular about the time when you need the changes done i.e. the changes can in worst case wait for few years then yes investing in index fund would make sense   else you are well off keeping this in savings try cd 's if they can offer better rates for such durations

this is the best tl;dr i could make original](https://www.vox.com policy and high minimum wage job killer seattle reduced by 91 i 'm a bot gt though there are sound theoretical reasons why a modest hike in the minimum wage might not depress employment most economists agree that if you set the minimum wage high enough at some point you will start destroying jobs   gt an economist at the university of massachusetts amherst who studies the minimum wage has pointed out that new minimum wage is not all that lavish when you take into account the high overall wages   gt the far more controversial interpretation of the university of washington study is that it might overturn or at least throw into doubt much of the past two decades of research on the minimum wage    extended summary**](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr | faq](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr comments/31b9fm faq_autotldr_bot/ version 1.65 tl;drs so far | feedback](http://np.reddit.com message compose?to=%23autotldr pm 's and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome | top keywords wage**^#1 work**^#3
