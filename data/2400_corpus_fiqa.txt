yes as long as you own the shares before the ex dividend date you will get the dividends depending on your instructions to your broker you can receive cash dividends or you can have the dividends reinvested in more shares of the company there are specific dividend reinvestment plans or drips if you are after stock growth rather than income from dividend payments

what is a dividend essentially for every share of a dividend stock that you own you are paid a portion of the company ’s earnings you get paid simply for owning the stock for example let ’s say company x pays an annualized dividend of 20 cents per share most companies pay dividends quarterly four times a year meaning at the end of every business quarter the company will send a check for 1/4 of 20 cents or 5 cents for each share you own this may not seem like a lot but when you have built your portfolio up to thousands of shares and use those dividends to buy more stock in the company you can make a lot of money over the years the key is to reinvest those dividends source what is an ex dividend date once the company sets the record date the ex dividend date is set based on stock exchange rules the ex dividend date is usually set for stocks two business days before the record date if you purchase a stock on its ex dividend date or after you will not receive the next dividend payment instead the seller gets the dividend if you purchase before the ex dividend date you get the dividend source that said as long as you purchased the stock before you are entitled to the next dividend if not you 'll get the following one after that

rsus are not essentially cash r in the rsu stands for restricted these awards have strings attached and as long as the strings are attached you do n't really own the money as such most banks do not include rsus in the income considerations some do especially if they have a specific agreement with your employer check your hr benefits coordinator specifically for mortgage loan   where the underwriting is very strict i 'm not aware of banks that include rsus as income without a specific agreement with the employer as a perk for credit cards car loans where you just need to write a number they would probably care less some banks but not all consider past performance and would include bonuses and maybe rsus if you can show several consecutive years of comparable bonuses

chinese suppliers can quote their price in cny rather than usd as has been typical and thus avoid the exchange risk from us dollar the cny has been generally appreciating so committing to receive payments in us dollars when their costs are in cny means they are typically on the losing end of the equation and they have to pad their prices a bit   canadian importers will have to buy rmb typically with cad to pay for their orders and canadian exporters can take payment in rmb if they wish or set prices in cad by avoiding the us dollar middleman the transactions are made less risky and incur less costs japan did this many decades ago they too used to price their products in usd   this is important in transactions of large amounts not so much for the tiny amounts associated with tourism two way annual trade between china and canada is in excess of $   of course forex trading may greatly exceed the actual amounts required for the world forex market is at least an order of magnitude greater than size of real international trade all that trading in currency and financial instruments means more jobs on bay street and more money flowing into a very vital part of the canadian economy   recent article from the liberal toronto star here

you have a good thing going one of the luxuries of being invested in an index fund for the long term is that you do n't have to sweat the inevitable short term dips in the market instead look at the opportunity that presents itself on market dips now your monthly investment is getting in at a lower price buy low sell high do n't lose money these are common for long term investment mentality 5 8 years is plenty of time i 'd call it medium term as you get closer to your goals ~2 3 years out you should start slowly moving money out of your index fund and start dollar cost averaging out into cash or short term bonds but that 's another question keep putting money in wait and sell high if it 's not high wait another year or two to buy the house a lot of people do the opposite for their entire lives buying high panic selling on the dips then buying again when it goes up that 's bad i recommend a search on dollar cost averaging which is exactly what you are doing right now with your monthly investments

i somewhat agree to alex b 's post   i was a finance manager for 7 years both prime and sub other words bad    the parts he 's 100 right on   hit up you local credit union then your bank   get your financing done first if you can   now 690 credit score is one of 3 bureaus not all banks and lending institutions use all three or the same one   also the score is n't everything   that could be good or bad   the 2 3 range is normally for the 720 + crowd unless its a manufacture   gm ford so on   with rates capping out at around 30 depending on state laws   however 690 should not be 19 on a new or late model car   at 690 at 19 you would have be going for a 70,000 + mile 6 year or older car if i had to guess assuming you have no bk 's and    some times dealerships have to pay banks to get people financed   its hidden in the cost and they by law are not allowed to tell you about it because it can not be passed on to you   however the banks do n't just fund any crazy amount of money either say like 115 of book and   that it   that is where and why they want that big down payment because that is used to off set the finance amount and what you pay   making the dealership money   and i can go on and on and on    but you should always try to get the funding prior   your credit union wo n't charge the hidden fees and they only care about your down payment to see that you are making a commitment   if you are buying used   save out 1500 for future repairs and tires and such   do n't buy paint and such   if you finance thru the dealership and put less than 20 down do buy gap insurance but that s it   i can go on and on but i wo n't   feel free to ask though    and to answer your original only question with not context is there any reason not to put a 35 down payment on a car yes if the money is better served paying off credit cards or long term mortgage assuming you do n't need the write off

i would personally look at consolidating your debt at a lower interest rate by refinancing your mortgage i would leave any retirement funds alone unless it was absolutely necessary to touch it with no other avenues available however once you have consolidated your debt into the mortgage i would pay more than the minimum amount so that you do n't take too long to pay it off i would put about 50 of the freed up cash flow back into the repayments that way you will be paying more debt off quicker and you will have additional cash flow to help your monthly budget another good point would be to go through your monthly budget to see if there is any expenses you could reduce or eliminate

as observed there is no answer that will fit all but below are some considerations your monthly requirement is 5000 so you have 3000 left to pay the monthly instalments emi however if you do pay 3000 you will have no money left for any other activities holidays etc till your emi is finished set off a sum let us say 500 1000 per month you shall have to decide for other expenses the rest of the money in this case 2000 2500 you can pay as monthly emi if you indicate that your monthly emi to the bank they will be able to tell you how much of loan you are eligible for and for how long the emi would last this is your benchmark if this loan amount is 750,000 or more you do not need to put in your own money so the decision then becomes how fast you want to pay off your loan and as accordingly you shall utilize your 500,000 however if the emi will not cover a loan of 750,000 more likely case you have options between the following a. max out on your loan that 2000 2500 emi month in terms of years as well as amount can get you and put the rest from 500,000 b. min your loan in terms of amount and time and put your entire 500,000 c. the middle ground is to balance between the loan and your own money which is the best approach there is no figure here that works for all you have to take the decision based on your circumstances however in general the shorter the loan term in years better it is as in aggregate you pay less money to the bank if you are 1 2 months away from buying the house one exercise you could do is to keep the emi money in a separate bank account and see how you fare with the residual cash this would give you a good reality check hope this helps thanks

in personal finance most of your success is determined by personal habit rather than financial savvy   getting in the habit of making regular deposits to your savings account will have a much larger effect on your situation than worrying about which account pays the highest interest rate particularly as neither one of them matches the current inflation rate which is over 3 so go ahead and put your money in a savings account but not because of the interest or safety but because it 's a savings account

if you 're asking this question you probably are n't ready to be buying individual stock shares and may not be ready to be investing in the market at all   short term in the stock market is gambling pure and simple and gambling against professionals at that you can reduce your risk if you spend the amount of time and effort the pros do on it but if you are n't ready to accept losses you should n't be playing and if you are n't willing to bet it all on a single throw of the dice you should diversify and accept lower potential gain in exchange for lower risk standard advice index funds   the way an investor as opposed to a gambler deals with a stock price dropping or surging upward or not doing anything is to say that 's interesting given where it is now do i expect it to go up or down from here and do i think i have someplace to put the money that will do better if you believe the stock will gain value from here holding it may make more sense than taking your losses   specific example the mortgage crisis market crash of a few years ago people who sold because stock prices were dropping and they were scared or whose finances forced them to sell during the down period were hurt badly those of us who were invested for the long term and could afford to leave the money in the market or who were brave contrarian enough to see it as an opportunity to buy at a better price came out relatively unscathed all i have lost was two years of growth so you made your bet now you have to decide do you really want to buy high sell low and take the loss as a learning experience or do you want to wait and see whether you can sell not so low if you do n't know enough about the company to make a fairly rational decision on that front you probably should n't have bought its stock

i do n't know much about paypal or bitcoin but i can provide a little information on i thought was just a service for moving real currency   btc has an exchange in which the price of a bitcoin goes up and down you can invest in to it much like you would invest in the stock market you can also invest in equipment to mine bitcoins if you feel like that is worthwhile it takes quite a bit of research and quite a bit of knowledge if you are looking to provide loans with interest i would look into p2p lending depending on where you live you can buy portions of loans and receive monthly payments with the similiar risk that credit card companies take debt that can be cleared in bankruptcy i 've thrown a small investment into p2p lending and it has had average returns although i do n't feel like my investment strategy was on too many high risk notes a large portion of which defaulted i 've been doing it for about 8 months and i 've seen an apy of roughly 9 which again i think is sub optimal i think with better investment strategy you could see closer to 12 15 which could swing heavily with economic downturn it 's hard to say

to understand his comments about bear market performance it 's important to take them in context my research method was bear read around the highlights this is not a complete survey of 60 + years of letters   in his earlier letters statements about bull market performance are always made in reference to buffet 's belief that many of bh 's current holdings are in undervalued securities ex   to the extent possible therefore i am attempting to create my own work outs by acquiring large positions in several undervalued securities such a policy should lead to the fulfillment of my earlier forecast an above average performance in a bear market it is on this basis that i hope to be judged p 6 emphasis mine similar statements are made throughout the earlier letters along with this interesting note   in a year when the general market had a substantial advance i would be well    satisfied to match the advance of the averages p 6 so to your question of why bh fund performance is likely to be better in a bear market than in a bull market i believe the implicit assertion is that undervalued securities are more resilient in a bear market presumably because they do n't have as far to fall and are also less likely to be subject to a bubble buffet is also explicitly asserting that when facing a choice to either a position bh to weather a possible downturn or b position bh to enjoy a bullish stock that is outpacing the market he would choose the former over the later as to your assertion that he always says this i can find no reference to bear market 's in the letters past 1960

there 's really no right or wrong answer here because you 'll be fine either way if you 've investing amounts in the low 5 figures you 're likely just getting started and if your asset allocation is not optimal it 's not that big a deal because you have a long time horizon to adjust it and the expense ratio differences here wo n't add up to that much a third option is vanguard etfs which have the expense ratio of admiral shares but have lower minimums i.e. the cost of a single share typically on the order of $ 100 however they are a bit more advanced than mutual funds in that they trade on the market and require you to place orders rather than just specifying the amount you want to buy a downside here is you might end up with a small amount of cash that you ca n't invest since you can initially only buy whole numbers of etfs shares so what i 'd recommend is buying roughly the correct number of etfs shares you want except for your largest allocation then use the rest of your cash on admiral shares of that if possible for example let 's say you have $ 15k to invest and you want to be 2/3 u.s. stock 1/6 international stock and 1/6 u.s. bond i would buy as many shares of international stock etf and u.s. bond etf as you can get for $ 2500 each then whatever is left over put into vtsax u.s. stock admiral shares mutual fund

you 'd have to look at the terms of the loan to be sure but if the interest compounds weekly then you 'd have to calculate the effect of 3 compounding periods then compute for weekly payments the balance after 3 weeks would be using excel 's pmt function for that principal balance i get a weekly payment of $    if the interest does n't compound the principal balance will be about $ and the weekly payment would be $ note however that the terms of the loan could be completely customized so you 'd need to be sure that the payment and the amortization schedule make sense to you before you agree to the loan   since the interest is very high i suspect this is a no credit needed car loan which are notorious for unfavorable to the borrower terms

you have multiple things going on some of which will work in opposite directions this is a second job for the family so that their income will be added onto of the main income this generally means that the 2nd income has too little tax withheld the tax tables used by employers have no way of handling this situation this 2nd job is being started part way though the tax year so too much in taxes is withheld if they make 2,000 a month for 4 months that would mean 8,000 in income but the tax tables used by the employer withhold at the $ 24,000 per year rate the third issue is the great variation in the number of hours per pay period this means that too much is withheld in checks with the most hours and too little in the ones with the least hours for this year you have a as long as you make the safe harbor levels for federal withholding you can avoid penalties when you file next spring to do so just make sure that the withholding of all the jobs in the family equal or exceed the total income tax for the family last year note this is n't equal to last years withholding or equal to the refund last year but the total tax you should have paid the general advice is to set the smaller income to have 0 exemptions and use the w-4 for the larger income to make adjustments in the past i have done this to make sure that we make the safe harbor level you can make adjustments in the new year once you know what the safe harbor goal is for the rest of the year

note that if 1   the stock prices are continuously differentiable they are n't 2   you rebalance continuously in the absence of trading fees and taxes then the return fraction future price original price will be the geometric mean of the return fractions for each investment if you do n't rebalance then the return fraction will be the arithmetic mean but the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean so continuous rebalancing in the case of continuously differentiable prices will always hurt you even trading costs taxes any argument in favor of blind rebalancing which does not somehow fail in the continuously differentiable case is simply wrong see

if you receive a loan from your parents it is treated legally just as a loan a bank or from any private person with spare money you do n't pay tax on a loan that you get from your bank or your parents and the bank or your parents do n't pay tax when you repay the loan if you pay interest the parents will have to pay tax on the interest just like they would have to pay tax if the money was in their own bank account   i would advice both you and your parents to make sure that a contract is signed saying that this is a loan and how it is repaid and that you follow the contract otherwise if you or your parents treat the loan as an actual present then you might have to pay tax because there is tax due on gifts and you might get a penalty for trying to avoid tax by declaring the gift as a loan so pay the money back only up to £ 3,000 in cash gifts that a person gives each year is tax free but the parents can use any unused money from last year so they can give a gift of £ 6,000 if they gave nothing in the previous year and it is per parent so both the mother and father can make a gift

yes you can indeed become rich by investing even small amounts over time let 's say that you begin with nothing invested and you start investing $ 100 per week suppose you choose to put your money in an s&p 500 index mutual fund the cagr compound annual growth rate of the s&p 500 over the last 35 years has been about 11 that 35 years includes at least two fairly serious crashes you may get more or less than that number in the future but let 's guess that you 'll average 9 35 years from now you would be a millionaire $ 1.2 million actually this math works out for anyone no matter who your parents are where you are from where you went to school etc yes you have a better chance of becoming wealthy the more you invest the longer you have to stay invested and the better choices you make in your investments   by starting early you will maximize your time invested which allows you the flexibility to be more conservative in your investments and to invest smaller amounts   but for those with a shorter time to invest it is still doable for most people   get your financial life under control by eliminating your debt setting a household budget and investing for the future

you were probably not given stock but stock options   those options have a strike price and you can do some more research on them if needed   lets assume that you were given 5 k shares at a strike of 20 and they vest 20 per year   assume the same thing in your second year and you are going to leave in year three you would have 2 k shares from your year 1 grant and 1 k shares from your year 2 grant so 2 k total if you leave no more shares would be vested if you leave you have one of two options to complicate matters subsequent grants may have different strike prices so perhaps year two grant is at $ 22 per share   however in pre public companies that is not likely the case for a bit of history i worked at a pre ipo company and we were all going to get rich   i was given generous grants but decided to leave   i really wanted to buy my options but simply did n't have the money   shortly after i left the company folded so the money would have been thrown away anyway   when a company is private the motivate their employees with tales of riches but they are not required to disclose financial data   this company did a very good job of convincing employees that all was fine when it was n't also i received options in a publicly traded company   myself and other employees received options that were underwater or worth far less than the strike price   you could let them expire so one did not owe money but they were worthless hopefully that answers your question

enrolled agents typically specialize only in tax matters   their status allows them to represent clients before the irs which a cpa can also do see the irs site regarding enrolled agents their focus is much narrower than a cpa and you would only hire them for advice or representation with tax related matters   e.g. you 'd not hire an enrolled agent to do an external audit   a cpa is a much broader certification covering accounting in general of which taxes are only a portion a cpa may or may not specialize in tax matters so if you have a tax related issue especially an audit review or appeal you may want to query a prospective cpa as to their experience with tax matters and representing clients appeals etc you would likely be better off with an ea than a cpa who tax work and specializes in other things such as financial the other hand if you have need of advice that is more generalized to accounting audits etc then you 'd want to talk with a cpa as opposed to an ea

if i were in your shoes and one time i was i would not talk about what i am doing unless i am specifically asked or if it 's something that could possibly help the c level exec instead i would talk about what he is doing ask him what problems he is currently facing in the organization this will give you insight as to what 's currently on his mind and the challenges he 's currently trying to overcome it will help you in your efforts at the company if you keep it in the back of your mind that this is what is trying to be achieved by the big guys ask him where he sees the company in the long term this will help reinforce and clear up the ideas you 're keeping in the back of your head from the previous question you asked ask him why he has n't gotten to that point already if the goal he mentioned seems like something that is n't that difficult to accomplish this will pose as a difficult question for himself to formulate an answer to where he will have to self evaluate whether or not he is behind the curve or ahead of the game mention things you have done well in the past that play into any of the troubles he 's currently facing or about to be facing soon so he knows he can directly call on you if he needs that particular something done bonus points if it 's a specialization do n't waste your time on and basic discussion if you do talk about because he brought it up find out his interests and see if you have any in common by location subject or any shared contacts the c level exec you are going to be sitting with has limited time but he has chosen to sit with you and possibly others when he could be doing other things use it to your advantage and ask him questions about why certain things are being done the way they are especially if you think they 're inefficient you never know you might just get directly put in charge of fixing those inefficiencies which since it 's more responsibility would be a great addition to your resume also research current news involving the company and mention it if appropriate not just out of nowhere it shows you 're on top of the game maybe not in rank but definitely in understanding

he general advice i get is that the younger you are the more higher risk investments you should include in your portfolio i will be frank this is a rule of thumb given out by many lay people and low level financial advisors but not by true experts in finance   it is little more than an old 's tale and does not come from solid theory nor empirical work   finance theory says the following the riskiness of your portfolio should inversely correspond to your risk aversion   period it says nothing about your age   some people become more risk averse as they get older but not everyone   in fact for many people it probably makes sense to increase the riskiness of their portfolio as they age because the uncertainty about both wealth social security the value of your house the value of your human capital and costs how many kids you will have the rate of inflation where you will live go down as you age so your overall level of risk falls over time without a corresponding mechanical increase in risk aversion in fact if you start from the assumption that people 's aversion is to not having enough money at retirement you get the result that people should invest in relatively safe securities until the probability of not having enough to cover their minimum needs gets small then they invest in highly risky securities with any money above this threshold this latter result sounds reasonable in your case   at this point it appears unlikely that you will be unable to meet your minimum needs i'm assuming here that you are able to appreciate the warnings about underfunded pensions in other answers and still feel comfortable   with any money above and beyond what you consider to be prudent preparation for retirement you should hold a risky but still fully diversified portfolio   do n't reduce the risk of that portion of your portfolio as you age unless you find your personal risk aversion increasing

i think there are a few facets to this namely overall i would n't concentrate on paying off the house if i did n't have any other money parked and invested but i 'd still try to get rid of the mortgage asap as it 'll give you more money that you can invest too at the end of the day if you save out paying $ 20k in interest that 's almost $ 20k you can invest yes i realise there 's a time component to this as well and you might well get a better return overall if you invested the $ 20k now that in 5 years time but i 'd still rather pay off the house
# 537721
lets do the math using your numbers we start off with $ 100 k a desire to buy a house and invest and 30 years to do it   scenario 1 we buy a house for $ 100 k mortgage at 5 interest over 30 years monthly payment ends up being $ we then take the $ 100 k we still have and invest it in stocks earning an average of 9 annually and paying 15 taxes   scenario 2 we buy a house for our $ 100 k cash and then every month we invest the $ we would have paid for the mortgage again investments make 9 annually long term and we pay 15 taxes   how would it look in 30 years   scenario 1 results 30 years later we would have a paid off house and $ in investments scenario 2 results 30 years later we would have a paid off house and $ in investments conclusion not paying off your mortgage early results in an additional $ in networth after 30 years that 's 28 more therefore not paying off your mortgage is the superior scenario   caveats notes things to consider play with the numbers yourself

first of all congrats very nice work indeed   secondly i do not offer this as legal advise lol anyhow you need to make sure to hang on to as much as possible being a single earner our uncle sam is going to want what 's due that being said you should probably look into investments for starters purchase a primary residence or start a business or purchase a primary residence and use that as a business residence both what you basically want are write offs you need to bring your taxable income as low as possible so you pay minimal taxes in your case you 're in danger of paying a hefty sum in taxes i 'm sure you can shield yourself with various business expenses a car workplace computers etc that you could benefit from both professionally and individually and then seriously bro making 250k leads me to believe you 've got at least more than half a brain and that you 're using more than half of that so dude get an accountant and one you can trust ask your parents colleagues people you 've worked with in the past etc there are professionals who are equally as talented in helping you keep your money as you are in making it you could get married make sure your wife stays at home and start popping out kids asap those keep my taxable and excess income pretty low lol i 'm going to add to this as a contractor i 've generally put any estimated taxes into some kind of interest accruing account so i can at least make a little money before i have to give it away in your case i 'd say put away at least 2/3 's into some kind of interest earning account start by talking to your personal banker wherever your money is you 'll be surprised at how nice they treat you you are going to have to pay taxes so until you do try to make a little money while it sits   again nice problem to have

running a fiscal deficit means a government is spending more money than it is taking in as taxes fees penalties fines etc with the extra money that is being spent being borrowed by selling bonds to willing buyers   interest paid to said buyers is another government expense in future years and of course the bonds must ultimately be redeemed and the buyers paid off   the buyers of the bonds must have some confidence that they will get the interest they have been promised as well as be paid off ultimately   as the government 's indebtedness increases buyers are likely to demand higher interest rates as to buy the bonds and so it goes

couple of to start off index funds and etf 's are essentially the same investments   etf 's allow you to trade during the day but also make you reinvest your dividends manually instead of doing it for you   compare vti and vtsax for example   basically the same returns with very slight differences in how they are run   because they are so similar it does n't matter which you choose either index funds and etf 's can be purchased through a regular taxable brokerage account or through an ira or roth ira   the decision of what fund to use and whether to use a brokerage or ira are separate whole market index funds will get you exposure to us equity but consider also diversifying into international equity bonds real estate reits and emerging markets   any broker can give you advice on that score or you can get free advice from for example future advisor   now the advice for most people in your situation you current tax rate is currently very low   this makes a roth ira a very reasonable idea   you can contribute $ 5,500 for 2015 if you do it before april 15 and you can contribute $ 5,500 for 2016   repeat each year   you wo n't be able to get all your money into a roth but anything you can do now will save you money on taxes in the long run   you put after tax money in a roth ira and then you do n't pay taxes on it or the gains when you take it out you can use roth ira funds for college for a first home or for retirement a traditional ira is not recommended in your case   that would save you money on taxes this year when presumably your taxes are already low since you wo n't be able to put all your money in the ira you can put the rest in a regular taxable brokerage account if you do n't just want to put it in a savings account   you can buy the same types of things as you have in your ira    note that if your stocks in your regular brokerage account go up over the course of a year and your income is low enough to be in the 10 or 15 tax bracket and you have held the stock for at least a year you should sell before the end of the year to lock in your gains and pay taxes on them at the capital gains rate of 0 this will prevent you from paying a higher rate on those gains later   conversely if you lose money in a year do n't sell you can sell and lock in losses during years when your taxes are high presumably after college to reduce your tax burden in those years this is called tax loss harvesting sounds like crazy but the name of the game is legally avoiding taxes   this is at least as important to your overall wealth as the decision of which funds to buy ok now the financial advisor   it 's up to you   you can make your own financial decisions and save the money but it requires you putting in the effort to be educated   for many of us this education is fun   also consider that if you use a regular broker like fidelity you can call up and they have people who for free will give you advice very similar to what you will get from the advisor you referred to   high priced financial advisors make more sense when you have a lot of money and complicated finances   based on your question you do n't strike me as having those   to me 1 sounds like a lot to pay for a simple situation like yours

my theory is that the massive swell of fear from 2008 until now has made people realize that they are never safe and that debt is the killer    when private sector incomes drop loss of job less consumer demand etc we can not afford to service our debt and this leads to catastrophic default with assets being lost to creditors on the other hand if you own your assets outright a significant and long lasting drop in income can usually be sustained or at least the assets are not lost   in a time of high risk to income like now it is better to pay down debt even if it means tightening the budget a bit better to lose some business utility now than to lose it all later to creditors   thanks for the post there is some interesting info in here i also find it interesting that these world class economists are presenting these horribly ugly excel graphs

depends on the country whether its a currency issuer with floating exchange rate and what the debt is denominated in for instance the us has no real debt b c its all in us dollars and can be printed at any time it has no need to borrow anything it issues its own currency it used to be different 4 decades ago on the gold standard so in general people still think currency issuers need to borrow or earn to spend just a relic in thinking   but when the country does not issue its own currency then it does need to earn or borrow in order to spend in this case it could borrow from anywhere that will lend it money in us a state would fit this description or greece as it borrowed euros for which it is not an issuer of   edit just came across this blog its title where does the money come from maybe he saw this question anyway the us does not need to borrow money why would it borrow what it creates from the video thinking is hard that 's why we do n't do it a lot great line

i did this 20 years ago i wanted desperately to quit my job but my wife would n't let me not because she thought it would fail but just because she thought it would take longer than i thought it took us 2 or 3 years to get to roughly half my previous salary as a software engineer it 's been my full time job for 15 years now it 's much better to not have enough time to finish x y or z on your startup than to have finished it and be waiting for someone to show up and pay i agree with do n't quit your day job until you are very confident your startup can support you and is making money validate your startup idea early in the words of the lean startup movement fail early   this is absolutely critical starting a company requires extreme confidence succeeding requires extreme humility and a willingness to face your mistakes because how else can you improve you 've clearly got the confidence now you need to to be realistic and look at what could go wrong and how will i know that this is working there are some parts of a startup that require what i call calendar time it 's just elapsed time for things like you your landing page and you 're a b testing whether that improves things   and you wait for a week or two you are waiting for a contractor to finish something on your website 's payment feature   read the lean startup and similar books to get an idea of all the things you 'll need to do   you 'll need to

i would n't be too concerned yet   you 're young   many young people are living longer in the family home   see this guardian article young adults delay leaving family home   you 're in good company   yet there will come a time when you ought to get your own place either for your own sanity or your parents sanity   you should be preparing for that and building up your savings since you 've got an income you should if you 're not already put away some of that money regularly   every time you get paid make a point of depositing a portion of your income into a savings or investment account   look up the popular strategy called pay yourself first since you still live at home it 's possible you 're a little more loose with spending money than you should be at least i 've found that to be the case with some friends who lived at home as young adults   so perhaps pretend you 're on your own   what would your rent be if you had to find a place of your own   if say £ 600 instead of the £ 200 you 're currently paying then you should reduce your spending to the point where you can save at least £ 400 per month   follow a budget with respect to your car it 's great you recognize your mistake   we 're human and we can learn from our mistakes   plan to make it your one and only car mistake   i made one too with respect to your credit card debt it 's not an insurmountable amount   focus on getting rid of that debt soon and then focus on staying out of debt   the effective way to use credit cards is to never carry a balance i.e. pay it off in full each month   if you ca n't do that you 're likely overspending also look at what pensions your employer might offer if they offer matching contributions contribute at least as much to maximize the tax free extra pay this equates to if you have access to a defined benefit plan join it as soon as you are eligible last i think it 's important to recognize that at age 23 you 're just starting out   much of your career income earning potential is ahead of you   strive to be the best at what you do get promotions and increase your income   meanwhile continue to save a good portion of what you earn   with discipline you 'll get where you want to be

ok i 'll ask does the job offer a 401(k matching deposits you see the answers given depend on your risk tolerance there are two schools of thought one extreme will tell you not to start investing until you have the emergency fund set up the other start from day one i accept there are pros and cons to either approach   but if you have access to a matched 401(k even a conservative risk adverse approach might agree that a 100 match on the first say 5 of your income is preferable to saving in a low return emergency fund if the emergency occurs a low interest loan for the need is a cheap way out since the money goes in pre tax and is matched being able to borrow out half irs rules effectively lets you borrow more than you deposited out of pocket and the word emergency implies a low occurrence event deposit to the match and start the emergency fund in another account   if no matched 401(k at work the other two answers are great   edit to clarify and answer a comment below say the risk is n't just a money emergency but job loss $ 1000 deposited to the 401(k cost $ 850 out of pocket assuming 15 bracket after the match it 's $ 2000 after the job loss if this is withdrawn if the 15 still applies it may be 10 or even 0 the net is $ 1700 less the 10 penalty or $ 1500 back in your pocket   there are those who will say they are just not comfortable running an emergency account so lean i understand that for the op here $ 800/mo is nearly $ 10,000 per year if even half of that can be deposited pre tax and matched the account will grow very quickly and there would still be cash on the side

the reason why we have lots of idle capacity is because we have over capitalized   fed has kept rates far too low for far too long and it incorrectly encouraged producers to over build   if rates where not manipulated so much to the low side than producers would not have built so much capacity and utilization would n't be a issue   the low rates also encouraged consumers to take out loans and to also not save so that they could buy excess supply   but all it did was made everyone go into debt to levels and eventually bankruptcy over the last few decades gov and fed reserve have been stimulating printing lowering rates to prevent the vicious cycle from crashing but eventually it crashed under its own weight   we have n't seen the end yet because we need to go down more before we can start gong back up

yes you do have to pay taxes in the uk as well but it depends on how much you have already been taxed in the us say you have to pay 20 tax in the uk for your earnings here you are required to pay the same percentage on your foreign income as well now if your home country already taxed you at 10 for the sake of example then you only need to pay the remaining 10 in the uk however the tax law in the uk does allow you to choose between arising basis and remittance basis on your income from the country you are domiciled in what i have explained above is based on when income arises but the laws are complicated and you are almost always better off by paying it on arising basis

how much is rent in your area you should compare a rental payment versus your mortgage payment now bearing in mind the opportunity cost of the difference let 's say that a rental unit in your area that has the same safety convenience as your house costs $ 1600 per month to rent and your mortgage is $ 2400 by staying in the house you are losing that $ 800 month as well as interest earned on banking that money however right now interest rates are negligible factor in total cost of ownership too meaning extra utilities for one or the other sometimes houses are cheaper sometime not property insurance and taxes for the house if they are n't already in escrow through your mortgage and generic house repair stuff   if the savings for a rental are worth more than a couple hundred a month then i suggest you consider bailing start multiplying $ 500 1000 per month out over a year or two and decide if that extra cash is better for you than crappy credit also this is not the most ethical thing but i do know of one couple who stopped paying their mortgage for several months knowing they were going to give the house back at the end they took what they would have spent in mortgage payments during that time into a savings account and will have more than enough cash to float for the few years that their credit is lowered by the default also something to consider is that we are in a time of ridiculous numbers of people defaulting as such a poor credit score might start to be more common among people with decent incomes to the point where a poor score in 5 years is worth about the same as an average score today i would n't count on that but it might soften the blow of your bad credit if you default

the key difference i 've found between a stock split and a stock dividend of the exact same stock and class as opposed to a spin off seems to be from the company 's own accounting perspective   there does n't appear to be any actual transfer of value to the shareholder with either kind of transaction i.e. in theory each transaction would be immaterial to the value of your holdings with respect to the company 's accounting a stock split affects the par value of the shares whereas a stock dividend reduces the retained earnings account in order to increase paid in or contributed capital i found a good online source which explains the history behind this accounting difference hill intermediate accounting ebook chapter 18 stock dividends and splits small quote    besides being based on fallacious reasoning accounting for stock    dividends by artificially earned capital as invested    capital conflicts with the reporting objective of reporting    shareholders equity by source despite these limitations this    outdated accounting standard still applies since neither the corporation nor its shareholders apparently benefits    from stock dividends why do companies declare occasionally a    company tries to give shareholders the illusion that they are    receiving a real dividend another reason is merely to enable the corporation to take advantage    of the accepted accounting practice of capitalizing retained earnings    specifically a company might wish to reduce an existing balance in    retained earnings otherwise available for cash dividends so it can    reinvest the earned assets represented by that balance without    carrying a large balance in retained earnings there 's a lot more on that page before and after worth reading from another book google books comparative income taxation a structural analysis page stock dividends small quote the distribution of dividends in the form of stock or bonus shares    to existing shareholders typically involves a transfer for corporate    law purposes of retained earnings into stated capital    it can been sic viewed as a deemed distribution of a cash    dividend to the shareholders followed by a corresponding contribution    to capital or as solely as an event at the corporate level which has    no effect on the shareholders whose economic interest in the    corporation is unchanged by the receipt of additional shares the    systems have taken varied approaches to the stock dividend problem     the treatment is in part a function of the rules dealing with    distributions of stated capital above are mine continues w descriptions of different countries tax treatments of the kinds of stock dividends includes u.s. sweden japan    netherlands canada australia u.k. france germany as far as why a corporation might want to capitalize earnings and reduce the equity otherwise available for dividends i can only imagine that ignoring taxes for a moment that it may have something to do with capital ratios that need to be maintained for financing or regulatory purposes   yet i remain curious if i discover more on this then i 'll update my answer additional resources

with reference to the uk structured deposits should not be confused with structured products   structured deposits are often quite simple deposit accounts you place your money into what is essentially a deposit account and are therefore guaranteed not to lose your capital as with any other deposit account the attraction is that you could earn more than you would in a normal deposit account often around double due to indirect exposure to the markets another benefit is that structured deposits can form part of your annual cash isa allowance so the returns can be tax free these products are popular with those who have savings which they are happy to deposit away for between 3 and 6 years and are looking for better rates of return than standard cash isas or savings accounts the main drawback is that you may not receive anything other than your original deposit that poses a minimal risk if your savings are earning less than 1 currently   see my article at for a more rounded overview of the structured deposits

once a debt has gone to a debt collector you have to work with the debt collector to settle your debt essentially the department store sold your debt to the debt collector so they do n't have to deal with it anymore you have rights when contacted by debt collectors you can negotiate a deal so that the amount you actually pay is lower than what you owe it is illegal for them to quote you for a higher amount than what you actually owe also they ca n't threaten you or pretend to be a credit bureau your best bet is to work with them and negotiate a better payment do n't give up collectors often times purchase the debt for a very low amount so even if you pay less than what you actually owe the collector will still make a profit

i am assuming you mean derivatives such as turbo 's or factors when you say derivatives these derivatives are rather popular in european markets in such derivatives a bank borrows the leverage to you and depending on the leverage factor you may own between 50 to + -3 of the underlying value the main catch with such derivatives from stocks as opposed to owning the stock itself are counterpart risk the bank could go bankrupt in which case the derivatives will lose all their value even if the underlying stock is sound or the bank could decide to phase out the certificate forcing you to sell in an undesirable situation spread costs the bank will sell and buy the certificate at a spread price to ensure it always makes a profit the spread can be 1 5 or even 10 pips which can translate to a the bank taking up to 10 of your profits on the spread   price complexity the bank buys and sells the long certificate at a price that is proportional to the price of the underlying value but it usually does so in a rather complex way if the share rises by € 1 the long certificate will also rise but not by € 1 often not even by leverage € 1   the factors that go into determining the price are   are normally documented in the prospectus of the certificate but that may be hard to find on the internet furthermore the bank often makes the calculation complex on purpose to commissions or other kickbacks to itself in it 's certificate prices   double commissions you will have to pay your broker the commission costs for buying the certificate however the bank that issues the derivative certificate normally makes you pay the commission costs they incur by hiding them in the price of the certificate by reducing your effective leverage in effect you pay commissions twice once directly for buying the derivative and once to the bank to allow it to buy the stock   so as havoc p says there is no free lunch the bank makes you pay for the convenience of providing you the leverage in several ways as an alternative futures can also give you leverage but they have different downsides such as margin requirements however even with all the all the drawbacks of such derivative certificates i think that they have enough benefits to be useful for short term investments or speculation

you need to do a bit more research and as @littleadv often wisely advises consult a professional in this case a tax layer or cpa you are not allowed to just pull money out of a property and write off the interest   from deducting mortgage interest faqs if you own rental property and borrow against it to buy a home the    interest does not qualify as mortgage interest because the loan is not    secured by the home itself interest paid on that loan ca n't be    deducted as a rental expense either because the funds were not used    for the rental property the interest expense is actually considered    personal interest which is no longer deductible this is not exactly your situation of course but it illustrates the restriction that will apply to you   elsewhere in the article it references how if used for a business the interest deduction still will not apply to the rental but to the business via schedule c.   in your case it 's worse you can never deduct interest used to fund a tax free bond or to invest in such a tax favored product   putting the facts aside i often use the line do n't let the tax tail wag the investing dog borrowing in order to reduce taxes is rarely a wise move if you look at the interest on the 90 k vs 290 k you 'll see you are paying in effect on the extra 200 k due the higher rate on the entire sum elsewhere on this board there are members who would say that given the choice to invest or pay off a 4 mortgage paying it off is guaranteed and the wiser thing to do i think there 's a fine line and might not be so quick to pay that loan off an after tax 3 cost of borrowing is barely higher than inflation but to borrow at over 5 to invest in an annuity product whose terms you did n't disclose does seem right to me borrow to invest in the next property that 's another story

for a long time i thought that all the nice things that i live with i could only have because other people somewhere in the world went with less that i had a nice life only because through magical economy and forced servitude someone else had a bad life then i heard the parable of specialization   there are 3 people alice is a farmer bob is a farmer and charlie is a candlestick maker every person needs to eat 1 potato and 1 egg every day to live there is no money   alice has always had a knack for making eggs and trained herself to become even better bob has a nice field with soil and so is quite good at making potatoes alice spends her morning making 2 eggs and her afternoon making 1 potato while bob uses his morning to make 1 egg and his afternoon to make 2 potatoes   in the evening alice brings her 1 extra egg to charlie trades it for a 1-hour candle goes back home to eat her 1 egg and 1 potato and read her book for an hour before going to bed bob does the same thing except he trades his 1 extra potato for a 1-hour candle charlie can make 1 1-hour candle in the morning and 1 1-hour candle in the afternoon he eats the 1 egg and 1 potato he got and goes to bed   one day alice and bob meet at their fence and talk about the books they 're reading and how they can only read for 1 hour each night and how much food they each produce then they get an idea and agree on a new plan   now alice spends her morning making 2 eggs and her afternoon making 2 eggs for a total of 4 eggs every day bob starts making potatoes only and makes 4 every day at the end of the day alice gives bob 1 egg in exchange for 1 potato alice then brings her 2 extra eggs to charlie and bob brings his extra 2 potatoes charlie now starts getting 2 eggs and 2 potatoes every day so he gets a lovely wife daniel from the next county over and trains her to make 1-hour candles she 's just as good as charlie and makes 2 per day   so now alice gets 2 1-hour candles for her 2 extra eggs and reads for 2 hours every night before bed she 's happy bob also gets 2 1-hour candles for his 2 extra potatoes and reads for 2 hours before bed he 's also happy charlie uses the 2 eggs and 2 potatoes he gets to feed himself and daniel every day and charlie and daniel play in bed every night charlie and daniel are happy   and so because of specialization we start with 3 unhappy people and end with 4 happy people and 0 unhappy people good lives can be gotten without making other people suffer

gt;i appreciate the detailed responses truthfully however i feel like at least half of your points are either just for its sake alone display a deep lack of understanding of unions collective bargaining and the histories of both or ignore and cling to an and ultimately self defeating ideology   i feel the same way about your arguments but i still try to respond to the content of your arguments rather than my assumptions about them   gt;the law forces the two parties to sit at a table the law forces the two parties to discuss a few core things like wages    the law should not force any party to sit at any table that violates a party 's contract liberty   gt;the idea is since these worker employer disputes exist naturally making them at least sit at a table together and talking is helpful in avoiding ego and fueled disruptions where no one benefits   that 's nice that you think you know what 's better for other people than they do for themselves but that does n't give you a right to force them to any table a right to contract freedom means the right to dismiss any offer or refuse to even negotiate with a party   gt;if this you see this as a violation of one 's liberty i really do n't know what to say to that   then i guess we have fundamentally different ideas about what is freedom and what is not you seem to think that forcing someone to negotiate with a party against their will is not a violation of any of their rights   gt;i'm not saying i do n't believe you but citation needed   sorry i do n't have time to dig up citations now if i have time later i 'd be happy to do so all i could find now is an inverse correlation between the state of a country 's credit market and the rate of child labor     is an abundance of indirect empirical evidence discussed below concerning   the role of credit constraints and educational   however and   2002 test the hypothesis directly   they estimate a basic model of child labor determination for a panel of countries for the years 1950 60 1970 1980 and 1995     gt;&gt;the credit constraint variable is by the share in gdp of private credit issued by 10 deposit money banks   they find that a one standard deviation increase in the share of credit in gdp is associated with a 10 percent standard deviation decrease in child labor they conclude that families with access to credit are considerably less likely to put   children to work during a period of economic volatility than parents without access to credit   educating children first lead to an increase in productivity also what if the owners of the means of production only a few in an given area have incomes 100x greater than the workers    if there are efficient financial markets that allow parents to borrow money against the expected future increase in earnings from their children being educated then yes   in less developed economies these markets have not developed and the choice is often between death and child labor    gt;they seem to be producing enough wealth to support themselves only they 're not the beneficiaries    studies have shown that by and large parents act towards their children and only put them to work if it is in the children 's best interest e.g. page 32     together the evidence so far presented it   appears that the data are consistent with a model where the returns from child   labor do not accrue to the parents parents redistribute entirely these returns to their children in the form of lower labor supply and higher schooling plus possibly increased consumption 47   laws against child labor therefore will generally do more harm than good   gt;what 's the solution here   the solution is to let the process of economic development run its course until child labor is not necessary   gt;this is typical anti union propaganda and it 's funny you pull it out since it ignores your own ideology what interest would a union have in destroying the very industry it needs to exist answer none   a union is not a self interested party a union represents self interested parties who are not directly affected by the destruction of their industry 30 years into the future since they would have retired by then   many of the laws and union backed agreements that ended up destroying many of america 's industries took decades to have their full effect it was n't a case of a law being passed and the next year the industry going bankrupt   gt;i have no idea how one could come to this conclusion i can only assume it stems from the same old idea that employers are always paying out the most that they can afford   why should employers pay out the most they can afford and why should laws be passed to force employers to do so   the only reason people invest is to profit if all profits had to be paid to employees there would be no incentive to invest and therefore no increase in capital productivity   gt;i happen to have first hand knowledge that it 's false however when my workplace unionized recently one of around a dozen locations nationally and the only one to organize the company responded by increasing wages and benefits to all locations have any locations closed no has anyone been laid off no is the company still mad profitable yes   a general effect happens gradually over a course of decades and happens in the aggregate not in every case it will not be apparent in the short run and will not be manifested in every case in other words that unionization did not result in immediate bankruptcy of your industry does not prove that unionization does not have a negative effect over the average long term performance of industries and average long term increase in wages

you can take a shortcut and make a few cumulative transactions maybe just estimate how much of your spending landed in each of your budget categories but you will lose a lot of the value that you were building for yourself by tracking your spending during the earlier months i reconcile my budget and categorize my spending on a monthly basis it 's always a chore to pull out the big stack of receipts and plow through them but i 've learned the value of having an accurate picture of where all my money went there is no clean way to fake it you can either take the time and reconcile your spending or you can take a short cut it probably renders your efforts to track everything from the beginning of the year invalid though if you want to start over this month as you did at the beginning of the year that would probably be a cleaner way to reconcile things

short term the game is supply demand and how the various participants react to it at various prices on longer term prices start to better reflect the fundamentals within something like week to some month or two if there has not been any unique value affecting news then interest options market swing traders and such play bigger part with intraday the effects of available liquidity become very pronounced the market makers have algos that try to guess what type of client they have and they prefer to give high price to large buyer and low price to small buyer as intraday trader has spreads and commissions big part of their expenses and leverage magnifies those instead of being able to take advantage of the lower prices they prefer to stop out after small move against them in practise this means that when they buy low that low will soon be the midpoint of the day and high etc if they are still holding on buy and sell are similar to long call or long put options position and options are like insurance they cost you also the longer the position is held the more likely it is to end up with someone with ability to test your margin if you 're highly leveraged and constantly making your wins from the same source   risk management is also issue the leveraged pros trade through a company not sure if they 're able to open another such company and still open accounts after the inevitable

the uk does n't tax gifts or wealth so you do n't have to pay any tax on your existing savings or the money your parents transfer you if your parents lived in the uk then you might be potentially liable to inheritance tax on the money if they died less than seven years after giving it to you but if they live in japan this wo n't be relevant in theory you might have to pay tax on any interest received in the bank account while you live in the uk however this is likely to be very small and if you do n't have any other income then it 's highly unlikely this would apply as you can get up to £ 16,000 of interest without paying tax

ok looking at the balance sheet they have $ 42 m in cash but that is down from $ 325 m in december meanwhile their debt has increased from $ in december to $ as of june so their net cash has dropped by $ m in only 6 months it looks like they spent $ m give or take buying other companies in those 6 months otherwise their working capital an important measure of the ability to run the business looks ok at $ looking at the income statement they are making money $ m in the last quarter on revenue of $ m which is quite remarkable however they had an unusual item which increased earnings somewhat otherwise their earnings would have been about $ 39 m which is still pretty healthy   all in the company itself looks healthy and on a bit of a buying binge growing through acquisition i do n’t like the debt load but that is probably usual for the industry   when companies grow through acquisition they generally plan to reduce total employment because of redundancies because you sort of get economies of scale this usually factors into the decision to buy the company you increase revenues through the purchase and reduce costs by eliminating employees this is typically how they sell an acquisition to investors   if i was to guess and it would only be a guess this company has a team which looks at the employees of the company it just bought and decides where to downsize it may not downsize from the newly acquired company but from its own existing employees for a variety of reasons so most likely that is what you were a victim of it was n’t because the company was struggling or because you were necessarily not a good employee it is a process albeit sometimes unfair and you were a victim of it   the layoff decisions are not always prudent and it can be hard to understand why a particular group was cut instead of another one management does n’t always make the right call the broadcast industry has been going through consolidation companies buying companies for some time now most likely management is hoping to bulk up to make it harder for another company to buy it and/or to get a better price when it is bought    so in summary most likely they are doing this for reasons of greed ie they ’ll make more money with fewer employees sorry about your situation

logically yes legally no any reasonable definition of an investment must include some types of gambling and insurance lottery tickets specifically are really crappy high risk high return investment   obviously most people try to avoid investments with a negative average expected future value but from a purely semantic perspective anything with a potential future value is an investment conversely anyone with a gambling problem should not pretend they are not gambling when making focused investments in high volatility stock options that said the irs taxes gains and losses differently depending on whether they are classified as gambling or just crappy investing so you will not be able to deduct your gambling losses from your earned income unlike investment losses which can be deducted up to per year

when you want to short a stock you are trying to sell shares that you are borrowing from your broker therefore you need buyers for the shares you are selling   the ask prices represent people who are trying to sell shares and the bid prices represent people who are trying to buy shares using your example you could put in a limit order to short sell 1000 shares at $ meaning that your order would become the ask price at $   there is an ask price ahead of you for 500 shares at $ 3.00   so people would have to buy those 500 shares at $ 3.00 before anyone could buy your 1000 shares at $ but it 's possible that your order to sell 1000 shares at $ never gets filled if the buyers do n't buy all the shares ahead of you   the price could drop to $ 1.00 without hitting $ and you will have missed out on the trade if you really wanted to short 1000 shares you could use a market order   let 's say there 's a bid for 750 shares at $ 2.50 and another bid for 250 shares at $   if you entered a market order to sell 1000 shares your order would get filled at the best bid prices so first you would sell 750 shares at $ 2.50 and then you would sell 250 shares at $ i was just using your example to explain things   in reality there wo n't be such a wide spread between the bid and ask prices   a stock might have a bid price of $ 10.50 and an ask price of $ so there would only be a 1 cent difference between putting in a limit order to sell 1000 shares at $ and just using a market order to sell 1000 shares and getting them filled at $ 10.50 also your example probably would n't work in real life because brokers typically do n't allow people to short stocks that are trading under $ 5 per share as for your question about how often you are unable to make a short sale it can sometimes happen with stocks that are heavily shorted and your broker may not be able to find any more shares to borrow also remember that you can only short stocks with a margin account you can not short stocks with a cash account

yes they 're often a beneficial choice because it means you are earning the interest on the money instead of the government you wo n't necessarily pay taxes on it you have many options once you reach the point of wanting to do something with the money many people accumulate the wealth and then pass it down to subsequent generations without paying tax which is perfectly legal if done right others make donations to charity   those are just a couple examples but the point is that you accumulated the wealth over a long period of time and bought yourself time to decide what to do with it edit no if the investor decides to cash the money out all at once at the end it would not be equivalent assuming you had $ 1,000 to put in an account and could get a 5 return on your money and you were in the 25 tax rate the tax free account ends up with more in the end mostly by virtue of the compounding being tax free

joke warning these days it seems that rogue trading programs are the big market makers this concludes the joke historically exchange members were market makers one or more members guaranteed a market in a particular stock and would buy whatever you wanted to sell or vice versa in a balanced market one where there were an equal number of buyers and sellers the spread was indeed profit for them to make this work market makers need an enormous amount of liquidity ability to hold an inventory of stocks to deal with temporary imbalances and a day like october 29 1929 can make that liquidity evaporate i say historically because i do n't think that any stock market works this way today i was discussing this very topic with a colleague last week went to wikipedia to look at the structure of the nyse and saw no mention of exchange members as market makers in fact it appears that the nyse is no longer a member based exchange instead today most all trading happens on electronic crossing networks where the spread is simply the difference between the highest bid and lowest ask in a liquid stock there will be hundreds if not thousands of orders clustered around the current price usually diverging by fractions of a cent in an illiquid stock there may be a spread but eventually one bid will move up or one ask will move down or new bids will come in you could claim that an entity with a large block of stock to move takes the role of market maker but it does n't have the same meaning as an exchange market maker since there 's no entity between the bidder and asker there 's no profit in the spread just a fee taken   by the ecn edit i think you have a misconception of what the spread is it 's simply the difference between the highest bid and the lowest offer at the instant a trade takes place the spread is 0 the highest bid equals the lowest offer and the bidder and seller exchange shares for money as soon as that trade is completed the spread re appears the only way that a trade happens is if buyer and seller agree on price the traditional market maker is simply an entity that has the ability to buy or sell an effectively unlimited number of shares however if the market maker sets a price and there are no buyers then no trade takes place and if there 's another entity willing to sell shares below the market maker 's price then the buyers will go to that entity unless the market 's rules forbid it

this falls under value investing and value investing has only recently picked up study by academia say at the turn of the therefore there is n't much rigorous on value investing in academia but it has started however we can describe valuations in short valuations are randomly distributed in a log variance gamma fashion with some reason nonsense mixed in you can check for yourself on   you can basically download the entire us market and then some with many financial and technical characteristics all in one spreadsheet re fisher he was tied for the best monetary economist of the 20th century and created the best price index but as for stocks he said this famous quote 12 days before the 1929 crash stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau i do not feel there will be soon if ever a 50 or 60 point break from present levels such as bears have predicted i expect to see the stock market a good deal higher within a few months    irving fisher ph.d. in economics oct. 17 1929 edit value investing has almost always been ignored by academia   irving fisher and other proponents of it before it was codified by graham in the mid 20th century certainly did n't help with comments like the above   it was almost always believed that it was a sucker 's game the bigger sucker game to be more precise because value investors get destroyed during recession collapses   so even though a economy would allow value investors and everyone never to suffer collapses value investors are looked down upon by academia because of the inevitable yet nearly always collapse   this expresses that sentiment perfectly it did n't help that benjamin graham did n't care about money so never reached the heights of buffett who frequently with bill gates as the richest person on the planet   buffett has given much credibility and academia finally caught on around in 2000 or so after he was proven right about a pending tech collapse that nearly no one believed would happen at least that 's where i begin seeing papers being published into value concepts   if one looks harder academia 's even taken the torch and discovered some very useful tools yes investment firms and fellow value investors kept up the information publishing but they are not academics the days of professors throwing darts at the stock listings and beating active managers despite most active managers losing to the market anyways really held back this side of academia until buffett entered the and embarrassed them all with his club 's performance in the article which is still relatively ignored   before that it was the obsession with beta the ratio of a security 's variance to its covariance to the market a now abandoned theory because it has been utterly discredited the of beta have embraced the p b not giving the satisfaction to buffet by the p e.    tiny technology firms receive ridiculous valuations because a long surviving tiny tech firm usually does n't stay small for long thus will grow at huge rates   this is why any solvent and many insolvent tech firms receive large valuations risk adjusted they should pay out huge on average   still most fall by the dead and those 100 p s valuations quickly crumble valuations are influenced by growth   one can see this expressed more easily with a growing perpetuity where p is price i is income r is the rate of return and g is the growth rate of i.   rearranging r looks like here one can see that a higher p relative to i will dull the expected rate of return while a higher g will boost it it 's fun for us value investor traders to say that the market is totally inefficient   that 's a stretch   it 's not perfectly inefficient but it 's efficient   valuations are clustered very tightly around the median but there are mistakes that even us little guys can exploit and teach the smart money a lesson or two if one were to look at a distribution of rs see that they 're even more tightly packed   so while it looks like p es are all over the place industry to industry rs are much more well clustered tech finance and frequently have higher growth rates so higher p es yet average rs   utilities and non have lower growth rates so lower p es yet average rs

is this really a net effect of concentration of wealth when so few people hold all the money you need more money to keep the system running imagine we need 10 trillion to keep the economy running if 1000 people hold 50 you effectively need 5 trillion just to keep the economy running   it is somewhat ironic that the last time we had full employment was basically the real estate bubble where tons of money was dumped into the system by liar loans with no credit check   not saying we want to go back there but perhaps we need that level of money in the system to get full employment if we want to get there safely we need to buy back our debt invest more in our infrastructure and provide more services this is the only way we are going to get full employment

a key principle of economics is sunk costs are irrelevant you bought the stock at 147 and it has now fallen to 144 that 's too bad this has nothing to do with whether it is wise or foolish to buy shares at 144 the only relevant thing to consider is do i expect the stock to go up or down from 144 you have lost $ 3 per share on the original buy buying more shares will not reduce your loss in any way suppose you bought 100 shares at 147 the price then drops to 144 you have lost $ 3 per share or $ 300 total you buy another 50 more shares at 144 the price stays at 144 so your average purchase price is now 147 x 100 + 144 x 50 150 = 146 so i guess you could say that your average loss per share is now only $ 2 but it 's $ 2 x 150 shares instead of $ 3 x 100 shares you still lost $ 300 you did n't reduce your loss by a penny maybe it made you feel better that you reduced your average loss per share but this is just an arithmetic game if you believe that the stock will continue to drop than buying more shares just means you will lose even more money your average loss per share may go down but you 're just multiplying that average by more and more shares of course if you believe that the stock is now at an low price and it will likely go back up then sure buy if you buy at 144 and it goes back up to 147 then you 'll be making $ 3 per share on the new shares you purchased but i repeat whether or not you buy more shares should have nothing to do with your previous buy buy more shares if you think the price will go up from the present price do n't buy more shares if you do n't think it will go up the decision should be exactly the same as if you had never previously bought shares i 'm assuming here that you are a typical small investor that you not buying enough shares to have any significant effect on the market nor that you are in a position to buy enough shares to take control of the company

i feel like this has nothing to do with income and as such rmds will not really help or harm you after a person passes credit card companies are unlikely to collect any outstanding balance   debts can not be inherited however assets can be made to stand for debts   many assets pass to heirs without the probate process and in some cases all of them pass this way   this leaves creditors with nothing and having to write off the balance even if assets do pass through probate heirs may dispute the creditors   in that case credit card balances may not be high enough justify hiring a lawyer to fight for payment or if they do the judge may be and offer nothing or pennies on the dollar     the bottom line is that they probably see you or your demographic as a poor credit risk and reduced their exposure by lowering your limit   while that is not what they told you they probably have to carefully structure what they say to avoid any discrimination claims

assuming you were in math with your cs degree the book a non random walk down wall street by andrew lo is a very interesting book about the random walk hypothesis and it 's application to financial markets and how efficient markets might not necessarily imply complete randomness     lots of higher level concepts in the book but it 's an interesting topic if you are trying to branch out into the quant world   the book is n't very specific towards algorithmic trading but it 's good for concept and ideas   especially for general finance that will give you a good run down about markets and the way we tackle modern finance     a random walk down wall street which the book above is named after by burton malkiel is also supposed to be a good read and many have suggested reading it before the one i listed above but there really is n't a need to do so     for investing specifically many mention the intelligent investor by benjamin graham who is the role model for the infamous warren buffet   it 's an older book and really dry and i think kind of out dated but mostly still relevant   it 's more specifically about individual trading rather than markets as a whole or general markets   it sounds like you want to learn more about markets and finance rather than simply trading or buying stocks   so i 'd stick to the andrew lo book first       also since you might not know it would be a good idea to understand the capital asset pricing model free cash flow models and maybe some dividend discount models the last of which is n't so much relevant but good foundations for your finance knowledge   they are models using various financial concepts tvm is almost used in every case and utilizing them in various ways to model certain concepts   you 'd most likely be in many of these topics by reading a math oriented finance book   try to stay away from those penny stock trading books i do n't think i need to tell a math major who is probably much smarter than i am that you do n't need to be engaging in penny stocks but do your dd and come to a conclusion yourself if you 'd like   i 'm not sure what career path you 're trying to go down personal trading quant firm analyst regular analyst etc etc but it sounds like you have the credentials to be doing quant trading       check out   it 's a website with a python engine that has all the necessary libraries installed into the website which means you do n't have to go through the trouble yourself and yes it is fucking trouble you need a very outdated os to run one of the libraries   it has a lot of resources to get into algorithmic trading and you can begin coding immediately   you 'd need to learn a little bit of python to get into this but most of it will be using or some other library and its own personal syntax learning about alpha factors and the pipeline api is also moderately difficult to get down but entirely possible within a short amount of dedicated time      also if you want to get into algorithmic trading check out on youtube   he 's a python programmer who does a lot of videos on this very topic and has his own tool on quantopian called sentiment analyzer or something like that which basically sentiment around any given security using web to scrape various news and media outlets   crazy cool stuff being developed over there and if you 're good you can even be partnered with investors at quantopian and share in profits     you can also deploy your algorithms through the website onto various trading platforms such as robinhood and another broker and run your algorithms yourself     lots of cool stuff being developed in the finance sector right now   modern corporate finance and investment knowledge is built on quite old and insights so expect a lot of things to change in today 's world     with a math degree finance should be like algebra i back in the day   you just got ta get familiar with all of the different rules and ideas and concepts   there is n't that much difficult math until you begin getting into higher level finance and theory which mostly deals with statistics anyways like covariance and regression and other statistic related concepts   any other math is simple arithmetic

you should look at the opportunity cost for your money i.e. what kind of return it could generate otherwise   we took advantage of these types of offer zero interest for x months in the past with the goal to redirect the money to the mortgage it was 7.5 back then and we made sure we do n't get hosed by the surprisingly high interest rate by having a big reminder in the bulletin board in the kitchen to make sure we pay off the money before the interest rate kicks in   so we basically reduced our interest on the mortgage during that period   oh we use an all in one account one so that was real nice i would stay away from those interest deferred offers it 's totally not worth it

the shift to trading at the close began in 2008 traders did not want to be caught off guard by surprise news and there was a lot of volatility during the financial crisis so they would close their position in the evening that s how it began there are two reasons why it sticks around first there has been an increase usage of index funds or passive funds these funds tend to update their positions at the end of the day from the wsj another factor behind the shift has been the proliferation of passively managed investments such as index funds these funds aim to mimic an index like the s&p 500 by owning the shares that comprise it index funds do n’t trade as often as active investors but when they do it is typically near the market close traders say that is because buying or selling a stock at its closing price better aligns their performance with the index they are trying to emulate the second reason is simply that volume attracts volume as a result of what s mentioned above you have a shift to end of day trading and the to that is that there is a liquidity shortage from 10 am to 3 pm thus if you want to buy or sell a stock but there are few buyers or sellers around you will significant move the price when you enter your order obviously this does not affect retail traders but imagine hedge funds entering or closing a billion dollar position it can make a huge impact on price and one way to mitigate that is to wait until there are more market participants to take the other end of your trade just as at the end of the day so this is a self reinforcing trend that has begun in the markets and will likely stick around

i 've done exactly what you are describing and it was a great move for me a few years back i had two credit cards one had a $ 6000 balance and a fairly high interest rate that i was making steady payments to including interest   the other was actually tied to a heloc home equity line of credit whose interest rate was fixed to prime which was very low at the time i think my effective rate on the card was around 3   so i pulled out one of the cash advance checks from the heloc account and paid off the $ 6000 balance then i started making my monthly payments against the balance on the heloc and paid it off a bit more quickly and with less overall money spent because i was paying way less interest another similar tactic is to find a card that does n't charge fees for balance transfers and that has a 0 interest rate for the first 12 months on transferred balances i am pretty sure they are out there open an account on that card transfer the balance to it and pay it down within 12 months and try not to use the card for anything else if you can help it

it looks like with the sale of your current home you have enough liquidity to obtain credit on the best terms without tapping your wife 's ira the biggest factor to consider is the deduction on mortgage interest which reduces the effective interest on your mortgage significantly particularly as you jump into a higher tax bracket along these lines deferred retirement savings should have a higher priority than paying down the mortgage or your student loans student loans should probably be your biggest priority to pay down with the mortgage deduction a 4 rate becomes effectively a 3.4 rate if you are in the 15 bracket but as low as 2.6 effective rate if you are in the 35 bracket both of these are lower than the 3.5 rate that you can get on the student loans after refinancing   this also assumes you are n't hit with the amt this is probably worth the cost of a quick consultation with a tax professional to go over these options and how they affect your taxes

for example started an animation studio and production developing company to produce something in the ballpark of $ and he had a $ 12k yearly salary i have no clue what you mean as others have mentioned i 'm not sure what the 12 million refers to   do you mean total cost of created by the company in a year or   if so 12 million would amount to say 5 to 20 major brand name tv commercials for example   do you mean the cost of plant so for a tv commercial production company you mean purchasing desks drawing pads and so on your specific example of a film or tv commercial production company is a bad example it 's not really a business that is to say it does not rely on capital and return on capital the way famous film or tv commercial production companies happens is precisely like this a young guy girl g perhaps a designer or is working just as you say for a menial wage at a film company g got that first job perhaps out of art school   g gets a chance at doing a photo shoot animation or helping direct a tv commercial   g does a fantastic job later that year a large important animation or commercial job arrives at the company due to the earlier excellent result g is allowed to work on the new one g again he does a fantastic job   soon within that company g is a highly regarded or director and has attracted fame amongst colleagues and clients eventually g hears of a company xyz hotel that needs a tv ad made or an animation or whatever g says to xyz look you could spend $ 230,000 with a production company and in reality they 'd have me direct it anyway i 'm leaving to work independently so i will do your job for only $ 190,000 in a word xyz says yes and hands over a cheque for $ 190,000   g spends $ 160,000 on the usual actors editing etc and uses 2 months of g 's own time and pockets $ 5000 after tax g then does n't get a job for a couple months and then gets three more in the new year because the commercial for xyz was so good xyz gave him another couple to do for another product line eventually g has just enough money coming in that he hires a few freelance people for a few weeks here and there a and so on   eventually g has enough tv ads solidly booked g can risk actually hiring long time friend p as a producer   p spends most of her time actually bringing in more work and it builds from there eventually you have a very busy well known in the industry tv commercial production company with many staff and endless clients example say it might be at some point in there say around year three g would like to borrow the odd million bucks to basically help with cashflow the answer to that is nothing more than through business contacts g knows a wealthy dentist whoever who is prepared to do that but note carefully that at that point g 's company is already very firmly established famous for doing 20 spectacular commercials and so on   note too that 999 times out of 1000 when this happens the money evaporates and the dentist d never sees a penny back in that case g only much much later once the company has many many staff and great cashflow could the production company actually borrow from a bank or perhaps from actual investors which is more what you have in mind regarding your four categories   numbers 1 and 3 are totally wrong they do not work at all like you are asking indeed the very simple answer is borrow money to start a category 1 or 3 type of business it 's totally the only exception would be if you literally just have an extremely rich uncle who loans you a few million to start an animation studio which would be completely   because in that example company xyz could not care less if you have an animation studio ie your uncle has given you a platinum card and you bought a building some drawing pads and a few dozen macs   xyz just could n't care less   all they care about is your folio of work   in this example rsa would get the job     my guess is you 're thinking people somehow magically go around borrowing money to get businesses like that started   your examples 1 and 3 the simple answer is they do n't and ca n't   your fears are

the same applies if you were looking for a business to buy would you pay more for a business that is doing well making increasing profits year after year or for a business that is not doing so well and is losing money a share in a company is basically a small part of a company which a shareholder can own so would you rather own a part of a company that is increasing profits year after year or one that is continuously losing money someone would buy shares in a company in order to make a better return than they could make elsewhere they can make a profit through two ways first a share of the company 's profits through dividends and second capital gains from the price of the shares going up why does the price of the shares go up over the long term when a company does well and increases profits because when a company increases profits they are making more and more money which increases the net worth of the company more investors would prefer to buy shares in a company that makes increasing profits because this will increase the net worth of the company and in turn will drive the share price higher over the long term a company 's increase in profits creates higher demand for the company 's shares think about it if interest rates are so low like they are now where it is hard to get a return higher than inflation why would n't investors then search for higher returns in good performing companies in the stock market more investors and traders wanting some of the pie creates higher demand for good performing stocks driving the share price higher the demand for these companies is there primarily because the companies are increasing their profits and net worth so over the long term the share price will increase in line with the net worth over the short to medium term other factors can also affect the share price sometime opposite to how the company is actually performing however this is a whole different answer to a whole different question

unless i am missing something subtle nothing happens to the buyer suppose alice wants to sell short 1000 shares of xyz at $ 5   she borrows the shares from bob and sells them to charlie   now charlie actually owns the shares they are in his account if the stock later goes up to $ 10 charlie is happy he could sell the shares he now owns and make a $ 5000 profit alice still has the $ 5000 she received from her short sale and she owes 1000 shares to bob   so she 's effectively $ 5000 in debt   if bob calls in the loan she 'll have to try to come up with another $ 5000 to buy 1000 shares at $ 10 on the open market    if she ca n't well that 's between her and bob   maybe she goes bankrupt and bob has to write off a loss    but none of this has any effect on charlie   he got the shares he paid for and nobody 's going to take them away from him   he has no reason to care where they came from or what sort of complicated transactions brought them into alice 's possession   she had them and she sold them to him and that 's the end of the story as far as he 's concerned

let 's say you should have paid $ 4000 in taxes in a year but you paid $ 5000 so you get a tax return of $ 1000 somebody thinks that you should have tried to only pay $ 4000 in the year and get zero tax return i hope he or she does n't think you should pay $ 5000 and mess up your tax return so you get no refund   once the end of the tax year is there you should do what you can to get as much tax returned as possible on the other hand you should also have tried to pay less during the year obviously every dollar you paid less is a dollar less refund

who are the losers going to be if you can tell me for certain which firms will do worst in a bear market and can time it so that this information is not already priced into the market then you can make money if not do n't try in a bull market stocks tend to act normally with established patterns such as correlations acting as expected and stocks more or less pricing to their fundamentals in a bear market fear tends to overrule all of those things you get large drops on relatively minor bad news and modest rallies on even the best news which results in stocks being undervalued against their fundamentals in the crash itself it is quite easy to make money shorting in an environment where stocks are undervalued such as a bear market you run the risk that your short no matter how sure you are that the stock will fall is seen as being undervalued and will rise in fact your selling of a losing stock might cause it to hit levels where value investors already have limits set this could bring a lot of buyers into the market due to the fact that correlations break down creating portfolios with the correct risk level which is what funds are required to do not only by their contracts but also by law to an extent is extremely difficult risk management keeping all kinds to within certain bounds is one of the most difficult parts of a manager 's job and is even difficult in abnormal market conditions in the long run definitions may vary stock prices in general go up for those companies who are n't bankrupted at least so shorting in a bear market is not a long term strategy either and will not produce long term returns on capital in addition to this risk you run the risk that your counterparty such as lehman brothers will file for bankruptcy and you wo n't be able to cover the position before the lender wants you to repay their stock to them landing you in even more problems

as others have said if you do n't have dependents there 's little need for life insurance if you ca n't think of any obvious beneficiary for an insurance policy than you probably do n't need one dependents here should be understood broadly it would n't necessarily be limited to wife and children if you 're the only support for your handicapped cousin for example you might want to provide for him but i take it from your question that you have no such special case of course even if you have no dependents now you might pick some up in the future and if and when that does happen your medical situation may have changed making it difficult to get life insurance but if you have no immediate plans so that any such even is likely to be far away a serious alternative to consider would be to invest the money you would have paid in insurance premiums then if someday you do acquire dependents you have a pot of money set aside to provide for them in case something happens to you if it 's not enough and you can get insurance at that time then great but if you ca n't get insurance at least there 's something if you never do acquire dependents you can consider that pot of money part of your retirement fund

lending of shares happens in the background those who have lent them out are not aware that they have been lent out nor when they are returned the borrowers have to pay any dividends to the lenders and in the end the borrowers get their stock back if you read the fine print on the account agreement for a margin account you will see that you have given the brokerage the permission to silently loan your stocks out   since the lending has no financial impact on your portfolio there 's no particular reason to know and no particular protection required   actually brokers typically do n't bother going through the work of finding an actual stock to borrow   as long as lots of their customers have stocks to lend and not that many people have sold short they just assume there is no problem and keep track of how many are long and short without designating which stocks are borrowed from whom when a stock becomes hard to borrow because of liquidity issues or because many people are shorting it the brokerage will actually start locating individual shares to borrow which is a more time consuming and costly procedure   usually this involves the short seller actually talking to the broker on the phone rather than just clicking sell

what is the best option to start with and   i am not sure about my goals right now but i do want to have a major retirement account without changing it for a long time that is a loaded question your goals should be set up first else what is stopping you from playing the mega millions lottery to earn the retirement amount instantly if you have the time and resources you should try doing it yourself it helps you learn and at a latter stage if you do n't have the time to manage it yourself you can find an adviser who does it for you to find a good adviser or find a fund who which can help you achieve your monetary goals you will need to understand the details how it works and other stuff behind it   when you are thrown terms at your face by somebody you should be able to join the dots and get a picture for yourself many a rich men have lost their money to unscrupulous people i.e. bernie madoff so knowing helps a lot and then you can ask questions or find for yourself to calm yourself i.e. ditch the fund or adviser when you see red flags it also makes you not to be too greedy when somebody paints you a picture of great returns because then your well oiled mind would start questioning the rationale behind such investments have a look at warren buffet he is an investor and you can follow how he does his investing it is simple but very difficult to follow investing through my bank i would prefer to stay away from them because their main service is banking and not allowing people to trade i would first compare the services provided by a bank to td ameritrade or any firm providing trading services the thing is as you mentioned in the question you have to go through a specific process of calling him to change your portfolio which should n't be a condition what might happen is if he is getting some benefits out of the it clarified in the first place if you intend to go through them from the side of the fund he might try to dissuade you from doing so to protect his stream of income and what if he is on a holiday or you can not get hold of him secondly from your question it seems you are n't that investing literate so it is very easy to get you confused by jargon and making you do what he gets the maximum benefit out of it rather than which benefits you more   i ai n't saying he is doing so but that could be a possibility too so you have consider that angle too the pro is that setting up an account through them might be much easier than directly going to a provider but the best point doing it yourself is you will learn and there is nothing which tops that you do n't want somebody else managing your money however knowledgeable they maybe i.e. anthony

i think the real answer to your question here is diversification   you have some fear of having your money in the market and rightfully so having all your money in one stock or even one type of mutual fund is risky as all get out and you could lose a lot of your money in such a stock market based investment   however the same logic works in your rental property   if you lose your and are unable to find a new one right away or if you have some very rare problem that insurance does n't cover your property could become very much not a break even investment very quickly   in reality there is n't any single investment you can make that has no risk   your assets need to be balanced between many different market investments that includes bonds us stocks european stocks cash etc   also investing in mutual funds instead of individual stocks greatly reduces your risk another thing to consider is the benefits of paying down debt   while investments have a risk of not performing if you pay off a loan with interest payments you definitely will save the money you would have paid in interest    to be specific i 'd recommend the following plan

the answers here are all correct   this is 100 scam beyond any reasonable doubt   do n't fall for it   however i felt it valuable to explain what would happen were you to fall for this   it 's not all that hard to understand but it involves understanding some of the time delays that exist in modern banking today the most important thing to understand is that depositing a check does not actually put dollars in your account even though it appears to   a check is not legal tender for debts public and private   it 's a piece of paper known as a bill of exchange   it 's an authorization for a payee you to request that their bank pay you the amount on the check   a transaction made with a check does not actually draw to a close until your bank and their bank communicate and cause the actual transfer of funds to take place   this process is called clearing the check despite living in the modern times this process is slow   it can take 7 10 days to clear a check especially if it is an international bank   this is not good for the banking business   you can imagine how difficult it would be to tell a poor client who is living paycheck to paycheck that he ca n't have his pay until the check clears a week later   banks have an interest in hiding this annoying feature of the modern banking system so they do   when you deposit a check the bank will typically advance you the money an interest free loan in effect while the check floats i.e. until it clears   this creates the illusion that the money is actually in your account for most intents and purposes   presumably a bank would distinguish between the floating check and a cleared check if you tried to close out your account but otherwise it looks and feels like the money is in your hands of course if the check is because the payer had insufficient funds or the account simply did not exist your bank will not get the money   at this moment they will cancel any advances you received and notify you that the check bounced   again this happens 7 10 days later the general pattern of this scam is that they will pay you by a method which clears slowly like a check   they will then ask you to withdraw the money using a faster clearing method like a wire transfer or withdrawing the cash   typically they will be encouraging you to move quickly they are on a timetable when their check bounces the game is up   at this time it will appear as though the account has a positive balance but in fact it has a negative balance plus an advance on the check   this looks great until 7 10 days later when the check bounces   at that time the bank will cancel the advance and reality will set in   you will now have an open bank account legally opened by you in your own name which is deeply in debt   meanwhile the scammer walks away with all the money that you sent them which cleared quickly there are many variants which can hide the details   some can play games with check kiting to try to make your first check clear then try to rope you in for a more painful hit   some will change the instruments they use checks are the easy ones so they 're simply most common   do n't try to think maybe this one is legit   these scammers literally make a living off of making shady transactions look legit things i would recommend looking out for

this is of course a perfectly normal thing to happen people trade up to a bigger house every day when you 've found a bigger house you want to move to and a buyer for your existing one you arrange closing dates for both i.e. the date on which the sale actually happens usually you make them very close either on the same day or with an overlap of a few weeks you use the equity i.e. the difference between the house value and the mortgage in the old house as the down payment on the new house you ca n't of course use the part of the old house that is mortgaged if the day you buy the new and sell the old is the same your banks and lawyers do everything for you on that day if there is an overlap then you need something called bridge financing to cover the period when you own two houses banks are used to doing this and it 's not really that expensive when you take into account all the other costs of moving house talk to them for details as a side note it is generally not to be worth buying a house if you only intended to live there one or two years the costs involved in the process of buying selling and moving usually outweigh any gains in house value you may find yourself with a higher down payment if you rent for a year or two and save up a down payment for your bigger house instead

i 'd be curious to compare current rent with what your overhead would be with a house most single people would view your current arrangement as ideal when those about to graduate college ask for money advice i offer that they should start by living as though they are still in college share a house or apartment and sack away the difference if you really want to buy and i 'd assume for this answer that you feel the housing market in your area has passes its bottom i 'd suggest you run the numbers and see if you can buy the house 100 yours but then rent out one or two rooms you do n't share your mortgage details just charge a fair price when the stars line up just right these deals cost you the down payment but the roommates pay the mortgage   i discourage the buying by two or more for the reasons mrchrister listed

i 'm probably going to get a bunch of downvotes for this but here 's my not very popular point of view i think many times we tend to shoot ourselves in the foot by trying to get too clever with our money in all our we forget a few basic rules about how money works it 's better to have 0 debt and a small amount of savings than lots of debt and lots of savings debt will bite you many times even the good mortgage debt will bite you i have several friends who have gotten mortgages only to find out they had to move long before they were able to pay it off and they were n't able to sell their homes or they sold at a loss when you have debt you are restricted someone else is always holding something over your head you 're bound to it pay it off asap within reason while putting a decent amount into a high yield savings account only after the debt is gone go and be clever with your money

yes money is created out of thin air and it is a good and necessary thing all money even commodity money such as gold is given value only by what can be traded for it so in that sense all money is created out of thin air because it represents the payment of a future debt money merely serves as ious between traders   who do you think should be responsible for adding money to the system been tried does n't work so well individual banks been tried does n't work so well nation states works a lot better although can still fail   so far having a central bank issue money as an economy needs it for trade has been the most successful method to deal with who gets to issue the ious   edit see my post above on a little how and why it works as it does

to short a stock you actually borrow shares and sell them the shorter gets the money from selling immediately and pays interest for the share he borrows until he covers the short the amount of interest varies depending on the stock it 's typically under 1 a year for large cap stocks but can be 20 or more for small illiquid or heavily shorted stocks in this scam only a few people own the shares that are lent to so they essentially have a monopoly and can set really high borrow costs the shorter probably assumes that a pump and dump will crash quickly so would n't mind paying a high borrow cost

in the united states taxes on the sale of a principal residence are based on the difference between the sale price and the cost of the home assuming you meet the requirements you can shelter 250,000 or 500,000 of gains from the sale of your principal residence   this calculation is not related to the loan balance the basic equation is sales price minus purchase price it get a little more complex because some costs to purchase and sell the home are included in the calculation or if you made renovations to the house that will increase your costs and decrease your gains trying to decrease the loan balance just before selling the house would just be paying yourself that money at the settlement table it could save you some money on interest between now and settlement but your bank account to save a few bucks does n't seem worth it i would also prefer to have the money in the bank to pay for some expenses that will getting the house sold you moving and the settlement date

first it 's an exaggeration to say every dollar traditional mutual funds including money market funds keep a small fraction of their assets in cash for day to day transactions maybe 1 if you invest $ 1 they put that in the cash bucket and issue you a share if you and 999 other people invest $ 100 each   not offset by people redeeming they take the aggregated $ 100,000 and buy a bond or two conversely if you redeem one share it comes out of cash but if lots of people redeem   they sell some to cover those redemptions which works as long as the can in fact be sold for close enough to their recorded value and this does n't mean they ca n't fail even though they are almost totally invested in securities   that are thought to be among the safest and most liquid available   in sufficiently extreme circumstances those investments can fall in market value   or they can become illiquid and unavailable to cover withdrawals redemptions etfs are also fully invested but the process is less direct you do n't just send money to the fund company instead thus as long as the underlyings for your etf hold their value which for a money market they are designed to and the markets are open and the market maker firms are operating your etf shares are well backed see for more

i came to us as an international student several years ago and i have also experienced the same situation like most of the international students in finding ways to build credit history below i list out some possible approaches you may want to consider i. get a student job at campus recommended i think the best way is to get a student job in university say a teaching assistant or student helper in this case you can be provided with a social security number and start to build your own credit history ii get credit card you can also consider to apply for a credit card there are indeed some financial institutions that can provide credit cards for international students with no or limited credit scores requirement say discover and bank of america however it is relatively hard to get approved simply because hey may put more restriction in other aspects for example you may be required to keep sufficient bank balance above several thousand dollars during a period of time or you should prove that you have relatives with citizenship in us who can provide your financial aid if needed iii apply for a loan recommended getting a loan product is another alternative to get out of this difficult situation but most of people do n’t realize that there are some fintech start ups in united states that specifically focus on international loan financing one representative example is an online lending company that specializes in providing car loan for international students with no ssn or credit history i once used their loan product to finance a honda accord and reported my loan transaction records to us credit bureau during my repayment process later when i officially got my ssn number i found my credit history has been automatically and i do n’t have to start from all over again it never be an easy journey for international students to build credit history in united states what approach you should make really depends on you own situation i hope the information above can be useful and good luck for your credit journey

as a company owner in europe that is correct the employee would be gone with iirc 80 pay for a full year   that   edit what employees also mostly do n't realize a bunch of similar ages females create a lot of drama seriously i 'm far from sexist but it always turns out like that if you have 3 + girls sitting together there will always be drama at some point and i mean bad vibe karma that makes you so angry you just want to fire them all out of frustration    but let me clarify i do hire women and i pay them the same amount i would pay a male employee if you can work like a man and there is no reason you ca n't you 're paid the same and you 're treated the same    i just got hyper selective of the characters i hire

you do n't need to hire a lawyer in general there are three things a lawyer might do 1 review the language of the deed of sale 2 review the terms of the mortgage if there is one 3 hire a title search company to do a title search if you do not want to do these things or want to do them yourself then you do not need a lawyer

if your gut told you to buy during the depths of 09 your gut might be well calibrated the problem is stock market declines during recessions are frequently not that large relative to the average long run return of 9   a better strategy might be hold a percentage in equities based upon a probability distribution of historical returns   this becomes problematic because of changes in the definition of earnings and the recent inflation stability which has encouraged high valuations   cash flow has not been as corrupted as earnings now and might be a better indicator   this obviously is n't perfect either but returns can be improved since there is no way yet available the optimal primary strategy is still buy hold which has made the most successful investor frequently one of the richest people on the planet for decades but this could still be used as an auxiliary for cash management reserves during recessions once retired

gt taxation is theft is an empirically true statement it is not an opinion   trying to give you the benefit of the doubt after that one you do realize that   citizenship implies agreeing to abide by the countries laws one of the biggest of which is taxation this is true in the same way that receiving a driver 's license implies a willingness to abide by road laws and regulations    pay them or not pay them no soon off my back obviously i highly disagree with you however if you really think it is theft then what does that make you that you stand by and allow it to happen every year

what this abbreviated balance sheet tells you is that this company has negative equity   the liabilities are greater than the value of the assets   the obvious problem for the company who wants to do business with you is that they are going to have a real hard time accessing credit to pay off any debts that they incur with doing business with you   in this case the recommended course would be to ask them put cash up front instead of putting them on account you do n't really need to look at the income statement to see that they are currently underwater   if their income statement turns out to be then you can wait for them to get their liabilities under control before you set up an account for them

probably the easiest way for individual investors is oil etfs   in particular uso seems to be fairly liquid and available   you should check carefully the bid ask spreads in this volatile time   there are other oil etfs and leveraged and inverse oil etfs exist as well but one should heed the warnings about leveraged etfs oil futures are another possibility though they can be more complicated and tough to access for an individual investor   note that futures have a drift associated with them as well   be careful close or roll any positions before delivery of course unless you have a need for a bunch of actual barrels of oil finally you can consider investing in commodities etfs or energy stocks or stock etfs that are strongly related to the price of oil   as keshlam mentions care is advised in all these methods   many people thought oil reached its bottom a few weeks back then opec decided to do nothing and the price dropped even further

the most important thing imo is to love the business itself love what you are doing some people in a family business have attitudes better suited for somewhere else they are just there because they want to help the family that is a noble mindset but it may translate into sub par work because you are not doing what you love so love it or at least like it a lot

the president does n't have a magic that automatically makes his will the law of the land    the president is the chief executive over a complicated bureaucratic system we call the us government with many branches and departments some of which are legally separated by the us constitution and not directly under the president 's control   no things are n't going to get better because the issues this country faces are beyond the office of the president maybe if congress would get serious about america we would see a little traction on the recovery as we would have 2/3 branches of the government moving in in the same direction currently the us government is a with 2/3rds of its legs busted   edit i do n't mean to give the impression that the judicial branch is dysfunctional so much as i wanted to illustrate that it tends to follow the legislative and executive branches not lead them the legislative branch creates the laws that the executive branch office of the president enforces the judicial branch oversees these two branches to make sure they create laws that abide by and operate within the constitution

since you have emphasized that you do n't mind about variability and that you have other funds you could liquidate then i think a solution is to do with this money the same thing that you are already doing with those other funds then when you need the money if the market has gone up sell the lots that were part of your original other funds which presumably have aged enough to qualify for long term gains rates and let the newly purchased shares take their place

gt because something is legal does n't make it the ethical choice   gt gt you fail to demonstrate what is unethical about minimizing tax burdens   operating in a country that allows you to make profit in my opinion establishes a duty to pay one 's fair share of taxes   paying legislators to make laws enabling tax avoidance is in my mind unethical   clearly we have a different idea of what is ethical and not gt corporations making huge profits using the infrastructure of the region   gt the corporations have an option to refuse using that infrastructure and instead provide their own or work with others to develop a competing infrastructure   yes    gt keep in mind that these favorable tax laws were lobbied by   corporations with the intent to avoid taxes in mind   have failed to support any argument that there is anything wrong with minimizing tax burden   that 's like your opinion man   i do n't think minimizing taxes by paying off legislators is equitable call me crazy   gt;if i 'm walking behind someone and they happen to drop a $ 100 bill without noticing i can certainly pick it up and put it in my pocket legally but its hardly the moral thing to do   more relevant example is if i order a pizza have it sent to your house then show up later with a bill for the pizza and my costs to send it to you demanding you pay it you never asked for the pizza maybe you did n't want the pizza maybe you did n't eat the pizza maybe you do n't like pizza or do n't like that kind of pizza that i choose to send you a pizza does not you to pay for that pizza   lost me on this one bro i thought we were talking ethics not surprise pizzas   how about this one    i go to your house use your kitchen and ingredients to make a pizza sell the pizza for a profit and give you nothing even though we had an agreement that if i could make a profit i would give you some   however i decide to talk to your roommate and give him a measly dollar to say forget about it bro i said it 's cool

sort of yes sort of no all teslas actually claim to be completely out of charge while there is actually still a bit of juice in the battery they do this because fully draining the battery damages it and its life span significantly but that 's just a few percent of full battery capacity and not what 's being discussed in this article   the thing being discussed in this article is that tesla used to sell one specific model that had about 15 of it 's normal battery capacity artificially locked away you could pay tesla a bit extra at any time and they would unlock the full potential of the battery via a remote software update that particular model sold pretty poorly unclear if it 's because customers did n't like the artificial restriction or if the range on that model was simply too short but either way tesla stopped selling it not long after introducing it

it depends on the rules in the specific places you stay   specific places being countries or states    some states may consider pension payments to be taxable income others may not   some may consider presence for x days to constitute residency x days may be 60 days in a calendar year whether or not those days are continuous    it does n't matter so much where your mailbox or mail handling service is located it matters you may owe taxes in more than one place   some states will allow you to offset other states taxes against theirs   some states in the us are really harsh on income taxes   it 's my understanding that if you own real estate in new york all of your income no matter the source is taxable income in new york whether or not you were ever in the state that year ultimately you ca n't just put up your hand and say that 's my tax domicile so i 'm exempt from all your taxes   there is no umbrella us regulation on this topic the states determine who they consider to be residents and how those residents are to be taxed while it 's possible you may be considered a resident of multiple states and owe income taxes in multiple states it 's equally possible that you wo n't meet the residency criteria for any state regardless of whether or not that state has an income tax   the issue you face as addressed in 's answer oklahoma will consider you a resident of ok until you have established residency somewhere else
