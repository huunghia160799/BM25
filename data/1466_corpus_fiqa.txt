another factor that makes buy to let more expensive is the risk involved with a buy to let you are dependent on finding a tenant that will keep regular payments if the property is left empty you need to finance the mortgage yourself putting you under financial strain and raising risk also as mentioned they are regarded as a business enterprise if the mortgage was to be taken by a business that would be very high risk for a bank as the business could dissolve leaving the bank out of pocket because of this it can be very difficult to get a buy to let through a business unless you are moving from a personal portfolio for a regular mortgage these risks do n't exist so this is reflected in lower interest repayments it 's because of these differences in risk that banks created buy to let so they can better manage those risks

in my experience buy to let mortgages charge a higher rate of interest than an personal residential mortgage   they are regarded as a business enterprise and presumably the banks calculate that they carry a higher risk   a bank would probably take action if the property on an ordinary mortgage was rented out as you would be breaking their terms   policies could be rendered void   the terms on an ordinary mortgage disallow renting out the property

residential mortgages normally explicitly state that the property can not be let without explicit permission whereas btl mortgages typically require that the property be let there are other differences residential mortgages are regulated which means that consumers have a degree of protection from mis selling most are not as landlords are expected to know what they 're doing affordability of residential mortgages are based on your income since that is how you are going to pay for them are mostly assessed based on the property 's rental income since it 's that that will fund the mortgage finally residential mortgages are typically done on a repayment basis so that at the end of the term you 've paid off the entire loan whereas are typically interest only on the assumption that you 'll either sell the property or remortgage at the end of the term i 've used words like typically a lot to give an overall picture of the differences obviously it 's a bit more complicated than that and there are exceptions to a lot of the above descriptions

there is no central government signature database   at least not in the us and at least not yet for debit and credit card transactions the merchant may check the signature on your against the signature on back of the card   this is intended to verify that you did n't steal the card so if you want to change the signature on the back of the card all you need to do is get a new card and re sign it   your card has an expiration date   when that happens you will get a new card to re sign   if your card expires soon you can just wait if you are impatient you can call your bank and ask for a new card   if they give you a lot of grief about issuing a new card it is an unusual request you can tell them you lost your card and need a new one   in that case they will typically disable the old card and issue a new one with a new account number note that if you want to change how you sign your name there are some other places you should also update also keep in mind that people 's signatures naturally drift over time   this fact is generally understood and accepted by people who check signatures

this person could buy another car at any moment without any money problems so i do n't really see any point in insuring especially with such a ridiculously high price compared to the extremely low risk convenience   if you self insure then an accident means that you have to make arrangements to get the car fixed evaluated etc   if you buy insurance your insurer would prefer to do all that   they argue with the mechanic over prices the lawyer over liability etc    and of course rich people need more liability insurance than other people not less   so part of that $ 1400 is probably money that your friend would have to pay regardless

as an addition to chris rea 's excellent answer these tender offers are sometimes made specifically to cast doubt on the current market price for instance a large public company that contracts with a smaller supplier or service company also public might make a tender offer below market price the market will look at this price and the business relationship and wonder what the larger company knows about the smaller one that they do n't now what happens when investors lose confidence in a stock they sell it supply goes up demand goes down and the price drops the company making the tender offer can then get its shares either way directly via the offer or on the open market this is however usually not successful beyond the very short term and typically only works because the company making a tender offer is the gorilla which can dictate its own terms with practically anyone else it meets such offers are also very closely watched by the sec if there 's any hint that the larger company is acting in a predatory manner or that its management is using the power and information of the company to profit themselves the strategy will backfire as the larger company finds itself the target of sec and doj legal proceedings

credit is very important even if you are wealthy one thing you may not realize is that rich people typically have comparatively little cash on hand   if they 're smart most of their assets are not liquid they 're tied up in safe long term investments   they use credit for their day to day expenses and pay it off from the dividends on their investments which might only come in once a quarter there are also tax advantages to using credit   if a rich person wanted a new car he 'd be smarter leasing it for his business immediate write off of the lease payments on taxes versus buying it depreciation over several years plus property tax liability in some states   there are more elaborate tax but the point is that buying a car outright is the worst option in terms of tax avoidance another way the rich mis use credit is so that they do n't risk their own money on business ventures   let 's say i have $ 1,000,000 in my personal bank account and i want to buy a business that costs $ 1m.   if i am dumb i clean out my bank account and put all my money in the business   i get 100 of the profits but i also bear 100 of the risk   if i 'm smart i loan 200 k of my own money in the business and put the rest someplace safe and get a loan from a bank for the other   if the business succeeds the bank gets their money back plus interest   if it fails the business declares bankruptcy and the bank eats the 800k loss if i structured the debt right my personal loan to the failed business gets paid back first when the company is liquidated and the bank gets whatever is left over if anything   the most of my own money i can possibly lose is 200k and probably it 's closer to zero if i have a good accountant

it 's important to realize that any portfolio if sufficiently diversified should track overall gdp growth and anything growing via a percentage per annum is going to double eventually a good corner of napkin estimate is percentage = years to double just looking at your numbers if you initially put in the full $ 7000 an increase to $ after 10 years represents a return of per annum to check my math $ 7000 ^ 10 ≈ $ since you 've been putting in the $ 7000 over 10 years the return is going to be a bit more than that but it 's not possible to calculate based on the information given   a return of is not bad some rules of thumb inflation is about 2 4 so if you are making less than that you 're losing money and 6 10 per annum is generally what you should expect if your portfolio is tracking the market i would n't consider that rate of return to be particularly amazing but it 's not bad either as you 've done better than you would have if you had invested in an etf tracking the market the stock market being what it is you ca n't rule out the possibility that you got lucky with your stock picks if your portfolio was low risk a return of could be considered amazing but given that it 's about 5 6 different stocks what i 'd consider amazing would be a return of to give you something to shoot for either way for your amount of savings you 're probably better off going with a mutual fund or an etf the return might be slightly lower but the risk profile is also lower than you picking your stocks since the fund etf will be more diversified and it 's less work

in the united states many banks aim to receive $ 100 per year per account in fees and interest markup   there are several ways that they can do this on a checking account   these examples assume that there is a 3 difference between low interest rate deposit accounts and low interest rate loans or some combination of these markups that adds up to $ 100 year   for example   a two dollar monthly fee = $ 24 year plus a $ 2,000 average balance at 0.05 = $ 29 year plus $ 250 month in rewards debit card usage = $ 24 year plus $ 2 month in atm fees = $ 24 year before it was taken over by chase manhattan in 2008 washington mutual had a business strategy of offering free checking with no monthly fees no annual fees and no charges by washington mutual for using atms   the catch was that the overdraft fees were not free   if the customers averaged 3 overdraft fees per year at $ 34 each washington mutual reached its markup target for the accounts

your idea is a good one but as usual the devil is in the details and implementation might not be as easy as you think   the comments on the question have pointed out your steps 2 and 4 are   not necessarily the best way of doing things and that perhaps   keeping the principal   amount invested in the same fund instead of taking it all out and re investing it in a similar but different fund might be better the other points for you to consider are as follows how do you identify which of the thousands of conventional mutual   funds and etfs is the average risk high gain mutual fund into which you will place your initial investment   broadly speaking most actively managed mutual fund with average risk are likely to give you   less than average gains over long periods of time   the   unfortunate truth to which many pay only service is that   x% of actively managed mutual funds   in a specific category failed   to beat the average gain of all funds in that category or the   corresponding index e.g. s&p 500 index for large stock mutual funds over the past n years where x is generally between 70 and   100 and n is 5 10 15 etc   indeed one of the arguments in   favor of investing in a very low cost index fund is that you are effectively guaranteed the average gain or loss do n't forget the possibility of loss this of course is also the argument used against investing in index funds   why invest in boring index funds and settle for average gains at essentially no risk of not getting the average performance average performance is close to guaranteed when you can   get much more out of your investments by investing in a fund that is among the funds that had better than average returns   the difficulty is that which funds are x rated and which non x rated i.e. rated g = good or pg = pretty good is known only in hindsight whereas what you need is foresight as everyone will tell you past performance does not guarantee future results   as someone john bogle said   when you invest in a mutual fund you are in the position of a in you can see where you have been but not where you are going   in summary implementation of your strategy needs a good crystal ball to look into the future there is no such things as a guaranteed bond fund they also have risks though not necessarily the same as in a stock mutual fund you need to have a plan b in mind in case your chosen mutual fund takes a longer time than expected to return the 10 gain that you want to use to trigger profit taking and investment of the gain into a low risk bond fund and also maybe a plan c in case the of the market cause your chosen mutual fund to have negative return for some time what is the exit strategy

in china people are using litecoin and bitcoin to circumvent capital controls are the biggest exchanges of smart money disclaimer this is not advice this is the answer on a question and answer site the exchange rate of smart money is very volatile you will experience very brief exposure to those networks although litecoin is popular for speculation in china bitcoin gives you and your trading partners the most flexibility as the united states does not have robust and liquid exchanges for litecoin only bitcoin you buy smart money on one of the exchanges in china you send all of it to an exchange in the united states you sell all of it on that exchange for usd if it is n't clear smart money 's flexibility comes the fact that it does n't use banks to work exist and can be transferred to valid addresses over the internet   current regulated liquid and fdic insured us exchanges are coinbase and circle other exchanges use private insurance such as and   so in the course of 30 minutes you should have converted all of your funds from yuan back to stable us dollars in a regulated and insured us banking account to make it for goods and services you need to transfer it out of the exchange to a us bank account this has very little exposure to the bitcoin or litecoin network you do n't need any friends or mules for this the chinese government has issued many many on smart money such as litecoin and bitcoin so it is hard to keep up because they have made half efforts to prevent banks from directly servicing those networks while retaining the legality of their operations within china party members have been waiting for ways to get their wealth out of the country too without risk of blowback so you will need to see what hoops you need to jump through to move your funds to one of those exchanges to begin with this is faster and only uses one transaction instead of broken up ones and there are no tax consequences for sending money to yourself

answers to this your question break down along a few lines regarding opportunity costs of tying up a significant chunk of your salary and assets in one piece of property as opposed to other things you 'd like to do with your life   the 30 year standard mortgage was invented in the 30 's as part of fdr 's new deal to make housing affordable to more people while the strain on the market of foreclosed homes from ~10 year interest only balloon mortgages sound familiar the 30 year term tends to follow the career of the average american of that era allowing them to pay the house off and live out the remainder of their lives there at a lower cost   houses are depreciating assets because they wear out over time their greatest investment value is a place to live the appreciation on a home comes from the real estate it sits on and the community the property is located in value is determined by desirability of the house and community in their current state and the supply of property in the area this value can only be extracted when you sell the home this partially answers your last question noting that you should n't buy a really expensive building for investment value we 've learned in recent years that there are no long term guarantees of property value either because land and communities can decrease in value due to unemployment over supply crime pollution etc only buy as much home as you will need in the next decade or so in a place that you will like living over that time period and do n't consider it much of an investment i will tell you to get a fifteen year fixed rate mortgage since it 's readily available at lower rates and has a significantly lower total purchase price than the standard 30 years the monthly payment difference is n't that great and anyone who looks at the monthly payment as opposed to the total costs your priorities and the opportunity costs should n't be trusted for financial advice i do n't like debt there are psychological benefits to being free from the and drain of a long term mortgage on your finances   the biggest argument for paying off your home quickly is freedom to pursue other desires with all of your salary and the assets you have available to you some financial advisers will tell you to keep your mortgage costs under 25 of your income so that you can actually live off the money you make i would also recommend paying at least enough into your 401k to get the company match and fully funding your roth ira i 'd also have an emergency fund to cover at least 6 months of expenses including this mortgage in case you lose your job a 15 or 20 year mortgage will give you breathing room to take care of these other priorities and you can overpay on almost any mortgage to decrease the principal and finish in a shorter time period make sure to get a mortgage that allows prepayment more financially savvy people may tell you to take the 30 year mortgage and invest the difference especially with mortgage rates around 4 this is a very cheap way to increase your purchasing power and total assets most people lack the investment prowess and self discipline to make this plan pay off there are even fewer guarantees regarding markets and investments than property this also is a way of diversifying your total assets to protect against loss of value in your home this approach has for thousands of people who are underwater on their homes this problem is often compounded by job loss forcing you to move or increasing your commute making your home less desirable for you some people will tell you to maintain the mortgage for the tax credit this fails a basic math test since you only get about a quarter of the money depending on your tax rate that you are paying in interest back from the government the rest of the money goes to bank at no gain to you this approach is basically a taxpayer subsidized decrease of your 4 interest payment to a 3 interest payment assuming you have ~ $ 5000 in other deductions and only pays off if you can successfully invest the money at a rate somewhat greater than 3

applying for a mortgage is a bit of paperwork but not too bad of an experience rates are pretty tight if one lender were more that 1/4 lower than another they 'd be inundated with applications above a certain credit score you get the best rate a search will show you the rates offered in your area   if you are a first time buyer there are mortgages that might benefit you if you are a vet for non native english readers a veteran who served in the us armed forces not a who is an animal doctor there are mortgages that offer low to no down payment with attractive rates   yes avoid pmi it 's a crazy penalty on your overall expense of home purchase if banks qualify you for different amounts it should n't be a huge difference a few percent variation but the standard ratios are pretty liberal even today and getting the most you 'd qualify for is probably too much   using the standard 28/36 ratios a bank will qualify you for 4x your income as a loan e.g you make $ 50 k they 'll lend you $ 200k. this is a bit too much in my opinion   if you come up short you are really looking to borrow too much and should probably wait if you owe a bit on loans it should squeeze in between those two ratios 28/36 but i would n't borrow on a credit line to add to the purchase that 's asking for trouble

the chances are good that the interest you are going to pay on the debt is going to be higher than the interest you are going to receive on any type of short term investments that would make the paying off of the debt worth more to you in the long run than saving your money note that without the particulars of your situation this is all just theory so consult the details of you loan agreements i can not imagine that a credit provider did not discuss this with you before you put pen on paper

actually the other answer is n't strictly correct   it 's an estimate giving a lower bound that gets less accurate as income increases   consider u.s. income tax is based on a progressive tax system where there are income bracket levels with increasing tax rates example given u.s. 2009 federal tax rates for an individual filing as single imagine somebody making $ 100000   assuming no other credits deductions or taxes then income tax based on the above brackets rates would be calculated as follows meaning the average tax rate for the single individual earning $ 100,000 is however a pre tax deduction from that income actually comes off at the top marginal tax rate   consider the same calculation but with taxable income reduced to $ instead i.e. simulating a pre tax $ 1000 deduction that 's a difference of $ 280 which is more than the $ savings that would have been estimated if just using the average tax rate method consequently when trying to determine how much money would be saved by a tax deduction it makes better sense to estimate using the marginal tax rate which in this case was 28   it gets a little trickier if the deduction crosses a bracket boundary   left as an exercise to the reader finally in the case of the deduction being discussed it also looks like payroll fica taxes paid by the employee social security 's 6.2 and medicare 's 1.45 would be avoided as well so add that to the marginal tax rate savings the surest way to know how much would be saved though would be to do one 's income tax return calculation without the deduction and then with and compare the numbers   tax software can make this very easy to do

the only way to hedge a position is to take on a position with a higher multiplier as any counter position such as a 1:1 inverse etf will merely cancel out the etf it is meant to hedge yielding a negative return roughly in the amount of fees slippage for true risk aversion continually selling the shortest term available covered calls is the only free lunch   a suboptimal version the cboe index has outperformed its underlying with lower volatility the second best way is to continually hedge positions with long puts but this can become very tax complicated since the hedged positions need to be rebalanced continually and expensive depending on option liquidity the ideal assuming no taxes and infinite liquidity is to sell covered calls when implied volatility is high and buy puts when implied volatility is low

i was not able to find any authority for the opinion you suggest wash sale rules should imho apply according to the regulations you attribute the newly purchased shares to the oldest sold shares for the purposes of the calculation of the disallowed loss and cost basis c where the amount of stock or securities acquired within the period is less than the amount of stock or securities sold or    otherwise disposed of then the particular shares of stock or    securities the loss from the sale or other disposition of which is not    deductible shall be those with which the stock or securities acquired    are matched in accordance with the following rule the stock or    securities acquired will be matched in accordance with the order of    their acquisition beginning with the earliest acquisition with an    equal number of the shares of stock or securities sold or otherwise    disposed of you can resort to the claim that you have not in fact entered into the contract within 30 days but when you gave the instructions to reinvest dividends i do n't know if such a claim will hold but to me it sounds reasonable this is similar to the rules re short sales in g there in this case wash sale rules will not apply unless you instructed to reinvest dividends within the 30 days prior to the sale but i 'd ask a tax professional if such a claim would hold talk to a ea cpa licensed in your state

having savings only in your home currency is relatively low risk compared with other types of low diversification this is because in a simple case your future cash outflows will be in your home currency so if the gbp fluctuates in value it will theoretically still buy you the same goods at home in this way keeping your savings in the same currency as your future expenditures creates a natural hedge against currency fluctuation this gets complicated for goods imported from other countries where base price fluctuates based on a foreign currency or for situations where you expect to incur significant foreign currency expenditures retirement elsewhere etc in such cases you no longer have certainty that your future expenditures will be based on the gbp and saving money in other currencies may make more sense in many circumstances diversification of the currency of your savings may actually increase your risk not decrease it be sure you are doing this for a specific reason with a specific strategy and not just to generally spread your money around even in case of a brexit consider what would you do with a bank account full of usd if the answer is convert it back to gbp when needed in 6 months 5 years 30 etc to buy british goods then i would n't call this a way to reduce your risk instead i would call it a type of investment with its own set of risks associated

what 's the value of the scholarship and is it administered by itself or by the university   if by itself the financial return discussed above drives   if by the university they create the tuition so it gets more interesting    if this is something that is administered and by the university then keep in mind that while it may be named the john doe memorial scholarship with $ 30000 in it 's account under the endowment the university overall is likely to cut some number of students tuition in financial aid packages anyway   let 's say they substitute a generic tuition adjustment in past years with this happens to be named john doe memorial scholarship moving forward the university can do this as long as they are not constrained in pricing power by laws and financial aid customs   there 's the finance answer and there 's the fact that a university can create a coupon indefinitely similar in concept to the price discrimination where and gamble can launch a new flavor of tide at a high price to maintain the market position and flood marketing channels with coupons also the university might find it to be an inexpensive benefit to the faculty to create a ceremony around a valued deceased professor collecting funds from other professors or staff to partially pay for it at finance price or even a slight loss

why do people buy them when they would be cheap to make for themselves convenience while you could easily find some pictures and lay them out with a sentiment buy some card stock print in colour trim it and perhaps glue on some glitter or whatnot and then find an envelope that fits it it 's likely to take you an hour or more to do so and you 'll invest far more than $ 6 on your printer and various inventories i made cards for my we had construction paper glitter markers etc and there was no need for an envelope but most people will find it quicker and simpler to buy one fully assembled the cost of the online ones is weird i agree perhaps people are also not confident they can compose a good why do stores stock $ 6 cards that they buy for $ 3 retail markup is 50 100 and i 'm sure it 's closer to 100 for cards when a different supplier might provide them for $ 2 well even if such a supplier existed i 'm sure the store would be happy to sell for $ 6 still see people buy them so there would be no consumer impact a store that sells cards for $ 5 is n't going to siphon customers from elsewhere because most of us just do n't buy cards often enough for it to matter   why does nobody become that supplier who will sell them cheaper selling stuff is more expensive than making stuff and getting your product into retail stores is hard hard means time and time means money and all of that contributes more to the card price than the ink and paper do that said dollar stores sell cards for a dollar typically and people do buy them i find they have less colours and the artwork is perhaps you even get what you pay for when it comes to design layout printing etc

waiting for the next economic downturn probably is n't the best plan at this point while it could happen tomorrow you may end up waiting a long time if you would prefer not to think much about your investment and just let them grow then mutual funds are a really good option make sure you research them before you buy into any and make sure to diversify as in buy into a lot of different mutual funds that cover different parts of the market if you want to be more active in investing then start researching the market and stick to industries you have   very good understanding of it 's tough to invest in a market you know nothing about i 'd suggest putting at least some of that into a retirement savings account for long term growth make sure you look at both your short term and long term goals letting an investment mature from age 20 through to retirement will net you plenty of compound interest but do n't forget about your short term goals like possible cars houses and families do as much research as you can and you will be fine

a few weeks ago i was thinking about this exact thing except swap euros for canadian dollars the good news is that there are options option 1 yes buy indian fixed deposits interest rates are high right you can get up to 9 p.a it boils down to your sentiment about the indian rupee going forward for instance let 's say you purchase a deposit for amount x at 9 p.a you can have it double to almost 2x in 10 years three things can happen in 10 years are you optimistic about indian governance and economy going forward if you are go for it i certainly am option 2 heard of fcnr look in to fcnr deposits i do n't know about europe but in canada the best rate for a 1 year deposit is approximately 1.5 however through foreign currency non resident fcnr deposits you can get up to 4 or 5 the other benefit is that you do n't have to convert currency to inr which results in conversion savings however only major currencies can be used to open such accounts

your problem is one that has challenged many people   as you said there are two aspects to balancing a budget reducing expenses or increasing income   and you state that you have done all the cost cutting that you can find   looking at ways to increase your income is a good way to balance your budget how big is your problem   do you need to find another $ 100/month or do you need $ 1000/month   there are many part time jobs you could obtain fast food retail grocery you could obtain a sales job cars real estate even working for a recruiting firm where you could connect buyers and sellers   if your need is $ 100/month a part time job on weekends would fill the gap when i was trying to solve my budget problems a few years ago i thought that i needed to increase my income   and i did increase my income   but then i realized that my expenses were too high   and i re evaluated my priorities   i challenge you to revisit your expenses   often we assume that we need things that we really can not afford   consider a few of your possible expenses my problems included mortgage debt auto loans high utilities high car insurance too much spending on kids activities and a few other problems

if you have enough earned income to cover this amount you should be all set if i understand you correctly you proposed two transactions the first a withdrawal from the beneficiary ira some of which is an rmd the rest is an extra withdrawal of funds   next you propose to make a deposit to a combination of your ira and your wife 's ira as long as there 's earned income to cover this deposit your plan is fine   to be clear you ca n't take a ira and deposit the rmd to an ira but money is fungible the dollars you deposit are n't traceable only need to be justified by enough earned income a ira is a great way to get the money to increase your own ira or 401(k deposits   further details the 2016 contribution limit is $ 5,500 per person so i did make the assumption you knew the $ 9000 deposit need to be split between the 2 iras with no more than $ 5500 going into either one

the problem with rate of return calculation on short positions is that the commonly used approach assumes an initial investment creating a cash outflow if we want to apply this approach to short selling we should look at the trade from another perspective we buy money and pay for this money with stock our investment to buy 50 $ in your example is 1 share   when closing the short position we effectively sell back our money 50 $ and receive 2 shares our profit on this position is obviously 1 share setting this in relation to our investment of 1 share yields a performance of 100    in reality we do not sell back the entire cash but only the amount needed to get back our investment of 1 share this is actually comparable to a purchase of stock which we only partially close to get back our invested cash amount and keep the remaining shares as our profit

that may be true but what will happen is that every carrier raises prices in an oligopoly it will be an opportunity to act as an so maybe after a while costs will be driven down but in the short it will probably only raise prices and also it creates a situation where the a service that was previously accessible to all customers will now only be available to the ones willing to pay whatever the cost of an actual human behind the telephone is   so in the short run it will only increase telecom costs also since having a phone or internet in something you can just opt out of everyone will be more or less forced to accept this practice again the oligopoly is where can find the cause

well you know the problem lies with bonds maturing the issue is not the function comp but the security itself you have to use existing total return indices that reflect a constant 10yr maturity position       rolled the principal once the bond matured until the present       that would mean your 10y becomes 5y matured then you reinvest not the same       use to find something like index or go to the ind page to see merrill lynch 's bond indices they 're some of the best

when using a debit card there are two limits that may be imposed on the use the current balance and the maximum daily limit if the banking institution limits your daily usage that may mean that on a particular day you may not be able to make a large purchase even though you have money in the bank otherwise as long as you have funds in the account linked to the debit card you can make the transaction the catch is that as soon as the transaction is sent to the bank one of two things happens the money is immediately deducted from the account or a hold equal to the the amount of the transaction is placed on the account a hold is generally used when the transaction is done in two parts the pre scan at a restaurant or gas station the hold reduces the amount of available funds in the account a hold or an immediate deduction limits the size of future transactions to be able to make larger transactions you need to transfer more money into the account there is no debit card transaction that you can do to   artificially allow a larger transaction unless the bank is not placing a hold or doing an immediate deduction   because a debit card is linked to a bank account some accounts have overdraft protection this protection comes in two forms they either transfer your money from another account or they make a loan either way there can be costs involved

debt creates risk   the more debt you take on the higher your risk   what happens if you lose your job miss a payment or forget to write the final payment check for the exact amount needed and are left with a balance of $ 1 meaning the back dated interest would be applied   there is too much risk for little reward   if you paid monthly at 0 and put your money in your savings account like you mentioned how much interest would you really accrue   probably not much since savings account rates suck right now if you can pay cash for it now do it   so pay cash now and own it outright   why prolong it   is there something looming in the future that you think will require your money   if so i would put off the purchase no one can predict the future   why not pay cash for it now and pay yourself what would have been the monthly payment   in three years you have your money back   and there is no risk at all also when making large purchases with cash you can sometimes get better discounts if you ask

forex vs day trading these can be one and the same as most people who trade forex do it as day trading forex is the instrument you are trading and day trading is the time frame you are doing it in if your meaning from your question was comparing trading forex vs stocks then it depends on a number of things forex is more liquid so most professional traders prefer it as it can be easier to get in and out without being gapped however if you are not trading large amounts of money and you stay away from more volatile stocks this should not matter too much it may also depend on what you understand more and prefer to trade you need to be comfortable with what you are trading if on the other hand you are referring to day trading vs longer term trading and/or investing then this can depend largely on the instrument you are trading and the time frame you are more comfortable with forex is used more for shorter term trading from day trading to having a position open for a couple of days stocks on the other hand can be day traded to traded over days weeks months or years it is much more common to have positions open for longer periods with stocks other instruments like commodities can also be traded over different time frames the shorter the time frame you trade the higher risk involved as you have to make quick decisions and be happy with making a lot of smaller gains with the potential to make a large loss if things go wrong it is best once again to chose a time frame you are comfortable with i tend to trade australian stocks as i know them well and am comfortable with them i usually trade in the medium to long term however i let the market decide how long i am in a position and when i get out of it i try to follow the trend and stay in a position as long as the trend continues i put automatic stop losses on all my positions so if the market turns against me i am automatically taken out i can be in a position for as little as a day can happen if i buy one day and the next day the stock falls by 15 or more to over a year as long as the trend continues by doing this i avoid the daily market noise and let my profits run and keep my losses small no matter what instrument you end up trading and the time frame you choose to trade in you should always have a tested trading plan and a risk management strategy in place these are the areas you should first gain knowledge in to further your pursuits in trading

rather than trying to indirectly game your credit score i would instead shop around and see if there are other lenders that will pre qualify you with your credit the way it is today   bofa and other large banks can be very in how they qualify loans a local bank or credit union may be more willing to bend the traditional rules and pre qualify you    i 'm thinking about using fha if you can put 20 down then a conventional mortgage will likely be cheaper than an fha loan since fha loans have mortgage insurance built in while conventional mortgages typically do n't require it if you borrow less than 80 of the house 's value   i would shop around before jumping to an fha loan

omg the answer is easy tell the truth and nothing is fraud down payment gifts are 's and every lender works with that each lender has their own rules fannie may and freddie mac could care less and fha and va backed loans allow for full gifting unless the buyer 's credit is below the standard 620 then 3.5 must come from the buyer standard bank loans want to know the source of the down payment for one reason only to know if the buyer is taking on a new debt the only thing you will need do is sign a legal document stating the entire down payment is a gift   that way the bank knows their is n't owing a new substantial debt and that there are n't two lenders on the house because should she default the bank will have to pay you back first off the resale get it they just want to know how many hands are in the fire

normal high street accounts certainly are available to non residents i have several and i have n't been resident in the uk for fourteen years however you do need to open them before you leave they need identification once you have one open the same bank should be able to open other accounts by mail the disadvantage of course is that you will pay tax on your earnings and while you can claim it back that 's an unnecessary piece of work if you do n't have other uk earnings i would take the risk of an offshore account assuming it 's with a big reputable bank the kind that are going to be bailed out if there is another collapse an alternative might be a fixed term deposit you lock up your money for three years and you get it back plus a single interest payment at the end of three years you would pay nothing in tax while you were gone but the whole interest amount would be taxable when you got back

arguably because they can   canada 's banking industry is dominated by five chartered banks who by virtue of their size pretty much determine how banking is done in canada yes they have to abide by government regulation but they carry enough weight to influence government and to some extent shape the regulation they have to follow while this situation makes canada 's financial system very stable and efficient it also permits anti competitive behavior   there was a time when u.s. banks were not permitted to operate across state lines when the smallest of canada 's big 5 was bigger than the biggest u.s. bank despite our economy having always been about 1/10 the size of the u.s. that scale and their small number gives the big 5 the ability to invest heavily in and collaborate on whatever they decide to be in their own interest so if they want to charge fees they do

this is normal with the dealer 's financing   to add more details to littleadv 's answer what happens is when you get the financing through the dealer at first they will try to do the loan on your behalf with local banks in your area this is why you see several hard inquiries one from each back if none of these banks wants to take the loan then dealer 's financing entity will take the loan this was my exact experience with hyundai in addition do n't get surprise if you start receiving letters saying that your loan was rejected the dealer will send the loan requests simultaneously and some of the banks might deny the loan this also happened to me and i have been owning my car for around a year still make sure that the letters matches with the credit inquiries

some historical and mathematical insights as a complement to existing answers   history i found it astonishing that already in ancient roman they investigated the issue of perpetuity of almost writes in de re 3 3 in century ad about a perpetuity of principal under 6 p.a resulting in 1950 annual payment and   if   the     would   enter   this   amount   as   a   debt   against his just as a does with a debtor    so that the owner may realize the aforementioned six per cent interest on that total as a perpetual annuity   he   should   take   in   1950 every   year    by   this   reckoning   the return on seven even according to the opinion of exceeds the interest on math if we fix a scholarship at a year then it 's clear that it could be paid out infinitely if we could achieve 3.33 p.a on it   on the other side with 0 we 'll spend out the endowment in 30 years thus having the interest rate between 0 and 3.33 p.a we could vary the life of endowment between 30 years and infinity just a few numbers in between under 1 it would be years under 2 years under 3 years however 1000 $ in 78 years could be less than 10 $ today conclusion to keep it perpetual either the fund 's yield must be at the level of scholarship or re adjust the amount of scholarship depending on fund achievement or redefine the notion of perpetuity like 50 years is approximately infinite for our purpose

i would say yes it 's worth building additional retirement savings on top of a defined benefit pension plan plans that pay set annual income   here are a couple of reasons do n't put all your eggs in one basket   while is probably in good shape things can and do happen to pension plans   while there is a provincial system in place to guarantee some of your pension income $ 1000/mo if your plan goes bust your benefits are not 100 guaranteed defined benefit pension plans are designed to provide recurring annual income like your paycheck when you are employed   you ca n't take more out from your defined benefit pension plan when an emergency comes up   whereas your rrsp and eventually in retirement are accounts from which you can take out extra in any given year if necessary that being said canada revenue agency cra wo n't let you save as much in your rrsp as other people who do n't have pension plans normally individuals in canada are entitled to save 18 of their earned income up to a limit $ in 2009 in an rrsp each year   however to level the playing field individuals who are in a pension plan get a pension adjustment pa number on their t4 which reduces their available rrsp contribution room   otherwise they 'd be able to tax shelter more income for retirement than others so i would suggest if you have the rrsp room consider using it   i 'd also suggest you look at a tax free savings account tfsa especially if you do n't have much rrsp room due to the pension adjustment   if you 're not sure whether to use an rrsp or a tfsa consider both

fica taxes are separate from federal and state income taxes as a sole proprietor you owe all of those   additionally there is a difference with fica when you are employed vs. self employed   typically fica taxes are actually split between the employer and the employee so you pay half they pay half but when you 're self employed you pay both halves this is what is commonly referred to as the self employment tax if you are both employed and self employed as i am your employer pays their portion of fica on the income you earn there and you pay both halves on the income you earn in your business edit as @joetaxpayer added in his comment you can specify an extra amount to be withheld from your pay when you fill out your w-4 form this is separate from the calculation of how much to withhold based on dependents and such see line 6 on the linked form this could allow you to avoid making quarterly estimated payments for your self employment income i think this is much easier when your side income is predictable personally i find it easier to come up with a percentage i must keep aside from my side income for me this is about 35 and then i immediately set that aside when i get paid i make my quarterly estimated payments out of that money set aside   my side income can vary quite a bit though if i could predict it better i would probably do the extra withholding yes you need to pay taxes for fica and federal income tax   i ca n't say exactly how much you should withhold though if you have predictable deductions and such it could be lower than you expect i 'm not a tax professional and when it comes doing business taxes i go to someone who is you do n't have to do that but i 'm not comfortable offering any detailed advice on how you should proceed there i mentioned what i do personally as an illustration of how i handle withholding but i ca n't say that that 's what someone else should do

the hmrc has a dedicated self help learning site that is helpful here it 's important to tell hmrc that you are self employed as soon as    possible   if you do n't you may have to pay a penalty   you do n't want to pay more to hmrc than you have to as it is a waste    of your money your business has started when you start to advertise or you have a    customer to buy your goods or services   it is at this point that your business is trading you can not    register before you start trading for example if you advertise your business in the local newspaper on    15 january but do not get your first customer until 29 march in this    case you have been trading since 15 january you must tell hmrc within six months of the end of the tax year in    which you start self employment   you must therefore register by 5 october   but it 's best to register well before this so that you do not forget    to do so the hmrc also has a youtube channel with help videos and am i trading or not might be of particular interest to you most of the registration is based around the concept of starting to work with the intent to make a profit by the letter of law and regulations you should register within six months of the end of the tax year you started to avoid any potential penalty however note that the situation is different based upon your intent if you begin making putting up videos online as a hobby with the hope that you can make something to help you the basic costs involved and the total amount you make is relatively small say less than 500 pounds you will not be classified as trading and likely have no need to register with hmrc   as soon as you begin to get in regular payments maybe a single payment of a significant size or multiple payments for a similar service item you are vastly more likely to need to register from my reading you would likely be safe to begin putting up videos without registration but if you begin spending a large portion of your time over an extended period multiple months and/or begin getting payments of any notable size then you should likely register with the appropriate services hmrc etc as is the case in both the usa and uk simple registration is pretty cheap and the costs of little no income are usually pretty minor   also note that the hmrc trading and self employment regulations are unusual compared to many us laws institutions in that you are explicitly permitted to begin doing something and only register later so if you start doing videos for an entire tax year + 5 months and make nothing significant you 'd seemingly be fine to never register at all

you have just answered your question in the last sentence of your question   more volume just means more people are interested in the stock i.e supply and demand are matched well if the stock is illiquid there is more chance of the spread and slippage being larger even if the spread is small to start with once a trade has been transacted if no new buyers and sellers enter the market near the last transacted price then you could get a large spread occurring between the bid and ask prices here is an example has a 50 day moving average volume of only 1200 share traded per day obviously it does not trade every day   as you can see there is already an 86 spread from the bid price if a new bid price is entered to match and take out the offer price at $ then this spread would instantly increase to from the bid price

i would definitely pay down the debt first   if it is going to take 15 years to do so you probably need to allocate more money to paying down debt cut expenses by going out to eat less and keeping spending to the bare necessities   you might even consider getting a second job just for paying down the debt   if that is n't enough consider selling off some assets   you should be able to come up with a plan to be debt free excluding maybe a regular mortgage within 3 5 years once the only debt you have is a home mortgage then its time to look at putting money towards retirement again note you should not take money out of a 401k or ira to pay off debt   the costs for doing so are nearly always too great

there can be federal estate tax as well as state estate tax due on an estate but it is not of direct concern to you estate taxes are paid by the estate of the decedent not by the beneficiaries and so you do   not owe any estate tax as a matter of fact most estates in the us do not pay federal estate tax at all because only the amount that exceeds the federal exemption $ 5.5 m is taxable and most estates are smaller state estate taxes might be a different matter because   while many states exempt exactly what the federal government does others   exempt different usually smaller amounts but in any case estate taxes are not of concern to you except insofar as what you inherit is reduced because the estate had to pay estate tax before distributing the inheritances as joetaxpayer 's answer says more succinctly what you inherit is net of estate tax if any what you receive as an inheritance is not taxable income to you either if you receive stock shares or other property your basis is the value of the property when you inherit it thus if you sell at a later time you will have to pay taxes only on the increase in the value of the property from the time you inherit it the increase in value from the time the decedent acquired the property till the date of death is not taxable income to you   exceptions to all these favorable rules to you is the treatment of traditional iras 401ks pension plans etc that you inherit that contain money on which the decedent never paid income tax distributions from such inherited accounts are mostly taxable income to you any part of post tax money such as nondeductible contributions to traditional iras that is included in the distribution is   tax free annuities present another source of complications for annuities within iras even the irs throws up its hands at explaining things to mere mortals who are foolhardy enough to delve into pub 950 saying in effect talk to your tax advisor for other annuities questions arise such as is this a tax deferred annuity and whether it was purchased with pre tax money or with post tax money etc   one thing that you should check out is whether it is beneficial to take a lump sum   distribution or just collect the money as it is distributed in monthly quarterly semi annual or annual payments annuities   in particular have heavy surrender charges if they are terminated early and the money taken as a lump sum instead of over time as the insurance   company issuing the annuity had planned on happening   so taking a lump sum would mean more income tax immediately due not just on the lump sum but because the increase in agi might reduce deductions for medical expenses as well as reduce the overall amount of itemized deductions that can be claimed increase taxability of social security   benefits etc you say that you have these angles out and so i will merely re beware the surrender charges

nafta affected u.s. workers in four principal ways first it caused the loss of some 700,000 jobs as production moved to mexico most of these losses came in california texas michigan and other states where manufacturing is concentrated to be sure there were some job gains along the border in service and retail sectors resulting from increased trucking activity but these gains are small in relation to the loses and are in lower paying occupations the vast majority of workers who lost jobs from nafta suffered a permanent loss of income   second nafta strengthened the ability of u.s. employers to force workers to accept lower wages and benefits as soon as nafta became law corporate managers began telling their workers that their companies intended to move to mexico unless the workers lowered the cost of their labor in the midst of collective bargaining negotiations with unions some companies would even start loading machinery into trucks that they said were bound for mexico the same threats were used to fight union organizing efforts the message was if you vote in a union we will move south of the border with nafta corporations also could more easily local governments into giving them tax reductions and other subsidies   third the destructive effect of nafta on the mexican agricultural and small business sectors several million mexican workers and their families and was a major cause in the dramatic increase in undocumented workers flowing into the u.s. labor market this put further downward pressure on u.s. wages especially in the already lower paying market for less skilled labor   fourth and ultimately most important nafta was the template for rules of the emerging global economy in which the benefits would flow to capital and the costs to labor the u.s. governing class in alliance with the financial elites of its trading partners applied nafta ’s principles to the world trade organization to the policies of the world bank and imf and to the deal under which employers of china ’s huge supply of low wage workers were allowed access to u.s. markets in exchange for allowing american multinational corporations the right to invest there   please thank bill clinton

hitting the 25 marginal rate does not mean all of your earnings are taxed at 25 only those that exceed the top of the 15 bracket you can deduct any expenses for upgrading or repairing your apartments those are subtracted from the earnings before tax is calculated as income so you will probably stay in a lower marginal rate property tax will hit you annually and capital gains tax will hit you when you sell them at the end if you already have experience with this business in your home country then this sounds like a good option for you the only caution that i would give you is to find an accountant to help you with your taxes and pay for a consultation before you get started so that you know what to track that will help him her minimize your tax bill

the word good was used in contrast to bad but these words are misused here   there are three kinds of debt debt for spending never go into debt to buy consumables go out for a good time for vacations or other purchases with no lasting financial value debt for depreciating assets such as cars and sometimes things like furniture there are those who put this in the same category as the first but i know many people who can budget a car payment and pay it off during the life of the car in a sense they are renting their car and paying interest while doing so debt for appreciating money making assets mortgage and student loans are both often put into the good category the house is the one purchase that in theory provides an immediate return you know what it saves you on the rent you know what it costs you after tax if someone pays 20 of their income toward their fixed rate mortgage and they 'd otherwise be paying 25 to rent and long term the house will keep up with inflation it 's not bad in the sense that they need to aggressively get rid of it student loans are riskier in that the return is not at all guaranteed i think that one has to be careful not to graduate with such a loan burden that they start their life under a black cloud paying 10 of your income for 10 years is pretty crazy but some are in that position finally some people consider all debt as bad debt live beneath their means to be debt free as soon as they can and avoid borrowing money

excellent question and it is a debate that is often raised   mathematically you are probably best off using option 1   any money that is above and beyond minimum payments earns a pretty high interest rate about in the form of saved interest payments the problem is you are likely to get discouraged   personal finance is a lot about behavior and after working at this for a year and still having 5 loans albeit a lower balance might take a bit of fight out of you paying off such a large balance in a reasonable time will take a lot of fight with the debt snowball you pay the minimum to the student loan save in an outside account and when it is large enough you execute option 2   so a year from now you might only have three loans instead of five   if you behaved exactly the same your balance would be higher after that year then using the previous method however often one does not behave the same   because the goals are shorter and more attainable it is easier to delay some gratification   the 8 dollars you are saving in your weekly gas budget because of low prices is meaningful when saving for a 4 k goal where it is meaningless when looking at it as a 74 k goal   with the 4 k goal you are more apt to put that money in your savings where the 74 k goal you might spend it on a latte for me the debt snowball worked really well with either option make sure that excess payments actually go to a reduction in principle not a prepayment of interest   given this you may be left with no option   for example if method 1 you only prepay interest you are forced to use option 2

this was first posted in full on by = 14 hours ago     original comment gt;i'm a huge spotify fan in fact i love it so much that i have n't purchased a song from itunes in months that alone should speak volumes about their position in the industry i ca n't be alone here and that means that for some significant portion of people money has stopped going to apple for music and now goes to spotify gt gt;but here 's the thing spotify is too cheap their service is amazing and far far too inexpensive relative to what they provide they provide a bulk of their service for free and people like me who want a bit more pay $ 10 a month gt gt;to get access to 5,000 songs via itunes would cost me roughly $ 5000 and people are willing to pay it that 's 500 months of spotify 42 years subscription to generate the same amount of revenue gt gt;so while i agree that music licensing costs particular for radio like services like pandora need to go down to be more in line with broadcast rates i do n't think that 's what 's hurting spotify here i think they 're providing far too much value for what they get paid     internet justice away

how does this get any business you 'd be surprised on how much profit these type of businesses can bring in and the number of people who cash their checks this way they make profit off people who want their checks cashed asap usually cheques written to cash or something can just be cashed for    free at the bank right yes most banks cash your check for free some may not cash it right away and may require a few days to process some charge a small fee if the check is not from the same bank some personal checks may not even be processed the same day as well would n't the only cheques that people would cash at these places be    bad cheques yes and no yes because it may be easier to try to cash a fraudulent check at these type of check cashing places however some places may only cash business checks and require your id in which they write down the information in order to possibly track you down in the future also some places only cash a check to a certain amount   and would n't this mean that the business will lose a lot of money    since it pays out cash but then has the cheque bounce   of course the business loses money if the check bounces or is fake that is why they try to minimize their losses with certain requirements that needs to met before the check can be cashed who uses these services exactly just about anyone who needs their check cashed asap or like stated in his answer is trying to keep their money on the low there is a demand for this service even though it may seem shady to you

unless it is in the contract that you must replace it then this should be replaced by your insurance they sent you a box that was defective consumer grade electronics are designed for at least 85 c and unless they can prove your car was hotter than that they sent you a defective unit   that being said i do not think it would be worth suing them for that low amount i would suggest you get a new insurance company the current company clearly values your business less than 185 pounds and this issue will happen multiple times since the company has no incentive to buy better products if customers keep footing the bill

do i need an investment adviser   no but you may want to explore the idea of having one is he going to tell me anything that my accountant ca n't   probably how much expertise are you expecting from your accountant here do you think your accountant knows everything within the of money from taxes insurance products investments and all your choices and what would work or would n't seems like it could be a tall order to my mind my accountant did say to come to him for advice on investment business    issues so he is willing but is he able not asking about his    competence but rather is there something that only an investment    adviser can provide by law that an accountant ca n't not that i know though do n't forget how much expertise are you expecting here from one person is this person intended to answer all your money questions but is n't that something that my accountant could should do perhaps though how well are you expecting one person to be aware of so much stuff i want you to know all the tax law so i can minimize taxes maximize my investment returns cover me with adequate insurance and protect my savings seems like a bit much to put on one entity do i need either of them wo n't the internet and sites like this one    suffice need no however how much time are you prepared to spend learning the basics of strategies that work for you how much money are you prepared to put into things to learn what works and does n't while it is your decision consider how to what extent do you diagnose your medical issues through the internet versus going to see a doctor be careful of how much of a do it yourself approach you want to go here and recognize that there are multiple approaches that may work the question is which trade offs are ok for you

well i 'm not going to advise whether it 's a good idea to invest in this company though often otc is pretty scary but it does have a product an ad blocker it did post financials and it 's trading on the otc qb which is better than the pink sheets so you need to look these over and study up on the product to decide if it is overpriced or not   what might have occurred the patriot farm becoming is that the latter bought up the stock of the former this is i believe called using a shell which is not necessarily a bad thing and is using this as a way to be registered i.e. sell to non accredited investors via the otc market   so i 'm really just answering your third question   yes you have to do a lot of due diligence to see if buying this stock is a good deal or not   it might be the next big thing   or it might not it certainly is the case that low trading volume allows a relatively small trade to really change the stock price so the penny stocks do tend to be easier to inflate side comment   the bid ask spreads are pretty big with a best bid of 0.35 and best ask of

the problem i have with gold is that it 's only worth what someone will pay you for it   to a degree that 's true with any equity but with a company there are other capital resources etc that provide a base value for the company and generally a business model that generates income gold just sits there it does n't make products it does n't perform services you ca n't eat it and the main people making money off of it are the folks charging a not commission to sell it to you or buy it back   sure it 's used in small quantities for things like plating electrical contacts dental work shielding etc but industrial uses account for only 10 of consumption   mostly it 's just hoarded either in the form of jewelry 50 or investment bullion coins 40   its value derives largely from rarity and other than the last few years there 's no track record of steady growth over time like the stock market or real estate just look at what gold prices did between 10 to 30 years ago i 'm not sure it came anywhere near close to keeping pace with inflation during that time   if you look at the chart you see a steady price until the us went off the gold standard in 1971 and rules regarding ownership and trading of gold were relaxed   there was a brief run up for a few years after that as the market found its level as it were and you really need to look from about 74 forward which it experienced its first test and demonstration of a supporting price around inflation adjusted   then the price fluctuated largely between 800 to 400 per ounce adjusted for inflation for the next 30 years other than a brief sympathetic silver tuesday spike due to the hunt brothers manipulation of silver prices in 1980   not sure if there is any causality but it is interesting to note that the recent in price starts in 2000 at almost the same time the last country the swiss went off the gold standard and gold was no longer tied to any currency or versa    if you bought in 75 as a hedge against inflation you were down as much as 50 during much of the next 33 years   if you managed to buy at a low the couple of times that gold was going down and found support around adjusted then you were on average up slightly as much as a little over 50 throwing out silver tuesday but then from about 98 through 05 had barely broken even   i personally view investments in gold at this time as a speculation   look at the history below and ask yourself if buying today would more likely end up as buying in 1972   or 1975 or gods forbid 1980   would you be taking advantage of a buying opportunity or piling onto a bubble and end up buying at the high   note from joe the article demand and supply adds to the discussion and supports chuck 's answer

brokerage firms must settle funds promptly but there 's no explicit definition for this in u.s. federal law see for example this article on settling trades in three days wikipedia also has a good write up on t+3 it is common practice however it takes approximately three days for the funds to be available to me in my canadian brokerage account that said the software itself prevents me from using funds which are not available and i 'm rather surprised yours does not you want to be careful not to be labelled a pattern day trader if that is not your intention others can better fill you in on the consequences of this i believe it will not apply to you unless you are using a margin account all but certainly the terms of service that you agreed to with this brokerage will specify the conditions under which they can lock you out of your account and when they can charge interest if they are selling your stock at times you have not authorised via explicit instruction or via a stop loss order you should file a complaint with the and with sufficient documentation you will need to ensure your cancel stop loss order actually went through though and the stock was sold anyway it could simply be that it takes a full business day to cancel such an order

i am from australia so my answer is based on my experience over here however it should be similar for the usa generally what determines both the price of houses apartments and the rents for them is supply and demand when there is high demand and low supply prices or rents generally go up when there is low demand and high supply prices or rents usually go down what can sometimes happen when house prices go down is that the demand can drop but so can supply as the prices drop developers will make less money on building new houses so stop building new houses other developers can go bankrupt as less people including investors are buying houses and more people including investors try to sell their existing houses there will be more people looking to rent and less rental properties available to rent this produces a perfect storm of high demand and low supply of rental properties causing rents to rise strongly when the property prices start to go up again as demand increases there is a shortfall of new properties being built due to the developers not building during the downturn at this time developers start to build again but there is a lag time before the new houses can be completed this lack of supply puts more pressure on both house prices and rents to go up further until equilibrium between supply and demand is realised or an oversupply of rental properties exists in the market rents will continue to rise

index funds are well known to give the best long term investment not exactly indexes give the best long term performance when compared to actively managing investments directly in the underlying stocks that is if you compare an s&p500 index to trying to pick stocks that are part of it you 're more likely to succeed with blindly following the index than trying to actively beat it that said no one promises that investing in s&p500 is better than investing in djia for example these are two different indexes tracking different stocks and areas so when advisers say diversify they do n't mean it that you should diversify between different stocks that build up the s&p500 index they mean that you should diversify your investments in different areas some in s&p500 some in djia some in international indexes some in bond indexes etc still investing in various indexes will likely yield better results than actively managing the investments trying to beat those indexes but you should not invest in only one and that is the meaning of diversification in the comments you asked why diversify at all and that is entirely a different question from your original what diversification is you diversify to reduce the risk of loss from one side and widen the net for gains from another the thing is that any single investment can eventually fail regardless of how it performed before you can see that the s&p500 index lost 50 of its value twice within ten years whereas before it was doubling itself every several years many people who were only invested in that index or what 's underlying to it lost a lot of money but consider you 've diversified and in the last 20 years you 've invested in a blend of indexes that include the s&p500 but also other investments like s&p bse mentioned by victor below you would reduce your risk of loss on the american market by increasing your gains on the indian market add to the mix soaring chinese real estate market during the time of the collapse of the us real estate gains on the dollar losing its value by investing in other currencies canadian dollar for example etc there are many risks and by diversifying you mitigate them and also have a chance to create other potential gains now another question is why invest in indexes that has been answered before on this site it is my opinion that some methods of investing are just gambling by trying to catch the wave and they will almost always fail and rarely will individual stock picking beat the market of course after the fact its easy to be smart and pick the winning stocks but the problem is to be able to predict those charts ahead of time

i 'm not an attorney nor am i a licensed tax adviser i suggest you talk to these two types of professionals from my limited knowledge without proper documentation organization i ca n't see how the irs state will not consider this as a rent payment the mortgage responsibility is of the person signing the mortgage contract and you 're under no obligation to pay that person anything had you not lived at the property you might argue that it was a gift although i 'm not sure if it would stand but since you do live in the property it is quite obviously a rent payment putting your name on the deed may mitigate this slightly but i 'm not sure how much since you 're still not obligated to pay the mortgage however this is probably moot since it is unlikely for a bank to give a mortgage on a property to person a when it is also owned by a person b without that person b being side to the mortgage contract

with a check there are limits on cashing the stale check but that is set by the banks involved with a debit card transaction it will be up the the debit card company and your bank imagine a situation where a person finds an old check and tries to cash it at their bank if the bank considers the check stale they might reject it or put a longer hold on the check when the check writers bank gets the transaction they will also decide what to do if they reject it the first bank will reverse the transaction you ca n't count on a 90 day or 180 day limit most banks will ask you to put a stop payment on an old check that you do n't want cashed this is especially important step if you write a replacement check because there is no check number to put a stop payment on in fact the temporary hold will fall off after a few days there does n't appear to be a way to stop an old transaction be careful if you do contact the restaurant you could end up double paying for the meal if they swipe your card again   your best option may be just to keep the transaction as pending

how would this trade behave irl i do n't know how the simulation handles limit orders and bid ask spreads to know it 's feasible but buying at when the current ask is 8.00 seems unlikely   that would mean that all other sell orders between 8.00 and were fulfilled which means that there were very few sellers or that sell pressure spiked both of which seem unlikely in reality it seems more likely that your order would have sat there until the ask dropped to $ if it ever did and then you 'd have to wait until the bid rose to $ in order to sell them at that price however that kind of swing in option prices in not unrealistic   options near at the money tend to move in price at about 50 of the change in the underlying so if amazon suddenly dropped by $ 5 the option price could drop by $ from to $ and then rise back to $ if the price rose $ 8 which would be 1 swing and not unheard of intra day but it sounds like you got very lucky or the simulation does n't handle option trading realistically i 've traded options in the past and have had some breaks similar to yours   i 've also had bad breaks where i lost my entire investment the options expire out of the money so it should be a very limited part of your portfolio and probably only used for risk management e.g. buying put options to lock in some gains but keeping some upside potential

a share of stock is a small fraction of the ownership of the company if you expect the company to eventually be of interest to someone who wants to engineer a merger or takeover it 's worth whatever someone is willing to pay to help make that happen or keep it from happening which means it will almost always track the company 's value to some degree because the company itself will buy back shares when it can if they get too cheap to protect itself from takeover it may also start paying dividends at a later date you may also value being able to vote on the company 's actions including whether it should offer a dividend or reinvest that money in the company basically you would want to own that share or not for the same reasons you would want to own a piece of that business because that 's exactly what it is

the first thing is to look at the monthly cost of the loan the one from the company is interest free while it is unlikely that a bank will have a zero percent loan you will also have to look at what the seller will offer   the next thing to look at is the term of the loan when comparing two loans with the same interest rate the shorter term loan will cost more per month many times when an auto dealer offers a zero percent loan they also   have a very short term 12 24 months many people ca n't afford the monthly payments with that short a term   you said you could afford to save the other $ 2000 in about six months that means you could set aside $ a month to do it in six months if the loan from the employer has a term longer than 6 months you should be able to afford the loan keep in mind that the employer will probably be taking the money right out of your paychecks   you do have to look at the conditions attached to the loan what does accepting the loan do to your employment situation if you leave early do they want you to pay it back in 30 days or will they take the rest from the final paycheck or do you have longer   you do have to look at the term of the loan and see if you can pay it off early if they require a 12 month term can you end it earlier or change the monthly payment to end it early the reason why you care about the term is that if the term is 24 months then after a year you still owe them $ 1000 which if you have to pay back immediately if you quit it may make it hard for you to leave the company a minor note they probably are not reporting it to the credit reporting agencies therefore it wo nt help your credit score this is probably not a big issue since you are considering going without a loan

if i invest x each month where does x go an existing low yield    bond or a new bond at the current interest rate this has to be viewed in a larger context   if the fund has outflows greater than or equal to inflows then chances are there is n't any buying being done with your money as that cash is going to those selling their shares in the fund   if though inflows are greater than outflows there may be some new purchases or not   do n't forget that the new purchase could be an existing bond as the fund has to maintain the duration of being a short term intermediate term or long term bond fund though there are some exceptions like or high yield where duration is n't likely a factor does that just depend on what the fund manager is doing at the time    buying selling no it depends on the shares being created or redeemed as well as the manager 's discretion if i put y into a fund and leave it there for 50 years where does y    go when all of the bonds at the time i made the purchase mature   you 're missing that the fund may buy and sell bonds at various times as for example a long term bond fund may not have issues nearing maturity because of what part of the yield curve it is to mimic does y just get reinvested in new bonds at the interest rate at that time y gets mixed with the other money in the fund that may increase or decrease in value over time   this is part of the risk in a bond fund where nav can fluctuate versus a money market mutual fund where the nav is somewhat fixed at $ 1/share

when you invest in a single index security you are completely exposed to the risk of that security diversification means spreading the investments so the losses on one side can be compensated by the gains on the other side what you are talking about is one thing called risk more formally known as risk tolerance risk tolerance is the degree of variability in investment returns that an investor is willing to withstand emphasis added this means that you are willing to accept some losses in order to get a potential bigger return fidelity has this graph   as you can see in the table above the higher the risk tolerance the bigger the difference between the best and worst values that is the variability the right most pie can be one example of an agressive diversified portfolio but this does not mean you should go and buy exactly that security high risk means playing with fire unless you are a professional playing with fire usually leaves people burnt in a financial context this usually means the money is gone recommended reading investopedia risk and diversification the risk reward tradeoff investopedia how to construct a high risk portfolio fidelity guide to diversification kpmg understanding and risk appetite pdf

as a former consumer credit counselor who worked with struggling homeowners and first time homebuyers i would argue that it is a mistake for lenders to rely on gross income and assumptions on what an applicant spends their income on i think lenders do this because they believe it is efficient and may not understand the long term ramifications for the stakeholders e.g. the borrower the lender the servicer the investor the broker the taxpayer the marshall the foreclosure lawyers etc or lenders do know the impact of a superficial mortgage screening and intentionally want to enrich themselves in the short term while harming other stakeholders in the long term developing a budget that reflects what a person can realistically spend on their mortgage takes much longer than signing up for a rocket mortgage i would say an hour minimum for the first appointment to get a baseline and at least two follow up appointments to make soon after or whenever a borrower 's financial situation changes dramatically credit counselors factor in all of the factors mentioned above i.e. take home pay future pay vs current pay the ability to adjust deductions seasonal expenses multiple sources of income and their frequency debt load etc budgets are always fluctuating but when it is done right by a qualified professional the result is a much more accurate financial picture   the consequences for not doing this type of old school due diligence or for willfully choosing to skip it are varied first off mortgages will be given to homeowners who should never have qualified in the first place and likewise denied to homeowners who should qualify this will result in market distortion and this distortion was a primary contributor to the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis and the wave of foreclosures that came with it another consequence is the stripping of wealth from minority communities since they are often targeted by the most unscrupulous of lenders additionally the securitization of mortgages based on poor diligence at the loan officer level means loan portfolio ratings are questionable investors will lose money and small banks who are heavily invested will fail as they did in the past depending on the federal enforcement of dodd frank act the taxpayers may or may not have to pick up the bill from a bailout of a big mortgage bank that was too big to fail via higher taxes lost jobs lost homes and other negative externalities that were not accounted for by the loan officer or willfully ignored   lastly borrowers also have a responsibility to provide accurate financial information which they do n't always do unfortunately in a capitalistic society where property is commoditized instead of communal there is always mistrust competition the fear that you will be left behind or the desire to get ahead this could incentivize cheating by either the borrower the broker lender or both in this example e.g. no doc negative loans this is just one of many other negative externalities so the only true fix would be a switch to communal land ownership in the interim i would push for universal borrower access to low cost consumer credit counselors and a change in loan officer training and incentive structure

there is no one answer to this question but there are some generalities most exchanges make a distinction between the passive and the aggressive sides of a trade   the passive participant is the order that was resting on the market at the time of the trade   it is an order that based on its price was not at the time and therefore goes into the order book   for example i 'm willing to sell 100 shares of a stock at $ 9.98 but nobody wants to buy that right now so it remains as an open order on the exchange then somebody comes along and is willing to meet my price i am glossing over lots of details here   so they aggressively take out my order by either posting a market buy or specifically that they want to buy 100 shares at either $ 9.98 or at some higher price most exchanges will actually give me as the passive i.e. liquidity making investor a small rebate while the other person is charged a few fractions of a cent   google found details and most other exchanges make their fees public as well   as of this writing the generic price charged credited but they provide volume discounts and many of the larger deals do fall into another tier of volume which provides a different price structure

how do people do it firstly i 'd advise you to explicitly budget all taxes the reason is because taxes get complicated when you have a child deduction not that raising a child is profitable post taxes but it can change your perspective with high income get by just fine the rest sacrifice they buy less house or rent they drive more than 30 minutes to work every day they work second jobs they stop saving for retirement and when they fail to save or plan they borrow from family or rack up huge credit card debt they do n't buy the sweet new truck they were planning on they cut cable and cook meals at home they skip church because they ca n't afford the and say it 's because they do n't have time do n't want their children to disrupt services etc   so right now that other basket is looking pretty juicy and the taxes can maybe be examined as well but ultimately if you 're looking at a 30 percent hit in pay that wo n't cut it mortgage + food alone is nearly half your budget

this is a good idea but it will barely affect your credit score at all   credit cards while a good tool to use for giving a minor boost to your credit score and for purchasing things while also building up rewards with those purchases are n't very good for building credit    this is because when banks calculate your credit report they look at your long term credit history and weigh larger longer term debt much higher than short term debt that you pay off right away   while having your credit card is better than nothing it 's a relatively small drop in the pond when it comes to credit    i would still recommend getting a credit card though it will if you have n't already started paying off a debt like a student or car loan give you a credit identity and rewards depending on the credit card you choose   but if you do do not ever let yourself fall into delinquency   failing to pay off loans will damage your credit score   so if you do plan to get a credit card it is much better to do as you 've said and pay it all off as soon as possible    edit   in addition to the above using a credit card has the added benefit of having greater security over debit cards and ensures that your own money wo n't be stolen though you will still have to report a fraudulent charge

you need to first visit the website of whatever state you 're looking to rent the property in and you 're going to want to form the llc in that particular state find the department of licensing link and inquire about forming a standard llc to register as the owner of the property and you should easily see how much it costs if the llc has no income history it would be difficult for the bank to allow this without requiring you to personally guarantee the loan the obvious benefit of protecting yourself with the llc is that you protect any other personal assets you have in your name your liability would stop at the loan   the llc would file its own taxes and be able to record the income against the losses i.e. interest payments and other operating expenses this is can be beneficial on your current tax situation i would definitely recommend the use of a tax accountant at that point   you need to be sure you can really afford this property in the worst case scenario and think about market leasing assumption property taxes maintenance and management especially if you 've moved to another state

why does it make sense financially to buy property and become a landlord because then your investment generates cash instead of just sitting idle all taxes fees and repairs aside it would take almost 21 years before i start making profits no your profit will be the rents that you collect minus expenses you still have an asset that is worth roughly what you paid for it and might go up in value so you do n't need to recoup the entire cost of the property before making a profit compared to investing the same 150k in an etf portfolio with conservative 4 in annual returns i would have made around 140k € after taxes in the same 21 years i.e. almost doubled the money if you charge 600 € month and never miss a month of rental income after 21 years you have made € in rents plus you still have a property   that property is most likely going to be worth more than you paid for it so you should have at least 300k € in assets having said all that it does not always make sense to invest in rental property   being a landlord can be a hard job and there are many risks involved that are different that risks in financial investments

it would seem that you are in a position where you are able to save money and you hope to have your money work for you from your statement above it is implied that you are a professional with a steady income not related to the finance field with that said it is better to diversify your portfolio and have your money work for you through passive investments rather than an active one where you actively search for companies that are below market price that research takes time and much more experience in order to properly execute   now if your overall goal is to trade actively then maybe researching individual companies might be the best way to get your feet wet but if your goal is to create a diversified portfolio and make your money work for you then passive is the way to go   two passive financial vehicles   mutual funds and etfs depending on what you are hoping to accomplish in the future an etf or a mutual fund will likely suite your situation i would encourage you to do your due diligence and find out the weakness and strength of each from there you are able to make an informed decision

i get the idea behind it but certainly you would agree that it can be seen as a selfish mindset say i 'm working on a project with this guy and we have a deadline at the end of the week if he is not willing to stay an extra hour or two on thursday afternoon to make sure we meet the deadline because he feels he needs to be compensated to put in a little extra effort then that is not a person i would enjoy working with that 's also an attitude that i do n't think will get you very far however fair that may be   routinely putting in 60 + hours when you are paid for 40 is different i would n't have anything against a person unwilling to do that but i 'm sure most people would prefer working with somebody that is willing to go the extra mile when needed rather than the guy clocks out at every day

i want to know ideally how much should a person save for retirement    funds a person should save enough such that your total retirement resources will equal the amount you personally need for a comfortable retirement at the point in time when the person desires to retire if you want to retire at 40 you may need to save quite a lot each year if you want to retire at 70 you may need to save less each year if you will have a pension you may wish to save somewhat less than someone who wo n't have a pension the same is true for social security or your local equivalent i am getting a feeling retirement funds is equal to financial    independence because one can live without needing to borrow money from    anyone sort of but it depends on your goals some who are financially independent never choose to retire but choose jobs without regard to financial need

there are two reasons for incorporating a business in canada limiting liability and providing some freedom in structuring your taxes since you are asking about taxes i will restrict myself to that topic first of all remember that if you do n't make much money there is n't much tax to save by clever structuring of your affairs and if you do incorporate you will pay taxes as a corporation and pay taxes again on your salary paid from that corporation it can still be advantageous because the small business tax rate is less that the higher tax brackets of personal taxes and you do n't have to pay out all of the profit as salary if you do n't incorporate you still must pay taxes on your net income from the business see brian 's answer definitely keep track of your income and expenses even if you do n't plan on making money in case you get audited if the cra wants to call your hobby a business you will need to show that you have n't made any profit i am just giving you a few bits of advice because this subject is complicated too complicated for an answer on this site if you are still interested go to your local library and get some books on the subject

look i agree with you in theory    in practice it is quite different    the fact that there is way more educated people than is even remotely necessary the extreme vast majority of jobs out there do not even require actual ability to get a diploma let alone a degree    think about your daily life with whom do you actually deal with that requires much of an education few people are going to pay more to their retail sales or car because they have an advanced degree     everybody having a college degree drives the value down for everybody which is exactly what is happening     things need to be turned on their head i propose that colleges need to receive their income as a percentage of the first 10 15 years of income from their students   it will cut down on bogus degrees concentrate on valuable students even those with questionable academics like steve jobs and larry and concentrate on degrees with high future value    however when you get 2500 applications for a lower end job i would immediately take it down to those with a degree because it 's easy and nobody will second guess you

what makes a standard raise depends on how well the economy is doing how well your particular industry is doing and how well your employer is doing all these things change constantly so anyone who says a good raise is 5 or whatever number is being simplistic even if true when he said it it wo n't necessarily be true next year or this year in a different industry etc the thing to do is to look for salary surveys that are reasonably current and applicable if today in your industry the average annual raise is 3 again just making up a number then that 's what you should think of as standard if you want a number okay in general as a first draft number i look for a raise that 's 2 or so above the current inflation rate yes of course i 'd like to get a 20 raise every year but that 's not going to happen in real life on the other hand if a company gives me raises that do n't keep pace with inflation than barring special circumstances i 'm going to be looking for another job but there are all sorts of special circumstances if the economy is in a depression and unemployment in my field is 50 i 'll probably figure i 'm lucky to have a job at all and not be too worried about raises if the economy is booming and all my friends are getting 10 and 20 raises then i 'll want that too as others have said in the united states at least the best way to get a pay raise is to change jobs i think most american companies are absolutely stupid about this they do n't want to give current employees big raises so they let them quit and then hire replacements at a much higher salary than they were paying the guy they just drove to quit and the replacement does n't know the company and may have a lot to learn before he is fully productive and then they congratulate themselves that they kept raises this year to only 3 even though total salaries paid went up by 10 because the new hires demanded higher salaries they actively punish employees for staying with the company reminds me of an article i read in a business magazine by an executive of a cell phone company he the fact that in the cell phone industry it is very hard to keep customers they are constantly switching to other vendors and i thought duh maybe it 's because you offer big discounts for the first year or two and after that you jack your prices up through the roof you actively punish your customers for staying with you more than 2 years and then you wonder why customers leave after 2 years oh if you do change jobs absolutely do not buy a line of we 'll start you off with this lower salary but do n't worry because you 'll get a big raise in a year when you 're looking for a job it 's very easy to turn down a poor offer once you have taken a job leaving to get another job is a big decision and a lot of work so you have way more bargaining power on starting salary than on raises and the company knows it and is trying to take advantage of it also consider not just percentage increase but what you 're making now versus what other people with similar experience are making if people comparable to you are making $ 50k and you 're making $ 30k you 're more likely to get a big raise than if you 're already making $ 80k if the company says we just do n't have the budget to give you a raise the key question is is that true if the company is on the edge of bankruptcy and trying to cut costs everywhere then even if they know you 're a good and productive employee they may really just not have the money to give you a good raise but if business is booming this could just be an excuse it might be an excuse for we 're trying to bleed employees white so the ceo can get another million dollar bonus this year or it might be a for you 're really not a very useful employee and we 're seriously thinking of firing you no way we 're going to give you a raise for the little bit of work you do when you bother to show up my final word be realistic what matters is n't what you want or think you need but what you are worth to the company and what other people with similar skills are willing to work for if you are doing work that brings in $ 20k per year for the company there is no way they are going to pay you more than $ 20k for very long you can go on and on about how expensive it is these days to pay the mortgage and pay medical bills and feed your 10 children and support your cocaine addiction but none of that is relevant to what you are worth to the company likewise if there are millions of people out there who would love to have your job for $ 20k if you demand a lot more than that they 're going to fire you and hire one of them conversely if you 're bringing in $ 100k a year for the company they 'll be willing to pay you a substantial percentage of that

wireless capabilities see tesla every type of communication outside of the really was created without the government so the fact that i was born here against my own free will automatically gives the government the right to seize the fruits of my labor this is where this bullshit statist logic falls apart because the only rebuttal you have is well just leave then which is fucking stupid and in pretty sure i already gave you 1 way but i 'll say it again cuz it 's clear you 're incapable of following along federal sales tax with federal sales tax there are no deductions or coercion also the more money individuals have in their pocket   disposable income the more likely they are to spend and grow the economy that 's why you see countries like sweden with insane tax rates seeing limited growth and in a lot of cases on the verge of an economic collapse so if people have more disposable income causing them to have more purchasing power a federal sales tax would probably do better than an income tax and the people would receive something tangible instead of just losing 25 of their pay check btw do n't ever say my income tax pays for roads because they do n't that 's what a gas tax is for a majority of our infrastructure is paid for with revenue from other taxes not income income taxes pay mostly into military budget and social programs ie social security

while i 've never used wall street survivor i took a look over the marketing materials and i 've seen multiple similar contests run among investment interns also just out of college   i see some good here and some bad first off i love interactive web based tutorials   i 've used one to learn the syntax of a new programming language and i find the instant feedback and the ability to work at your own pace very useful   the reviews seem to say that wall street survivor is a good way to learn the basics of how trading stocks works and the lingo   also it seems pretty fun which i 've found helps a lot wall street survivor will hopefully teach you that there are many real stock markets and that they may have somewhat different prices and they likely take the real and timely data from a single market wall street survivor also me   the big problem that i see with interns running similar contests is that the market is extremely random over short to medium periods of time   an intern can make an awful portfolio or even pick stocks at random and still win the contest   these interns know a lot about the randomness in markets already so they do n't believe they are trading geniuses because they won a contest i 'm not sure there is much to temper this view on this web site also while wall street survivor teaches you about trading it does n't appear to teach you about investing   the website appears to encourage short term views and changing positions a lot and does n't seem to simulate the full trading costs including fees that would eat away at the gains of a individual investor that trades that much   it gives some help with longer term thinking like diversification but also seems to encourage trading that makes wall street survivor more money but are likely detrimental to the user i would say have fun with wall street survivor let it teach you some things about trading but do n't give the site much if any money   at the same time pick up a copy of short book called a random walk down wall street and start learning about investing at the same time   feel free to come back to stack exchange with questions along the way

when you pay off a loan early you pay the remaining principal and you save all of the remaining interest so you do save on interest but it 's the interest you would have paid in the future not the interest you have paid in the past your remaining balance when you pay off the loan only includes the principal not the projected interest interest is a factor of the amount borrowed the interest rate and the amount of time you borrow the money the sooner you repay the money the less interest you pay imagine if you had taken a 30 year loan at 4 interest but were allowed to make no payments until the loan term ended if you waited 15 years to make your first payment you would n't owe the same money as if you 'd made payments every month no instead of owing you 'd owe because you had borrowed $ 100k for 15 years plus the interest due rather than borrowing a declining sum so that 's why you do n't get a refund on interest for previous months if you had started with a 16 year loan then you would have been paying more principal every month and your monthly amount due would have been higher to reflect that as you paid the principal off faster the interest each month would drop faster paying a huge portion of the principal at the end of the loan is not the same as steadily paying it down in the same time frame you will pay a lot more interest in the former case and rightfully so it might help to consider a credit card payment in comparison if you run up a balance and pay only the minimum each month you pay a lot of interest over time because your principal goes down slowly if you suddenly pay off your credit card you do n't have to pay any more interest but you also do n't get any interest back for previous months that 's because the interest accrued each month is based on your current balance just like your mortgage the minimum payments are calculated differently but the interest accrued each month uses essentially the same mechanism

yes the stock market is rigged to some extent but if you are good at game theory then you can predict the direction of bias and therefore take advantage of the rigged nature of the market eventually enough people become aware of the bias and then the people who are manipulating the market have to change their strategy this is just how the market works though its always worked this way it has just become more and more sophisticated   look at it this way if you control billions of dollars in equities then you have to manipulate the market to give you a favorable price if you do nt manipulate then day traders and speculators will drive up the price of a security before you can even get your money in   so the big players try to manipulate the market and the small fish try to predict the manipulation welcome to the jungle

the banks countrywide was the worst about this failed to uphold lending standards when they were giving out mortgages because it was n't in their self interest   is there such thing as lending standards as in by law or by regulations not ethics   as far as i know the major regulations banks have to follow are the capital ratio requirements basel i ii and the min 4 leverage ratio i 'm assuming the banks kept to the ratios by keeping illiquid loans off their balance sheet   gt;after the banks would give someone a mortgage the banks would make their fees off the mortgage and then bundle these mortgages into securities the banks then had these sub prime mortgages that are now bundled together as securities    from my understanding the bank did originate the loan and they will assign this loan to a trust fund who will the loans into cdos or mortgage backed securities i have 2 questions from this   1 what is wrong with this and   2 if it is unethical or greedy what can be done to solve this stop them from these loans would n't that destroy the reinsurance market   gt;then s&amp;p and other ratings agencies gave them aaa ratings despite nearly everyone in the industry knowing they were time bombs waiting to go off goldman sachs and everyone else knew what was going on but they did n't want to get stuck holding the bag per se so they committed fraud by knowingly misleading their clients to buy these securities   so the responsibility lies more with these guys then goldman sachs were the ones committing fraud and now the sec is going after fannie and freddie the banks did n't break any laws or regulations

's original answer and the   example with proportionate application of the payment to the two balances is not quite what will happen with us credit cards by us law card act of 2009 if you make only the minimum   required payment or less the credit card company can choose which part of the balance that sum is applied to i am not aware of any company that chooses to apply such payments to anything other than that part of the balance which carries the least interest rate   including the 0 rate that results from acceptance of balance transfer   offers if you make more than the minimum required payment then the excess must by law be applied to paying off the highest rate balance if the highest rate balance gets paid off completely any remaining amount must be applied to second highest rate balance and so on   thus it is not the case that that $ 600 payment in joe 's example is applied proportionately to the $ 5000 and $ 1000 balances owed it depends on what the required minimum payment is so what would be the minimum required payment the minimum payment is the total of i all finance charges incurred during that month ii all service fees and penalties e.g. fee for exceeding credit limit fee for taking a cash advance late payment penalty and other charges e.g. annual card fee and iii a fraction of the outstanding balance that by law must be large enough to allow the customer to pay off the entire balance in a reasonable length of time the law is silent on what is reasonable but most companies use 1 which would pay off the balance over years   consider the numbers in joe 's example together with the following assumptions $ 5000 and $ 1000 are the balances owed at the beginning of the month no new charges or service fees during that month and the previous month 's minimum monthly payment was made on the day that the statement paid so that the finance charge for the current month is on the balances stated the finance charge on the $ 5000 balance is $ while the finance charge on the $ 1000 balance is $ giving a minimum required payment of $ + + 60 = $ of the $ 600 payment $ would be applied to the lower rate balance $ 5000 + $ = $ and reduce it to $ the excess $ would be applied to the high rate balance of $ 1000 + = $ and reduce it to $ in general it is a bad idea to take a cash advance from a credit card do n't do it unless you absolutely must have cash then and there to buy something from a merchant who does not accept credit cards only cash and do n't be tempted to use the convenience checks that credit card companies send you from time to time all such cash advances not only carry larger rates of interest there may also be upfront fees for taking an advance but any purchases made during the rest of the month also become subject to finance charge in other words there is no grace period for new charges and this state of affairs will last for one month beyond the first credit card statement whose statement is paid off in full in timely fashion finally turning to the question asked i am trying to determine how much i need to pay monthly to zero the balance as per the above calculations if the op makes the minimum required payment of $ plus $ that $ will be applied to the low rate balance and the rest $ will pay off the high rate balance in full if the payment is made on the day the statement is issued if payment is made later but before the due date that $ will be accruing finance charges until the date the payment is made and these will appear as 22 rate balance on next month 's statement similarly for the low rate balance what if several monthly payments will be required the best calculator known to me is at free but it is necessary to set up a username and password   enter in all the credit card balances and the different interest rates and the total amount of   money that can be used to pay off the balances and the site will lay out a payment plan   basically pay off the highest interest rate balance as much as possible while making minimum required payments on the rest most people are surprised at how much can be saved and how much shorter the time to be debt free is if one is willing to pay just a little bit more each month

i 'm not saying they should n't try and perhaps in the very long run it might be a good idea in fact if they were able to fix some of their own problems it would be a great idea here is my understanding of a few points to suggest as of now it 's not ukraine is still very corrupt ukraine does n't really have an economy that can support itself ukraine had traditional ties to russia and these ties included economic ties   to join the eu a country should be in a position to foremost support itself not only will joining mean having huge inflation but you 're substituting one creditor and buyer for another problem is you 're right beside russia so you should be extra prepared for hard times most i 've spoken to do n't necessarily agree on what 's right or wrong but economically sticking with russia and cleaning up the government would be the ideal problem is russia a less than clean influence this is a problem and where many people are stuck because just switching to eu will probably be harder on average people

circa 2002 2005 i was able to successfully transfer a balance from a debit card linked to a bank account to a bank of america visa credit card as an example i could say do a balance transfer from the card xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx which was a valid debit card number to the credit card and the funds would appear in the checking account within a few days and also the balance on the credit card would go up the amount plus any balance transfer fee i think they 've sealed off that loophole years ago

the united states taxes nonresident aliens on two types of income first a nonresident alien who is engaged in a trade or business in the united states is taxed on income that is effectively connected with that trade or business second certain types of u.s source payments are subject to income tax withholding the determination of when a nonresident alien is engaged in a u.s. trade or business is highly fact specific and complex however keeping assets in a u.s. bank account should not be treated as a u.s. trade or business a nonresident alien 's interest income is generally subject to u.s. federal income tax withholding at a rate of 30 percent under section of the tax code interest on bank deposits however benefit from an exception under section so long as that interest is not effectively connected with a u.s. trade or business even though no tax needs to be withheld on interest on a bank deposit the bank should still report that interest each year to the irs on form the irs can then send that information to the tax authority in brazil please keep in mind that state and local tax rules are all different and whether interest on the bank deposits is subject to state or local tax will depend on which state the bank is in also the united states does tax nonresident aliens on wages paid from a u.s. company if those wages are treated as u.s source income generally wages are u.s source income if the employee provides services while physically present in the united states there are a few exceptions to this rule but they depend on the amount of wages and other factors that are specific to the employee 's situation   this is an area where you should really consult with a u.s. tax advisor before the employment starts maybe your company will pay for it

my problem with your argument is the idea that we make a decision and reap the benefits sometime in the near and measurable future   where as the actual outcome of our decision may not be realized until many other decisions are made afterwards thus making the number of permutations very high   while i agree there tend to be people who can make better or more informed decisions given a situation i think you give them entirely too much credit given the long run possibilities of outcomes   my ultimate point being no matter who you are you are limited to being able to consider so many steps ahead or combinations at a single time   and there are certainly people who make bad choices but get good outcomes and vice versus   since we do n't see one person or a specific model for making decisions i have to believe that one simply does not exist   so call it luck or informed decisions i think at a certain point people make decisions and reap the rewards of those decisions independently   maybe more often than not the informed win but there have been plenty of smart people out there with brilliant models and ideas that go down in flames   likewise i 've meet some pretty dumb people who happen to be at the right place at the right time and turn the right knob   not sure i was clear in explaining my point its been a long day

there are peer to peer services these days which work by trying to match someone who wants to convert currency x to currency y with other people who want to convert y to x. obviously this works better with major currencies they tend to give you the interbank rate banks use to trade with each   less their commission of 1 2 banks can charge up to 5 and use different rates for buying and selling transfers may take a day or two although you may be able to do it faster if you pay extra transferwise currencyfair and midpoint are examples of such services though there are many others here 's a link to a newspaper article with more details

according to the answers to this question you generally are n't taxed on gains until you sell the asset in question none of those answered specifically for the u.k. so perhaps someone else will be able to weigh in on that to apply those ideas to your question yes your gains and losses are taxable if you originally traded something worth $ 100 for the bitcoins then when you converted back to dollars you received $ 200 you would have a $ 100 gain simply on the foreign exchange trade that is this $ 100 of income is in addition to any income you made from your business selling goods

the issue here is that the transaction your funds to her account looks very similar to the rent payments which you plan to make in the future those rental payments if deemed to be commercial would normally be subject to tax consider the scenario where rather than an up front $ 5000 and $ 5000 over 2 years you paid her $ 10000 and paid no rent that might be an attempt to avoid paying tax a commercial transaction ca n't be re labeled as a gift just based on your election the transaction needs to be considered as a whole however an interest free unsecured loan connected with you paying rent at market rate would be depending on local laws simply foolish to some extent i do n't think you are able to structure the transaction as a joint purchase since the mortgage will prevent her from allocating a part of the property to you its also likely that you can live in her house and contribute an adequate amount to the household costs without creating a taxable income for her for example in the uk up to pa rental income generated from the property in which you reside does not need to be declared you need to identify the scenarios where your particular arrangement could be imagined as resulting in a taxable or potentially taxable event then make sure you are not avoiding those events just by choosing how you label the events

true my thinking is the higher the rates are the less people you 'll have borrowing the less chance of people defaulting more people buying with flat cash and of course cheaper housing prices   whereas with low interest rates you 'll have more people borrowing thus increasing the likelihood of more people defaulting more people buying homes technically not buying technically just borrowing money and putting down mortgages and more expensive housing prices   quite frankly i think the way that the western world can solve its issue with unaffordable housing is by raising the interest rates to at least the double digits like they once were when housing was still cheap

its kind of a dumb question because no one believes that you can earn 8 in the short term in the market but for arguments sake the math is painfully easy   keep in mind i am an engineer not a finance guy so the first payment will earn you one month at 8 the second two   in effect three months at 8 on 997   you can do it that way because the payments are equal 997 .08 3 = earnings 20 so with the second method you pay 997 3 20 =

first paragraph is very true but you also have to take into consideration that the adviser and the company are 2 different things to look into for the adviser quickest and easiest way is to do a facebook search the point of this is to see how transparent they are with their personal life even companies are now relying on facebook to see how they really are i would n't care if the person has lots of photos with booze and girls but i would be concerned if they are using fb for spamming purposes have pictures with drugs or hints that they do n't like their job and want to move on to something else   second paragraph is spot on as well but i would rather want to know if the company cold calls or not which leads in to your last statement   for one adviser more than 100 clients is a red flag this could mean that they push savings plans left and right they do n't contact their current clients and/or they may not have the ability to assist clients should they get many queries   a few good questions to ask   1 how do you make your salary   2 besides this plan you are selling me what other types of products do you work with and show me several examples   3 how many other advisers are in your firm   4 how many clients does your colleagues and boss have   5 how often do you cold call   6 who else cold calls in your office   7 how does your company get new clients other than referrals    go style and ask the above questions several times using different phrases

purchasing an option to sell the stock is probably the safest bet this gives you reasonable leverage and your risk is limited to the cost of the option say the stock currently sells for $ 100 per share you think it will drop to $ 80 per share in the next two weeks and the market thinks the price will be stable now consider an option to sell one share of that stock for $ 95 any time within the next two weeks the market would consider that option nearly worthless since in all likelihood you would lose out by exercising it since you could just sell the share on the market for a price expected to be higher than that you might be able to acquire that option for $ 5 now say you 're right and within two weeks the price drops to $ 80 now you can purchase a share for $ 80 exercise the option to sell it for $ 95 and pocket $ 15 that would make you a $ 10 profit on a $ 5 investment if you 're wrong you just let the option lapse and are out $ 5 no problem in reality you would buy a number of such options and you would n't actually buy a share and exercise the option you would just sell the option back to its issuer for $ 15

many countries have employers report their employees salaries and withhold some money for income tax purposes it 's called pay as you earn withholding taxes or taxing at the source often the system is designed in such a way that most people actually pay too much and can get money back at the end of the year in that case the salary you receive can certainly be considered a net salary depending on the tax system individuals might need to file a separate tax returns to report any other income investments rents whatever or benefit from tax incentives but it can also be optional if you live in such a country and your situation is simple enough that there are no applicable deductibles you might simply choose to forgo it and let your employer take care of everything

first you should probably have a proper consultation with a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state in fact you should have had it before you started but that ship has sailed you 're talking about start up expenses you can generally deduct up to $ 5000 in the year your business starts and the expenses in excess will be amortized over 180 months 15 years this is per the irc sec the amortization starts when your business is active i.e. you can buy the property but not actually open the restaurant you can not start the depreciation i have a couple questions about accounting should all the money i    spent be a part of capital spending or is it just a part of it if it qualifies as start up organizational expenses it should be capitalized if it is spent on capital assets then it should also be capitalized but for different reasons and differently for example costs of filing paperwork for permits is a start up expense buying a commercial oven is a capital asset purchase which should be depreciated separately as buying the tables and if it is a salary expense to your employees then it is a current expense and should n't be capitalized our company is llc if this matters   it matters to how it affects your personal tax return

there are two fundamental flaws to your plan supposing that you can get a loan with an interest rate that is less than the profit you are likely to get from an investment historically the u.s. stock market goes up by 6 to 7 per year i just did a quick check and found rates for unsecured loans of 10 to 15 of course interest rates vary depending on your credit rating and all sorts of other factors but that 's probably a reasonable ball park borrowing money at 15 so you can invest it at 6 is not a good plan of course you could invest in things that promise higher returns but such investments have higher risks if there was a super safe investment that was virtually guaranteed to give 20 profit the bank would n't loan you money at 10 or 15 they 'd put their money in this 20 investment i do n't know what your income is but unless it 's substantial no one is going to give you an unsecured loan for $ 250,000   in your question you say you 'll use $ 2,000 of your profits to make payments on the loan that 's less than 0.8 of the loan amount if you really know a bank that will loan money at 0.8 i 'm sure we 'd all like to hear about it that would be an awesome rate for a fully secured loan never mind for a signature loan $ 250,000 for 10 years at 10 would mean payments of $ 3,300 per month and that 's about the most optimistic terms i can imagine for a signature loan you say you plan to lie to the bank what are you going to tell them a person does n't get to be a bank loan officer with authority to make $ 250,000 loans if he 's a complete idiot they 're going to want to know what you intend to do with the money and how you plan to pay it back if you 're making a million dollars a year sure they 'll probably loan you that kind of money but if you were making a million dollars a year i doubt you 'd be considering this scheme as said in the comments if it was really possible to get bigger returns on an investment than you would have to pay in interest on an unsecured loan then everybody would be doing it all the time sorry if you want to be rich the realistic choices are a arrange to be born to rich parents b win the lottery c get a good job and work hard

does it add to their lending reserves or is it utilized in other ways it depends on how the economy and the bank in particular are doing to simplify things greatly banks get deposits and lend or otherwise invest the majority of those deposits they must keep some percentage in reserve in case depositors want to make withdrawals and if they get a high percentage of withdrawals pushing them to be then they may sell their loans to other banks whether they lend the money to someone else or use the money for something else will depend completely on how many reserves they have from depositors and whether they have people lined up to take profitable loans from them i wrote this answer for the benefit of cqm i 'd vote to close this question if i had 49 more reputation points since it 's not really about personal finance

a sunk cost is a cost that you have already incurred and wo n't get back the sunk cost fallacy as you described is when you make a bad decision based on your sunk cost   when you identify a sunk cost you realize that the money has been spent and the decision is irreversible   future decisions should not take this cost into account   when you commit the sunk cost fallacy you are keeping something that is bad simply because you spent a lot of money on it   you are failing to identify the correct current value of something based on its high cost to you in the past the other fallacy you describe the opposite of the sunk cost fallacy is when you get rid of something that is good simply because you spent little on it   as before you are also failing to correctly identify the correct current value of something but in this case you are assigning too little a value based on the low cost in the past   you could call this a type of opportunity cost a loss of future benefits due to a mistake made today   it seems reasonable to describe this type of fallacy as an opportunity cost fallacy

first of all it 's pretty rare that would cash out your entire traditional ira at once when you retire that would incur major taxes and negate much of the tax deductibility benefit instead you 'd want to take distributions of just what you want to live on which are taxed at income rates and let the rest continue to grow tax free until you need want it as to your main question if you do n't expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement then yes roth makes sense but this is a pretty major assumption when you 're working your salary pushes you into higher tax brackets once you 're retired you do n't have as many sources of income it could be mostly distributions from retirement accounts and even coming from a traditional ira a lot of that will be tax free or taxed at a low rate e.g. 15 if when it was earned it would have been taxed at a higher marginal rate e.g. 25 then the traditional ira was a better choice than the roth traditional versus roth if both are options to you with deductibility for the traditional all comes down to tax rate now versus what you expect your tax rate to be in retirement there is no universal answer

it 's astonishing how my simple point this is going to suck really badly for thousands of people is somehow interpreted as some sort of approval for exploitative capitalism   as i keep saying these old companies have to go and in the last few years the quality of the jobs they offer has fallen and fallen frankly i see a collapse coming where most of these companies vanish   but it 's going to suck for the people who lost their jobs and i feel for them    gt think of all the unfortunate hedge fund managers who lost their jobs in 2008 shed any tears for them    heck no probably most of them should be in jail   and they wo n't go hungry   what 's your point   the poor suckers who work for sears are in a completely different category

with regard to your edit although i did n't downvote one way to reduce the security risk is to separate the payment from the ability to drain your account   a considerable part of the security risk is inherent in giving people a number which is directly linked to a bank account where you keep all your money   if you do n't want that risk do n't do that   instead of or in addition to trying to reduce the chance of fraud you can reduce the impact of fraud even if it occurs by not paying for things using the details of an account where you have all your money   trying to protect against fraud while keeping all your money in the account is sort of like carrying around thousands of dollars in cash in your wallet and then worrying about how to defend against robbery   yes you can carry a weapon or hire a but it 's probably simpler to just not carry that much money in the first place you already mentioned one solution with your option 1 which is to just keep a small amount of money in a separate account and use that for online payments   assuming you can easily transfer money in and out of this account via online banking this effectively is what you say you want in your edit you log in to your bank online but rather than informing it you 're about to make a payment you just transfer money in   you 'll probably have to keep a small amount of money in the account to keep it open but if this is an important issue for you that should n't be that big a deal another solution is a credit card   with a credit card you simply make the payment online   in the us if the merchant or someone else stealing the info makes fraudulent charges the credit card company assumes the liability and the consumer suffers only the inconvenience of having to get a new card issued   i do n't know what the uk laws are regarding credit vs. debit fraud but some sites i found seem to suggest that credit cards have fraud protection in the uk as well   this is probably worth looking into if you are concerned about fraud

there are two reasons why most options are n't exercised   the first is obvious and the second less so the obvious an option that 's practically worthless does n't get exercised options that reach expiry and remain unexercised are almost always worthless bets that simply did n't pay off this includes calls with strikes above the current underlying price and puts with strikes below it a heck of a lot of options if an option with value was somehow left to expire it was probably a mistake or else the transaction costs outweighed the value remaining not quite worthless but not worth it either the less obvious an option with value can be cancelled any time before expiration a trader that buys an option may at some point show a gain sooner than anticipated or a loss in excess of his tolerance if a gain he may want to sell before expiry to realize the gain sooner similarly if a loss he may want to take the loss sooner in both cases his capital is freed up and he can take another position and this is the key part the other end matched up with that option sale is often a buyer that had created written exactly such an option contract in the first place the option writer and who is looking to get out of his position option writers are the traders responsible in the first place for creating options and increasing the open interest   anybody with the right kind and level of options trading account can do this a trader that writes an option does so by instructing his broker to sell to open a new instance of the option the trader then has a short position negative quantity in that option and all the while may be subject to the obligations that match the option 's exercise rights the only way for the option writer to get out of that short position and its obligations are these not by choice   to get assigned that is to say a buyer exercised the option the writer has to fulfill his obligation by delivering the underlying if a call to the option holder or buying the underlying if a put from the option holder not by choice the option expires worthless this is the ideal scenario for a writer because 100 of the premium received less transaction costs is profit by choice the writer is free to buy back exactly the same kind of option before expiry using a buy to close order with their broker once the option has been purchased with a buy to close it eliminates the short position and obligation   the option is cancelled   the open interest declines options thus cancelled just do n't live long enough to either expire or be exercised

if the car loan has 0 interest for 5 years then paying off the student loan is cheaper no matter when you pay off the car you will pay the exact same amount as long as its within 5 years you could spend $ 20,000 right now to pay off the car loan or slowly spend $ 20,000 over the next 5 years the gross amount paid for the car loan does not change on the contrary the longer you wait to pay off the student loans the more you will end up paying for them so why not get the student loans out of the way before they rack up more interest and pay the car loan over time update i forgot to add as ben miller said congratulations on paying off the $ 40,000

having someone else paying you rent is always going to be the better deal financially the question is what does $ 450k buy in the neighborhood in which you want to live vs $ 800k i 'm going to assume you can afford either option buying a $ 450k home and not selling or an $ 800k home and selling your current one whether someone 's paying you rent or not let 's make up some numbers here a $ 450k home financed 80/20 principal at 4 for 30 years will cost you about $ in p&i payments per year plus escrows such as re taxes pmi and homeowners insurance where applicable an $ 800k home financed 80/20 principal at 4 for 30yr will give you payments of about $ before taxes and insurance so the worst case overall is that you buy a 450k home in the new neighborhood and are not at any given time collecting rent on the old property that would assuming the mortgage terms on both home loans were comparable cost you $ and you 'd be living in a $ 450k home in a neighborhood where 450k may not buy a home as nice as the one you moved out of the question as i stated above is this assuming you had a reliable tenant in your home for the entire remaining life of the loan on your current home which is more acceptable to you buying $ 450k of home which might be a downgrade in sqft or amenities and paying $ 2020 in p&i or paying about a grand more $ for a much nicer home in the new location strictly from a money perspective the renter is going to be the best option if you get reliable tenancy for the entire life of the mortgage on that house you 'll be paying $ for 30 years which is $ to end up with $ of total home value plus adjustments for actual home value appreciation depreciation that 's the only way you 'll come out ahead on any mortgage have someone else pay most of it for you if you do n't rent the $ 800k home will cost you $ while two $ 450k homes will cost you $ the percentage of home value over total payments for the 800k home would be 72 you will have paid 137 of the value of the home while you will have paid of the value of two 450k homes

thanks for your reply i think a lot of people are confused when talking about ownership and i think it is a issue    when a company issues stock the first time or anytime what they are doing is selling the right to a percentage of the dividend they are not actually selling parts of the company to you everyone thinks this way though and that has to do with the chicago school economists who perpetuated their ideas of ownership which is what everyone know thinks is the case this way of thinking about corporations and ownership is just wrong not ethically just erroneous    as i stated before of cornell university explains this really well i would encourage anyone to read more about it

today the rates are arrived simply on the basis of demand and supply historically rates were pegged to gold when all currencies were printed depending on the gold reserves so if one country printed 100 units of currency of a of gold and other country 10 units of currency for 1 gm of gold the rate would be 1:10 however in the with shortages of gold and other reasons usd became the default standard so the rate started being pegged to the usd reserves the countries started maintaining however later in the early us backing out the rate purely started getting pegged to market demand and supply so for most currencies there was a default rate to begin with and today its changed incase of usd eur the initial rate was determined by the weighted average of the currencies that it sought to replace after that its been market supply and demand since most of the trade in international market is us denominated largest being oil each country has created a huge reserves of usd so technically if china were to bank half its usd denominated treasury bills the usd would come crashing down but then china itself would be at disadvantage as its value of usd its holding would become less and it can not buy the same items hence all countries keep hording usd and this means us if they print more money the value will not come down because it that happens all countries holding usd would loose their value of reserve in essence a country can print as much as currency it wants if its debts and trades are denominated in local currencies this is 100 true for us and hence it can get away by printing money this is also true to a large extent for japan as bulk of its debts are denominated in jpy

is there anyway to salvage my investment for short term no   if by salvage you mean get back as much as you paid the only way to salvage it is to wait as long as you consider short term and see if goes up again   if by salvage you mean get some money back the only thing you can do to guarantee that is sell it now   by doing so you guarantee that you will get neither more nor less than it is worth right now   either way there is nothing you can do other than sell the stock or hold it   the stock price went down   you ca n't make it go back up would it be better if i sell my stocks now and buy from other company or should i just wait for it 's price to go up again this depends on why you bought the stock and what you think it will do in the future   you said a family member persuaded you   does that family member still think the stock will go up again   if so do you still trust them you did n't even say what stock it is in your question so there 's no way anyone here can tell you whether it 's a good idea to sell it or not   even if you do say what stock it is all anyone can do is guess   if you want you could look the stock up on motley fool or other sites to see if analysts believe it will rise   there are lots of sources of information   but all you can do with that information is decide to sell the stock or not it may sound obvious but you should sell if you think the stock will go lower and hold it if you think it could still go back up   no one can tell you which of those things is going to happen

i used to work as a sale support for one of these companies as a sale support i did n't get commission from the sale but a sale manager did and he made good money however i ended up doing a lot of the sales myself and never got any commission for it even though the boss kept promising me that i would get them it 's relatively easy money but i felt like you have to sell your soul a little it 's hard to justify for yourself that a 30 interest for a 6 month term is a great deal so you can get your guests to take the loan most of the clients you will likely get are the ones who 1 have little knowledge about finance and/or 2 can not get a loan anywhere else nobody would get a loan with these companies if they have a better choice i also found it was borderline harassment for my clients because i was forced to constantly call them few times a day to get them into taking our loan offers i did end up leaving the company after three months because the boss was and thought he could do it all himself   back to your question it is not shady mostly because it 's definitely legal but the sales tactics can be that would depend on your management but i would say most companies probably employs similar tactics

i think this is really two questions dumbcoder has already answered part 1 in a comment either just wire the money from the japanese bank account to the uk bank account either bank should be able to help you with the details of this or if your bank also has a uk operation you may be able to do it within the same bank   as for part 2 if you are looking for a mortgage then many high street mortgage providers banks will want proof of your savings up front they may or may not accept japanese bank statements all you can do is ask the question you would probably also need to ask your japanese bank if they can provide statements in english   if you find that most or all of the high street banks will not accept this as proof of assets or that they demand that the money is in the uk for a period of time first then you might have more luck with a mortgage broker who can deal with the specialist requirement if you do find a mortgage provider who is happy to accept japanese bank statements as proof of assets then you would simply need to wire the money direct from your bank in japan to the uk bank of your solicitor at or shortly before the point when the deposit becomes due usually at exchange of contracts

someone who filed for bankruptcy multiple times be running national finances at a time when we have a big debt problem   his answer   i 've never filed for bankruptcy   um to say the least this is semantics i would classify it as an outright lie   i say that because he the name on everything he is the president ceo chairman of the board he is responsible until things go south then the investors and debtors are left with an empty shell   here are some examples   trump plaza hotel bankruptcy on nov 2 1992 trump 's plaza hotel was forced to file chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after being unable to make its debt payments under the plan trump agreed to give up a 49 stake in this luxury hotel to citibank and five other lenders    trump shuttle closure the trump shuttle became no more

in his portfolio 's business debt   trump hotels amp casino resorts bankruptcy on november 21 2004 trump 's company filed for bankruptcy trump said the filing was really just a technical thing as the best way to implement a restructuring plan   donald trump personal bankruptcy again once again trump filed for personal bankruptcy protection and restructured his debt in 2004   bankruptcy on november 22 2006 donald j. trump ’s casino empire filed for bankruptcy protection after months of negotiations with bondholders over restructuring a crushing debt   donald trump 's online travel search engine was launched in 2006 just a year later it folded   trump 29 casino now known as spotlight 29 casino because donald trump 's ownership management involvement ended in 2006   donald trump ocean resort baja this mexican resort was never built and investor 's deposits up to $ have not been returned trump claims these buyers are lucky because they would have lost more money in a tanking market had the projects been actually built   trump towers tampa trump is being sued right now in tampa florida for taking deposits on a condo tower that he never built none of the buyers got their $ 45,000 deposits back and in an ironic twist initial sales of this condo were so successful that all deposits were returned to charge a higher price   trump international hotel and tower chicago trump built the second tallest building in chicago he also defaulted on a $ 40 million loan rather than having to pay the bank loan trump demanded the same bank should pay him $ 3 billion for undermining the project and damaging his reputation   trump magazine trump 's private labeled publication which was aimed at affluent readers in major us markets suffered from ad sales it folded on may 19 2009 this was trump 's third failed attempt at offering a magazine bearing his name   trump international hotel amp tower new orleans if constructed this trump tower would become the tallest building in the city of new orleans and the state of louisiana at 70 stories high but the project was put on hold in february of 2009   trump entertainment resort holdings bankruptcy on february 17 2009 casino operator trump entertainment resorts inc filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with a debt ratio of $ 50 million in assets to his $ 500 million in debt   donald trump hotel condominium donald trump was sued for fraud over his new york condo offering in 2010 the lawsuit by 15 plaintiffs alleged that during the first 18 months of marketing trump advertised that the building was 30 40 50 60 percent or more sold when in fact just 16 of the units were sold   trump ocean resort baja mexico instead of a luxury vacation home complex with pools and tennis courts this project is shaping up to be a legal battle with a big hole in the ground dozens of angry buyers sued trump for failing to complete the project trump claims he only lent his name to the project and it was the developers who allowed the project to fail   trump international hotel amp tower fort lauderdale construction was to be completed by the end of 2009 featuring hotel condominium units having defaulted on a $ million loan donald trump announced in november of 2010 he was no longer affiliated with the project   trump international hotel amp tower las vegas through the end of february 2010 the condominium hotel had only closed on units that equates to a vacancy rate it was forced into renting out the building as apartments   trump international hotel amp tower in dubai this mixed used building on the palm ’s golden mile was first announced in 2005 construction was never started and the $ 2.9 billion project had been canceled and replaced with a shopping mall   so back to your distinction has he filed for personal bk   no   has he filed for personal bk protection while he reorganized debt yes   does he manipulate the corporate bk laws by playing a corp shell game and filing for bk protection yes   is it smart business

depending on how you view the loan it could either be considered an asset or a liability   since you are not charging interest it might seem more intuitive to create an assets cash loan account and transfer money to from it when you receive payments like you would with a bank account personally i prefer to think of all loans as liabilities   whether it 's a debt which you owe someone or a balance which someone else owes you since it 's an unsettled amount i file it under liabilities loan   either way you record the initial balance as a debit from your bank and then record payments as credits back to your primary account the only way that income or expenses ever gets involved would be if you charged interest income or if you some or all of the loan expense at some point in the future

compounding is just the notion that the current period 's growth or loss becomes the next period 's principal so applied to stocks your beginning value plus growth or loss in value plus any dividends becomes the beginning value for the next period your value is compounded as you measure the performance of the investment over time dividends do not participate in the compounding unless you reinvest them   compound interest is just the principle of compounding applied to an amount owed either by you or to you you have a balance with which a certain percentage is calculated each period and is added to the balance the new balance is used to calculate the next period 's interest which again adds to the balance etc obviously it 's better to be on the receiving end of a compound interest calculation than on the paying end interest bearing investments like bonds pay simple interest like stock dividends you would have to invest the interest in something else in order to get a compounding effect when using a basic calculator tool for stocks you would include the expected average annual growth rate plus the expected annual dividend rate as your interest rate for bonds you would use the coupon rate plus the expected rate of return on whatever you put the interest into as the interest rate factoring in risk you would just have to pick a different rate for a simple calculator or use a more complex tool that allows for more variables over time believe it or not this is where you would start seeing all that calculus homework pay off

the tax cost at election should be zero   the appreciation is all capital gain beyond your basis which will be the value at election irc 83 applies to property received as compensation for services where the property is still subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture   it will catch unvested equity given to employees stops taxation until the substantial risk of forfeiture i.e. no tax until stock vests since the item is and not yet truly income   83(b allows the taxpayer to make a quick election up to 30 days after transfer firm deadline to waive the substantial risk of forfeiture e.g. treat shares as vested today the normal operation of 83 takes over after election and the taxable income is generally the value of the vested property minus the price paid for it   if you paid fair market value today then the difference is zero and your income from the shares is zero the shares are now yours for tax purposes though not for legal purposes   that means they are most likely a capital asset in your hands like other stocks you own or trade   the shares will not be treated as compensation income on vesting and vesting is not a tax matter for elected shares if you sell them you get capital gain with tax dependent on your holding period over a basis equal to fmv at the election   the appreciation past election fmv will be capital gain rather than ordinary income   this is why the 83(b election is so valuable   it does not matter at this point whether you bought the restricted shares at fmv or at discount or received them free that only affects the taxes upon 83(b election

i was told by the lawyers there was no tax consequence because the two    numbers were the same that is correct however a tax professional tells me that since the start up stock was    realized there a taxable event now that is correct i 'm now led to believe i owe cap gains tax on the entire 4 year vest    this year that is incorrect you owe capital gains tax on the sale of your startup stock which is accidentally the exact same amount you paid for the new unvested stocks there 's no taxable event with regards to the new stocks because the amount you paid for them was the amount you got for the old stocks but you did sell the old stocks and that is a taxable event

alright i know a lot of people do see it as being wrong and some have tried to pull a government motors sort of thing with tesla but it 's really not correct to do so so i tend to overreact a bit when i hear any suggestion that that be the case   by the way i should say that elon says the government loan did n't save the company   maybe it did and he 's just saying that for pr purposes but he has been honest in the past about when the company has been near death so i 'm willing to trust him on this one when he says this was n't a near death experience especially after hearing the story of the mercedes investment which elon has told in a few interviews   the roadster did make money overall but it was all spent on s development as had been the plan all along which is why tesla did n't show a profit on the books because it went into r&amp;d capex   the loan definitely helped make the s happen faster but i feel it probably would have happened anyway just maybe a year or two later or something   i also do encourage you to drive one if you can it 's a great thing to try

first i 'd like to congratulate you on your financial discipline in paying off your loans and living well within your means   i have friends who make more than twice your salary with similar debt obligations and they barely scrape by month to month if we combine your student loan debt and unallocated income each month we get about $ 1,350   you say that $ per month is the minimum payment for your loans which have an average interest rate of about 3.5   thus you have about $ 1,350 a month to invest making your loan payments is basically the same as investing with the same return as the loan interest rate when it comes down to it   an interest rate of 3.5 is not great all things considered and barely above inflation     however that 's a guaranteed return of 3.5 more or less like a bond   as noted previously the stock market historically averages 10 before inflation over the long run the us stock market is right around its historic high at this point djia is at today april 6th 2017 historic high hit just over on march 1 2017   obviously no one can predict the future but i get the feeling that a market correction may be in order especially depending on how things go in washington in the next weeks or months   if that 's the case again we have no way of knowing if it is you 'd be foolish to invest heavily in any stocks at this point what i would do given your situation is invest the $ in a portfolio that 's 50/50 stocks and bonds where the bonds here are your student loans   here you have a guaranteed return of on the bond portion and you can still hedge the other 50 on stocks continuing their run and also benefiting from dividends capital gains etc over time   i would apply the extra loan payments to the highest interest loan first paying only the minimum to the others   once the highest interest loan is paid off move onto the next one once you have all your loans paid off your portfolio will be pretty much 100 stocks at which point you may want to add in some actual bonds say a or 80/20 split depending on what you want   i 'm assuming you 're pretty young so you still have plenty of time to let the magic of compounding interest do its work even if you happen to get into the market right before it drops well that and the fact that you wo n't really have much invested anyway again let me stress that neither i nor anyone else has any way of knowing what will happen with the market i 'm just stating my opinion and what my course of action would be if i were in your shoes

the spot curve or yield curve demonstrates the different yields at which bonds of differing maturities are being purchased when the yield curve is upward sloping longer maturity bonds are being purchased at higher yields when it 's downward sloping longer maturity bonds are purchased at lower yields keep in mind that yield is inversely related to price so that a high yield bond will be at a lower price and vice versa the spot curve can also be used to determine the forward curve this is based on the concept that an investor given two options with identical cash flows will be indifferent in what to purchase i.e. their prices should be equal    to learn more about this stay here in /r finance to learn anything about your actual question try /r personalfinance

to begin i 'm not sure you understand what col refers to   it 's what you spend not what you bring in   let 's say bob makes 60k in some midwest town but spends 30k for living   if his salary and his cost of living both increase at the same rate let 's say they both double this means bob now makes 120k but spends 60k   he now saves double what he would have before   that 30k extra saved is 30k extra saved   his purchasing power has now gone greatly up especially in respect to housing outside of an expensive area like the valley   for one let me clear this up sf the city itself is expensive   i 'm talking more generally about the bay area and silicon valley as a whole   most tech jobs from the big tech companies that we think of as the bay are not in sf   they are in mountain view and that area   so this might explain some of our disagreements   most people who work for large tech companies understand they have a decision to make live in the city proper pay a lot more than the greater valley use transit into work all of the giants have regular in but get to love a more hip life or be more conservative in the valley where rental prices are on par with nyc   in talking to a lot of people who work for the big companies they know this   younger folks who want to live the city life pay the premium but by far and wide they live outside of it where it is closer to work and they take the rail up for weekends out with buddies   i 'm still not sure where you are getting a doubling of the col in the valley versus outside   yes housing as a single item is going to be a person 's largest expense   but all the rest of their expenses are not going to see a similar increase   it 's also important to remember that saving 10 of 60 v 10 of 120 is significantly different   lots of people take jobs in the valley are able to save vastly larger amounts of cash and then leave     in my calculations i evaluated the col markup to be ~30 for the valley for a 200k job   that is i spend maybe 50k of my earning on all living expenses in the midwest in a downtown nice area and would expect i 'd pay about 70k for the same standard in the valley   but i 'd be saving a more   i 've done the math i 'm not here to argue with someone who just googled sf cost of living searching for the answers i want   i 've talked to actual people out there   i appreciate your passion for this but your 100 increase in col estimate is simply wrong   but then again it depends on how you live and where you live in your current situation   i live in a large midwest city actually in the city itself

yes that is correct note when there is a tax treaty between canada and the other country which is pretty much anywhere you have active treaties conventions the tax credits are equal to the income received making it tax free here is a better explanation   gt the greatest advantage of having a foreign affiliate in the international business setting is   to repatriate foreign profits back to canada tax free under certain conditions for example   if a foreign affiliate carries on an active business in a designated treaty country i.e. a   country with which canada has a tax treaty the after tax profit is included in a pool   called exempt surplus if the repatriation of profit in the form of dividend was paid out   of the exempt surplus pool to a canadian corporate shareholder such dividend is   included in its income and the same amount is allowed to be deducted in computing its   taxable income in other words the dividend is not subject to canadian tax if received by   a canadian corporate shareholder    source test files 22   edit here from the site   gt treaty countries active business income earned in a treaty country is classified as exempt surplus the exempt surplus of an fa also includes inter affiliate dividends received out of the exempt surplus of other foreign affiliates the exempt portion 25 of all capital gains and certain taxable capital gains dividends paid out of the exempt surplus of an fa can be received free of additional taxes in canada since the profits out of which they are paid are considered to have borne a rate of tax in the treaty country comparable to that of canada   mining materials see the section on subsidiary income this is the reason bk is moving to canada also here is a very interesting deck on corporate tax in latin america by the canadian mining wp content

typically developing economics are marked by moderate to high inflation as they are growing at a faster pace higher in savings rate and higher lending rates if you reduce the lending rate more business start up will borrow at cheaper rate this in turn means lowers savings rate and leads to higher inflation to combat this central banks make borrowing expensive which lowers inflation and increases the saving rate essentially all these 3 are tied up as to why these countries offer higher interest on usd is because most of the developing countries have trade current account deficit they need to bring in more usd in the country one of the ways is to encourage non resident citizens to park their foreign earning back home ensuring more funds usd inflow   the rate differential also acts as a guide as to how the currency would be valued against usd for example if you get 8 on usd less than 12 had you converted same to rouble at the end of say 3 years the exchange rate between usd and rouble would factor that 4 ie rouble will go down developed countries on the other hand are marked by low inflation they have already achieved everything as there is no in growth it more they are also characterized by low savings and lending rates

this was a really unusual deal because a fund owned by one of the owners of the company was buying much of the shares seems that maybe someone at the company realized that they could get an ipo for much less than 7 because the bank was n't really doing much work or taking much risk for their cut and that nobody figured to put contingencies for this in a contract because how often does it happen   edit do people even read the articles for these things   you do an ipo where an existing shareholder and company director is buying half the deal that 's not quite the same as doing an ipo where the banks are just selling shares to investors that the banks dig up and when that shareholder decides that he 'd rather not buy his escape is not so much refusing to pay for his shares as it is trying to get the deal pulled   if sues the banks they can turn around and sue saying that this is a backdoor way of getting out of their contract

both credit card and mortgage work on same principle the interest is calculated on the remaining balance   as the balance reduces the interest reduces the mortgage schedule is calculated with the assumption that you would be paying a certain amount over a period of years however if you pay more then the balance becomes less and hence the subsequent interest also reduces this means you would pay the loan faster and also pay less then forecasted the other type of loan typically personal loans auto loans in older days worked on fixed schedule this means that you need to pay principal + pre determined interest this is then broken into equal monthly installment however in such a schedule even if you pay a amount in between the total amount you need to pay remains same only the tenor reduces

if you receive a loan from your parents it is treated legally just as a loan a bank or from any private person with spare money you do n't pay tax on a loan that you get from your bank or your parents and the bank or your parents do n't pay tax when you repay the loan if you pay interest the parents will have to pay tax on the interest just like they would have to pay tax if the money was in their own bank account   i would advice both you and your parents to make sure that a contract is signed saying that this is a loan and how it is repaid and that you follow the contract otherwise if you or your parents treat the loan as an actual present then you might have to pay tax because there is tax due on gifts and you might get a penalty for trying to avoid tax by declaring the gift as a loan so pay the money back only up to £ 3,000 in cash gifts that a person gives each year is tax free but the parents can use any unused money from last year so they can give a gift of £ 6,000 if they gave nothing in the previous year and it is per parent so both the mother and father can make a gift

the main difference between a mutual fund and an etf are how they are bought and sold from the investors perspective an etf is transacted on the open market this means you normally ca n't buy partial shares with your initial investment having to transact on the open market also means you pay a market price the market price is always a little bit different from the net asset value nav of the fund during market hours the etf will trade at a premium discount to the nav calculated on the previous day morningstar 's fund analysis will show a graph of the premium discount to nav for an etf with a mutual fund on the other hand your investment goes to a fund company which then grants you shares while under the hood buying the underlying investments you pay the nav price and are allowed to buy partial shares usually an etf has a lower expense ratio but if that 's equal and any initial fees commissions are equal i would prefer the mutual fund in order to buy partial shares so your initial investment will be fully invested and so you do n't have to worry about paying premium to nav

bit hesitant to put this in an answer as i do n't know if specific investment advice is appropriate but this has grown way too long for a comment the typical answer given for people who do n't have the time experience knowledge or inclination to pick specific stocks to hold should instead invest in etfs exchange traded index funds what these basically do is attempt to simulate a particular market or stock exchange an s&p 500 index fund will generally attempt to hold shares in the stocks that make up that index they only have to follow an index not try to beat it so are called passively managed they have very low expense ratios far below 1 and are considered a good choice for investors who want to hold stock without significant effort or expense and who 's main goal is time in the market it 's a contentious topic but on average an index and therefore an index fund will go even with or outperform most actively managed funds with a sufficiently long investment horizon which you have these may be ideal for you trading in etfs is also typically cheap because they are traded like stock there are plenty of low fee online brokers and virtually all will allow trading in etfs my broker even has a list of several hundred popular etfs that can be traded for free   the golden rule in investing is that you should never buy into something you do n't understand do n't buy individual stock with little information it 's often little more than gambling the same goes for trading platforms like do n't use them unless you know their business model and what they stand to gain from your custom as mentioned i can trade certain funds for free with my broker but i know why they can offer that and how they 're still making money

if you business is incorporated it 's up to the two of you how to do it typically you will have the company write cheques or make transfers whatever to each of the humans if you want to say that each of you gets a salary of 80 of the revenue you bring in and then tweak things with bonuses you can if one of you is contributing more to marketing and awareness and less to revenue then you may prefer to pay you each the same even though the revenue you bring are different it 's up to you it 's quite literally your business when you 're not incorporated then for tax purposes you split the income and the expenses according to your ownership share if that does n't seem fair to you then a partnership is probably not as useful to you as being incorporated in general it 's better to be incorporated once you 're past any initial phase in which the business is losing money for tax purposes acquiring depreciable assets and the partners have taxable income from elsewhere day jobs or at least income from the earlier part of the year before starting the business i would recommend that the partnership phase of the business be very short get incorporated and get a shareholder agreement

gt to me that 's a failure on a collective level   i 'd say it 's more of a failure on a personal level without the mass of wealth that exists due to capitalism and free trade there would be nothing to support anyone with we would n't have to worry about these conversations because there would be no internet and we 'd be too worried about killing wild dogs to eat and off the rest of the pack so they would n't kill us i think you 're taking a lot for granted   gt;the service industry employs a big chunk of the country if the people whom they employ ca n't eek out a living then something should be done minimum wage has existed for many years now and is not controversial   inflation is n't seen as controversial either but it should be here 's someone that finds it controversial

okay i went through a similar situation when my mother died in march of this year the estate still needs to go into probate especially if there was a will and when you do this your husband will be named as the executor then what he will need to do is produce both of their death certificates to the bank have the account closed and open an estate account with both of their names on it their debts anything like this should be paid from this account as well then what you can do is endorse the check as the executor and deposit it into this account after all debts are paid the money can be disbursed to the beneficiaries your husband basically as long as they did n't have any huge debts to pay he will see the money again it just may be a couple of months and you will have to pay some filing fees

as points out in his comment the real values are inflation adjusted values using the consumer price index cpi included in the spreadsheet   the nominal value adjusted by the cpi gives the real value in terms of today 's dollars for example the cpi for the first month jan 1871 is given as while the most recent month aug 2016 has a reported cpi of thus the real price in today 's dollars for the s&p index level at jan 1871 is calculated as x = actually reported as due to rounding of the reported   and similarly for the other real values reported

this is based on my experience with chase and may not be applicable to other banks as you mentioned chase as one of the banks you do business with hopefully this will be helpful to you the money does come out of your account immediately if the check is n't cashed in a certain amount of time the check expires and you get the money credited back to your account once you have made a bill payment online you can check on the status of your check by looking at your payment activity finding the payment in question and following the proof of payment link    there is will provide you with information on your payment which you can submit to your payee to prove when you submitted the payment and which they can use to verify with the bank that you really did send the payment as you claimed   once the check is cashed this page will also contain images of the front and back of the cashed check so you can prove that the recipient really did cash it   you can see from this info that the check is being funded from a different account number than your own which is good for security purposes since per 2008 giving someone else your bank routing number and account number as found on your personal checks basically provides them with all they need to fraudulently of course clean out your account

me those edi operators called edi service bureaus in the us have a unique edi map for each trading partner because as i said each trading partner sends the edi data in a completely different way   different erp systems have different mappings but there are no unlimited amount of erp systems if you can cover sap microsoft and oracle you can already trade edi messages between most of the big parties you only have to make the edi mappings once for a system and if you have process to update them it is not hard to sell it to companies that want to have edi processes   we never had to do any kind of mappings our self i guess the infra in eu is just a bit ahead of what you got in us   service bureaus charge $ $ $ per message   so does it cost to scan input data and process the invoice for us it was easy choice as it is way faster more reliable and also cheaper than having someone do all the data input into erp   invoices from suppliers are for many different types of services handled by many different departments   for all those we have automated rules freight orders are sent through a 3rd party system that matches the invoices to the freight orders they have our freight prices and can automatically approve the invoices with the tables or reject them and ask for a credit   goods invoices have the po number the shipping documents have the same po number and when a item is received with a po number it is allocated to a invoice with the same po number buyers know if the po is not full filled automatically as the inventory will not match what was ordered   hr invoices will go to hr department automatically and they just have to check if the invoice is correct postings and allocations are done by automatic rules here also   office supplies can either be bought by po number or with reference to who the invoice has to be sent for inspection inspector can change the automatic postings if there is something incorrect with the automatic posting   the system we have has been quite flexible and there has not been much of need for customization after the initial setup    of course there is still some manual postings to be done but lot less than without

simply put for a mortgage interest is charged only on the balance as well think of it this way on a $ 100 k 6 loan on day one 1/2 is $ 500 and the payment is just under $ 600 so barely $ 100 goes to principal but the last payment of $ 600 is nearly all principal   by the way you are welcome to make extra principal payments along with the payment due each month an extra $ in this example paid each and every month will drop the term to just 15 years think about that 40 higher payment all attacking the principal and you cut the term by 1/2 the time

some reasons i take low interest loans are leverage if the loan 's rate is low enough then i can invest the cash in something fairly low risk and make more money than i pay in interest the interest rate has to be pretty low say below 4 or so my auto loan is low enough and my home loan is low enough if you count the tax deduction obviously you have to invest in something riskier than cash here though and consider taxes which lower the rate you 're paying on a home loan but also lower the returns you 're getting on any bonds you invest in liquidity and flexibility if i have n thousands in cash instead of tied up in my house then i could use that money to survive many months of unemployment for example or handle any other emergency but if you become unemployed or have some other emergency it will be too late to get a home loan credit rating it 's good to use some credit just so you can get more if you need it but this is n't a reason to take a particular loan just a reason to have some kind of credit card or loan budgeting when budgeting it 's best to think of expenses such as cars and houses in terms of a monthly cost so you can see how they nudge out or allow other spending when negotiating with a car dealer of course use total cost so you do n't get screwed by him messing with interest rates i would n't take a loan just to ease the budgeting you can always manually amortize but it 's a nice side effect for credit cards there are more buyer protections and you get a nice transaction log again useful in budgeting also you do n't have to carry around cash or worry about your checking account balance so credit cards are just convenient but even though my card has a very low rate it is n't low enough that i want to keep a balance month to month so i do n't use credit cards to actually borrow money

got it i can definitely see how it can come across that way especially with all of these big tech companies lining up against the proposal my understanding is that a lot of that is more driven by their size than anything else the media focuses on the impacts to amazon and facebook because they 're huge companies and it 's easier to get information on them   but when it comes to who would get hurt the most by removing nn it 's actually small businesses and startups that would suffer the most in a world without net neutrality isps would be able to provide access to web services at different speeds for example if you are a comcast customer if comcast has a deal with amazon prime they can make it so that your access to competing services like netflix and hulu are moving so slow that it will be hard to use anything other than amazon prime video   now if that happens it will be annoying for companies like facebook netflix google etc to have to pay extra for internet users to be able to use them but they could do it they have the money the people who would struggle are people who own smaller businesses and smaller websites when they 're just starting out they wo n't have the money to pay the isps to let people access them and as a result they could be essentially locked out of many marketplaces this is the argument made by people who say that removing net neutrality will stifle small business removing the regulation would create this built in structural advantage for large established businesses and leave smaller businesses locked out

another way to look at this is if we separate the owner 's account from the business 's account   at the start of the year the owner puts $ 9 into the business account to get the business started at the end of the first day the business account has $ 10 and at the end of the second day the business account has $ 11   the owner does n't need to add any more of his own money into the business account at the end of the day the business will have $ which is $ 365 profit + $ 9 investment   assuming the business has no other expenses the business will calculate profit for the year like this the author is making a strange point the two numbers he is talking about are two different quantities the business owner 's return on investment is $ 365 $ 9 =   but the business 's profit margin is $ 365 $ = 10   both are useful numbers when running the business i disagree with the author 's that a business is doing something tricky when calculating profit margin remember that in addition to the business owner 's monetary investment he worked every day for a year to earn that $ 365

you need to find out exactly   how the two accounts are titled if an account   is an ugma uniform gifts to minors act account that is in your name with your mother father as custodian then you are entitled to all the money in the account when you become an adult if the account is indeed a ugma account   the bank is supposed to not let the custodian operate the account once the   child becomes an adult but this does not always happen   there was a   question earlier on money se which i can not find at this time in which   the 25-year old person asking the question claimed that   his father was still buying and selling shares in his ugma brokerage   account and the irs was asking why the profits and losses from these transactions were not being reported on the 25-year old 's tax return money in an ugma account is not supposed to be used for payment of household expenses food etc which is the parent 's responsibility during the minority but this can well be abused as to whether money was taken out and then restored or possibly not restored as you seem to suspect it is possible to sue the custodian for improper handling of the ugma account and recover the funds but whether one wants to sue a parent over what might be a relatively small sum is another matter consider whether most of what is recovered might go to pay legal fees or other costs of the recovery process and will likely ruin a family relationship if the accounts are titled as joint accounts then either party can empty the account without informing the other but doing so would need information about the account number etc which you may not have for tax purposes there is also the issue of whose social security   number is listed on the account yours or your parent 's see also this answer   for a view of what happens from the other side
