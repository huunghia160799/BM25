coins are legal tender they 're authorized by governments and have a face value rounds are simply coined pieces of metal minted by private manufacturers they do not have any face value and are not legal tender rounds are used to own metal they have no value other than the value of the metal in them any premium you pay over the price of the metal is the mint 's profit coins are also used as i.e. to own metal and create profits for the government but many times coins have limited issue and become valuable because of the rarity specific issues with a specific coin mistakes impurities exclusive designs etc so they also may have some value depends on the specific coin coins also have the assurance of quality of the authorizing government and are dealt with by the law as forgery of coins is illegal and is a crime rounds however do not enjoy such protection and any one can mint them only copyright trademark protections apply where the enforcement is by the owner and not the government re the advantages coins if you pick the right ones appreciate much more than the metal however this is mostly in hindsight and most of the coins do not appreciate significantly beyond the price of the metal unless there 's something else significant about them first year of issue high quality certification etc rounds on the other hand are cheaper 1 oz round will be significantly cheaper than 1 oz coin and monitor more closely the price of the metal it is unlikely for rounds to significantly deviate from the spot price although this does happen occasionally for specific designs or if a mint goes out of business

you can evaluate portfolio raw returns or risk adjusted returns to evaluate raw returns i would personally compute the total returns over the time period in question for both portfolios   to compute total returns split the time into a bunch of by the dates at which you contributed money   compute each return by dividing the value of the portfolio at the end of the but before adding additional cash on that day by the value at the beginning of the after adding cash on that day   then multiply all these returns together   finally subtract 1   that 's your total return for the portfolio where you did n't add any money it 's easy just divide the end value by the beginning and subtract 1 whichever has a higher return performed better to compute risk adjusted returns get the portfolio returns from both portfolios daily or monthly and use to regress on a benchmark portfolio return something like the s&p500   the intercept of the regression is a measure of the risk adjusted of your portfolio   higher the better   more sophisticated models will do multiple regression using a few benchmark portfolios at the same time

it 's rarely advisable to pay interest for something you can afford with cash just because you have no credit or loan history does n't mean you are n't credit worthy when applying for loans or credit the lending institutions look at your credit report not just your credit score there are lots of things that show up on the reports they receive including but not limited to right now so many people are focused on their credit score they 're taking on unnecessary debt and potentially losing money in the long run yes having a higher credit score will ultimately be beneficial but your score will start growing naturally as you live your life unless of course you can and do pay for everything with cash the concept of monitoring your score and striving to get it as high as possible is being shoved down our throats by advertisers at the moment do n't fall for it rather than taking out a loan which will cost you money in interest and actually show up as a closed account once it 's paid off you might be better served by applying for a credit card and using it sparingly just to start getting that credit history together add usual do n't spend more than you can pay back mantra here get a card with no annual fee and maybe some cash back options and use it as the auto payment for a utility if possible you build credit history increase your score and it does n't cost you any more than you 'd be paying anyways    with regards to the investment question with little to no credit history you 're not going to be approved for a loan with a low enough interest rate anyways think double digits with a co signer you 'll get a better rate but then you need a co signer i do n't know the exact math but in today 's market i 'd say you 'd need a loan interest rate of 2 or lower for investing to be worth thinking about   i believe this answer helps clarify the loan to invest math

as @mbhunter says make sure you pay off any debt you have first   then it 's a good idea to keep some or all of your savings as an emergency fund   if you use every last dime to pay for a house you 'll have no cushion available when something breaks down   the most common recommendation i 've seen is to have 3 6 months worth of expenses as an emergency fund   once you have that then you can start saving for your down payment    as @victor says try to find the best interest rate you can for that money but i would n't invest it in any kind of stock or bond product because your need for it is too short term   safety is more important than growth given your time frame when you 're ready to invest make sure you learn all you can   you do n't want to invest in something you do n't understand because that 's how you get ripped off   you can be reading and talking to people while you 're saving for your house so that when the time comes you 'll have a pretty good idea of what you want to do for investments

you 'll have to research the canada side of things on your own or maybe someone else can answer that side for the germany side there is a gift tax which depends on the relationship of the giver and receiver has an overview here which shows the tax class and tax free amount so according to the overview nieces get 20 000 € tax free amount anything over 20 000 € within 10 years from the same gift giver will be taxed with tax class 2 which can range from 15 to 43 depending on the gifted amount the full article is here it also a few tricks for example if you want to gift 40 000 € to your niece you could gift 20 000 € directly and 20 000 € to your brother or sister who then gifts it to their daughter you 'll have to trust them to do that though because you ca n't put that in a contract bottom line of this if you want to gift more than 20 000 € your niece should contact a tax advisor   about the bank transfer your niece will have to declare any bank transfers over 12 500 € that she receives her bank will know how to do that so she should just ask them it also might be helpful for her to have a letter from you stating that the money came from you and is a gift just in case the tax office does n't believe that the money is n't from

i feel these beliefs can not be changed so easily once someone loses their money how can you convince him and on what ground can you convince him can you give a guarantee that investments will perform at a certain level there are many people who are happy with low returns but highly safe instruments they are not concerned with what you earn in the stock market or the realty market they are happy not losing their money i known many people who earned decently during the up rise of the stock market but all profits were squared up in the downturn and it turned to negative such people have their own thinking and such thinking is not out of place after experience with much turmoil i feel that they are also right to a great extent hence i feel if the person is not getting convinced you should accept it with greatness

theoretically when a company issues more shares it does not affect the value of your shares   the reason is that when a company issues and sells more shares the proceeds from the sale of those shares goes back into the company using your example you have 10 out of 100 shares of the company for a 10 stake   let 's say that the shares are valued at $ 1,000 each meaning that the market value of the company is $ 100,000 and your stake is worth $ 10,000 now the company issues 100 more shares at $ 1,000 each   the company receives $ 100,000 from new investors and now the company is worth $ 200,000   your stake is now only 5 of the company but it is still worth $ 10,000 the authorized share capital is the amount of shares that a company has already planned on selling   when you buy stock in a company you can look up how many shares exist so you know what your percent stake in the company is   when a company wants to sell more shares this is called an increase of authorized share capital   in order to do this the company generally needs the approval of a majority of the existing shareholders

you should ask your employer to issue an updated payslip showing the correct gross salary deductions and net salary and then repay to the employer the difference between the net salary in your old wrong pay slip and the new correct one you should also get them to confirm that they have corrected any information they sent hmrc at the end of the tax year when you get a showing your salary for the year make sure that it is consistent with the corrected salary amount and check that the tax it shows as being deducted is also correct for that gross salary for the year if you are still employed by them then you could just ask them to withhold the overpayment in your next salary payment at which point the income tax would sort itself out because paye is calculated based on cumulative totals if the overpayment had happened at the end of the tax year march then there 'd be some risk of it messing up your tax payments in some cases it 's also possible that withholding from the next salary payment could make a difference to the total national insurance you end up paying broadly if you earn below the primary threshold of £ you might lose out if you earn close to the upper earnings limit of £ you could end up gaining

according to the fair credit reporting act any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report to a person which it has reason to believe intends to use the information in connection with a credit transaction involving the consumer on whom the information is to be furnished and    involving the extension of credit to or review or collection of an account of the consumer see section the usual interpretation of this that i 've heard is that a debt collection agency that owns or has been assigned a debt can make hard pulls on your credit report without your consent this link seems to support that and references the same part of the act among others according to the fair credit reporting act any business can access your credit history without your permission provided the business has a valid permissible purpose the fcra notes that one such permissible purpose is to review your credit information in connection with the collection of a debt thus if you owe money to a debt collector the debt collector has the legal right to pull and review your credit report if they have n't been assigned the debt or own it outright i believe you have a legal right to dispute it consult a lawyer if this is actually a situation you face   once use for this is if the debt collection agency has trouble locating you since your credit report normally contains current and past addresses this is one way to locate you

obviously you ca n't predict the future too much but it 's not too hard to figure out what is going to happen to mortgage rates in the short term mortgage rates are heavily influenced by 10 year treasury yields   you can find the daily 10 year rates here   it 's easy to see the direction they 've been moving recently   it usually takes a few days for mortgage rates to follow if the 10 year treasury yield is dropping although if it 's going up mortgage rates will go up faster than they will fall here 's a sample of all the 10 year treasury yields for the past 10 years   looks like a good time to get a mortgage or refinance you can also take a look at movements in mortgage backed securities here you can find a chart for fannie mae 3.0 mortgages   as the price goes up mortgage rates go down   think of it this way right now people are will to pay $ 103 for $ 100 worth of 3.0 mortgages that does n't really make sense because i could just loan you $ 100 at 3.0 and turn around and sell it for $ 103 immediately pocketing the $ 3 profit   the reason is because right now no one would willingly borrow money at 3.0 rates have fallen so much that if a bank has a customer paying them 3.0 on a mortgage other people are willing to pay a premium on that mortgage new mortgages are probably being written for 2.0 there is no current mortgage backed security for 2.0 fannie because rates have never been this low before

there are a few incorrect assumptions in your question but the tl;dr version is all or most of the withdrawal is taxable income that is reported on lines total distribution and 15b taxable amount of form 1040 none of the distribution is given special treatment as qualified dividends or capital gains regardless of what happened inside the ira and none of the distribution is subject to the 3.8 net investment income tax that some high income people need to compute on form if the withdrawal is not a qualified distribution it will be subject to a 10 excise tax tax penalty on premature withdrawal not all contributions to traditional iras are deductible from income for the year for which the contribution was made people with high income and/or coverage by a workplace retirement plan pension plan 401(k plan 403(b plan etc can not deduct any contributions that they choose to make to a traditional ira such people can always make a contribution subject to them having compensation earned income such as salary or wages self employment income commissions on sales etc but they do n't get a tax deduction for it just as contributions to roth iras are not deductible whether it is wise to make such nondeductible contributions to a traditional ira is a question on which reasonable people can hold different opinions   be that as it may nondeductible contributions to a traditional ira create or add to what is called the basis of an ira they are reported to the irs on form 8606 which is attached to the federal form 1040   note that the ira custodian or trustee is not told that the contributions are not deductible earnings on the basis accumulate tax deferred within the ira just as do the earnings on the deductible contributions now when you make a withdrawal from your traditional ira no matter which of your various ira accounts you take the money from part of the money is deemed to be taken from the basis and is not subject to income tax while the rest is pure taxable income that is none of the rest is eligible for the reduced taxation rates for qualified dividends or capital gains and since it does not count as investment income it is not subject to the 3.8 net investment tax of form either computation of how much of your withdrawal is nontaxable basis and how much is taxable income is done on form 8606 note that you do n't get to withdraw your entire basis until such time as when you close all your traditional ira accounts how is all this reported well your ira will send you form 1099-r reporting the total amount of the withdrawal what income tax if any was withheld etc the do n't know what your basis is and so box 2b will say that the taxable amount is not determined you need to fill out form 8606 to figure out what the taxable amount is and then report the taxable amount on line 15b of form 1040 the total withdrawal is reported on line which is not included in the agi computations note that as far as the irs is concerned you have only one traditional ira the a in ira stands for arrangement not account as most everybody thinks and your traditional ira can invest in many different things stocks bonds mutual funds etc with different custodians if you choose but your basis is in the ira not the specific investment that you made with your nondeductible contribution that 's why the total ira contribution is limited not the per account contribution and why you need to look that the total value of your ira in determining the taxable portion not the specific account(s from which you withdrew the money so how much basis did you withdraw   well if you withdrew $ w during 2016 and the total value of all your traditional ira accounts was $ x at the end of 2016 and your total basis in your traditional ira is $ b then assuming that you did not indulge in any traditional to roth rollovers for 2016 multiply w by to get the amount of nontaxable basis in the withdrawal b thus gets reduced for 2017 by amount of basis withdrawal what if you never made a nondeductible contribution to your traditional ira or you made some nondeductible contributions many years ago and have forgotten about them well you could still fill out form 8606 reporting a zero basis but it will just tell you that your basis continues $ 0 or you could just enter the total amount of your withdrawal in lines and 15b effectively saying that all of the withdrawal is taxable income to you the irs does not care if you choose to pay taxes on nontaxable income

gt i believe transparency when it comes to our food is important    totally agreed here 's my amateur solution   all food companies are required to have the answers to a set of questions available via email or website phone or standard mail those questions are determined by a combination of independent panel and consumer polling what those questions are may change over time allowing for a reasonably generous grace period for the companies to prepare   for example if consumers really have to know what gm ingredients are in their food for whatever asinine reasons then fine require the company to answer if consumers really want to know what color shoes the workers wear then so be it   i also think we need a series of third party organizations rather than the usda organic system we have what 's acceptable and what is n't is super arguable and rather than just taking the standard that exists which imo is not meaningful folks can choose which standard they wish to head combined with the mandated transparency above this would lower costs by removing the need for active investigation and lead to more informed decision making on the part of the consumers

if the portfolio itself is taxable then yes if you have two stocks and you 're rebalancing them without using new cash you are forced to sell one stock to buy another that sale is taxable unless you 're in some sort of tax deferred deductible account such as an ira    if you 're talking about you being in a mutual fund and the fund itself rebalances the same rules apply as above though indirectly you 'll have capital gains realized and distributed to you those gains will be taxed unless again your account is a retirement account

i 'm surprised by all these complicated answers yes @victor you can create a form that asks people to put down their financial information but you want to be careful and not put off potential tenants by asking for too many details depending on the op 's typical tenants an extensive background and credit check may not be necessary for example if i have proof that someone is a graduate student at the local university that 's usually good enough for me because i am willing to bet that they will follow my contract   bidding war does n't sound doable you advertise a price correct you can only be down not up   so my suggestion is to look at other rental advertisements in the area compare what you 're offering location quality of house cleanliness amenities etc to the competition and price accordingly if you 're getting a flood of interest then you 're probably pricing below the average price in your area or you live in an area where demand is just much higher than supply in which case you can also raise your rent

start the process by contacting the company that services the mortgage they can answer all your questions they should have a form that needs to be submitted you will want to get from them the most up to date payoff amount x days from now the amount changes each day they will be sending you a document that the debt has been met they will also be filing paperwork with the county city releasing the property from the mortgage obligation   because all my mortgage payoffs have either been or refinancing or i have sold the property the balance due was significant and the lender required a cashiers check contact them to ask if it only a few thousand left they might take a regular check sending the checks via overnight delivery speeds up the process and cuts down on the uncertainty of the delivery date ask for a return receipt so that you have proof of the date it was received overpay by a couple of days they will refund the overage if you let the mortgage run its course you will still get a document back from them they will still file the documents with the local government and they will refund any overage if you look at the coupon book or the paperwork they gave you at settlement the last payment is usually a different amount due to rounding of the monthly payments   of course if you have been making extra payments or larger than required payments the numbers on the original coupon book are moot so contact the company for the last payment amount

the simplest most convenient way i know of to move your savings to canada is to purchase an exchange traded fund like the canadian dollar trust or a similar instrument i identify this fund because i know it exists not because i particularly recommend it your money will be in canadian currency earning canadian interest rates you will pay a small portion of that interest in fees since us banks are already guaranteed by the fdic up to $ 250,000 per account i do n't really think you avoid any risks associated with the failure of an individual bank but you might fare better if the us currency is subject to inflation or unfavorable foreign exchange movements not that such a thing would be a direct risk of a bank failure but it could happen as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve under the of the economy if the economy worsens in the wake of a financial crisis or for that matter if it worsens as a result of something else including legislative regulatory or executive policies read the prospectus to understand additional risks with this investment one of them is foreign exchange risk if the us economy and currency strengthen relative to the canadian economy and its currency you may lose substantial amounts of purchasing power additionally one of the possible results of a financial crisis is a flight to safety the global financial markets still seem to think the us dollar is pretty safe and they may bid it up as they have done in the past resulting in losses to your position at least in the short term i do not personally recommend moving all your savings to canada especially if it you of income from more profitable investments over the long term but moving some of your savings to canada at least is n't a stupid idea and it may turn out to be somewhat profitable having some canadian currency is also a good idea if you plan to spend the money that you are saving on canadian goods in the intermediate future

as nri pio non resident indian person of indian origin the overseas income and transfers in foreign currency are exempt from indian income taxes however the account in india has to be designated nre or fcnr there are three kind of accounts that an nri can maintain interest earned in nre and fcnr accounts is exempt from income taxes interest earned in nro accounts is not exempt from income taxes in fact banks would withhold about 30 of interest tds the exact tax liability would depend upon income generated in india and tds could be applied towards that liability when the tax returns are filed there are other implications also of designating the account as nre or nro nre accounts can only be funded via inward remittance of permitted foreign currency e.g. deposit usd gbp so proceeds like rental income pension etc that are generated in inr within india ca n't be deposited in this account the money deposited in nre account can grow tax free and can be converted back in any foreign currency freely on the other hand nro accounts can be funded through both inward remittance of permitted foreign currency or local income e.g. rental pension etc all the amount in this account is treated as indian originated inr even if remitted in foreign currency and thus is taxed as any other bank account the amount in this account is subject to the annual cap of of usd 1 million both nre and nro accounts are maintained in inr and can be saving and term deposit any remittance made to these accounts in any foreign currency is converted to inr at the time of deposit and is maintained in inr fcnr account are held in foreign currency and can only be term deposit official definitions accounts for non resident indians nris and persons of indian origin

pay off the credit cards   from now on pay off the credit cards monthly   under no circumstances should you borrow money   you have net worth but no external income   borrowing is useless to you    $ 200,000 in two bank accounts because if one bank collapses you want to have a spare while you wait for the government to pay off the guarantee   keep $ 50,000 in checking and another $ 50k in savings   the remainder put into cds   do n't expect interest income beyond inflation   real interest rates after inflation are often slightly negative    people ask why you might keep money in the bank rather than stocks bonds   the problem is that stocks bonds do n't always maintain their value much less go up   the bank money wo n't gain but it wo n't suddenly lose half its value either   it can easily take five years after a stock market crash for the market to recover   you do n't want to be withdrawing from losses    some people have suggested more bonds and fewer stocks   but putting some of the money in the bank is better than bonds   bonds sometimes lose money like stocks   instead park some of the money in the bank and pick a more aggressive stock bond mixture   that way you 're never desperate for money and you can survive market dips   and the stock bond part of the investment will return more at 70/30 than 60/40    $ 700,000 in stock mutual funds   $ 300,000 in bond mutual funds   look for broad indexes rather than high returns   you need this to grow by the inflation rate just to keep even   that 's $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 a year   keep the balance between 70/30 and   you can move half the excess beyond inflation to your bank accounts   that 's the money you have to spend each year   do n't withdraw money if you are n't keeping up with inflation    do n't try to time the market   much better informed people with better resources will be trying to do that and failing   play the odds instead   keep to a consistent strategy and let the market come back to you   if you chase it you are likely to lose money    if you do n't spend money this year you can save it for next year   anything beyond $ 200,000 in the bank accounts is available for spending   in an emergency you may have to draw down the $ 200,000   be careful   it 's not as big a cushion as it seems because you do n't have an external income to replace it    i live in southern california but would like to move overseas after establishing stable investments    i am not the type of person that would invest in mcdonald 's but would consider other less evil franchises maybe    these are contradictory goals as stated   a franchise meaning a local business of a national brand is not a stable investment   a franchise is something that you actively manage   at minimum you have to hire someone to run the franchise   and as a general rule they are n't as turnkey as they promise    how do you pick a good manager   how will you tell if they know how the business works   particularly if you do n't know   how will you tell that they are honest and wo n't just your money   or more honestly give you too much of the business revenues such that the business is not sustainable   or spend so much on the business that you ca n't recover it as revenue    some have suggested that you meant brand or stock rather than franchise   if so you can ignore the last few paragraphs   i would be careful about making moral judgments about companies   mcdonald 's pays its workers too little   google privacy   exxon is bad for the environment   chase collects fees from people desperate for money   tesla relies on government subsidies   every successful company has some way in which it can be considered evil   and unsuccessful companies are evil in that they go out of business leaving workers customers and investors i.e. you in the    regardless you should invest in broad index funds rather than individual stocks   if college is out of the question then so should be stock investing   it 's at least as much work and needs to be maintained    in terms of living overseas dip your toe in first   rent a small place for a few months   find out how much it costs to live there   remember to leave money for bigger expenses   you should be able to live on $ 20,000 or $ 25,000 a year now   then you can plan on spending $ 35,000 a year to do it for real including odd expenses that do n't happen every month   make sure that you have health insurance arranged    eventually you may buy a place   if you can find one that you can afford for something like $ 100,000   note that $ 100,000 would be low in california but sufficient even in many places in the us   think rural like the south or midwest   and of course that would be more money in many countries in south america africa or southern asia   even southern and eastern europe might be possible   you might even pay a bit more and rent part of the property   in the us this would be a duplex or a bed and breakfast   they may use different terms elsewhere    given your health do you need a maid cook   that would lean towards something like a bed and breakfast where the same person can clean for both you and the guests   same with cooking although that might be a second person or more   hire a bookkeeper accountant first as you 'll want help evaluating potential purchases   keep the business small enough that you can actively monitor it    part of the problem here is that a million dollars sounds like a lot of money but is n't   you are n't rich   this is about bare minimum for surviving with a middle class lifestyle in the united states and other first world countries   you ca n't live like a tourist    it 's true that many places overseas are cheaper   but many are n't including much of europe japan australia new zealand etc   and the ones that are n't may surprise you   and you also may find that some of the things that you personally want or need to buy are expensive elsewhere   dabble first and commit slowly be sure first   include rarer things like travel in your expenses    long term there will be currency rate worries overseas   if you move permanently you should certainly move your bank accounts there relatively soon perhaps keep part of one in the us for emergencies that may bring you back   and move your investments as well   your return may actually improve although some of that is likely to be eaten up by inflation   a 10 return in a country with 12 inflation is a negative real return    try to balance your investments by where your money gets spent   if you are eating imported food put some of the investment in the place from which you are importing   that way if exchange rates push your food costs up they will likely increase your investments at the same time   if you are buying stuff online from us vendors and having it shipped to you keep some of your investments in the us for the same reason   make currency fluctuations work with you rather than against you    i do n't know what your circumstances are in terms of health   if you can work you probably should   given twenty years your million could grow to enough to live off securely   as is you would be in trouble with another stock market crash   you 'd have to live off the bank account money while you waited for your stocks and bonds to recover

i have n't used transfer wise so ca n't speak to their price    regardless of what service you use what you should look for is whether the conversion price is greater than how much you think the currency 's price will move    example if your bank charges on any currency exchange you should ask yourself whether you think the pound or whatever currency will drop by within whatever time frame you 've set for yourself if not you 're better off keeping your money in that currency    i checked out their site and it does look like transferwise is pretty inexpensive around in transaction costs so again ask yourself whether you think the pound will drop by 1 in your time frame does n't seem like a lot but also consider that currencies typically fluctuate by just a few of a percentage per day    i know you 're probably looking for an answer like pound will drop sell it all but i do n't know enough about currencies to be giving advice there i would definitely pay attention to brexit negotiations though as that will be one of the biggest influences on both currencies for quite some time

let 's look at the two options   it sounds like at this time the company has enough cash to pay you a salary or pay your loan off but not both at the same time ideally in the future there will be enough cash flow to be able to do both at the same time   if you start your salary now when the cash flow increases to the point where the company can pay off your loan you will continue to receive your salary while the loan is being repaid so it is probably most advantageous to you to start the salary now and wait with the loan payments if you think that the company is not going to make it and there is a danger of not ever getting the loan repaid this could change however you are probably optimistic about the company or you would n't have made the loan and agreed to work for free in the first place with the other option the company gets out of debt quicker and cheaper i can totally understand your brother wanting to eliminate this debt asap   it looks like you and your brother had different expectations about what was going to happen that 's why it is so critical to put these kinds of agreements in writing if you had had a payment schedule in your written loan agreement this would n't be an issue of course the issue of how long you would continue to work for free would still be there but this could also have been decided ahead of time as is you have two different things going on that were left up in the air with no formal agreement   as to what is fair that is something only you and he can work out perhaps you can propose a payment schedule for your loan that the company can afford now while paying your salary that way you will start getting paid for working and the company will start moving toward eliminating the debt   i hope that you will be able to agree to a solution without ruining the relationship you have with your brother besides the fact that family relationships are important a rift between the two of you would certainly be disastrous for the company and as a result your and his finances

it has got to do with market perceptions and expectation and the perceived future prospects of the company usually the expectation of a company 's results are already priced into the share price so if the results deviate from these expectations the share price can move up or down respectfully for example many times a company 's share price may be beaten down for increasing profits by 20 above the previous year when the expectation was that it would increase profits by 30 other times a company 's share price may rise sharply for making a 20 loss when the expectation was that it would make a 30 loss then there is also a company 's prospects for future growth and performance a company may be heading into trouble so even though they made a $ 100 m profit this year the outlook for the company may be bleak this could cause the share price to drop accordingly conversely a company may have made a loss of $ 100 m but its is turning a corner after reducing costs and restructuring this can be seen as a positive for the future causing the share price to rise also a company making $ 100 m in profits would not put that all into the bank it may pay dividends with some it may put some more towards growing the business and it might keep some cash available in case cash flows fluctuate during the year

there 's a difference between missing a payment and carrying a balance making an on time payments that are less than the full balance due i have heard mortgage brokers claim that if you have no other credit history carrying a small balance here and there on a credit card may improve your score   small is in relation to your available credit and your ability to pay it off   but actually missing a payment will probably hurt your score example you have a card with a credit limit of $ 1000   in july you charge $ 300 worth of stuff   you get the next statement and it shows the balance due of $ 300 and a minimum payment of $ 100 if you pay the entire $ 300 balance in that cycle most cards wo n't charge you any interest   you are not carrying a balance so the credit scores may not reflect that you actually took a $ 300 loan and paid it off if you instead pay $ 200 you 'll be in good standing because $ 200 is greater than the minimum payment   but you 'll be carrying a $ 100 balance into the next statement cycle   plus interest will accrue on that $ 100   if you do this regularly your credit score will probably take into account that you 've taken a small loan and made the payments   for those with no other credit history this may be an appropriate way to increase your credit score   but you 're paying interest so it 's not free   and if the average balance you carry is considered high relative to your ability to pay or to the total credit available to you then this could adversely affect your score or at least the amount of credit another provider is willing to extend to you if you instead actually miss a payment or make a payment that 's less than the minimum payment that will almost certainly hurt your credit score   it will also incur penalties as well as interest   you want to avoid that whenever possible my guess is that in the game of telephone from the banker to you the carrying a balance was misinterpreted as missing a payment

i will disagree with the other answers the idea that there is some to establish a credit history is largely a myth by who see it as positive propaganda to increase the numbers of their prospective customers you will find some people who claim they were rejected for a card because they had no credit history but in every case what these people are not telling you is they also had no income were students house wives or others with no steady income anyone who has income can get a credit card or other line of credit regardless of their credit history even people who have gone bankrupt can get credit cards if they have proven income if your answer to this is that you have no income but still want a credit card i would advise you to re read that sentence several times and think carefully about it i have never had a credit card and never missed having one except when trying to rent cars which was somewhat complex and annoying to do in the 2005 2010 time period without a credit card credit cards have a number of disadvantages i definitely agree with those who will tell you credit cards are convenient they are but for someone who wants to be financially prudent and build wealth they are unnecessary and unwise if you do n't believe me read the total money makeover by david ramsey one of the most famous and best selling books ever written on personal finance he actually will give you much better and detailed reasons to avoid ccs than me after all who am i just some dumb rich schmuck with lots of money and no debt and a happy life comment on culture i think it is pretty funny we have a lot of americans in this thread basically telling the op to get lots of credit cards as soon as possible if you asked the same question in japan you would get completely different answers and votes in japan its hard to even use credit cards the   people there are much more responsible financially than americans the average japanese person has much higher wealth than a person with the same income in the united states one of the reasons for this among many is that the average japanese person does not use credit cards a japanese person if you translated this question for them would think the whole thing a typical example of how foolish americans are

people normally hold precious metals as a protection against the whole system going down massive inflation etc   if our whole government and financial system broke completely and we returned to a barter economy then holding silver would likely turn out to be a good thing however precious metals are not very good hedges against individual calamity like losing your job   they are costly and inconvenient to sell and the price of these metals fluctuates wildly so you could end up wanting to sell just when the metal is n't worth much i 'd say having some precious metal is n't unreasonable but it should not make up a major portion of one 's total net worth   if you want protection against normal problems especially as a person of limited means start with an emergency savings account and paying down debt   that way fixed costs will be less likely to turn an unfortunate turn of events into a personal catastrophe

no you do n't have to be super rich   but the companies do not have to sell you shares and as others mention the government actively restricts and regulates the advertising and sales of shares so how do you invest   the easiest way to obtain a stake is to work at a pre ipo company preferably at a high level e.g. director vp of under water basket weaving or whatever     you might be offered shares or options as part of a compensation package   there are exemptions to the accredited investor rule for employees and a general exemption for a small number of unsolicited investors   also the accredited investor rule is enforced against companies not investors and the trend is for investors to self certify the crime being defined is not investing in things the government thinks are too risky for you   instead the crime being defined is offering shares to the public in a small business that is probably going to fail and might even be a scam from the beginning    to invest your money in pre ipo shares is on average a losing adventure and it is easy to become irrationally optimistic   the problem with these shares is that you ca n't sell them and may not be able to sell them immediately when the company does have an ipo on nasdaq or another market   even the executive options can have lock up clauses and it may be that only the founders and a few early investors make money

am i wrong   yes the exchanges are most definitely not good ole boys clubs they provide a service a huge liquid and very fast market and they want to be paid for it additionally since direct participants in their system can cause serious and expensive disruptions they allow only organizations that know what they 're doing and can pay for any damages the cause is there a way to invest without an intermediary certainly but if you have to ask this question it 's the last thing you should do typically such offers are only superior to people who have large investments sums and know what they 're doing as an inexperienced investor chances are that you 'll end up losing everything to some fraudster honestly large exchanges have become so cheap e.g. xetra costs eur + per trade that if you 're actually investing then exchange fees are completely irrelevant the only exception may be if you want to use a dollar cost averaging strategy and do n't have a lot of cash every month fixed fees can be significant then many banks offer investments plans that cover this case

if you plan to keep this asset for ten years then you can take the of its cost over that time period for simplicity lets treat that as 120 monthly payments so at a purchase price of $ 60,000 you are committing around $ 500 per month not including vehicle maintenance i typically allocate around 20 percent of the purchase price of my vehicles for future maintenance costs since you have the cash to purchase this outright you have an option not afforded to most people this adds for additional consideration here is an example   you purchase a $ 60,000 car and put $ 10,000 down you finance $ 50,000 at over 60 months your total finance cost is $ if you do not miss any payments the question here is can you make more than $ on the $ 50,000 that you would retain in this situation over a five year period i know that i most certainly can and is an excellent example of why i finance my vehicles obviously this all goes out the window if you do not have the credit for top rates   i have also negotiated a vehicle maintenance plan with the dealership at the time of my vehicle purchases most dealerships offer this service the key here is negotiating on my last truck i was able to get an all inclusive maintenance policy for 72 months for 8 of the purchase price your mileage will vary with manufacturer and dealership as described in the comments above it is never beneficial for an individual to lease you end up paying more for the newer models i consider that to be a lifestyle choice as it is most certainly not a sound financial decision

for a parent deciding on contributing to a 529 plan the first consideration is the plan run by the state government that will trigger a state income tax deduction you do have to at least look at the annual fees for the program before jumping into the state program but for many people the state program offers the best deal because of the state tax deduction unfortunately for you california does not offer a state tax deduction for 529 plan contributions which means that you can pick another states program if the fees are more reasonable or if the investing options are better you can even select a nationwide plan with a state is run by tiaa cref tiaa cref is a large company that runs pension and 403(b funds for many state and local governments many teacher unions use them   they are legitimately authorized by the state of california the investment board sets investment policies and    oversees all activities of the state ’s 529 college    investment plan the program enables californians to save for college    by putting money in tax advantaged investments after tax    contributions allow earnings to grow tax deferred and disbursements    when used for tuition and other qualified expenses are federal and    state tax free the plan is managed by tiaa cref tuition    financing inc. the investment board also oversees the governor ’s    scholarship programs and california memorial scholarship program note before picking a plan from another state make sure that they allow outside contributions

the problem is who is going to be left holding the coins when the market is over   that 's one of the things that really turns me away from cryptocurrency the idea of a decentralized currency i really love but i ca n't help but feel they are all basically ponzi schemes    people invent new types of cryptocurrency like ethereum and the creators have the first chance to mine the coins with zero competition since no one else knows it 's a currency yet after they mine several million coins they publicize the new currency and a bunch of short term investors buy into it and hoard up the coins because they are into it for short term gains the price of this sexy new cryptocurrency spikes with all this interest and then when the price is high the big early investors dump their coins on the who frequent cryptocurrency forums these users all how it 's so much safer than the dollar and this particular cryptocurrency is better than the other cryptocurrencies so they buy into it and meanwhile some hot new startup just spun up some even newer cryptocurrency and is mining it while investors hype it up   there are over a dozen cryptocurrencies now how many were hyped up as the next big thing with news headlines like this how many tens of millions of dollars of hard earned savings were taken from cryptocurrency supporters who wanted a safe alternative to fiat currencies it 's just sad really half these currencies are just exploiting people 's fear of fiat currency and basically using that fear to scam them

we want to be able to get two cards related is it difficult to ask the credit card issuer for two cards even if the account belongs to one person with the best credit limits and perks no it 's actually quite common to have authorized users on your account   they typically get a separate card with their name on it but it 's attached to your account and may or may not have the same number would it be better for me to apply for the card on my own or would there be an advantage to having her co sign probably faster easier to just apply yourself and add her an an authorized user   i know some issuers even offer additional sign up bonuses for adding an authorized user as an afterthought as her credit improves she can apply for the card and add you as an authorized user to again reap some more signup bonuses

s p index announcements would have notes on when there are changes to the index   for example in the s p small cap 600 there is a change that takes affect on 19 2013 as for how index funds handle changes to the fund this depends a bit on the nature of the fund as open end mutual funds would be different than exchange traded funds   the open end fund would have to sell and purchase to keep tracking the index which can be interesting to see how well this is handled to keep the transaction costs down while the etfs will just unload the shares in the redemption units of the stock leaving the index while taking in new shares with creation units of the newly added stock to the index

it 's all about risk these guidelines were all developed based on the risk characteristics of the various asset categories bonds are ultra low risk large caps are low risk you do n't see most big stocks like coca cola going anywhere soon foreign stocks are medium risk subject to additional political risk and currency risk especially so in developing markets and small caps are higher risk more to gain but more likely to go out of business   moreover the risks of different asset classes tend to balance each other out some when stocks fall bonds typically rise the recent credit crunch being a notable but temporary exception as people flock to safety or as the fed adjusts interest rates when stocks soar bonds do n't look as attractive and interest rates may rise a bummer when you already own the bonds is the us economy with the dollar in the dumps while the rest of the world passes us by your foreign holdings will be worth more in dollar terms if you 'd like to work alternative asset classes real estate gold and other commodities etc into your mix consider their risk characteristics and what will make them go up and down a good asset allocation should limit the amount of down that can happen all at once the more conservative the allocation needs to be the less down is possible at the expense of the up as for what risks you are willing to take that will depend on your position in life and what risks you are presently are exposed to including your job how stable your company is and whether it could fold or do layoffs in a recession like this one whether you 're married whether you have kids where you live for instance if you 're a realtor by trade you should probably avoid investing too much in real estate or it 'll be a double whammy if the market crashes a good financial advisor can discuss these matters with you in detail

i ca n't say i know everything about the underlying details but from what i understand your limit buy adds to the bid side of open orders and one possibility is that someone placed a market order to sell when the bid price for the stock fell to $ 10 which was matched to your open limit order so using your terminology i would say the spot bid price is what fell to $ 10 even if for a brief moment whether or not it is possible for your order to be filled when the limit buy price is deeper than the current bid price is beyond me it may have something to do with lot sizes

economically it does n't make much difference but i like to control the account because i can adjust the amount i put aide each month based on the new tax rates that come out each spring this allow me finer control i also know that the bills have been paid i had one lender years ago that failed to pay the property tax bill i had to end the money in to the county and then months fighting the lender to get the money back now i avoid escrow accounts   the money being collected by the mortgage servicing company for property taxes and property insurance goes into a separate account the company insists on handling the funds to make sure that these bills are paid on time thus protecting their investment the failure to pay the taxes leaves the property subject to forfeiture via tax lien   the failure to pay property insurance leaves the house unprotected if there is a fire or other incident you can avoid the use of an escrow   account if you have enough equity in the account some lenders ask for you to provide proof of payment each year if you are going to pay it yourself   at the end of each year the servicing company will provide you with an accounting for interest on the loan and the amount of money spent on taxes and insurance also expect that they will make adjustments to the monthly withholding based on estimated increases for taxes and insurance   depending on your financial situation the interest taxes may be included on schedule a. if you have a rental property the interest taxes and insurance are considered expenses that you can write off the biggest issue with escrow accounts is that the company can have a buffer built in to protect them from unexpected increases many people view the calculation of the buffer a confusing and feel that they are overpaying   if you want to avoid the escrow account you should make sure that each month you put the money into a separate account so that when the property tax bill is due you can pay it on time when savings accounts earned significant interest it was possible to make a little money in the deal but that has n't been true for the last few years

a technically strong stock or market is simply a stock or market which is up trending and has been up trending for a while just as a fundamentally strong stock is one with good fundamentals a stock that is healthy and making higher profits year after year and continually improving a technically strong stock has a healthy uptrend that continues to go up and up apple was technically strong until it hit $ 700 its price stayed above the 200 day ma for a long period until after it hit $ 700 then broke down through the 200 day ma shortly after the uptrend was over i will usually buy stocks which are both fundamentally and technically strong as a technically strong stock will generally stay technically strong longer if it also has strong and good fundamentals

maximizing income could mean a lot of things   what you really want is to maximize wealth   does n't matter if it comes from your bond appreciating in value or as dividends in order to maximize your wealth that 's today 's wealth you need to make decisions based on the net present value of these bonds the market is fairly priced especially for a tight market like government bonds   that means if your bond falls in price it has fallen by precisely the amount necessary so that an investor would be indifferent between purchasing it now at its current price and purchasing a new bond with a higher dividend   the bonds with higher dividends will simply have a higher price so more of the money comes as dividends than as price appreciation at maturity it will sell for face value   in other words the animals are out of the barn and you have lost or made money already   changing from one bond to another will not change your wealth one way or the other the only potential effect of changing bonds will be changing the risk of your portfolio   if you buy a bond that matures later or has a lower dividend than your current bond you will be adding additional interest rate risk to your portfolio   that risk should be compensated so you will have a higher expected return as well   but regardless of your choice you will not be made wealthier or less wealthy by changing from one bond to another should you buy bonds that will earn you the most possible   sure if you are below your risk tolerance   even among default free bonds the longer the maturity and the lower the dividend the greater the effect of future changes in interest rates on your bond   that makes them riskier but also makes them earn more money on average tl;dr in terms of your wealth which is what matters it does n't matter whether you hold your bond or buy a new one

i agree with all that was said here but i have to add something another point i will add is stimulus while you still can at some point you can no longer take on more debt even if you wanted to if global and domestic investors think you are going to be a risky investment then they cut you off the people who argue that greece should n't be implementing austerity do n't seem to understand the situation they are in far fewer wanted to lend money to them even before they started their haircut people think the government should spend more but how are they supposed to do that if no one wants to lend more money they also criticize germany and co. for insisting on austerity what they sometimes seem to forget is that germany does n't have an infinite supply of money to bail out greece they have their own bills to pay and any politician who was dumping ever larger amounts of money into greece would be looking at being voted out or even if they let things get too bad for the german people i am being a little hyperbole here to make a point but i honestly feel it is a very real possibility in this kind of economic climate at this point there is no reason to discuss whether greece should choose to spend more money because that choice is no longer even available to them   we are not as bad off as greece right now we should spend more money but we need results we need to identify the structural problems ailing our economy and get them fixed with the money we have direct spending is n't always a great idea if it is done in a nonsensical way people defending the bike paths and other shit argue that all spending is good in a depression i am not against bike paths and roads because they can certainly create jobs and generate value to the economy but every dollar you spend on them is one dollar that ca n't be spent on the biggest problems assuming of course that kind of infrastructure is n't one of those   after spending trillions of dollars on spending our gdp is still growing at only 2 it was increasing about 3.5 every year from 2012 our jobs creation rate is still less than half the 250,000 jobs a month we created in the last 10 20 years ca n't remember the exact number we definitely need to spend differently to address the problems and get people back to work as said we need middle class jobs we particularly need those among america 's youth so they can move out of their parents houses and buy their own which could really help the housing economy and create jobs for the lower class in turn and get us out of this depression my thoughts are that we should use stimulus in new new industries such as those in high tech i intentionally stated that very broadly because we have many millenials who need to get to work   investing in different high growth industries could create jobs for people in any number of occupations but if we do n't do that while people still want to lend us money then we are going to be fucked in a few years when we are out of options and land in the same position as greece   edit let me clarify the infrastructure thing there was a town that spent millions rebuilding a sidewalk that was five years old that no one in the community wanted everyone there thought it was a nonsensical way of spending tax dollars and would have thought that money could have been better spent in another community that really needed problems resolved would n't it have made more sense to spend money somewhere where it was needed then you could have created jobs and created lasting value to an economy by fixing a structural problem that was holding the economy back why do n't our politicians realize this

this answer will assume you know more math than most an ideal case for the point of argument first consider the following admittedly incorrect assumptions 1   the prices of all assets in your investment universe are continuously differentiable functions of time 2   investor r for rebalance continuously buys and sells in order to maintain a constant proportion of each of several investments in his portfolio 3   investor p for passive starts with the same portfolio as r but neither buys nor sells then under the assumptions of no taxes or trading costs it is a mathematical theorem that investor p 's portfolio return fraction will be the weighted arithmetic mean of the return fractions of all the individual investments whereas investor r will obtain the weighted geometric mean of the return fractions of the individual investments it 's also a theorem that the weighted arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the weighted geometric mean so regardless of what happens in the market given the above assumptions the passive investor p does at least as well as the rebalancing investor r.   p will do even better if taxes and trading costs are factored in the real world   of course prices are n't continuously differentiable or even continuous nor can you continuously trade   indeed under such assumptions the optimal investing strategy would be to sample the prices sufficiently rapidly to capture the derivatives and then to move all your assets to the stock increasing at the highest relative rate   this crazy momentum trading would destabilize the market and cause the assumptions to break the point of this is not to argue for or against rebalancing but to point out that any argument for rebalancing which continues to hold under the above ideal assumptions is bogus   many such arguments do   if a stockbroker standing to profit from commission pushes rebalancing on you with an argument that still holds under the above assumptions then he is profiting off of bs

i think you are mixing up forward looking statements with the actual results the funds objective    the fund invests primarily in stocks that tend to offer current dividends it focuses on high quality companies that have prospects for long term total returns as a result of their ability to grow earnings and their willingness to increase dividends over time obviously in 1993 quite a few companies paid the dividends and hence was able to give dividends over the period of years in some years its given more and in some years less for example the year 2000 it gave $ 1999 it gave $ and in 1998 it gave $ the current economic conditions are such that companies are not making huge and the one 's that are making prefer not to distribute dividends and hold on to cash as it would help survive the current economic conditions so just to clarify this particular funds objective is to invest in companies that would give dividends which is then passed on to fund holders this fund does not sell appreciated stocks to convert it into dividends

the first thing i would try is to take out a loan from a local credit union if you do n't know of any that you 're eligible for start looking at the national credit union administration 's credit union locator you should be able to get a good rate since your credit is so good if for whatever reason you ca n't get the credit union loan i would open another credit card try hard to get the loan though because using a credit card will most likely be significantly more expensive if you ca n't cover your cash only expenses with cash you already have make sure that you can get cash from the card for example one of my cards regularly sends me checks that i could write to myself to get cash but be careful with this strategy usually the interest is much higher than normal purchases either way until you 've paid off this emergency debt and built up an emergency fund of 3 6 months of expenses cut your expenses as much as possible this experian article has some good tips

in my experience working at a currency exchange money service business in the us flat fees are the because we can fee on average these can be waived on certain dollar values at some banks or and sometimes can even be   if you google eurusd as an example you also get something like $ 1.19 at 4 pm if you look at the actual conversion that you got you may find your bank hit you with $ 1.30 or something close to convert from usd to euro in other words you payed 10 more usd per euro and if you sell your euro directly back you might find you only make $ 1.07 this spread is the real fee and covers a number of things including risk or liquidity you 'll see that currencies with more volatility or less liquidity have a much wider spread some businesses even go as far as to artificially widen the spread for speculators see inr etc typically if you see a 3 surcharge on international atm or pos transactions that 's the carrier such as visa or mastercard taking their cut for processing interestingly enough you also typically get the carrier set exchange rate overseas when using your card in other words your bank has a cash eurusd of $ 1.30 but the conversion you get at the atm is visa 's rate hence the visa fee but it 's typically a nicer spread or it 's sometimes the international spot rate depending on the circumstances due to the overhead of electronic transactions you also have to consider the atm charging you a separate fee for it 's own operation in essence the fees exist to pad every player involved except you some cards do you a solid by advertising $ 0 foreign exchange fees unfortunately these cards only insulate you from the processing flat fees and you may still fall prey to the fee hidden in the spread in the scheme of things currency exchange is a retail operation they try to make money on every step that requires them to expend a resource if you pay 10 on a money transaction this differs actually very little from the mark up you pay on your groceries which varies from 3 5 on dry food to 20 on alcohol such as wine

you 'd need to talk with an attorney familiar with social security or an appropriately qualified ssa representative to be sure but all signs point to the idea that unfortunately social security does not work the way your father was told it would and if he does n't file to receive benefits the reality is actually much worse than throwing away free money however this is not due to a complete misunderstanding of the system social security does work the way he thinks in some instances just that the rules do n't apply to his exact situation first of all retroactive benefits come in a few forms file and suspend to get a lump only if you really need it before the age of 70 only in this method you apply for retirement but you tell the ssa to suspend delay your benefits you are entitled to full lump sum of the payments you deferred but at a cost of getting lower monthly benefits permanently and that also lowers spousal and dependent children 's benefits too if those could apply to your dad but note that at the age of 70 social security will stop deferring the payments and start paying you the full maximum retirement benefit monthly with no lump sum this is a kind of emergency insurance policy for those who want to try to defer retirement benefits but who want the opportunity to cash out and get the money they would have been getting just in case you can get up to 6 months of retroactive benefits such as if you wait past your exact retirement age to apply for benefits but no more we can not pay retroactive benefits for any month before you reached full retirement age or more than 6 months in the past as for after death benefits an estate can only get benefits that were already due to be paid which generally means a person died and did not get their benefits for that month so ssa can re issue a check to the estate following these rules but as a person can not be due a lump sum payment after age 70 for more than 6 months at most the estate will only be able to get at most 1 6 months of payments and 6 months is doubtful you 'll need to ask a lawyer if that much would even be possible if your father was below 70 and wanted to file and suspend the question of lump on death would be more complex and i do n't know that answer but once you are past 70 this does n't matter any more as you are n't due a lump anymore given the above we 've established pretty clearly that if you do n't claim your benefits within 6 months after age 70 any months of payment you would have gotten are just forfeited to the system but if you claim the benefits and stick them in the bank can they be taken well if a lawsuit is really a worry then yes these accumulated funds can required to pay a debt but this potential for loss can be protected against without forfeiting the benefits entirely this is not very common but if your father does n't need the money now he may be able to deposit some of the money into a special partially lawsuit protected format of the roth ira which has no age limits as detailed here if he never gets sued that 's ok it 's still his money if he passes away the value goes to his estate and does not disappear and he does n't forfeit any of his earned retirement benefits finally i would like to share one last thing with you and your father these benefits are n't free he has been paying a portion of his paycheck for decades into social security and now he is eligible for the maximum amount of benefits per month that he will qualify for and if he wants to keep working he loses no benefit and the amount could potentially even go up that 's up to him but not filing for benefits now will mean that all this money he 's been paying in for decades will just be lost they 'll basically just be a tax he 's paid out to other retirees his estate which means you kids wo n't get any of it either that 'd just be a waste for everyone involved if you have continued doubts or questions i would n't hesitate to consult a specialist lawyer or talk with the ssa directly to make sure this is all correct it 's his money and he has earned his benefits for many years i very much hope he gets to enjoy as much of them as he can

i would expect that your position will be liquidated when the option expires but not before there 's probably still some time value so it does n't make sense for the buyer to exercise the option early and take your stock instead they could sell the option to someone else and collect the remaining time value occasionally there 's a weird situation for whatever reason where an option has near zero or negative time value and then you might get an early exercise but in general if there 's time value someone would want to sell rather than exercise if the option has n't expired maybe the stock will even fall again and you 'll keep it if the option just expired maybe the exercise just has n't been processed yet it may take overnight or so

my son who is now 21 has never needed me to cosign on a loan for him and i did not need to establish any sort of credit rating for him to establish his own credit   one thing i would suggest is ditch the bank and use a credit union i have used one for many years and opened an account there for my son as soon as he got his first job he was able to get a debit card to start which does n't build credit score but establishes his account work the credit union he was able to get his first credit card through the same credit union without falling work the bureaucratic bs that comes with dealing with a large bank his interest rate may be a bit higher due to his lack of credit score initially but because we taught him about finance it is n't really relevant because he does n't carry a balance he has also been able to get a student loan without needing a cosigner so he can attend college   the idea that one needs to have a credit score established before being an adult is a fallacy like my son i started my credit on my own and have never needed a cosigner whether it was my first credit card at 17 the credit union probably should n't have done that since i was n't old enough to be legally bound my first car at 18 or my first home at 22 for both my son and i knowing how to use credit responsibly was far more valuable than having a credit score early before your children are 18 opening credit accounts with them as the primary account holder can be problematic because they are n't old enough to be legally liable for the debt using them as a cosigner is even more problematic for the same reason each financial institution will have their own rules and i certainly do n't know them all   for what you are proposing i would suggest a small line of credit with a credit union being small and locally controlled you will probably find that you have the best luck there

you 're interpreting things correctly at least at a high level those numbers come from the 10q filing and investor summary from microsoft but are provided to nasdaq by investment research as noted on the main page you linked to   that 's a big investment data firm    i 'm not sure why they reported non gaap microsoft numbers and not say aapl numbers it 's possible they felt the non gaap numbers reflect things better or have in the past for some material reason or it 's possible they made a typo though the last three quarters at least all used non gaap numbers for msft   msft indicates that the difference in gaap and non gaap revenue is primarily deferred revenue from windows and i did confirm that the sec filing for msft does include the gaap number not the non gaap number as you 'd expect i will also note that it looks like the 10q is not the only source of information   look at for example they had in the march 2016 report period ending revenues of gaap non gaap   but the nasdaq page indicates for that quarter my suspicion is that the investment data firm 's does additional work and includes certain numbers they feel belong in the revenue stream but are not in the gaap numbers   perhaps ms and oracle have more of those such as deferred software revenues aapl has relatively little of that as most of their profit is hardware

yes there is such possibility also there 's a possibility people made your computer your operation system your browser etc put there some code there that would intercept your communications and steal your money so could bank clerks and unlike all other examples this really happened in real world numerous times though usually at smaller banks atm makers etc   in the modern world you rely on things made by thousands of people this is a part of modern world 's conveniences you do n't have to use it you can store all your money in a big jar in your basement and nobody but occasional thief breaking in could take it   however fraudulent unauthorized transactions in most banks can be rolled back and any transaction is reported to you so fraud from mint.com people would be quite low on my list of risks much bigger risk is that somebody could break into mint.com servers and steal information about your accounts from there or install some malicious code i believe they have good protections but no security system is perfect you need to evaluate how the convenience of using mint.com compares to your personal feeling about this risk if you feel you could n't sleep at night knowing somewhere out there there is information about your money do n't use it i do n't worry about it too much as i know the chance of it happening is low and the chance of getting the money back if it happens is high but if you feel differently do n't do it

it can be zero or negative given the current market conditions any money parked with treasury bonds is 100 risk free so if i have a large amount of usd and need a safe place to keep then in today 's environment even the banks large as well are at risk so if i park my money with some large bank and that bank goes bankrupt my money is gone for good after a long drawn bankruptcy procedure i may get back all of it or some of it even if the bank does not go bankrupt it may face liquidity crises and i may not be able to withdraw when i want   hence it 's safer to keep it in treasury bonds even though i may not gain any interest or even lose a small amount of money at least it will be very safe    today there are very few options for large investors typically governments and institutional investors the euro is facing uncertainty the yuan is still regulated there is not enough gold to buy or to store it hence this leads towards the usd   the very fact that usd is safe in today 's environment is reflected in the treasury rates

the employer most likely has already sent that money that was withheld to the irs therefore they can not refund you any money instead you need to get the money back from the irs you do this by filing a tax return   your will show that taxes were withheld i.e. that you paid taxes the rest of the return will show that no taxes were due and therefore you are entitled to have your money refunded if you have already filed for that tax you you just need to file an amended return with the new data that amendment will show that you are to be refunded the extra money then just wait several weeks for the payment from the irs   as pointed out if it is medicare and social security taxes that have been withheld in error then you need to file a different set of forms with irs it would be nice if refunding fica also occurred via the tax return

if one has established a liquid emergency fund of 3 to 6 months income as suggested in several places here as well as being recommended by many financial planners then a savings account is a great place to keep that money all things being equal between the savings and checking account the limited transfers should be a non issue since ideally you wo n't be using that money and if you need to in an emergency you could move a whole months worth of expenses to checking in one transfer   the savings account gives you a place to keep the emergency fund segregated from your normal funds out of sight out of mind as it were a savings account also gives you a place to stash funds intended for short term goals away from normal use funds one such example i can use is that i am purchasing several plane tickets for various family members to come visit for christmas i have those funds set aside in a savings account so they do n't interfere with my budgeting of my normal living expenses while these are just examples and your situation may vary they are both examples of where a savings account would be useful even if it is identical to a checking account   edit   using other types of accounts can also accomplish the same thing since we are using the assumption that the checking and savings accounts are identical the benefit of using a savings account is that it is usually inherently linked to the associated checking account without any additional effort on the part of the account holder any other account type would require additional effort however minor on the part of the account holder to link them in such a way that would make transfers between accounts as easy as possible

yes because you can not have an exponential growth rate that is faster than the rate at which the economy grows on the long term 100 growth is much more than the few percent at which the economy grows so your share in the world economy would approximately double every year today the value of all the assets in the world economy is about $ 200 trillion if you start with an investment of just $ 1000 and this doubles every year then you 'll own all the world 's assets in years assuming this does n't grow you can of course take into account that it does grow this will yield a slightly larger time before you own the entire world

pump and dump scams are indeed very real but the scale of a single scam is n't anywhere near the type of you see in movies like trading places usually the scammer will buy a few hundred dollars of a penny stock for some obscure small business then they 'll spam every address they have with advice that this business is about to announce a huge breakthrough that will make it the next microsoft a few dozen people bite buy up a few thousand shares each remember the shares are trading for pennies then when the rise in demand pushes up the price enough for the scammer to make a decent buck he cashes out the price falls based on the resulting glut of stock and the victims lose their money thus a few red flags shake out that would be investors should be wary of

you absolutely should consider expenses why do they matter when the sticker price already includes them   because you can be much more certain about what the expense ratio will be in the future than you can about what the fund performance will be in the future the sticker price mixes generalized economic growth i.e. gains you could have gotten from other funds with gains specific to the fund but the expense ratio is completely fund specific   in other words when looking at the sticker price performance of a fund it 's difficult to determine how that performance will extend into the future   but the expense ratio will definitely carry into the future   it is rare for funds to drastically change their expense ratios but common for funds to change their performance suppose you find a fund that has returned a net of 8 over some time period and has a 1 expense ratio and another fund that has returned a net of 10 but has a 2 expense ratio   so the first fund returned = 8 and the second returned   there are decent odds that over some future time period the first fund will return while the second fund will return   in order for the second fund to be better than the first it has to reliably outperform it by 1 this is harder than it may sound   simply put there is a lot of noise in the fund performance but the expense ratio is all signal of course if you find a fund that will reliably return 20 after expenses of 3 it would probably make sense to choose that over one that returns 10 after expenses of 1   but will reliably return is not the same as has returned over the past n years and the difference between the two phrases becomes greater and greater the smaller n is   when you find a fund that seems to have performed well over some time period you should be cautious there is a good chance that the future holds some regression to the mean and the fund will not continue to be so stellar you may want to take a look at this question which asked about morningstar fund ratings which are essentially a measure of past performance   my answer references a study done by morningstar comparing its own star ratings vs. fund expenses as a predictor of overall results   i 'll repeat here the take home message how often did it pay to heed expense ratios every time how often did it pay to heed the star rating most of the time with a few exceptions how often did the star rating beat expenses as a predictor slightly less than half the time taking into account funds that expired during the time period in other words morningstar 's own study showed that its own star ratings that is past fund performance are not as good at predicting success as simply looking at the expense ratios of the funds

being long the s&p index etf you can expect to make money the index itself will never crash because the individual stocks in it are simply removed when they begin performing badly this is not to say that the s&p index wo n't lose 80 of its value in an instant or over a few trading sessions if circuit breakers are considered but even in the 2008 correction the s&p still traded far above book value with this in mind you have to realize that despite common sentiment the indexes are hardly representative of the market they are just a derivative and as you might be aware derivatives can enable financial tricks far removed from reality regarding index funds if a small group of people decide that 401k 's are performing badly then they will simply rebalance the components of the indexes with companies that are doing well the headline will be s&p makes another record high today so although panic selling can disrupt the order book especially during periods of illiquidity with the current structure the stock market being based off of three composite indexes can never crash because there will always exist a company that is not exposed to broad market fluctuations and will be performing better by fundamentals and share price similarly you collect dividends from the index etfs you can also sell covered calls on your holdings the cboe has a chart through the 2008 crisis showing your theoretical profit and loss if you sold calls 2 standard deviations out of the money at every monthly interval if you are going to be holding an index etf for a long time then you should n't be concerned about its share price at all since the returns would be pretty abysmal either way but it should suffice for hedging inflation

10 seems to be a little bit too optimistic but annually on average is doable 1 is way too little you 're doing something wrong unless you mean real return i.e. after adjustment for inflation and even then it 's not too high at any given year it may be easy or difficult but the point is that we 're talking about long term averages for example if you look at the dji for the last 30 years you 'll see a rise of 1300 give or take which annually is ~40 in the last 3 years the rise is even steeper but in the last week it is negative so it depends on your time line and the way you manage your investments you 've got to balance between stocks and bonds and cash but even if you park your money in cash you can get more than 1 right now capitol one on line savings is 1.15 and that 's with the lowest rates ever so getting 1 over time does mean that you 're doing something wrong imho

basically you need to use a time value of money equation to discount the cashflows back to today the wikipedia formula will likely work fine for you then you just need to pick an effective interest rate to use in the calculation run each of your amounts and dates though the formula there are various on line calculators to pick from and sum up the values you did not mention your location or jurisdiction but a useful proxy for the interest rate would be the average between the same duration mortgage rate and fixed deposit rate at your bank it should be close enough for your purposes although if an actual lawsuit is involved and the sums high enough to have lawyers it might be worth engaging an accountant as well to defend the of both the calculation and the interest rates chosen

first do n't owe much money on a car that 's out of warranty   if you have an engine blow up and repairs will cost the lion 's share of the car 's value the entire car loan immediately comes due because the collateral is now worthless   this puts you in a very miserable situation because you must pay off the car suddenly while also securing other transportation   second watch for possible early payment penalties   they are cheaper than paying interest but run the numbers   their purpose is to repay the lender the amount of money they already paid out to the dealer in sales commission or kickback for referring the loan   the positive effects you want for your credit report only require an open loan owing more money does n't help it hurts   however interest is proportional to principal owed so a $ 10,000 car loan is 10 times the interest cost of a $ 1000 car loan   that means paying most of it off early can fulfill your purpose as the car is nearer payoff you can reduce costs further assuming you handle the hit by increasing the deductible on collision and comprehensive fire and theft auto insurance   it 's not just you paying more co pay it also means the insurance company does n't have to deal with smaller claims at all e.g. with a $ 1000 files a claim on an $ 800 repair   if the amount you owe is small compared to its value and within $ 1000 2000 of paid off the lender may be ok with you dropping collision and comprehensive coverage altogether assuming you are   all of this adds up to paying most of it off but not all may be the way to go you could also talk to your lender about paying say 3/4 of it off and refinancing the rest as a 12-month deal

my answer is similar to ben miller 's but let me make some slightly different points there is one excellent reason to get a consolidation loan you can often get a lower interest rate if you are presently paying 19 on a credit card and you can roll that into a personal loan at you 'll be saving over 5 which can add up i would definitely not consolidate a loan at into a loan at then you 're just adding 1 to your interest rate what 's the benefit in this another good reasons for a consolidation loan is psychological a consolidation loan with fixed payments forces you to pay that amount every month you say you have trouble with credit cards it 's very easy to say to yourself oh just this month i 'm going to pay just the minimum so i can use my cash for this other very important thing that i need to buy and then next month you find something else that you just absolutely have to buy and again the next month and the next and your determination to seriously pay down your debt keeps getting pushed off if you have a fixed monthly payment you ca n't you 're committed also if you have many credit cards juggling payments on all of them can get complex and confusing it 's easy to lose track of how much you owe and to budget for payments at worst when there are many bills to pay you may forget one personally i now have 3 bank cards an airline card and 2 store cards and managing them is getting out of hand i have good reasons for having so many cards the airline card and the store cards give me special discounts but it 's confusing to keep track of as to adding $ 3,000 to the consolidation loan very very bad idea you are basically saying i have to start seriously paying down my debt tomorrow today i need a some extra cash so i 'm going to borrow just a little bit more but i 'm going to get started paying it off next month this is a trap and the sort of trap that leads people into spiraling debt start paying off debt now not at some vague time in the future that never seems to come

this is an unfortunate situation for you   you have zero chance at your question number 1 if someone was going to bend this rule for you it would have happened already   the answer to question number 2 is pursue solution number 3 the overriding issue is that the irs makes these rules not the employer plan sponsor or the administrator   you ca n't talk the plan administrator in to reimbursing you their system likely does n't even have a function to do so fsa timing issues can be complex and i think that 's the root of your issue because when an expense can be incurred date of service versus date of payment and when a claim must be filed are different things it 's really common to bend the rules on when a claim is submitted but not when it was incurred    it 's really common for an exiting employee to have 30 days to submit expenses for reimbursement   fsa expenses must always be incurred within the specified plan year or within your dates of employment if you were n't employed for the entire plan year this is specified by the irs   it seems like some wires were crossed when you asked this question   you were asking can i still incur claims and they were hearing how long do i have to submit an expense that has already been incurred some plans allow cobra continuation on fsa which generally does not make sense   your contributions to the plan would use after tax dollars but for folks who know they have an eligible expense coming it can make sense to continue via cobra in retain your eligibility under the plan so you can incur a claim after your employment termination regarding number 3   this sort of reimbursement would be outside the plan no precedent is necessary   you 've gotten them to claim it was their mistake they 're going to reimburse you for their mistake it has nothing to do with the fsa good luck

if the price of the property 1 increases a lot you will just break even on the huge expenses of home owning if the price of the property 2 increases a huge amount you will make lots of money due to the leverage if the price of the property 3 stays even you will lose a tremendous amount of money it 's much like owning a car constant expenses that 's all there is to it it 's well worth bearing in mind that property prices for your area your property need to be constantly increasing for you to merely break even note that over long periods of time prices tend to go up most anywhere but not everywhere many people basically base their thinking on that it will be ok in the long run which is fair enough i believe one huge factor is that it is enforced saving that is the number one advantage for most note too that in most all jurisdictions there are tremendous tax advantages even if it turns out to be situation 1 i.e. a waste of time you only break even note finally that there are indeed tremendous social financial advantages to having the equity it gets incredibly easy to get other loans for business or the like once you own a house this is undeniably an advantage perhaps press your husband on that one

currently when implied volatility is spoken the black scholes merton model is implied   this model has been shown to be deficient thus the variance gamma model should be used however as nearly no one uses it can be assumed that bs is still being implied the bs formula has multiple variables   some are external to the underlying in question   the rest are internal when all but one variable is known or assumed the last variable can be calculated so if one has the price of the underlying and all else except the volatility the volatility can be calculated thus implied if one selects an implied volatility and all variables except the underlying price is known the underlying price can be calculated for the present one uses the current price of the underlying to calculate the implied volatility   for future option prices one assumes an implied volatility at a later date to calculate a possible price for prices not at the money the bs model is extremely   the model can better determine a potential future price

the 3 and 9 figures are based on the cost of borrowing money and all the other ownership costs associated with real estate   from the same article because it 's usually still much cheaper to rent than to own the same    size and quality house in the same school district in rich    neighborhoods annual rents are typically only 3 of purchase price    while mortgage rates are 4 with fees so it costs more to borrow the    money as it does to borrow the house renters win and owners lose    worse total owner costs including taxes maintenance and insurance    come to about 8 of purchase price which is more than twice the cost    of renting and wipes out any income tax benefit imagine you are renting a house if the cost of your annual rent is lower than x then renting is obviously the best idea from a monetary calculation if rent is greater than y being a landlord makes more sense in the middle it is debatable and the non monetary reasons need to be considered

logically yes legally no any reasonable definition of an investment must include some types of gambling and insurance lottery tickets specifically are really crappy high risk high return investment   obviously most people try to avoid investments with a negative average expected future value but from a purely semantic perspective anything with a potential future value is an investment conversely anyone with a gambling problem should not pretend they are not gambling when making focused investments in high volatility stock options that said the irs taxes gains and losses differently depending on whether they are classified as gambling or just crappy investing so you will not be able to deduct your gambling losses from your earned income unlike investment losses which can be deducted up to per year

excellent explanation upvote to you sir i would like to add something   how do we know how many bushels of apples is worth a chunk of deer meat    you did not touch on the concept of value   the way i see it value is related to the human energy required to procure a specific good    for example it takes a man all day to find a nugget of gold while it take another man all day to pick 20 bushels of apples because gold is scarce it is worth a lot of apples it has a high value    at it 's core value is assigned based on the amount of human labor required to acquire a good or service    for example many years ago there may have been an equal number of bears and however it would take many brave hunters with and to kill a bear while any hunter could kill a solo thus even though they had the same scarcity a bear hide would be more valuable because the human labor required was greater    many economics classes simply say value depends on supply and demand however if something is in low supply and high demand it is because it takes so much human effort to procure if it did not take large amounts of human labor everyone would sell said item and the value would drop    what is your take on this do you have a better explanation for value

you should not trade based on what news is just released if you try you will be too slow to react most of the time in many cases the news is already priced into the stock during the anticipation of the news being released other times as soon as the news is released the price will gap up or down in response to the news   some times when you think that the news is good like new record profits have been achieved but the share price goes down instead of up this may be due to the expectation of the record profits by analysts to be 20 more than last year but the company only achieves 10 more than last year so the news is actually seen as bad because even though record profits it has n't met expectations the same can happen in the other direction a company may make a loss and the share price goes up this may be because it was expected to make a 50 loss but only made a 20 loss due to cost cutting so this is seen as a good thing and the price can shoot up especially if it had been beaten down for months an other example is when the federal reserve in the usa put up interest rates earlier this month some may have seen this as bad news and expected share prices to fall but instead prices rallied this was actually seen as good news firstly because it had been expected for a long time and secondly and more importantly because a small rise in interest rates after many years of near zero rates is a sign of the economy finally starting to improve if the economy is improving that means more people will have jobs more people will be spending more money companies will start to make higher revenues and start to expand which means higher profits and higher share prices a better way to trade is to have a written trading plan and use technical analysis to develop a set of buy and sell criteria that you follow to the tea then back test your trading plan through various market conditions to make sure you get a positive expectancy

moving average is mere average line based on historical period broadly use to view the trend but it has no relation to price action in due future course if price is going below 20 sma then in near future even the sma will start directing toward south in your case if price has fallen below all the short period average lines and long period average line then it is bearish in nature soon in few days you may find 20 sma leading downwards followed by closest period and then long also sma and ema can best be observed in charting software in candlestick mode because these moving averages can also be adjusted and viewed based on opening price high prices low price or closing price in you case i guess the data is of closing price data overlapping of averages may be sign of reversals so if you want to buy this stock you may have to wait till all the average lines cross over and when new trend begins with sma of shortest avg period 20 leading above the long avg period 90 days in your case then you can buy and just follow the trend i hope it answers you question

i am a bit at a loss as to how you can read the same book that inspired warren buffet and take away that trading 600 contracts per month is a way to prosperity   as a fellow engineer i can say with assurance this speculation scheme is doomed to failure   crossing out the word gamble was a mistake    instead you should focus on two things   the first is your core business which is signal processing   work and strive to be the best you can   seek out opportunities to increase your income while keeping your costs low   as an engineer you have an opportunity to earn an above average salary with very low costs second would be to warehouse some of those earning and let others who are good at other things work for you   you may want to read the jack bogle books and seek an asset allocation model   i tend to be more aggressive then he would suggest but that is a matter of preference     you do n't really have the time when you focus on your core business to manage 6 trades a month let alone 600   put your contributions on auto pilot and a surprisingly short time you will have a pile of cash

if a company earns $ 1 million in net profit let 's say all cash which is not entirely realistic it can do one of three things with it on the balance sheet profits that have not been distributed show up as retained earnings   when dividends are paid retained earnings and cash are reduced none of the other options change the fact that it is still profit they all just affect the balance sheet not the income statement note that when a company issues dividends it reduces its per share value since cash is leaving the door with nothing in return    in apple 's case since a significant amount of its profit was earned in other countries where it was not taxed by the us it would pay a significant amount in us corporate tax by bringing it back to the us by investing it or paying dividends they are betting that at some point the us will change the rules to make it more favorable to repatriate the money and reduce their tax significantly

there are people whose strategy revolves around putting orders at the bid and ask and making money off people who cross the spread   if you put an order in between the current bid ask people running that type of strategy will usually pick it off viewing it as a discount to the orders that they already have on the bid ask   often these people are trading by computer so your limit order may get hit so quickly that it appears instantaneous to you   in reality you were probably hit by a limit order placed specifically to fill against yours

what makes a credit card risky is that it requires discipline it is very easy to buy things that you can not afford with a credit card credit cards usually require a minimum payment every month if you owe them money but if you pay only the minimum amount your debt will grow quickly and since the interest rates are usually very high you can easily get into a state where you are overwhelmed by your debt the correct way to use a credit card is to pay the complete bill every month if you ca n't afford to pay the complete bill because you spent too much cut up your credit card   on the positive side there are many situations where paying by credit card will give you protection if you do n't get the goods that you paid for because the credit card company is fully responsible for those goods just like the seller so if you pay for a $ 5,000 holiday with a credit card and the company you paid to goes bankrupt the credit card company will refund your money   do not ever look at cash back on purchases you only get cash back if you spend money getting $ 50 cash back is of no use if you had to get $ 2,500 deeper in debt to get that cash back some people might contradict this but if you ask for advice on then this is the correct advice for you that you should follow

if the intention is after maturing to convert back the rupees into euro its not a good idea   generally the interest rate in euro and the interest rate in rupee are offset by the predicted exchange rate i.e. the rupee will fall compared to euro by similar rate the point at step 5 is generally what is expected to happen at times this can be less or more depending on the local global factors so on average you will not make money some times you will loose and sometimes you will gain plus i have shown flat conversion rates typically there is a buy rate and a sell rate for a pair of currencies there is a difference spread that is the margins of bank typically in the range of 2 to 4 depending on the currency pairs

i used to think that paying off ahead of time made sense but i no longer do at least in most cases   the upside is that you can get a return on your money equal to the mortgage interest rate it 's less than that in the us where mortgage interest is deductible so it 's roughly the mortgage interest rate 1 your marginal income tax rate   there are a few downsides the biggest is that cash is the most liquid asset you can have you can get at it with no restrictions if you put that cash into your house you are converting that into an asset with a lot of restrictions you ca n't get at it without fees nor can you get at it if you do n't have a job which is when you would need it most   so you are putting your money in a hard to get at place for a small interest rate i do n't think it is worthwhile edit one complication is pmi if you are currently paying pmi it may make sense to put money towards the mortgage until you get to 20 and can get rid of the pmi

my recommendation is simple   rent the fact that you have to ask the question is a clear sign that you have no business buying a home that 's not to say that it 's a bad question to ask though far more important then rather it 's wise for you to buy a home is the more important question of are you emotionally ready for the responsibility and of a home   at best you are tying your self to the same number of rooms same location and same set of circumstances for the next 5 7 years in that time it will be very unlikely that you will be able to sell the house for a profit get your minor equity back or even get a second loan for any reason   you mentioned getting married soon that means the possibility of more children divorce and who knows what else   you are in an emotionally and financially time in your life now is not the right time to buy anything large instead rent and focus on improving your credit rating in 5 years time you will have a much better credit rating get much better rates and fees and have a much better handle on where you want to be with your home family situation   buying a house is not something you do on a weekend for most people it 's the culmination of years of work searching researching and preparation   often times people that buy before they are ready will end up in foreclosure and generally have a crappy next 15 years as they try to work themselves out of the issue

us or eu states are sovereigns which can not go bankrupt us states have defaulted in the 's but in most of those cases creditors were eventually repaid in full i 'm not 100 sure but i believe that indiana was an exception with regard to costs incurred building a canal system the best modern example of a true near default was new york city in the late 1970 's although new york city is n't a state the size and scope of its finances is greater than many us states what happened then in a nutshell basically a default of a major state or a city like nyc where creditors took major losses would rock the financial markets and make it difficult for all states to obtain both short and long term financing at reasonable rates that 's why these entities get bailed out if greece or california really collapse it will likely create a domino effect that will have wide reaching effects

most people carry a diversity of stock bond and commodities in their portfolio   the ratio and types of these investments should be based on your goals and risk tolerance   i personally choose to manage mine through mutual funds which combine the three but etfs are also becoming popular as for where you keep your portfolio it depends on what you 're investing for   if you 're investing for retirement you are definitely best to keep as much of your investment as possible in 401k or iras preferably roth iras   many advisers suggest contributing as much to your 401k as your company matches then the rest to ira and if you over contribute for the ira back to the 401k   you may choose to skip the 401k if you are not comfortable with the choices your company offers in it such as only investing in company stock if you are investing for a point closer than retirement and you still want the risk and reward potential of stock i would suggest investing in low tax mutual funds or eating the tax and investing in regular mutual funds   if you are going to take money out before retirement the penalties of a 401k or ira make it not worth doing technically a savings account is n't investing but rather a place to store money

i think you are addressing it the wrong way around insurance in its basic idea is supposed to protect you from exceptional and potentially life changing financial situations not from day to day cost that means that covering the first 1000 $ is pretty much useless for any serious sickness the insurance would be without merit for example it makes sense to insure your house against fire the premium is small compared to the potential damage which works because the chance of a fire is also small if you extend a fire insurance to cover dropped glasses or broken tv sets it becomes quickly a bad idea chances for these events are higher so insurance cost go up and the events are easier to fake too insurance should cover the large damage with low risk never the small damage with more risk the only reason the latter exist is that people do n't understand it and insurances make money on it so they offer it apply this to your insurance idea and the right way would be pay 50 $ to cover any cost over 10000 $ pay 100 $ to cover any cost over 5000 $ pay 200 $ to cover any cost over 2500 $ and so on all numbers are taken from thin air as an example i would love if there is an relatively cheap insurance that covers anything above 10000 $ or even a higher threshold they do n't exist because there is not enough money to make for insurance companies

while volume per trade is higher at the open and to a lesser extent at the close the overall volume is actually lower on average bid ask spreads are at the open and to a lesser extent at the close generally bid ask spreads are inversely proportional to overall volumes why this is the case has n't been sufficiently clearly answered by academia yet but some theories are that

this is known as an inverted yield curve it is rare and can be caused by a few things as discussed at the link it can be because the view is that the economy will slow and therefore interest rates will go down it is not caused by secret preparation it could also be that there is generally in the world a move towards safer investments making their interest rates cheaper if i had to guess and this guess is worth what you paid for it it is because australia 's interest rate is significantly greater than other parts of the world long term lower risk investment is being attracted there as it gets a better return than elsewhere this is pushing rates lower on long term bonds so i would not take it as an indication of a soon to be economic downturn simply because in this global economy australia is different in ways that influence investment and move interest rates

another thing to keep in mind is the fact that capex is viewed as required cash spend in order to maintain the business at its current levels whereas as expansionary capex is viewed as voluntary if i were to value your company i would want to know how well it cash flows as is given that whatever voluntary growth capex investments current management is making may not apply to my plan for the company if i were to purchase it   secondly often times expansionary capex is funded through credit facilities and thus from a credit perspective it is helpful to break out maintenance capex and growth capex when determining certain credit metrics such as a fixed charge coverage ratio

metals and mining is an interesting special case for stocks   it 's relationship to u.s. equity spx is particularly weak correlation compared to most stocks so it does n't behave like equity   however it is still stock and not a commodities index so it 's relation to major metals gold for instance is not that strong either correlation metals and mining stocks have certainly underperformed the stock market in general over the past 3 vs 9.8 annualized so this does n't look particularly promising   it did have a spectacularly good 8 year period though 66 annualized   it 's worth remembering that it is still stock   if the market did not think it could make a reasonable profit on the stock the price would decrease until the market thought it could make the same profit as other equity adjusted slightly for the risk   so is it reasonable to expect that it would give the same return as other stock on average   yes   though as has been shown in the past 25 years your actual result could vary wildly both positive and negative all numbers are from monthly over the last 25 years using as a proxy

there is no hard and fast rule if there was people could cleverly arrange to make money just often enough to stay on the ok side it 's a judgement call by the cra and it probably starts with an audit and depends on the reasons for the loss simple example your business is selling your time at x an hour and you have expenses that you will cover if you sell y hours a year where y is a lot less than the 2000 hours we have to sell each year maybe 300 and you had a big contract but it fell through and though you tried and tried you could n't get another contract this will probably be considered a reasonable loss another example your business is selling art or antiques most of which are kept in your house where you can look at them every day and enjoy them your expenses include lots of flights to places where these art or antiques come from or perhaps are inspired by along with hotel and restaurant costs and you would need to sell your entire inventory every year just to cover these expenses yet you only sell one or two pieces a year or none and there 's no indication that you 're particularly trying to sell more than that this will probably be considered an unreasonable loss and if the situation persists for many years in a row the expenses may end up being disallowed side businesses often lose money at first in fact once they stop losing money they stop being side businesses if you have spin up costs like buying hardware developing software or acquiring inventory and you can show how long those extra costs can be expected to last your expenses are less likely to be disallowed that 's the issue not how many years in a row the loss occurred this archived cra document gives examples of startup expenses that were allowed in years that did n't have revenue never mind profit

here are some things to consider if you want to employ a covered call strategy for consistent returns the discussion also applies to written puts as they 're functionally equivalent write covered calls only on fairly valued stock if the stock is distinctly undervalued just buy it by writing the call you cap the gains that it will achieve as the stock price to intrinsic value if the stock is overvalued sell it or just stay away as the owner of a covered call position you have full exposure to the downside of the stock the premium received is normally way too small to protect against much of a drop in price the ideal candidate does n't change in price much over the life of the position yes this is low volatility which brings low option premiums as a seller you want high premiums but this ca n't be judged in a vacuum no matter how high the volatility in absolute terms as a seller you 're betting the market has overpriced volatility if volatility is high so premiums are fat but the market is correct then the very real risk of the stock dropping over the life of the position offsets the premium received one thing to look at is current implied volatility for the at the money atm near month call compare it to the two year historical volatility morningstar has this conveniently displayed moving away from pure volatility consider writing calls about three months out just slightly out of the money the premium is all time value and the time value decay accelerates in the final few months in theory a series of one month options would be higher time value but there are costs and no guarantee that today 's good deal will be repeatable twelve time per year when comparing various strikes and expirations compare time value per day to compare the same statistic across multiple companies use time value per day as a percent of capital at risk car is the price of the stock less the premium received if you already own the stock track it as if you just bought it for this strategy so use the price on the day you wrote the call along with time value per day compare the simple annualized percent return again on capital at risk measuring the return if a the stock is called away and b the stock remains unchanged i usually concentrate more on the second scenario as we get the capital gain on the stock regardless without the option strategy ideally you can also calculate the probability based on implied volatility of the stock achieving these price points by expiration measuring returns at many possible stock prices you can develop an overall expected return i wo n't go into further detail as it seems outside the scope here finally i usually target a minimum of 25 annualized if the stock remains unchanged you can of course adjust this up or down depending on your risk tolerance i consider this to be conservative

13 16 the loss from the previous purchase will be added to the cost basis of the security for the second purchase since you sold it at a loss again it would increase your losses your loss from the first sale will be disallowed your loss will be added to the cost basis of the next purchase your gains will be taxed on the total of the cost basis which will reduce your gains which you will taxed less your gains will be taxed your loss is allowed you will be taxed on both   wash sales really only applies to losses if you sell for gain the tax man will be happy to take his share from my understanding it does not matter if it is ira or brokerage the wash sale rule affects them all check this link

leverage increase returns but also risks ie the least you can pay the greater the opportunity to profit but also the greater the chance you will be underwater leverage is given by the value of your asset the house over the equity you put down so for example if the house is worth 100k and you put down 20k then the leverage is 5 another way to look at it is to see that the leverage is the inverse of the margin or percentage down payment so = 5 the return on your investment will be magnified by the amount of your leverage suppose the value of your house goes up by 10 had you paid your house in full your return would be 10 or however if you had borrowed 80 dollars and your leverage was 5 as above a 10 increase in the value of your house means you made a profit of 10k on a 20k investment a return of 50 or as i said your return was magnified by the amount of your leverage that is 10 return on the asset times your leverage of 5 = 50 this is because all the profit of the house price appreciation goes to you as the value of your debt does not depend on the value of the house what you borrowed from the bank remains the same regardless of whether the price of the house changed the problem is that the mechanism also works in reverse if the price of the house falls by 10 it means now you only have 10k equity if the price falls enough your equity is wiped out and you are underwater giving you an incentive to default on your loan in summary borrowing tends to be a really good deal heads you win tails the bank loses or as happened in the us the taxpayer loses

assuming your investments are n't in any kind of tax advantaged account like an ira they are generally not tracked and you indeed may pay more taxes   what will likely change however is your cost basis   you only pay tax on the difference between the value of the investment when you sell it and its value when you bought it there is no rule that says once you sell an investment and pay taxes on the gain you will never again pay any taxes on any other investments you then buy with that money   if you own some investment and it increases in value and then you sell it you had a capital gain and owe taxes depending on your tax bracket etc   if you use the money to buy some other investment and that increases in value and then you sell it you had another separate capital gain and again owe taxes however every time you sell you only are subject to capital gains taxes on the gain not the entire sale price   the value of the investment at the time you bought it is the cost basis   when you sell you take the sale price and subtract the cost basis to find your gain so suppose you bought $ 1000 worth of some etf many years ago   it went up to $ 2000 and you sold it   you have $ 2000 in cash but $ 1000 of that is your original money back so your capital gain is $ 1000 and that is the amount on which you owe or may owe taxes   suppose you pay 15 tax on this as you suggest that is $ 150 leaving you with $ 1850   now suppose you buy another etf with that   your cost basis is now $ 1850   suppose the investment now increases in value again to $ 2000   this time when you sell you still have $ 2000 in cash but this is now only $ 150 more than you paid so you only owe capital gains taxes on that $ 150   a 15 tax on that would be $ in that example you had one capital gain of $ 1000 and a second of $ 150 and paid a total of $ in taxes 150 +   suppose instead that you had held the original investment and it had increased in value to $ and you had then sold it   you would have a single capital gain of $ minus the original 1000 you paid   15 of this would be the same $ you paid under the other arrangement   so in essence you pay the same taxes either way   this example is simplified of course in reality the rate you pay depends on your overall income so you could pay more if you sell a lot in a single year since it could push you into a higher tax bracket so none of the money is tax exempt but each time you sell you reset the counter by paying tax on your gain and each time you buy you start a new counter on the basis of whatever you pay for the investment   assuming you 're dealing with ordinary investment instruments like stocks and etfs this basis information is typically tracked by the bank or brokerage where you buy and sell them   technically speaking it is your responsibility to track and report this when you sell an investment and if you do complicated things like transfer securities from one brokerage to another you may have to do that yourself   in general however your bank brokerage will keep track of cost basis information for you

the entire premise of purchasing a call option is your expectation that the prices will rise so even though there is a possibility of prices falling you would n't mind paying higher premiums in a volatile market   for a call option because you 're bullish and are expecting the volatility to eventually turn out in your favour i.e. prices to rise

tl;dr if your currently held bond 's bid yield is smaller than another bonds ask yield you can swap your bond for bigger returns let 's imagine you buy a long bond for $ 12000 face value of $ 10000 and it has 6 coupon the cash flows will have an internal return rate of this is the published ask yield in 2014 of the bond after six years prices have fallen inflation and yields went up so you can sell it for only $ 10000 if you would do it the irr will be only so there will be less return than if you keep it   but if you would undo the transaction then the future cash flows would yield this is the bid yield in 2020 of the bond if you can find an offer that yields more than you have better returns if you sell your bond and invest that $ 10000 in the other bond   but as other answers pointed it out you rarely have this opportunity as the market is very effective assuming everything else is equal

employers withhold at rates specified in circular e issued by the ir you can request that   additional money be withheld not an issue here or you can have   reduced withholding by claiming additional allowances on a w-4 i.e.   more than just for you and spouse and dependents if you believe that   this will result in withholding that will more closely match the tax due   note added in 2 of the w-4 form has worksheets that can be used to figure out how many additional allowances to request also i wonder if your withholding will be 37 or final tax bill be   26 of your adjusted gross income   the tax brackets are the tax   on marginal income if you are in the 28 tax bracket you owe 28 cents in tax for each additional dollar of income not 28 cents in tax for every dollar of income   your overall tax might well be less than 20 of your income   as a specific example in 2011 a married taxpayer filing jointly would be in the   highest 35 tax bracket if the taxable income was $ or more marginal tax rate of 35 is applicable to every dollar more than $ but the tax on   $ itself works out to be $ or of the taxable income so if you do expect to be earning around $ 350 k or more in salary between now and december 31 to hit that 26 that you expect you will owe you might want to consider paying a tax accountant for advice on how to fill out your w-4 form for your new employer rather than relying on an internet forum such as this for free advice note added in edit   your comment it is a cocktail of federal taxes state taxes local taxes health care on the earlier version of my answer does raise the question of whether you want your employer to withhold 26 instead of 37 and have the money go to meet all these obligations or just 26 towards your federal income tax liability only the federal w-4 form affects only how much money is withheld from your paycheck and sent to the us treasury   some of the money that each of your employers withholds social security and medicare taxes is not affected by what you put down on   the w-4 form   now if you hold two jobs and the total income shown on your w-2s is larger than the ss limit you will   have had too much social security taxes withheld and the excess will be a credit towards your federal income tax liability   you have self employment income too on which you owe social security and medicare taxes and you are making estimated tax payments the excess social security tax payment can count towards this too as well as income tax on your schedule c income   thus if your new employer is withholding too much you might be able to skip making the fourth quarterly payment of estimated tax or make a reduced payment there is no requirement that the four installments   must be equal   in short there are lots of ramifications that you need to take into account before deciding that 26 is the right number instead of filling out a w-4   all by yourself right away i strongly recommend   reading up a lot on income taxes or play with a tax preparation program last year 's version will do a pretty good job of at least getting you in the right ballpark or consult with a tax accountant

someone asked this over in /r they were asking how to profit off nv specifically but here 's what i wrote there i 'd be curious what you guys think   gt go back in time about 6 mo case the medical scene for movers and write some proposals to help them expand traditional banks wo n't touch financing these guys with a 10 ft stick right now the fed has told them straight up they will lose fdic membership if they touch drug money cough cough tobacco and alcohol do n't count cough cough if you do n't have a time machine either come up with a way to be a bank to these guys without going to a fed lockup or go finance expansion in the next state which it 's gon na be a while until these guys get integrated with the regular money system to the point they have stocks and such or maybe the fed freezing them out as they make a fortune will just push forward crypto currency and the collapse of the current money oligarchy who knows   there was also some comments about shipping from nv to home states which is probably a bad idea for many reasons i did however feel i can offer some insight on a legal president for this kind of behavior   but exactly how legal to avoid direct shipping of a purchase to a state is i mean once it 's your proper legal property and you 're just shipping it to yourself that does seem legal right or if it would get the same blind eye when done with pot are huge unknowns   gt;i'm sure the feds will not see a problem with sending drugs to yourself across state lines actually funny enough i live in the wine region of ca and there is a whole business here of wine storage and shipping places it 's up to the states to decide how or if they allow alcohol to be shipped into their state from others and a bunch of state have very complex rules or just do n't allow it so if you come out here for tourism drink some wine at a like it and ask if you can have some shipped home the answer is about 50/50 to be no and if you 're a average income that 's your answer if you 're some rich dude however you can say ah gotcha pesky laws well here 's the address of my storage and shipping place send the 2 cases there then nobody bats an eye and off the cases go guy goes home calls up the shipping place and says hey pull those cases my personal property and ship them to me and somehow magically this is now legal i have no idea who 's taking on the liability here if the shipping place has them sign off we will ship wherever you ask it 's not our job to verify the legality of your request then i guess it 's on the consumer but if you have an entire business built around circumventing state law it would seem to me that this should be a legal problem but wine is a high end commodity rich people make their own rules and if ca turns a blind eye to this practice they get to collect the sales tax as it 's sold in ca and shipped to a location in ca whereas fighting it would hurt their tourism and also send the tax income to the states being shipped to baby   re reading this now i 'm not even sure if there is a liability here they bought the property in ca paid tax in ca and had it sent to a mailing address in ca what they do after that with their personal property is not the states business right i 'd imagine this would be drastically different if shipping for resale similarly i think this all only works if you complete the transaction while physically in the state so at most this might turn on some weed tourism   the big difference in all of this is that the fed is fine with alcohol but not weed so while i suspect someone will form such a weed storage and shipping place at some point i do n't really want to be first in line to see how this and if it lands you in trouble with the fed

this is a hard question to answer   government debt and mortgages are loosely related   banks typically use yields on government bonds to determine mortgage interest rates   the banks must be able to get higher rates from the mortgage otherwise they would buy government bonds your question mentions default so i 'm assuming a country has on its promise to pay either the principal or interest on government bonds the main thing to consider is who does not get their money   in other words who does the government decide not to pay   this is the important part   the government will have some money so they could pay some bond holders   they must decide who to for example let 's look at who holds greek government debt   around 70 of greek government debt is held outside greece   see table below   the greek government could decide to default only on the debt to foreign holders   in that case the banks in france and switzerland would take the loss on their bonds   this could cause severe problems in france and switzerland depending on the percentage of greek bonds that make up the banks assets   greek banks would still face losses however since the price of their greek bond holdings would drop sharply when the government defaults   interestingly the losses for the greek banks may be smaller than the losses faced by the french and swiss banks   this is usually the favored option chosen by government since the french and swiss do n't vote in greece yields on greek government bonds would rise dramatically   if your greek mortgage is an adjustable rate mortgage then you could see some big adjustments upward   if you live in france or switzerland then the bank that owns your mortgage may go under if greece defaults   during liquidation the bank will sell their assets which includes mortgages and you will probably not notice any difference in your mortgage as i stated earlier this is a hard question to answer since the two financial instruments involved bonds and mortgages are similar but may or may not be related

the market moves faster than ratings agencies   everyday the market is trying to figure out the true value of assets liabilities and thus its overall equity value   the financial crisis illustrated this perfectly when bear got stuck in a liquidity trap   it 's was still highly rated likewise its overall credit rating was sound however in reality the value of assets were much higher due to coming default credit providers realized assets bear had posted as collateral were falling in value quickly   this started the death spiral or feedback loop in which it is n't clear if the tail the dog or the dog the tail but as equity value fell bear could no longer get access to credit markets to fund daily operations once it got margin called and could n't pay it was all over   when it was sold to jpm they basically stole the entire company at a fire sale price everyone knew they were getting a deal as reflected in the post buyout price jump of jpm stock     so in a technical sense you are right they have nothing to do with each other   but in a practical sense as we see equity value collapse we are approaching bankruptcy and thus default and credit ratings should represent likelihood of default so the two should have a positive correlation to one another assuming equity value is the true value
