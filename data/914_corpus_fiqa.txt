if you sell through an intermediate who sets up the shop for you odds are they collect and pay the sales tax for you my experience is with publishing books through amazon where they definitely handle this for you if you can find a retailer that will handle the tax implications that might be a good reason to use them   it looks like etsy uses a different model where you yourself are responsible for the sales tax which requires you to register with your state looks like this is the information for new york and pay the taxes yourself on a regular basis see this link for a simple guide if you 're doing this you 'll need to keep track of how much tax you owe from your sales each month quarter or year depending on the state laws   you can usually be a sole proprietor which is the easiest business structure to set up if you want to limit your legal liability or work with a partner you may want to look into other forms of business structure but for most a sole proprietorship is fine to start out with   if you do a sole proprietorship you can probably file the income on a 1040 schedule c when you do your personal taxes each year

first get a professional tax consultation with a ny licensed cpa or ea at what point do i need to worry about collecting sales taxes for the city and state of new york generally from the beginning see here for more information on nys sales tax   at what point do i need to worry about record keeping to report the income on my own taxes from the beginning even before that since you need the records to calculate the costs of production and expenses i suggest starting recording everything as soon as possible what sort of business structures should i research if i want to    formalize this as less of a hobby and more of a business you do n't have to have a business structure you can do it as a sole proprietor if you 're doing it for profit i suggest treating it as a business and reporting it on your taxes as a business schedule c so that you could deduct the initial losses but the tax authorities do n't like business that keep losing money so if you 're not expecting any profit in the next 3 4 years keep it reported as a hobby misc income talk to a licensed tax professional about the differences in tax treatment and reporting you will still be taxed on your income and will still be liable for sales tax whether you treat it as a hobby or as a business official business for profit activity will require additional licenses and fees hobby not for profit activity might not check with the local authorities city county state

wow it 's clear i 'm outnumbered   when i 'm approached with the question and keep in mind it 's usually a couple data points and little else i am getting started with no other money do i fund a retirement or emergency account i often suggest they put the funds into a roth in a money market fund and treat it like an emergency account if there 's in fact an emergency there 's no penalty to withdraw the deposit and we 're talking peanuts for interest today   with no emergency two things could happen a as the account grows beyond what 's needed for emergencies the excess can be invested long term b as the investor earns more money and saves up enough to have a true emergency account separate from the ira the roth can be fully invested long term the bad idea stems from the view that one is using their roth as an emergency account which of course is bad the subtle difference is one has no retirement savings and puts their emergency account into the otherwise unused roth as time passes they 've protected more funds to grow tax free   in the end the most important thing is whether the person is saving and not tapping for simple non emergency things i 'd rather see a guy with $ 25 k in his roth and no other funds than to have $ 5000 in his bank account because every time it gets larger he feels compelled to spend it   my answer to matt is to treat it for now as you intended low risk cd or cash money market

i strongly recommend you to invest in either stocks or bonds both markets have very strict regulations and usually follow international standards of governance plus they are closely supervised by local governments since they look to serve the interests of capital holders in order to attract foreign investment real estate investment is not all risky but regulations tend to be very localized there are federal state county laws and the last usually being the most significant in terms of costs city taxes and zoning so if they ever change that could ruin your investment keeping up with them would be hard work because of language legal and distance issues visiting notary 's office to sign papers for example another thing to consider is specially on rural distant areas the risk of taking your land in poorer countries you could also face the problem of land invasion both urban and rural solution for that depends on a harsh fast or socially populist slow local government small businesses are out of question for you frankly the list of risks cash stealing accounting misleading etc is such that you will lose money even if you ran the business in your hometown it would not be easy right

as joetaxpayer says there 's a lot you can do with just the stock price exploring that a bit stock prices are a combination of market sentiment and company fundamentals options are just a layer on top of that as such options are mostly which is why you have a hard time finding historical option data it 's just not that interesting technically mostly because there are known issues with the assumptions the black scholes formula makes it 's pretty good and importantly the market relies on it to determine fair option pricing option prices are determined by relationship of stock price to strike both distance and time to expiration dividends since dividend payments reduce the intrinsic value of a company the prospect of dividend payments during the life of a call option depresses the price of the option as all else equal without the payments the stock would be more likely to end up in the money reverse the logic for puts volatility interest rates but this effect is so tiny it 's safe to ignore 4 volatility is the everything else is known that 's why option trading is often considered volatility trading there are many ways to skin this cat but the result is that by using quoted historical values for the stock price and the dividend payments and if you like interest rates you can very closely determine what the price of the option would have been very closely depending on your volatility assumption you could calculate then historical volatility for each time period by figuring the average price swing in either direction for say the past year year before the date in question so you 'd do this each day walking forward read up on it and try various volatility approaches and see if your results are within a reasonable range re the black scholes formula   there 's a free spreadsheet downloadable from you might find it useful to grab the concept for coding it up yourself it 's vba but you can certainly use that info to translate in your language of choice or if you prefer to read perl has a good module with full source of course i find this approach easier than reading a calculus formula but i 'm a better developer than math geek

depends on the stock involved but for the most part brokerages allow you gain entry at 50 meaning you can short twice the cash on hand you have    going forward you need to maintain 30 so on a $ 10,000 short you 'd have to maintain $ 3000 in your account example an account with $ 5000 cash you can short $ 10,000 securities   let say 100 shares of xyz at $ 100 per share after trade settles you wo n't receive a margin call until your balance falls to $ 3000 probably right around the time xyz rises to $ 120 per share   riskier stocks will have higher margin maintenance requirements leveraged vehicles like triple leveraged require 90 margin if they are allowed to be shorted at all

when volatility is higher the option is more likely to end up in the money moreover when it ends up in the money it is likely to be over the strike price by a greater amount consider a call option with high volatility moves in the stock price are big both up moves and down moves if the stock moves up by a lot the call option holder will benefit greatly on the other hand when the stock moves down below a certain point the option holder does not care how big a down move the stock has his downside is limited hence the value of the option is increased by high volatility i know everyone who searches this is looking for this answer bump so people are able to get this concept instead of looking all over the web for it

i do n't agree that the market as a whole is a ponzi scheme but there are some ponzi like aspects to it if you buy high quality stocks like coca cola johnson and johnson at&amp;t verizon kraft wells fargo the vanilla bank not one of the crazy ones ibm berkshire hathaway etc and simply hold onto them for the next 10 20 years you will make money even over the last decade when stocks went nowhere you still came out ahead through the dividend payments it was just at an unsatisfactory rate of return also the market consists of a lot more than just stocks corporate bonds are a big market and i always recommend people to look at bonds if you can not judge whether a company is credit worthy how can you invest in the common stock i 've made a lot more money myself in the bond market than in the stock market   however for many stocks they do look a lot like ponzi schemes this is true in particular with many of the tech stocks cuban was a tech investor so that is probably where his sentiment is coming from you have many of these companies that create great products however they never have positive cash flow because all the money is spent to develop new products as the share price goes up the company issues new shares to fund research stock options to employees to enrich them etc however eventually they run into a string of bad research that do not yield a new product and the share price plunges perhaps the company goes bankrupt so you have a company that developed great products but the shareholders never got a penny in dividends and the final shareholders have paper worth zero   take a look at research in motion for example creating the blackberry has to be one of the biggest successes in tech over the last decade however has the shareholders gotten any richer only if they traded amongst themselves nobody got a dividend what happened to the many billions of dollars they made during the peak popularity years of blackberry it went to executives employees and was squandered on development that did not effectively defend the phone 's dominant market position now the stock price is back down to the pre prime years and if a shareholder held onto it throughout the entire period he would not have received a single penny and this is a profitable enterprise things look even more bizarre when you start looking at the tech companies that have never had a positive earnings quarter and no plans to ever have positive earnings something like pandora comes to mind often management at these more bizarre companies run the company as a toy to play with their own ideas and to issue themselves stock as compensation and of course they sell a lot of the stock to cash in before they delve into the next risky venture they have no intention of ever enriching anybody who holds into the stock in the long run if for some reason they make money they will put it all into their next toy project until one of them fails and wipes everything out   if you invest in a profitable business with reasonable management you will generally come out ahead some businesses get displaced by unpredictable circumstances and they go bankrupt but on average if a company is good at doing something and they pay out the earnings you come out ahead you get in trouble when businesses are good at something and they take all the money they make and put it into doing something they are not good at a business might only provide good cashflow for 10 20 years when the product is popular and before competitors cut into margins if that money is squandered the long term shareholder may ultimately have very terrible results the long term shareholder ends up being the guy who keeps going all in on a to win bet that is what management is doing when they bet the company on the next unproven product but eventually he gets zeroed out on one loss   this is why if you look at buffett 's investments they are all in simple businesses that spits off cash to the owner shareholder businesses like soft drinks snacks rail roads vanilla banking utility like energy companies insurance etc you might be good at judging the odds of whether a business will succeed or not aka make more money than your original investment or not but you do n't want management of that company to make a wildly different bet for you just because they are great at operating a company does n't mean they are good enough at judging odds or disciplined enough to make those bets for you i may have predicted accurately that business x will be a great success but if manage takes those profits and goes all in on business y without giving me a chance to cash out that may have results

it will depend somewhat on the rules where the company is formed and perhaps how much you 're talking about investing i do n't know about canada but when i 've formed businesses in the u.s. i 've been advised to invest some of the money as an equity investment and the bulk of the remainder as a loan you say more shares so it sounds like you 've already invested some money and need to inject another round if you make a loan to the company make sure everything is done at arm 's length you 'll need to wear the hat of the company management and sign a contract with yourself use a market based interest rate and make sure the company is paying you back with interest an alternative which may work if you expect cash flow soon is to pay for certain expenses personally and then submit an expense report to the company which will pay you back overall a quick consultation with your accountant should be a relatively inexpensive way to get the best answer for your specific circumstances

well hindsight tells us now that by and large doing 100 borrowing was not the best policy we could have taken   it gets but in the us the traditional 20 is the answer i presently feel comfortable with it could be a reactionary judgement i am making to the current mess in which i have formed the opinion that all parties are responsible and arm chair if we had only stuck with the 20 rule we would n't be here right now the truth is probably much more gray than that but like all things personal finance it is really up to you   if the law allows 100 financing ask yourself if it really makes sense that a bank would just loan you hundreds of thousands of dollars to live somewhere

you need to talk to a local attorney specializing in real estate matters the contract needs to ensure that your interests are protected how you do that is too complex for an answer here and varies from state to state or even jurisdictions within a state there are all sorts of options sometimes deals like this are structured so that you can actually sell your remaining equity in the property to a third party later on if the property has value but the banks are n't interested in lending right now you could potentially make money on it down the road

you will be best to cancel the original instruction first as you will have to wait for any pending payments to be received as the banks will not entertain multiple refunds after this can be confirmed the account will simply show a credit which you ask for   many lenders banks process these type of transactions after a period of time ie 30 days and there will be no way to speed this up so the sooner you act the better   when you contact the bank have bank details for the might transfer externally fingers crossed or you may receive a cheque in the post   try to avoid complicating the matter with changes of address and ringing before you have cancelled the instruction etc if possible

i have read from lot of places that transferring funds from nro to nre is possible given correct documents are provided yes this is correct the key document 15cb establishes that you have paid taxes that were due before money is transferred from the nro account to the nre account and/or are repatriated here is what i am simply steps 3 4 more so the step 4 can be seen as new income so the source of the funds is originally from nre account however the ca feels that since my withdrawal and deposit mechanism in nro is cash i might be subject to questioning    is there any issues in doing the above the ca is right the cash withdrawal and cash deposit has broken the link between the money withdrawn and the money deposited it could easily be the case that the cash withdrawals were spent on expenses and the cash deposit is new taxable income to you this new income needs to be declared and the taxes paid if you uncle is a close relative the exact relationships that are called close relatives are defined by law the return of the money can be declared to be a gift from your uncle to you and no taxes are due from you on the money if the funds are large it is advised to have a gift deed it is not a simple matter of creating a gift deed stating that your uncle has given you a gift your uncle has to show how he acquired so many assets that he gave you some money as a gift and whether appropriate taxes were paid by him   if your uncle is not a close relative he can still gift you up to rs 50,000 per year without you having to pay any income tax on the money received but again a gift deed would be needed to account for the cash deposits in short keep speaking to your ca he will advise you on the best course of action related question transfering money from nre account in india to family member

yes you can do that but you have to have the stocks issued in your name stocks that you 're holding through your broker are issued in street name to your broker if you have a physical stock certificate issued in your name you just endorse it like you would endorse a check and transfer the ownership if the stocks do n't physically exist you let the stock registrar know that the ownership has been transferred to someone else as to the price the company does n't care much about the price of private sales but the taxing agency will in the us for example you report such a transaction as either a gift irs form 709 if the transaction was at a price significantly lower than the fmv or significantly higher on the other end or a sale irs form 1040 schedule d if the transaction was at fmv

you 're not going to like this answer   you might be able to get out of the car you probably wo n't be able to get out of the loan   option 1 sell the car privately you 'll get more in a private sale and get a private loan for the difference between the sale price and what you owe   option 2 if you go to a dealership that advertises that they will take any trade no matter how much you owe they will roll your balance less your trade in value into your new loan so for example let 's say you buy a car for and borrow $ 20,000 the dealership gives you $ 6,000 for your trade because that 's what they do that leaves $ 9,000 on your loan and you will end up borrowing $ to buy a $ 20,000 car dealerships can be surprisingly accommodating but a lot of car buyers do n't understand the terms of what they 're getting into i actually knew someone a few years ago who left a dealership with a new car and could n't tell you anything about the deal beyond her monthly payment   option 3 hang on to the car and throw every extra penny at it to get the balance down on the loan until you can get it to the point where you can sell it trade it in or refi it without putting out a big one time cash payment

# 545800
the general answer to this is yes   when you 're dealing with single digit millionaires the answer is that their insurance habits and needs are basically the same as everyone else   when you get into the double digit and triple digit millionaires or people worth billions they have additional options but those basically boil down to using self insurance rather than paying a company for an insurance policy   the following is based on both what i 've read and a fair deal of personal experience working for or with various stripes of millionaire and even one billionaire addressing the types of insurance you mention this is generally used to provide survivors with a replacement for income you can no longer provide when dead in addition to paying for costs associated with dying funeral hospital bills etc   even millionaires and billionaires have this yes but the higher your net worth the less value it has   if you 're worth 9 or 10 figures you probably already have trust funds set up for your family members so an extra payout from an insurance policy is probably going to represent a small fraction of the wealth you 're leaving your survivors and as has been noted insurance makes a profit so the expectation by the insurance company is that they 'll make more money on the policy than they 'll have to pay out on death   that being said the members of the 9 + figure club i 've worked for all had multi million dollar life insurance policies on them which were paid for or heavily subsidized by the companies they owned or worked for   i doubt they would have held those policies if they had to pay the full cost but when it 's free or cheap why not absolutely   as health insurance in america is an untaxed employment benefit owing to regulations from world war ii all the wealthy folks i 've had contact with got outrageously good plans as part of the companies they work for or owned   having said that even their trust fund beneficiaries held health insurance because this type of insurance in america at least is actually not really insurance it 's more of a pre payment plan for medical expenses and as such it provides broader access to health care than you 'd get from simply having enough money to pay for whatever treatments you need   if you walk into a hospital as a millionaire and state that you 'll definitely be able to pay for your open heart surgery with cash you 'll get a very different response than if you walk in with your insurance card and your diamond level coverage   so in this case it 's not as much as about the monetary benefits although this is a type of insurance that 's generally free or heavily discounted to the individual so that 's a factor as it is about easier access to health care although this is required by law it 's one of the common forms of insurance that the very wealthy can and often do handle differently than the rest of us   most if not all us states have a provision to allow to self insure themselves which amount to putting up a bond to cover claims against them   basically you deposit the minimum amount the state determines is required for auto insurance with the responsible state organization get a certificate of self insurance and you 're good to go   all the high wealth individuals i know when this route for two reasons first of all they did n't have to deal with insurance companies or pay sky high rates on account of all the speeding tickets they picked up and secondly they made their deposit with government bonds they had in their portfolios anyway and they could still collect the interest on their self insurance deposits   of course this meant that if they wrecked or dinged up their or or whatever they 'd be out of pocket to repair or replace it but i guess if you can afford one $ 200,000 car you can afford to buy a second one if you wreck it or get by riding one of your other luxury automobiles instead since someone else mentioned insurance i 'll point out here that what robert did in casino when he put a couple million dollars into a safety deposit box for his wife to use if he was kidnapped or needed to pay off a government official is essentially the same thing as self insurance   putting money away somewhere for unexpected events in lieu of buying an insurance policy against them in real life the very wealthy will often do this with us treasuries government bonds and other interest bearing safe investments they make a little money diversify their portfolios and at the same time self insure against a potential big loss this is another insurance area where even the very wealthy are remarkably similar to the rest of us in that they all generally have it yes although the reason is a little different   for normal folks the home they own is generally the largest part of their net worth or at least a very substantial fraction for those older folks with retirement savings that exceed the value of their homes   so for us we have home owners insurance to prevent a catastrophic event from wiping out the lion 's share of our net worth if you 're an ultra wealthy individual who can afford an 8 figure home that 's not really the case at least with the ones i 've dealt with who made their fortunes in business and are good managing their wealth and diversifying their assets could be different for sports stars or the entertainment industry and these people generally own multiple homes anyway so it 's not as big a deal if they lose one however no one actually buys a multi million dollar home by writing a multi million dollar check   they get a mortgage just like the rest of us   and to get a mortgage insurance on the property is a requirement   so yes even the ultra wealthy generally have insurance on their   there is an element of not wanting to shell out another 20 million if the place burns down or someone breaks in and steals your valuables but the bigger part of the reason is that it 's required to get a mortgage in the first place which is generally done for financial reasons interest on your mortgage is a tax deduction and you do n't want to sink millions of dollars all at once into buying a property that 's not going to appreciate in value when you can get a mortgage and invest those millions of dollars to make more money instead

based on what you 've said i think buying a rental is risky for you it looks like you heard that renting a house is profitable and zillow supported that idea vague advice + a website designed for selling + large amounts of money = risky at the very least that does n't mean that rental property is super risky it just means that you have n't invested any time into learning the risks and how you can manage them once you learn that your risk reduces dramatically in general though i feel that rental property has a good risk reward ratio if you 're willing to put in the time and energy to learn the business then i 'd encourage you to buy property if you 're not willing to do that then rentals will always be a crap shoot one thing about investing in rental property is you have the ability to have more impact on your investment than you do dropping money in the stock market which is good and bad

in the end you your dad and your brother should come to an agreement so there 's no surprises or expectations but here 's my opinion if you can afford to make the additions now i would offer to pay fully for the addition with the understanding that the additional value that it generates is yours   that keeps everything in your name and should be fair since you pay for the expense and someday reap the benefit if you ca n't afford to make the additions now i see two options have your brother buy your father 's house giving you half of the proceeds and use those proceeds to make the addition as above or split the cost of the addition and have some sort of contract drawn up promising to reimburse him with the amount of the reimbursement very clear like xxx dollars plus accrued interest at y% annually as a condition to selling the house    one other part you did n't mention is any compensation you get for keeping your father at your house   what compensation if any you get is not as important as making sure that the three of you all agree on what is fair    in any case clear honest communication and full agreement is key there is a very real risk that when your father 's estate is settled that there will be disputes over what the agreement was and who it entitled to what   having everything in writing may sound cold but it keeps everyone on the same page

the details of credit score calculation tend to change periodically but the fundamentals are mostly consistent   pay your bills keep your average account age high overpay your credit card minimums and keep your overall debt low   and do soft pulls on your credit report to see what 's happening first the simplest route pay all your bills early or on time   automatic deduction may be useful in this regard especially for bills with predictable amounts   a corollary to this tip is to never leave an unpaid bill   what often happens to young people is in the course of moving around they leave the final bill unpaid and it gets reported to collections   make sure you follow up online with all bills even after canceling the service second average account age and oldest account age matter   open an account like a credit card and never close it so you 'll have an older account hopefully a zero fee card   try to keep other accounts open rather than closing them no need to cancel a zero fee credit card so your average account age stays higher   a card that works on internal systems like a gift card is not going to show up on a credit report a card that works like any visa mc is likely going to show up   the rule of thumb is if they need your ssn to run a credit check for the application then the card will appear on a credit report   you can pull your credit report to find out if the card is listed you may have to allow time for lag before the card appears but i 'm not sure how long that might be    third a tip for extra credit score is to pay more than the minimum required on credit card bills   you can achieve this by either using your credit card at least once a month or by leaving a small hanging balance each month so there 's always something to overpay next month   credit card reporting will be either unpaid underpaid minimum paid or overpaid   minimum payment helps your score and overpayment helps more   if you can use your credit card every month that will give you something to overpay every month   otherwise you can leave a small debt left on the card but still pay over the monthly minimum   however your total debt load especially debt carried on your cards counts against your score aim for less than 10 of your limit finally of course is to pull your credit report periodically   you need to know what others are seeing   since debt load utilization matters make sure the reported card maximum is correct on your credit report   talk to your bank or account issuer if the limit is wrong   if a collection appears then you need to handle it   often you can negotiate with the collector but be careful to negotiate how they will report the resolution   you want them to agree to remove any negative information either in exchange for payment or because of a mistake   failing that you want them to mark it paid in full or satisfied in full letting them your score that you only partially paid is what you want to avoid since it most signals someone with cash flow problems and credit issues   they control their reporting to credit bureaus so if the person on the phone ask to speak to their supervisor or someone with negotiating authority   try to get any agreements in writing remember that your total debt load is a factor in your credit score   home loans and student loans do affect credit score   if you take on a smaller home loan then it will affect your credit less harshly and leave you with smaller monthly payments

the key to this is budgeting without a budget you do n't know what you are spending your money on   let 's say you would like to go to a movie with a friend   can you afford it   without a budget it is difficult to answer this question   yes you have enough money in your wallet but if you do n't go to the movies you could be saving that money for a house   but you might say to yourself surely one movie with my friend wo n't prevent me from saving my $ 10k for my house   and you might be right but when you add up all the movies coffees and other discretionary spending up it very well could    at this point you might be discouraged   do i seriously need to give up every single to make this work   i do n't have that kind of willpower   luckily here is where budgeting comes to the rescue budgeting is simply a plan for your money   you have some monthly expenses that are more or less fixed your rent your utility bills etc   you have other expenses that are not exactly fixed but are still necessary groceries fuel for your car etc   you also have longer range expenses such as insurance premiums that you only pay once or twice a year but need to be accounted for   list all of these expenses and figure out how much that comes to each month   what you have left over is available to you for other things next you need to figure out how fast you want to save for this house and balance that with the other things you might want to spend money on such as entertainment   if you start from $ 0 and want to save $ 10k you could do it by saving $ 100 a month in a little over 8 years you 'll have your $ 10k   if you can increase this to $ 300 a month you 'll be there in less than 3 years now that you have a plan and everything is accounted for very little willpower is needed   you do n't need to feel guilty every time you buy coffee if the money is there in your coffee snacks budget go for it   if you 've got extra money for the month in your entertainment budget take a date to the movies   your budget allows you to spend on those things because you have a plan in place and are not in danger of spending your rent money or your home savings this can all be done on paper in excel or even by placing cash in different envelopes   however it is easier to use budgeting software such as ynab mvelopes or everydollar

the biggest problem with the company was that they had really good employees for a long time who were passionate about their jobs but they then made progressing through the company awful in certain regions for instance at one point if you wanted to become an assistant manager of your department you had to agree to a rotation within your metro stores for what was basically a two dollar raise you might start at a store two miles from your home and then end up 30 miles from home then six months later be 40 miles away so a lot of people who were intelligent looked at that and said yeah i can just stay here and make two dollars less i live down the street   but the worst part was their employees were able to make the shitty systems work most of the time so they were never viewed as shitty despite the fact that their employees routinely told them of their and how awful they were to use   then they laid off the several thousand people they used some very interesting calculations to come up with their 1500 person layoff figure a while back who were responsible for keeping the ship afloat and put all those duties on the backs of other people   disclosure i was out before the layoffs left of my own free will and still like the people i worked with i left because i looked at moving up and was like nope these people are morons

if your uncle is looking to maintain life insurance coverage for specific shorter period of time he may want to look into hybrid life insurance if you buy a hybrid universal life policy the premium and death benefit can be guaranteed to last until any age since most permanent policies focus on cash value accumulation it is hard for most people to find cheap whole life or affordable universal life consumers only looking for a longer duration have a more flexible choice with a new hybrid product that combines elements of both term life coverage and universal life hybrid universal   policies are much cheaper then other permanent coverage such as whole life coverage because they do not emphasize cash value accumulation however the premiums and death benefits can still be guaranteed to a specific age i.e. 85 90 95 100 so premiums can be scaled to coordinate with your desired budget and the face amount required for your family typical universal life and whole life insurance contracts only allow for lifetime coverage however hybrid universal life offers a much smaller premium because the coverage can be into a specific age if the does live beyond the originally selected age the death benefit will simply begin getting smaller while the original premium will   continue to remain the same

a roth ira is simply a tax sheltered account that you deposit funds into and then invest however you choose within the limits of the firm you deposit the funds with for example you could open a roth ira account with vanguard   you could then invest the $ 3000 by purchasing shares of voo which tracks the s&p 500 index and has a very low expense ratio 0.04 as of last time i checked   fidelity has a similar option or schwab or whatever brokerage firm you prefer iras are basically just normal investment accounts except they do n't owe taxes until you withdraw them and roth do n't even owe them then though you paid taxes on the funds you deposit   they have some limitations regarding options trading and such but if you 're a novice investor just looking to do basic investments you 'll not notice    then your ira would go up or down in value as the market went up or down in value you do have some restrictions on when you can withdraw the funds roth ira has fewer than a normal ira as you can withdraw the capital the amount you deposited without penalty but the profits can not be withdrawn until you 're retirement age i wo n't put an actual year as i suspect that actual year will change by the time you 're that old but think 60s the reason not to invest in an ira is if you plan on using the money in the near future even as an emergency fund   you should have some money that is not invested aggressively that is in something very safe and very accessible for your emergency fund and if you plan to buy a house or whatever with the funds do n't start an ira   but if this is truly money you want to save for retirement that 's the best place to start note this is not investment advice and you should do your own homework prior to making any investment   you can lose some or all of the value of your account while investing

yes you incur income tax on the rsu on they date they vest at this point you own the actual shares and you can decide to sell them or to hold them if you hold them for the required period and sell them later the difference between your price at vesting and the sales price would be taxed as long term capital gains caution if you decide to hold you are still liable to pay income tax in the year they vest you have to pay taxes on income that you have n't made yet this is fairly dangerous if the stock goes down you may lose a lot of this tax payment technically you could recover some of this through claiming capital losses but that this is severely restricted the irs makes it much easier to increase taxes through gains than reducing taxes through losses

in general investors with a long period of time until they would need to withdraw the cash are best off holding mostly equities   while the dividends that equities would return are less than the interest you would get in peer to peer lending over long periods of time not only do you get the dividends from equity investment but the value of the stock will grow faster than   interest on loans the higher returns from stocks however comes with more risk of big downturns   many people pull their investments out of stocks right after crashes which really hurts their long term returns   so in order to get the benefit of investing in stocks you need to be strong enough to continue to hold the stocks through the crash and into the recovery as for which stocks to invest in generally it is best to invest in low fee index funds etfs where you own a broad collection of stocks so that if when any one stock goes bust that your portfolio does not take much damage   try to own both international and domestic stocks to get good diversification   the consensus recommends adding just a little bit of reits and bonds to your investments but for someone at 25 it might not be worth it yet warren buffett had some good thoughts on index investing

believe it or not this is done as a service to you the reason for this has to do with a fundamental difference between a credit card account and a checking account   with a credit card account there is no money in the account every charge is borrowed money when you get to your credit limit your credit transactions will start getting declined but if the bank does for some reason let one get approved it 's not a big deal for anyone it just means that you owe a little more than your credit limit note that almost every credit card transaction today is an electronic transaction   a checking account however has real money in it when it is gone it is gone when a balance inquiry is done the bank has no way of knowing how many checks you 've written that have not been cashed yet it is a customer 's responsibility to know exactly how much money is available to spend   if you write more checks than you have money for in your account technically you have committed a crime unfortunately there are too many people now that are not taking the responsibility of calculating their own checking account balance seriously and bad checks are written all the time when a bank allows these transactions to be paid even though you do n't have enough money in your account they are preventing a crime from being committed by you the fee is a finance charge for loaning you the money but it is also there to encourage you not to spend more than you have   even if you use a debit card it is still tied to a checking account and the bank does n't know if you have written enough checks to overdraw your account or not it is still your responsibility to keep track of your own available balance   every time this happens to you thank the bank as you pay this fee and then commit to keeping your own running balance and always knowing how much you have left in your account

run your credit reports for the 3 major agencies to find out which of them have the debt was reported on and initiate the dispute process with each agency that reports the invalid debt this will cause the person who put it on the report to either prove that it is valid or remove it from your report ignoring debt collector calls is not a good option regardless of whether the debt is valid they obviously think the debt is yours so their response is naturally to put it on your credit report in most cases it is a good idea to respond in writing that it is not your debt i doubt you have much recourse against the creditor for one thing they did try to contact you and you dodged them that is not their fault secondly it is unlikely you would prevail unless you could prove that they maliciously put false information on your credit or through gross incompetence did so more likely is that they are you to a debt from someone with a similar name or there is an accounting error somewhere or possibly you owe the debt and no one ever sent you a bill it happens with medical bills all the time

you do n't prove a model incorrect that 's not how this type of statistical modeling works this is n't cognitive dissonance it 's understanding what statistics tells us    if i look at a model that takes a bunch of inputs from two football teams and the inputs tell me the expected numbers of yards etc over 1000 different simulations and gives me that over those 1000 different simulations that 750 of them is in favor of team a. when team b wins this does n't prove a model wrong in a one shot game it proves that one of those 750 times out of 1000 did n't occur    in this case it 's especially interesting because continuing with the analogy the was almost near correct popular vote just the areas of the field that came from slightly this election was essentially when one team out gains the other but loses due to the exact wrong play in the wrong area of the field    again you clearly do n't understand how this works or the definition of cognitive dissonance for that matter

  k mart and sears merged under the direction of eddie lampert   supposedly it was partially a giant middle finger to the board of directors at sears who had not allowed eddie lampert to make changes he wanted to make to sears   he used his investment firm 's assets to buy up a sizable chunk of k mart while chairman of sears then had k mart and sears merge giving him a more controlling stake of the corporation   it seems he has not been able to deliver on the promise of the two stores to compete better in the modern economy though as the two parts continue to struggle as made obvious by these closures

i know this question is old i also have a trading account there is no way to get the dividend report from the trading account the dividend is directly credited to your bank account by the companies through registrar there is no involvement of trading account in there so the best possible way will be to get the bank account statement for the financial year and filter out the dividend transactions manually i know it is tedious but there does n't seem to be any easy way out there for this few days back i started using portfolio manager provided by economic times it lists all the dividend earned in my stocks automatically

the sec reference document pdf explains order types in more detail a fill or kill order is neither a market order nor a limit order instead it 's something in between a market order asks to be filled at the best available price whatever that price might be when the order gets to the exchange   additionally if there are not enough counterparties to fill the order at the best available price then part of the order may be filled at a worse price   this all happens more or less immediately there 's no way to cancel it once it has been placed a limit order asks to be filled at a particular price and if no counterparties want to trade at that price right now then the order will just sit around all day waiting for someone to agree on the price it can be canceled at any time a fill or kill order asks to be filled at a particular price like a limit order but if that price or a better one is not currently available then the order is immediately canceled   it does not accept a worse price the way a market order does nor does it sit around waiting the way a limit order does   since the exchange computes whether to fill or kill the order as soon as it is arrives there 's also no way to cancel it like a market order

they have forever to collect a balance from you   furthermore they can add whatever penalties and fees they wish to increase that balance   worst of all they do n't have to remind you or send you bills or any other notification   you owed it when you left the office   there very well could be local laws that require notifications but that is n't really the issue here that dentist has every right to deny you service until you settle the account   forever the statute of limitations on collecting that debt via court which covers the rules on how long they have to collect the debt   owing the money is one thing but the rules and tools that you creditor has to collect the debt are another   you are probably worried about them suing you but if you do n't pay the debt or settle in some way that dentist can refuse to provide services to you even if they write off the debt ways you can be punished by your dentist for not paying the bill are depending on your jurisdiction and/or type of debt they typically only report it on your credit if they are reporting at all for 7 years   even if you pay and settle the account it will still be reported on your credit report for 7 years   the difference is how it is reported   they can report that is a super reliable person who always pays debts on time   they can say is a who pays but takes a while to pay   or they can say is a bad person to provide services before collecting money because do n't pay bills other people considering lending you money are going to read these opinions and decide accordingly if they want to deal with you or not and they can say that for 7 years   the idea of credit reporting is that you settle up as soon as possible and get your credit report to reflect the truth one popular way to collect a debt to is to sue you for it   there each state has a different time period on how long a creditor has to sue you for a debt if you pay part of the debt that will often reset the clock on the statute of limitations so be sure any partial or negotiated settlements state very clearly in writing that payment is considered payment in full on the debt   then you keep that record forever there are other interesting points in the fair debt collection practices act   see debt collectors calling know your rights   they can only contact you in certain ways they must respond to you in certain ways and they have limits on what they can say who they can say it to and when they can say it   there are protections from mean or vicious bill collectors but that does n't sound like who you are dealing with   i do n't know that the fdcpa is a tool you need to use in this case you should negotiate your debt and try your best to settle up   from your post both parties dropped the ball and both parties should give a little   you should pay no or minor late fees and the doctor should report your credit positively when you do so   if you both made honest mistakes they both parties should acknowledge that and be fair and not defensive this is not legal advice   but you owe the debt so you should settle up   i do n't think it is fair for you to not pay because they did n't mail you a paper   however i also do not think it is fair for the doctor to run up fees and not remind you of the bill finally you did n't bring up insurance or many other details   those details can change the answer

it depends   dividends and fees are usually unrelated if the etf holds a lot of stocks which pay significant dividends e.g. an s&p500 index fund these will probably cover the cost of the fees pretty readily if the etf holds a lot of stocks which do not pay significant dividends e.g. growth stocks there may not be any dividends though hopefully there will be capital appreciation some etfs do n't contain stocks at all but rather some other instruments e.g. commodity trust etfs which hold precious metals like gold and silver or daily leveraged etfs which hold options in those cases there will never be any dividends and depending on the performance of the market the capital appreciation may or may not cover the expenses of the fund either if you look up qqq 's financials you 'll find it most recently paid out a dividend at an annualized rate of its expense ratio is 0.20 so the dividends more than cover its expense ratio   you could also ask why would i care because unless you 're doing some pretty darned specific tax related modeling it does n't matter much whether the etf covers its expense ratio via dividends or whether it comes out of capital gains you should probably be more concerned with overall returns for qqq in the most recent year 8.50 which easily the dividends

i can think of a few good reasons a company especially public usually wants their fourth quarter earnings to be the strongest of the year that ends each fiscal year on a high note for the company and its investors which helps public sentiment and boosts stock prices so travel agencies and airlines usually like ending their year in october or march in the between the summer and winter travel seasons with a large amount of that revenue falling within the company 's fiscal q4 oil companies sometimes do the same because fuel prices are seasonal for much the same reasons december is a really bad month to try to close out an entire year 's accounting books accountants and execs are on vacation for large parts of the month most retail stores are flooded with revenue and then contra revenue as items are returned that takes time to account at the store level and then filter up to the corporate office etc etc it also does n't tell the whole story for most retail outfits december sales are usually inflated by purchases that are then returned in january after all the as a result a fiscal year end in january or even february keeps the entire season 's revenues and expenses in one fiscal year

gt the bpp 's inflation measure is markedly different from the government 's the economists average all the prices online meaning the basket of goods is whatever you can buy on the web some items like books are most often bought online others like cats are not plus the researchers do not weight certain items prices even if they tend to make up a larger proportion of household spending   see that last line is where the problem with this alternate independent system lies   it may not adjust the prices in the same manner as the cpi but it operates on an equally flawed assumption which at it 's fundamental root is still the same as the hedonic adjustment   the fact that dvd 's may have dropped from $ 20 to $ 5 each or that last years nearly obsolete model of a laptop computer tablet or cell phone has likewise dropped from $ 500 to $ 250 and in that sense just like the cpi excluding things like gas amp from the core inflation rate the bpp similarly creates a false picture of inflation as being just a crude aggregated average of price changes   the problem that the cpi or other indices include weighting and adjustments it is that the weighting and adjustments are biased and they have been altered many times over the past decades and the methodology being used is one that is biased to create a lower inflation rate one that a reduction in lifestyle quality of goods as being an acceptable change rather than a sign amp signal of the actual problem   thus far the bpp has tracked the cpi closely   yes it has extremely closely   so closely in fact that it belief

the question you should be asking yourself is this why am i putting money into a 401(k for many people the answer is to grow a large nest egg and save for future retirement expenses investors are balancing risk and potential reward so the asset categories you 're putting your 401(k contribution towards will be a reflection on how much risk you 're willing to take per a us news world report article ultimately investors would do well to remember one of the key tenants    of investing diversify the narrower you are with your investments    the greater your risk says vanguard 's diversification    does n't ensure against a loss but it does help lessen a significant    loss generally investing in your employer 's stock in your 401(k is considered very risk in fact one forbes recommends not putting any money into company stock finra notes simply stated if you put too many eggs in one basket you can expose yourself to significant risk in financial terms you are under diversified you have too much of    your holdings tied to a single investment your company 's stock    investing heavily in company stock may seem like a good thing when    your company and its stock are doing well but many companies    experience fluctuations in both operational performance and stock    price not only do you expose yourself to the risk that the stock    market as a whole could but you take on a lot of company    risk the risk that an individual firm your company will falter or    fail in simpler terms if you invest a large portion of your 401(k funds into company stock if your company runs into trouble you could lose both your job and your retirement investments for the other investment assets vehicles you should review a few things personally i prefer to keep my portfolio simple and just pick just a few options based on my own risk tolerance from your fund examples without knowing specifics about your financial situation and risk tolerance i would have created a portfolio that looks like this when i was in my 20 's i avoided the bond and income money market funds because the growth potential is too low for my investing horizon like some of the other answers have noted the target date funds invest in other funds and add some additional fee overhead which i 'm trying to avoid by investing primarily in index funds again your risk tolerance and personal preference might result in a completely different portfolio mix

different bonds and securitized mortgages are bonds that have similar average lives tend to have similar yields or at least trade at predictable yield spreads from one another so why does a 30 year mortgage not trade in lock step with 30-year treasuries first a little introduction mortgages are pooled together into bundles and securitized by the federal agencies fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae investors make assumptions about the prepayments expected for the mortgages in those pools as explained below those assumptions show that mortgages tend to have an average life similar to 10-year treasury notes   100 a so called average rate of prepayment means that the prepayment increases linearly from 0 to 6 over the first 30 months of the mortgage after the first 30 months mortgages are assumed to prepay at 6 per year this assumption comes from the fact that people are relatively unlikely to prepay their mortgage in the first 2 1/2 years of the mortgage 's life see the graph below   the faster the repayments the shorter the average life of the mortgage with 150 a mortgage has an average life of nine years on average your investment will be returned within 9 years some of it will be returned earlier and some of it later this return of interest and principal is shown in the graph below   the typical investor in a mortgage receives 100 of this investment back within approximately 10 years therefore mortgages trade in step with 10 year treasury notes average life is defined here the length of time the principal of a debt issue is expected to be    outstanding average life is an average period before a debt is repaid    through amortization or sinking fund payments to calculate the    average life multiply the date of each payment expressed as a    fraction of years or months by the percentage of total principal that    has been paid by that date summing the results and dividing by the    total issue size

p e is a useful tool for evaluating the price of a company but only in comparison to companies in similar industries especially for industries with well defined cash flows   for example if you compared consolidated edison nyse ed to hawaiian electric nyse he you 'll notice that he has a significantly higher pe all things being equal that means that he may be overpriced in comparison to ed as an investor you need to investigate further to determine whether that is true he is unique in that it is a utility that also operates a bank so you need to take that into account you need to think about what your goal is when you say that you are a conservative investor and look at the big picture not a magic number if conservative to you means capital preservation you need to ensure that you are in investments that are diversified and appropriate given the interest rate situation in 2011 that means your bonds holding need to be in short duration high quality securities equities should be weighted towards large cap with smaller holdings of international or commodity associated funds consider a target date or blended fund like one of the vanguard life strategy funds

i am sorry for your troubles   presumably you are feeling better which is the best possible outcome   you project that you are an honest person and desire to seek a fair outcome although you were mistreated   the insurance company should have paid a good portion of this bill because of this situation you will learn a valuable lesson   namely that collectors are scum   they lie and manipulate to do their job   they are trying to generate an emotional reaction out of you so you give in an put this bill on a credit card   do not fear them my advice would be to ignore them   you can educate yourself on collections law in your state   they can not call you at work and they probably can not call you on a cell phone   they will threaten to garnish your wages tax return and take away your birthday   just do n't talk to them when you can save up some money   once you have like $ 1200 attempt to settle in full for that amount   get it in writing ahead of time and do not give them access to your checking account   use a cashiers check or prepaid visa that you then throw away   if they say no do not argue hang up and call back when you have 1300   rinse wash repeat    there is a decent chance that they have already violated some form of collections law   if you have proof you can call the company 's legal department and provide that proof   you can then settle on having your collections waived   in summary this also presumes you have a household income   if you make like 70 k pay the bill   i doubt that is the case though

i disagree and thankfully so does basic economics if a business that is not successful shutters then the needs that that business was fulfilling will be provided by a new business the market usually finds a way   and no one is suggesting that random arbitrary minimum wage increases are wise simply that it makes no sense to have a minimum wage that does n't mandate a livable salary

the study of technical analysis is generally used sometimes successfully to time the markets there are many aspects to technical analysis but the simplest form is to look for and in the charts   generally higher highs and higher lows is considered an uptrend   and lower lows and lower highs is considered a downtrend   a trend follower would go with the trend for example see a dip to the trend line and buy on the rebound a simple strategy for this is shown in the chart below   i would be buying this stock when the price hits or gets very close to the trendline and then it bounces back above it i would then have sold this stock once it has broken through below the trendline this may also be an appropriate time if you were looking to short this stock other indicators could also be used in combination for additional confirmation of what is happening to the price another type of trader is called a bottom fisher a bottom fisher would wait until a break above the downtrend line second chart and buy after confirmation of a higher high and possibly a higher low as this could be the start of a new uptrend there are many more strategies dealing with the study of technical analysis and if you are interested you would need to find and learn about ones that suit your investment styles whether you prefer short term trading or longer term investing and your appetite for risk you can develop strategies using various indicators and then paper trade or backtest these strategies you can also manually backtest a strategy in most charting packages you can go back in time on the chart so that the right side of the chart shows a date in the past say one year ago or 10 years ago then you can click forward one day at a time or one week at a time if using weekly charts with your indicators on the chart you can do virtual trades to buy or sell whenever a signal is given as you move forward in time this way you may be able to check years of data in a day to see if your strategy works whatever you do you need to document your strategies in writing in a written trading or investment plan together with a risk management strategy you should always follow the rules in your written plan to avoid you making decisions based on emotions by backtesting or paper trading your strategies it will give you confidence that they will work over the long term   there is a lot of work involved at the start but once you have developed a documented strategy that has been thoroughly backtested it will take you minimal time to successfully manage your investments in my shorter term trading positions held from a couple of days to a few weeks i spend about half an hour per night to manage my trades and am up about 50 over the last 7 months for my longer term investing positions held from months to years i spend about an hour per week and have been averaging over 25 over the last 4 years technical analysis does work for those who have a documented plan have approached it in a systematic way and use risk management to protect their existing and future capital most people who say that is does n't work either have not used it themselves or have used it ad without putting in the initial time and work to develop a documented and systematic approach to their trading or investing

this is really two questions about yield and contents content as others have noted an annuity is a contractual obligation not a portfolio contained within an investment product per se the primary difference between whether an annuity is fixed or variable is what the issuer is guaranteeing and how much risk reward you are sharing in generally speaking the holdings of an issuer are influenced by the average duration of the payments however you can ascertain the assets that back that promise by looking at for example the holdings of a large insurance or securities firm that is why issuers are generally rated as to their financial strength and ability to meet their obligations a number of the market failures you mentioned were in part caused by the failure of these ratings to represent the true financial strength of the firm yield as to the second question of how they can offer a competitive rate there are at least several reasons i am assuming an immediate annuity 1 return of principal the 7 you are being quoted is the percent of your principal that will be returned to you each year not the rate of return being earned by the issuer if you invest $ 100 in the market personally and get a 5 return you have $ 105   however the annuity 's issuer is also returning part of your principal to you each year in your payment as they do n't return your principal when you eventually die because of this they can offer you more each year than they really make in the market what makes a ponzi scheme different is that they are also paying out your principal usually to others but lie to you by telling you it 's still in your account 2 the time value of money a promise to pay you $ 500 tomorrow costs less than $ 500 today a fixed annuity promises to pay you a certain amount of money each year this can be represented as a rate of return calculated based on how much you have to pay to get that annual payment but it is important to remember that the first payment will be worth substantially more in real purchasing power than the last payment you get the longer you live the less your fixed payment is worth in real terms due to inflation in short the rate of return has to be discounted for inflation it is not a real rate of return in other words if you give me $ 500 today and i promise to pay you $ 100 for the next 5 years i am making money not only because i can invest the money between now and then but also because $ 100 will be worth less five years from now than it is today with annuities if you want your payment to rise in step with inflation you have to pay more for that a lot more these are the two main reasons here are a few smaller ones 3 a very long time horizon if the stock market or another asset class is performing well poorly the issuer can often afford to wait much longer to buy or sell than an individual and can take better advantage of historical highs and lows over the long term 4 big boy investing a large financially sound issuer can afford to take risks that an individual can not such as in very large or illiquid assets such as a private company a la warren buffet 5 efficiencies of scale institutional investors have a number of legal advantages over individuals which i wo n't discuss in detail here however they exist large issuers are also often in related business insurance mutual funds such that they can deal in large volumes and form an internal clearinghouse i.e. if i want to buy facebook and you want to sell it they can just move the stock around without doing any trading with the result that their costs of trading are lower than those of an individual hope that helps

technically you owe self employment taxes not fica taxes because they are imposed under a different law however since se taxes are by design exactly the same rates as combining the two halves of fica employer and employee it is quite reasonable to treat them as equivalent se taxes and income tax also are based on your net self employment income after deducting business expenses but not non business items like your home mortgage dependent exemptions etc which factor only into income tax you owe se medicare tax 2.9 on all your se net income unless it is under $ 400 adjusted down by 7.65 to compensate for the fact that the employer half of fica is excluded from gross income before the employee half is computed you owe se social security tax 12.4 on your adjusted se net income unless and until the total income subject to i.e. your w-2 wages plus your adjusted se net income exceeds a cap that varies with inflation and is $ for 2017 otoh if income exceeds $ 200k single or $ 250k joint you owe additional medicare tax 0.9 on the excess if your w-2 income alone exceeds this limit your employer should withhold for it however the additional medicare tax is part of obamacare ppaca which the new president and republican have said they will repeal and replace whether any such replacement will affect this for ty 2017 is at best uncertain at this point yes se taxes are added to income tax on your 1040 with schedule se attached and schedule c e f as applicable to your business virtually so if you file electronically and paid together you are supposed to pay at least 90 during the year by having withholding increased on your w-2 job or by making quarterly estimated payments irs quarters are not exactly quarters but close or any combination but if this is your first year which you do n't say but someone who had gone through this before probably would n't ask you may get away with not paying during the year as normally required specifically if your w-2 withholding is not enough to cover your increased taxes for this year because of the additional income and se taxes but it is enough to cover your tax for the previous year and your agi that year was n't over $ 150k then there is a safe harbor and you wo n't owe any penalty although you must keep enough money on hand to pay the tax by april 15 but for your second year and onwards your previous year now includes se amounts and this does n't help similar related

i was in a very similar place 10 years ago i was in my mid 20 's with 45 k in combined school + personal business related debt and working in it for not very much i already had 10 15 k in debt when my college loans first came due and it was the first time i really had to come to terms with the hole i had dug myself and i spent weeks at a time obsessing over plans that would help me get out of debt it effected my health and my relationships i felt like i was never going to come out from under it my family was very much lower middle class k household income and i was n't going to get or expect any help there so i went to work and made it a point to make sure every personal and professional decision i made was conducive to my long term goals and before i knew it they became short term goals    find out what your basic monthly need is be brutally honest cut back on things like cable tv i still do n't have it reduce your phone plans borrow things when you do n't have to buy them and send that money to your debt pick up some hobbies that do n't cost much these are all minor sacrifices i got back in to playing the piano and spent a lot of time at the beach in the summer and up on books i 'd always meant to read in the winter    i ran a lot of numbers in a spreadsheet but you can play with the numbers with online loan calculators to put some real numbers behind your goals here is one that i just tried out   you 'll probably be surprised how much effect a little bit of extra towards a loan can make in the long term   put your current college loan details in to it and then see what the effect of an extra 150 a month is i know you 've implied that you really do n't have anything extra each month and that is fine figure out an amount that gets you moving towards your goals and then start working on a way to make it figuring out how to make or squeeze an extra n dollars out of your budget every 30 days is much less daunting than thinking about paying off 50k. you said you are working in it i do n't know where you live but in my city there are lots of decent it related jobs your first goal might need to be to find a better one     if possible move around balances until you 've got interest rates you can deal with and now that you have solid numbers to plan with consider the effect of making smaller goals would you feel as bad if you had half as much debt how about if you got rid of 10 k of debt or just your credit cards   i know i felt a huge relief when i cut my overall debt in half it felt like a huge part of my burden had lifted and it had i could start seeing the end of the tunnel     i think that one of the biggest changes in my life since then has been the way i look at and think about money and debt   i did n't really have to sacrifice much i learned to travel cheaply and whenever i met    a goal i 'd reward myself with a small trip today i have a very low mortgage payment and i pay my full credit balances each month so i have no revolving bad debt    i wish you luck and i know exactly where you are standing right now

hsbc exchange spread between hkd and usd was bps 1 bps is on their 24 hours exchange network a few weeks ago when i checked it is very high for a pair of linked currencies which has very little fluctuation one should expect less than 5 bps or even 1 bps i did my currency conversion at a us brokerage which can take hkd currency and then i was able to pick the time rate and amount i like to make the conversion basically the currency pair runs within a tight band and you just need to buy usd with hkd at the time when it is near the edge of the band to your advantage there is usually no fee on currency conversion they make money through the spread hsbc premier allows you to wire free among countries i forget whether they offer tighter spread or not   rob was right on about the cost of transferring money overseas the majority of the cost is in the conversion not the wiring

lets look at possible use cases if you ever converted your cryptocurrency to cash on a foreign exchange then yes you had to report that means if you ever and the us dollar or other fiat amount was $ 10,000 or greater when you went out of crypto then you need to report because the regulations stipulate you need to report over $ 10,000 at any point in the year if you did not convert your cryptocurrency to cash and only had them on an exchange 's servers perhaps traded for other cryptocurrency pairs then no this did not fall under the regulations example in 2013 i wanted to cash out of a cryptocurrency that did n't have a usd market in the united states but i did n't want to go to cash on a foreign exchange specifically for this reason amongst others so i sold my litecoin on btc e slovakia for bitcoin and then i sold the bitcoin on coinbase usa   even though btc e had a litecoin usd market and then i could day trade the swings easily to make more capital gains but i wanted cash in my bank account and did n't want the reporting overhead read the regulations yourself financial instruments that are reportable cash fiat securities futures and options also whether it is just in the blockchain or on a server irs and fincen said bitcoin is not reportable on fbar when they update their guidance it 'll be in the news the director of fincen is very active in cryptocurrency developments and guidance bitcoin has been around for six years it is n't that esoteric and the government is n't that confused on what it is irs and fincen 's hands are tied by congress in how to more realistically categorize cryptocurrency although at this point in time there are several very liquid exchanges within the united states such as the one nyse ice hosts coinbase

historically most economists considered a sustained negative interest rate impossible for just the reason you describe an investor could outperform a bond with a negative interest rate by simply hoarding cash for background see wikipedia by central banks in the wake of the 2007 financial crisis however demonstrates that slightly negative interest rates are possible first of all note that the zero lower bound on interest rates has everything to do with the existence of cash as an alternative it 's a lower bound on the nominal interest rate rather than the real interest rate that is on the rate before adjusting for inflation in most situations the real interest rate is more economically meaningful as it 's the real interest rate that measures the market 's preference for stuff now as opposed to stuff later there 's nothing in principle or in practice to stop a negative real interest rate there are always some people who want stuff now and some people who want stuff later a negative real interest rate just means that people who want stuff later are more dominant in the market as i stated earlier what creates the zero lower bound is the existence of cash as an alternative to bonds even though that lower bound applies it 's not strict hoarding cash in large quantities can be difficult and expensive especially when central banks are doing their best to prevent you from doing it consequently investors who strongly prefer stuff later to stuff now are willing to pay a slightly negative nominal interest rate on bonds in order to avoid those costs if it were significantly negative however you 're right that no sane investor would buy such a bond

you 're interpreting things correctly at least at a high level those numbers come from the 10q filing and investor summary from microsoft but are provided to nasdaq by investment research as noted on the main page you linked to   that 's a big investment data firm    i 'm not sure why they reported non gaap microsoft numbers and not say aapl numbers it 's possible they felt the non gaap numbers reflect things better or have in the past for some material reason or it 's possible they made a typo though the last three quarters at least all used non gaap numbers for msft   msft indicates that the difference in gaap and non gaap revenue is primarily deferred revenue from windows and i did confirm that the sec filing for msft does include the gaap number not the non gaap number as you 'd expect i will also note that it looks like the 10q is not the only source of information   look at for example they had in the march 2016 report period ending revenues of gaap non gaap   but the nasdaq page indicates for that quarter my suspicion is that the investment data firm 's does additional work and includes certain numbers they feel belong in the revenue stream but are not in the gaap numbers   perhaps ms and oracle have more of those such as deferred software revenues aapl has relatively little of that as most of their profit is hardware

i am not sure how anyone is answering this unless they know what the loan was for   for instance if it is for a house you can put a lien on the house   if it is for the car in most states you can take over ownership of it    point being is that you need to go after the asset    if there is no asset you need to go after you friend   again we need more specifics to determine the best course of action which could range from you suing and wages from your friend to going to small claims court   part of this process is also getting a hold of the lending institution   by letting them know what is going on they may be able to help you they are good at tracking people down for free also the lender may be able to give you options   for example if it is for a car a bank may help you clear this out if you get the car back plus penalty   if a car is not in the red on the loan and it is in good condition the bank turns a profit on the default   if they can recover it for free they will be willing to work with you   i worked in repo when younger and on more than a few occasions we had the cosigner helping   it went down like this co signer gets pissed like you and calls bank bank works out a plan and tells cosigner to default cosigner defaults banks gives cosigner rights to repo vehicle cosigner helps or actually vehicle bank gets car back bank car bank asks cosigner for x amount sometimes nothing but not usually cosigner pays x bank does not hit credit bank releases loan and sells car   i am writing this like it is easy but it really requires that asset is still in good condition that cosigner can get to the asset and that the friend still is around and trusts cosigner   i have seen more than a few promise to deliver and come up short and couple conspiring with the friend    i basically think most of the advice you have gotten so far is crap and you have n't provided enough info to give perfect advice   seeking a lawyer is a joke   going after a fleeing party could eat up 40 50 billable hours   it is n't like you are suing a business or something   the lawyer could cost as much as repaying the loan and most lawyers will act like it is a snap of their fingers until they have you dry just really advice for the most part i would suggest talking to the bank and defaulting but again need 100 of the details    the other part is cosigning the loan   why the hell would you cosign a loan for a friend   most parents wo n't cosign a loan for their own kids   and if you are cosigning a loan you write up a simple contract and make the non payment penalties extremely costly for your friend   i have seen simple contracts that include 30 interests rates that were upheld by courts

america is a really fucked up place when i was a small child we were told horror stories about the workers in japan they could n't take vacations because if they did they 'd find someone else in their job when they got back they had to work super long hours and spend 90 minutes commuting each way on a train packed tight with people   america has taken a leaf from japan 's 1970s playbook allow employers to give employees no paid vacation time at all and employment at will where an employer can march someone off the premises for any reason make workers do 60 hour weeks while paying them for a 40 hour salary reduce effective incomes by inflation over decades and smaller wage increases   americans have forgotten that you work to live you do n't live to

   for example says the report solvency could be achieved by raising taxes or reducing benefits for new recipients by about one fifth if we started today however if policy makers wait until payroll taxes would have to be increased by nearly one third and it would be impossible to achieve solvency solely from reducing benefits for new beneficiaries     social security was enacted in medicare was enacted in 1965 life expectancy at those times was 61 and 70 respectively today average life expectancy is 80    pushing the receipt age for these benefits makes the most sense and results in a two fold savings 1 benefits put into the system through additional payroll deduction and 2 benefits are not taken out of the system

according to hmrc 's manual you ca n't deduct expenses of this kind when calculating your profits for corporation tax no deduction is allowed for expenditure not incurred wholly and exclusively for trade purposes so at the least the company will have to pay corporation tax on this donation at some point assuming it ever makes any profits there 's also the risk that hmrc would say that what is really happening is that you are making a personal donation to this person and the company is giving you income to allow you to do it in that case you 'd be liable to income tax and employees national insurance and the company liable to employers national insurance it should then be deductible from corporation tax though

this is the bird 's eye view of how shorting works when you place an order to sell a stock short your broker attempts to grab the desired number of shares from any accounts of its other customers and makes them available for you to sell if no other customers own shares of this stock then generally you are out of luck it is more complicated like that in practice but this is just an overview     your odds are better if the particular stock has a large float i.e. a large number of shares that are actually available for trading and its short ratio is low which means relatively few shares    are currently being sold short also a large brokerage may be more likely to have access to the shares than a small niche market broker    the example you 've given 's list is a $ 600 m small cap with a comparatively low float and though i have n't been able to glean the short ratio it appears that a lot of investors are bearish on this stock and probably already had the same idea to short it   there is really no way to find out if a specific broker has shares in inventory available for shorting short of forgive the pun checking directly with the broker

i have a related issue since i have some income which is large enough to matter and hard to predict start with a best guess check what tax bracket you were in last year and withhold that percentage of the expected non withheld income adjust upward a bit if desired to reflect the fact that you 're getting paid more at the new job adjust again either up or down to reflect whether you were over withheld or under withheld last year whether the irs owed you a refund or you had to send a check with your return repeat that process next year after next tax season when you see how well your guess worked out you could try pre calculating the entire tax return based on your expected income and then divide any underpayment into per paycheck additional withholding but i do n't think it 's worth the effort i do n't worry about trying to get this exactly correct i do n't stress about lost interest if i 've over withheld a bit and as long as your withholding was reasonably close and you have the cash float available to send them a check for the rest when it comes due the irs generally does n't grumble if your withholding was a bit low   it would be really nice if the irs paid us interest on over withholding to mirror the fact that they charge us interest if we 're late in returning our forms oh well despite all the stories the irs really is fairly reasonable if you are n't deliberately trying to get away with something the process is annoying but should n't be scary the one time they mail audited me it was several thousand dollars in my favor i 'd forgotten to claim some investment losses and their computers noticed the error though i still say the motto of the next revolution will be no taxation without proper instructions

first you do n't state where you are and this is a rather global site   there are people from canada us and many other countries here so mutual funds that mean one thing to you may be a bit different for someone in a foreign country for one point   thanks for stating that point in a tag second mutual funds are merely a type of investment vehicle there is something to be said for what is in the fund which could be an investment company trust or a few other possibilities   within north america there are money market mutual funds bond mutual funds stock mutual funds mutual funds of other mutual funds and funds that are a combination of any and all of the former choices   thus something like a money market mutual fund would be low risk but quite likely low return as well   short term bond funds would bring up the risk a tick though this depends on how you handle the volatility of the fund 's nav changing   there is also something to be said for open end etf and closed end funds that are a few types to consider as well third taxes are something not even mentioned here which could impact which kinds of funds make sense as some funds may invest in instruments with favorable tax treatment aside from funds i 'd look at cds and treasuries would be my suggestion   with a rather short time frame stocks could be quite dangerous to my mind i 'd only suggest stocks if you are investing for at least 5 years   in 2 years there is a lot that can happen with stocks where if you look at history there was a record of stocks going down about 1 in every 4 years on average   something to consider is what kind of downside would you accept here   are you ok if what you save gets cut in half   this is what can happen with some growth funds in the short term which is what a 2 year time horizon looks like   if you do with a stock mutual fund it would be a gamble to my mind   do n't forget that if the fund goes down 10 and then comes up 10 you 're still down 1 since the down will take more

fwiw i 've got a printed invoice that was included in a shipment of books that i received in july 2013 in the right side side panel at the bottom and in fine print it reads   inc.    410 avenue    north seattle wa    gst registration number no tps    etc if i view the same order online at the on screen version does not have that detail   interestingly at the bottom of the online invoice page it says please note this is not a vat invoice that probably should 've said gst hst for canada and not vat which is presumably for the united kingdom   so it would appear that amazon may only print their gst hst details on the shipped invoice printout which made me wonder did you purchase something that was fulfilled electronically i.e. no physical shipment to you e.g. a kindle book an app or a service like cloud drive if no physical invoice shipped means one does n't get the required gst details then there 's still a canadian tax requirement amazon is n't fulfilling on such invoices though not as broad an issue as you suspected on the other hand if you did get a physical invoice and your comment confirmed you did then what you were seeking was most likely printed on that version just as mine was at the moment i 'm not sure why amazon would n't also include the gst number on electronic versions of invoices whether received by email or viewed on the web site but if i find out more i 'll update my answer later

the united states taxes gifts to the giver not the receiver   thus in your case there would be no direct tax implications from the receiver so long as you are gifting cash and the cash is in canada   if you are gifting capital stocks property etc or if you are gifting something that is in the united states us stock for example there may be a tax implication for either or both of you your adult child would however have to file an irs form since the gift is so large over $ 100k to create a paper trail for the money basically proving s he is n't money laundering or otherwise avoiding tax see this article in the globe and mail which goes into more detail there are no implications except that there is a form irs form 3520 that would have to be filed by the u.s. recipient if the foreign gift is over $ 100,000 u.s. but the child would still receive the gift tax free the u.s. gift tax would only apply when the canadian parent makes a gift of u.s. assets which are typically only u.s. real estate or tangible personal property such as a boat located in the u.s. for gift tax purposes u.s. shares are not considered to be u.s. assets

a typical manufacturer buys raw materials produces a product using labor and energy at a specific cost with some waste and then sells the product to produce income a bank buys raw materials deposits by paying interest then uses labor and energy to turn a portion of the raw materials into their product loans they then receive income interest on those loans if the income exceeds the cost to buy and produce the loans taking into account losses due to delinquencies waste the bank company has made a profit the growing profits can lead to an increase in stock prices or the paying of dividends the search for more raw materials can lead to paying more for the raw materials or by buying other factories branches or even other bank companies

look at their dividend history   the chart there is simply reporting the most recent dividend or a recent time period in any event   gf for example it 's had basically two significant dividends and a bunch of small dividends   past performance is not indicative of future returns and all that   it might never have a similar dividend again what you 're basically looking at with that chart is a list of recently well performing funds funds who had a good year   they obviously may or may not have such a good year next year you also have funds that are dividend heavy intended explicitly to return significant dividends   those may return large dividends but could still fall in value significantly   look at for example it 's currently trading near it 's low   you got a nice dividend but the price dropped quite a bit so you lost a chunk of that money   i do n't know if is a dividend heavy fund but it looks like it might be gf 's chart is also indicative of something interesting it fell off a cliff right after it gave its dividend at the end of the year   dropped $ 4   i think that 's because this is a mutual fund priced based on the nav of its holdings so it some of those holdings which dropped the share price and the nav of the fund by that amount   ie $ 18 a share $ 4 a share dividend so after that $ 14 a share   the rest of the dividends are from stock holdings which pay dividends themselves if i understand properly   has a similar drop in dec 2013   they may simply be trying to keep the price of the fund in the a share range i suspect but do n't know that some funds have in their charter a requirement to stay in a particular range and dividend excess value

that 's not very correct math it should be + household savings + business savings + imports + government surplus = 0 and then it seems like comparing oranges with apples   how can you compare savings spending and surplus of various instances   if it would be + income expense it would be more understandable then it 's just about money not about value   it 's possible to circulate a fixed amount of money around to various instances if those instances are doing valuable favors to each other while circulating money they generate wealth however it 's better to assign more money into the system to represent added value in the system price of money usually is something like total value in the system amount of money in the system if you just add money you ca n't add value

though mentioned it in a comment i would like to emphasize the point that the financial planner cfp you talked to said that he was a fiduciary   a fiduciary has an obligation to act in your best interests   according to when one person does agree to act for another in a fiduciary relationship the law forbids the fiduciary from acting in any manner adverse or contrary to the interests of the client or from acting for his own benefit in relation to the subject matter   so any of these stack exchange community members may or may not have your best interest at heart but the financial advisor you talked to is obligated to you have to decide for yourself is it worth 1 of your investment to have someone legally obligated to have your best financial interest in mind versus for example someone who might steer you to an overpriced insurance product in the guise of an investment just so they can make a buck off of you   or versus wandering the internet trying to make sense of conflicting advice   in my opinion a fiduciary registered cfp is probably the best person to answer your questions

the breakeven amount is n't at 8 years you calculated how many years of paying $ 500 it would take to break even with one year of paying $ 4000 8 x 10 years = 80 years so by paying $ 500/year it will take you 80 years to have spent the same amount $ 40000 total as you did in 10 years at this point it may seem obvious what the better choice is consider where you 'll be after 10 years in scenario 1 you 've spent $ 5000 $ 500 10 and have to continue spending $ 500/year indefinitely in scenario 2 you 've spent $ 40000 $ 4000 10 and do n't have to pay any more but you currently have $ $ 40000 $ 5000 less than you did in scenario 1 if you had stayed with scenario 1 you could invest that $ at a measly 1.43 annual return and cover the $ 500 payments indefinitely without ever dipping into your remaining $ most likely over the long term you 'll do better than 1.43 per year and come out far ahead

you will invest 1000 £ each month and the transaction fee is 10 £ per trade so buying a bunch of stocks each month would not be wise   if you buy 5 stocks then transaction costs will eat up 5 of your investment   so if you insist on taking this approach you should probably only buy one or two stocks a month it sounds like you 're interested in active investing would like a diversified portfolio so maybe the best approach for you is core satellite portfolio management   start by creating a well diversified portfolio core with index funds   once you have a solid core make some active investment decisions with the satellite portion of the portfolio   you can dollar cost average into the core and make active bets when the opportunity arises so you 're not killed by transaction fees

even though you will meet the physical presence test you can not claim the feie because your tax home will remain the us from the irs your tax home is the general area of your main place of business employment or post of duty regardless of where you maintain your family home your tax home is the place where you are permanently or indefinitely engaged to work as an employee or self employed individual having a tax home in a given location does not necessarily mean that the given location is your residence or domicile for tax purposes       you are not considered to have a tax home in a foreign country for any period in which your is in the united states however your is not necessarily in the united states while you are temporarily in the united states your is also not necessarily in the united states merely because you maintain a dwelling in the united states whether or not your spouse or dependents use the dwelling       the location of your tax home often depends on whether your assignment is temporary or indefinite if you are temporarily absent from your tax home in the united states on business you may be able to deduct your away from home expenses for travel meals and lodging but you would not qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion if your new work assignment is for an indefinite period your new place of employment becomes your tax home and you would not be able to deduct any of the related expenses that you have in the general area of this new work assignment if your new tax home is in a foreign country and you meet the other requirements your earnings may qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion    if you expect your employment away from home in a single location to last and it does last for 1 year or less it is temporary unless facts and circumstances indicate otherwise if you expect it to last for more than 1 year it is indefinite    if you expect your employment to last for 1 year or less but at some later date you expect it to last longer than 1 year it is temporary in the absence of facts and circumstances indicating otherwise until your expectation changes for guidance on how to determine your tax home refer to revenue ruling 93 86 your main place of business is in the us and this will not change because your business is n't relocating if you are intending to work remotely while you are abroad you should get educated on the relevant laws on where you are going most countries do n't take kindly to unauthorized work being performed by foreign visitors and yes even though you are n't generating income or involving anyone in their country the authorities still well may of your working my answer to a very similar question on

there is the price they want and the price you pay everything is negotiable when its a service always possible but usually harder with actual goods you should always haggle and price match your vendors you can also try going to different vendors and not telling them its for a wedding and see if there really is a price difference for example call up a florist and say you need x y and z for a corporate or for a special event for which you can not give the details if you then tell them its actually a wedding and they blindly raise it without a good justification move on that said they jack up the price because they know most people will says it 's my wedding it 's once in a lifetime it 's my special day etc the same is true about diamonds their price does not reflect the actual supply and demand ratio just the perception that has been created however as mentioned in some of the comments above the service provided at a wedding may be different or more involved than just a normal dinner the more important issue is ensuring there are no back fees no hidden fees and you have well written well reviewed contracts for example we know a couple whose added a mandatory 20 gratuity regardless of the service which was provided most venues or restaurants will not be making the bar a lose leader but they will charge for other things   you can also save money by buying used or looking on ebay for prices closer to wholesale for the product i think a good analogy to this is the recent time magazine article on the price of healthcare it costs a lot because its a small market and its harder to navigate and most are not experienced shoppers in the area or do n't have control over the individual item costs

the point about insurance is solidarity think about this in london a few hundred years ago people first started insuring their houses against fire there were several insurance companies and if you used one you got a marker on your house so if your house caught fire they would come and check and they would put the fire out only if it had their marker on it   now in most places these days the fire brigade will always come and always put your fire out we expect this and we are happy to pay for this service by taxation and we do not fret about wasted money if we pay it for decades without ever having a fire we also do not complain if the neighbour 's house burns and they get the full fire service which we have been paying for   now all the fire brigade do is rescue you and put your fire out here in germany every house owner is also obliged to have fire insurance so if your house burns it can be repaired or rebuilt everyone pays insurance premiums and i never heard anyone complain if they paid for 50 years and never claimed anything if you need a new house the payout is huge but the premiums are low this only works if everyone is insured this can only work if we all accept the concept of solidarity it is easy to say i do n't smoke so i do n't need to insure against fire or i live a healthy life so i do n't need to insure against cancer but lightning does not check your cv before it strikes it hits you or your fellow man and how can you justify not helping your neighbour insurance can only work if we all take part

if you were nri during the period you earned the income its tax free in india and you can bring it back anytime within 7 years there is a limit on total amount but its quite huge if you were not an nri during that period when you earned in us then whatever you have earned is taxable even in india it does not matter whether you keep the funds in us or bring it back to india you get the benefit of double tax and can deduct the tax already paid

but you are n't driving between your two jobs you 're driving for your job the better analogy would be if i did n't buy commercial insurance but was hiring myself out to do then my personal insurance better cover me if i hit someone between deliveries it does n't work that way there is a reason commercial insurance costs a lot more when your job is to drive your risk profile increases significantly there are specific clauses in personal insurance that they are n't going to cover you if something happens while you are using your car for commercial purposes

another factor that makes buy to let more expensive is the risk involved with a buy to let you are dependent on finding a tenant that will keep regular payments if the property is left empty you need to finance the mortgage yourself putting you under financial strain and raising risk also as mentioned they are regarded as a business enterprise if the mortgage was to be taken by a business that would be very high risk for a bank as the business could dissolve leaving the bank out of pocket because of this it can be very difficult to get a buy to let through a business unless you are moving from a personal portfolio for a regular mortgage these risks do n't exist so this is reflected in lower interest repayments it 's because of these differences in risk that banks created buy to let so they can better manage those risks

switching to only 401k or only spy   both bad ideas   read on you need multiple savings vehicles   401k roth ira emergency fund   you can should add others for long term savings goals and wealth building   though you could combine the non tax advantaged accounts and keep track of your minimum representing the emergency fund spy is etf version of spdr index mutual fund tracking the s&p 500 index   index funds buy weighted amounts of members of their index by an algorithm to ensure that the total holdings of the fund model the index that they track   they use market capitalization and share prices and other factors to automatically rebalance    individual investors do not directly affect the composition or makeup of the s&p500 at least not visibly   technically very large trades might have a visible effect on the index makeup but i suspect the size of the trade would be in the billions    an electronically traded fund is sold by the share and represents one equal share of the underlying fund as divided equally amongst all the shareholders   you put dollars into a fund you buy shares of an etf in the case of an index etf it allows you to buy a fractional share of the underlying index such as the s&p 500 for spy 10 spy shares represent one s&p basket   targeted retirement plan funds combine asset allocation into one fund   they are a one stop shop for a diversified allocation   beware the fees though   always beware the fees fidelity offers a huge assortment of plans   you should look into what is available for you after you decide how you will proceed   more later spy is a etf think of it as a share of stock   you can go to a bank broker or what have you and set up an account and buy shares of it   then you have x shares of spy which is the etf version of spdr which is an index mutual fund if the company is matching the first 10 of your income on a 1:1 basis that would be the best i 've heard of in the past two decades even with the 10 year vesting requirement   if this is them matching 1 dollar in 10 that you contribute to 401k it may be the worst i 've ever heard of especially with 10 year vesting   typical is 3 5 match 3 5 year vesting bottom line that match is free money   and the tax advantage should not be ignored even if there is no match research i applaud your interest   the investments you make now will have the greatest impact on your retirement    here 's a scenario   if you can figure out how to live on 50 of your take home pay 100k 0.90 0.5 12 salary with first 10 in 401k at roughly 60 after taxes social security medicare etc halved and divided by 12 for a monthly amount you 'll have a month to live on   since you 're 28 and single it 's far easier for you to do than someone who is 50 and married with kids   that leaves you with a month to max out 401k and roth and invest the rest in wealth building   after four or five years the amount your investments are earning will begin to be noticeable   after ten years or so they will eclipse your contributions   at that point you could theoretically live of the income   this works with any percentage rate and the higher your savings rate is the lower your cost of living amount is and the faster you 'll hit an investment income rate that matches your cost of living amount   at least that 's the early retirement concept    the key as far as i can tell is living frugally identifying and negating wasteful spending and getting the savings rate high without forcing yourself into cheap behavior   reading financial independence blog posts tells me that once they learn to live frugally they enjoy it    it 's a lot of work and planning but if you want to be financially independent you are definitely in a good position to consider it other notes

you are only 33 with plenty of time to generate long term returns a correction is an opportunity for you to buy more at a lower price my advice invest about half in an index fund s&p 500 for example and half in a target fund pick your retirement age keep saving regularly and in 30 years you 'll be very happy you did 5 10 k a month is fine until all of the money is invested you said this is a retirement account so invest the entire amount keep a rainy day fund in your non retirement savings you can fiddle around with how you invest the money and i 'm sure you 'll get variations on my answer my above suggestions may not be the absolute best option but they are certainly not the worst option given that you are very risk averse keep in mind that you are in this for the long term and should be investing in something where you can safely ignore short term downswings

a roth ira is intended for retirement before age 59.5 i think you can only withdraw the amount you deposited without penalty it 's great you 're saving in a roth but you should n't put savings in there that you will need before you reach sufficient age and since it 's long term you can invest in things you expect to grow over the long term like equities you should keep emergency funds either in federally insured extremely liquid accounts bank savings or money market funds which are n't insured but are close enough to zero risk yes the interest rates are terrible right now but anything else would potentially leave you with insufficient funds in the event of you know an emergency

the main reasons are that investment are deducted from your gross income and earnings are not taxed until withdrawal this applies to both traditional iras and 401ks roth accounts have different rules but valuable benefits my effective income tax rate is around 35 this means that for every $ 1000 i earn in wage i only get to keep $ 650 since my 401 k contributions are deferred reductions from my income i can invest 35 more money into my 401 k than i would be able to invest in a non tax advantaged account where i can invest $ 1000 into my 401 k i would only be able to invest $ 650 into a non advantaged account with the same wages if i put $ 650 into an account yielding 10 then my one year return on my income is $ 65 the 10 return on my $ 1000 is $ 100 compared to what i would have been able to take home in the first place this makes my roi $ = 15.3 interest earned in non advantaged accounts incurs taxes every year interest earned in advantaged accounts does not incur taxes until withdrawn compounding 10 annually for 20 years is significantly more than 6.5 compounded annually for 20 years imagine 10 on a 1000 investment with no additional cash flows over 20 year the result is $ or imagine your income tax rate does not reduce below 35 your after tax return is or return now imagine you pay taxes every year on 10 take so your take annually is only 6.5 now over 20 years you have $ but you 've already paid all taxes on this and your return is you have earned 24 more money because taxes were deferred until withdrawal edit some info for the commenters your take home from the investment is $ because you have paid your taxes every year on the earnings now with the tax deferred until withdrawal you then owe 35 tax on the withdrawal so you keep = $ $ versus $ means you have made an additional $ or 28 from the compounding against tax advantaged earnings but matthew you say annual proceeds from your investments are not taxed at your income tax rate this is true for now but the political winds are pushing this direction however even if you use a reduced rate in the first situation let 's say 30 instead of 35 if you 're a california resident then the effect is $ rather than $ less of a gain but still a gain in fact your capital gains rate would have to be as low as 22 to even this difference out versus a 35 income tax rate and remember that this assumes you 're in the same bracket at retirement which more people are not you may also note that i used $ 1000 as the principle in both calculations this was intentional to show the effects of compounding the taxable earnings alone if you replace the taxable principle with $ 650 instead of $ 1000 then the effect is even more pronounced and only balanced out if your capital gains rate is actually zero

i was wondering how future cash flows of the asset are predicted are they also predicted using fundamental and/or technical analysis there are a many ways to forecast the future cash flows of assets for example for companies it seems like calculating expected required rate using capm does not belong to either fundamental or technical analysis does it i would qualify the capm as quantitative analysis because it 's mathematics and statistics it 's not really fundamental since its does not relies on economical data except the prices and as for technical analysis the term is often used as a synonym for graphical analysis or but quantitative analysis can also be referred as technical analysis the present value of future cash flows called intrinsic price value if i am correct yes you are correct i wonder when deciding whether an asset is over fair under valued what kind of price is compared to what other kind of price if it 's only to compare with the price usually the net asset value which is the book value the discount cash flows the intrinsic value and the price of comparable companies and the capm are used in comparison to current market price of the asset that you are studying why is it in the quote to compare the first two kinds of prices instead of comparing the current real price on the markets to any of the other three kinds actually the last line of the quote says that the comparison is done on the observed price which is the market price the other prices ca n't really be observed but think that the part an asset is correctly priced when its estimated price is the same as the present value of future cash flows of the asset means that since the capm gives you an expected rate of return by using this rate to compute the present value of future cash flows of the asset you should have the same predicted price i wrote this post explaining some valuation strategies maybe you can find some more information by reading it

there are many ways to calculate the return and every way will give you a different results in terms of a percentage value one way to always get something meaningful count the cash you had 977 + 31 and in the end you have which means you have earned dollars but what is your return in terms of percentage one way to look at it is by pretending that it is a fund in which you invest 1 dollar what is the fund worth in the beginning and in the end the tricky part in your example is you injected new capital into the equation initially you invested 977 dollars which later in the second period became worth you then sold off 200 shares for 950 dollars remember your portfolio is still worth split between 950 in cash and 523 in shares so far so good still easy to calculate return 977 -1 = return now you buy share for dollars but you only had 950 in cash we now need to consider 2 scenarios either you or someone else injected 31 dollars into the fund or you actually had the 31 dollars in the fund to begin with if you already had the cash in the fund to begin with your initial investment is and not 977 977 in shares and 31 in cash in the end the value of the fund is which means your return is = 36 consider if the 31 dollars was paid in to the fund by someone other than you you will then need to recalculate how much you each own of the fund just before the injection the fund was worth 950 in cash and in stock 310 200 = 110 x = dollars then 31 dollars are injected bringing the value of the fund up to the ownership of the fund is split with = of the value for the old capital and 2.2 for the new capital if the value of the fund was to change from here you could calculate the return for each investor individually by applying their share of the funds value respective to their investment because the value of the fund has not changed since the last period bullet 3 the return on the original investment is 977 1 = and the return on the new capital is 31 31 = 0 if you and not someone else injected the 31 dollar into the fund you will need to calculate the weight of each share of capital in each period and get the average return for each period to get to a total return in this specific case you will still get return but it gets even more for each time you inject new capital

this very topic was the subject of a question on workplace se tl dr   from tax publication 521 moving expenses table regarding how to report if your form w-2 shows your entire reimbursement reported    as    wages in box 1          and you have moving expenses     then file form showing all allowable   expenses but do not    show any    reimbursements there are tax implications covered in tax publication 521 moving expenses and employers tax guide to fringe benefits related to moving expenses from the employers view moving expense reimbursements this exclusion applies to any amount you directly or indirectly give to an employee including services furnished in kind as payment for or reimbursement of moving expenses you must make the reimbursement under rules similar to those described in chapter 11 of publication 535 for reimbursement of expenses for travel meals and entertainment under accountable plans the exclusion applies only to reimbursement of moving expenses that the employee could deduct if he or she had paid or incurred them without reimbursement however it does not apply if the employee actually deducted the expenses in a previous year    deductible moving expenses    deductible moving expenses include only the reasonable expenses of moving household goods and personal effects from the former home to the new home and traveling including lodging from the former home to the new home deductible moving expenses do not include any expenses for meals and must meet both the distance test and the time test the distance test is met if the new job location is at least 50 miles farther from the employee 's old home than the old job location was the time test is met if the employee works at least 39 weeks during the first 12 months after arriving in the general area of the new job location for more information on deductible moving expenses see publication 521 moving expenses employee    for this exclusion treat the following individuals as employees a current employee a leased employee who has provided services to you on a substantially full time basis for at least a year if the services are performed under your primary direction or control exception for s corporation shareholders    do not treat a 2 shareholder of an s corporation as an employee of the corporation for this purpose a 2 shareholder is someone who directly or indirectly owns at any time during the year more than 2 of the corporation 's stock or stock with more than 2 of the voting power treat a 2 shareholder as you would a partner in a partnership for fringe benefit purposes but do not treat the benefit as a reduction in distributions to the 2 shareholder exclusion from wages    generally you can exclude qualifying moving expense reimbursement you provide to an employee from the employee 's wages if you paid the reimbursement directly to the employee report the amount in box 12 of form w-2 with the code p. do not report payments to a third party for the employee 's moving expenses or the value of moving services you provided in kind   from the employees view the not be included as income the expenses must be from an accountable plan accountable plans to be an accountable plan your employer 's reimbursement arrangement must require you to meet all three of the following rules your expenses must have a business connection that is you must have paid or incurred deductible expenses while performing services as an employee of your employer two examples of this are the reasonable expenses of moving your possessions from your former home to your new home and traveling from your former home to your new home you must adequately account to your employer for these expenses within a reasonable period of time you must return any excess reimbursement or allowance within a reasonable period of time also what is interesting is the table regarding how to report if your form w-2 shows your entire reimbursement reported    as    wages in box 1          and you have moving expenses     then file form showing all allowable   expenses but do not    show any    reimbursements

i get paid a 50 cents more at my second job than my day job and at the end of the week my take home pay from the latter is $ 20 higher that s a bullshit argument $ 5 per hour is a lot of money especially considering that a lot of people have been living paycheck to paycheck throughout obamas never ending recovery   what makes a 's hours $ 5 more valuable than a fedex employee by every measure fedex is a more productive and efficient entity than the us postal service so why is the worth more i 'll tell you exactly why   the fedex employee 's compensation is needs based fedex does a certain amount of business which requires a certain amount of labor which commands a certain price in the labor market fedex does not pay more for labor than it has to because fedex must be an efficient organization to meet its customers price expectations     the 's compensation is arbitrary set by government officials with no direct accountability to customers because they know jack shit about logistics congress has mandated that the postal service offer services to the public at uniform price and quality as such it has continuously failed to manage its budget properly to the tune of $ 5 to $ 10 billion dollar every year with a total mail volume that has declined 29 between 1998 and 2008   why does the postal service exist because it makes your congressman feel good and he 's more than willing to burn your money on the of his and false over the massive arbitrarily created vested interest postal employees have in losing their above average pay hack jobs than for any dedication you he has to the welfare of his constituents   if you want me to run down why i believe our government is not acting in our own personal best interests the postal service is the perfect place to start

in my opinion the average investor should not be buying individual stocks one reason why is that the average investor is not capable of reading financial statements and evaluating whether a stock is overpriced or underpriced as such they 're often tempted to make buy sell decisions based solely on the current value of a stock as compared to the price at which they bought it the real reasons to buy or sell a stock is the expectation of future growth of the company or continued profit and expected dividends if you are n't able to analyze a company 's financial statements and business plan then you really are n't in a position to evaluate that company 's stock price so instead of asking whether to sell based on a recent drop in stock price you should be investigating why the stock price is falling and deciding whether those reasons indicate a trend that you expect to continue   if you buy and sell stocks based solely on recent trends in the stock price you probably will end up buying stocks that have recently risen and selling stocks that have recently fallen in that case you are buying high and selling low which is a recipe for poor financial outcomes

you should plan 1 3 months for an emergency fund   saving 6 months of expenses is recommended by many but you have a lot of goals to accomplish and youth is impatient   early in your life you have a lot of building saving that you need to do you can find a good car for under $ 5000   it might take some effort and you might not get quite the car you want but if you save for 5 6 months you should have a decent car   my son is a college student and bought a sedan earlier this year for about $ 4000 onto the house thing   as you said at $ 11,000 expenses yearly plus about $ 10,000 saved you are making low 30 's   using a common rule of thumb of 25 for housing you really can not afford more than about $ 600 for housing you probably want to wait on that first house for awhile down payments really should be about 20 and depending upon the area of the country a modest house might be $ 120,000 or $   even on a $ 120,000 the 20 down payment would be $ 24,000 as you have student loans $ 20,000 you should put together a plan to pay them off perhaps allocating half your savings amount to paying down the student loans and half to saving as you are young you should have strong salary gains in the first few years and once you are closer to $ you might find the numbers working better for housing my worry is that you are spending $ 22,000 out of about $ for living expenses   that you are saving is great and you are putting aside a good amount   but you want to target saving 30 40 if you can

here 's what i 'd do   show these figures to your bank and ask if they can offer you some type of account with a small overdraft say up to $ 2000   typically this wo n't pay the same kind of interest as your savings account but it does n't matter if such an account is available then yes dump most of your savings into the student loan and keep a few hundred in your new account   the overdraft on this account is your emergency fund   this means that in the more likely scenario no emergencies you 're saving yourself 6 interest on something like $ 4000 to $ 4500   in the case of an emergency you 're still covered but you 'll be paying a larger amount of interest   let 's say you have an emergency cost and need to dip into the overdraft for $ 1000   if the interest is 15 then you 've cost yourself an extra 9 on that $ 1000 over leaving that debt in the student loan   this seems to me like a really good gamble more likely to gain 6 of $ 4000 less likely to lose 9 of $ 1000 if your bank wo n't give you a low interest account with a small overdraft then use your credit card as your emergency fund   the same kind of logic applies but since credit card interest rates are typically higher than overdraft interest rates you 'll want to keep slightly more in your savings account   about $ 1200 to $ 1500 feels right to me and move the remaining $ 3500 to $ 3800 to your student loan    so yes pay off the student loan   that 6 interest really is worth having even if you 'd be taking a small gamble edit alexander has suggested that i should compare this to matched retirement plans   the 100 gain in a matched retirement plan is n't 100 per annum it 's 100 divided across the length of time you have to wait until you can get your hands on that money   suppose the money is accessible when you turn 60 a matched plan is a good deal if you 're in your 50 's but not so good if you 're in your 20 's   the 100 matching is equivalent to 6 interest per annum compounded over slightly under 12 years    so if you 're less than 12 years away from retiring go for the matched plan   otherwise pay off your student loan first

that is mostly true in most situations when there are more buy orders than sell orders higher buy volume orders than sell volume orders the price will generally move upwards and vice versa when there are more sell orders than buy orders higher sell volume orders than buy volume orders the price will generally move downwards note that this does not always happen but usually it does you are also correct that for a trade to take place a buyer has to be matched with a seller or the buy volume matched with the sell volume but not all orders get executed as trades say there are 50 buy orders in the order book with a total volume of 100,000 shares and the highest buy order is currently at $ 10.00 on the other side there are only 10 sell orders in the order book with total volume of 10,000 shares and the lowest sell order is currently $ at the moment there wo n't be a trade unless a new buyer or seller enters the market to match the opposing side or an existing order gets amended upper or lower to match the opposing side with more demand than supply in the order books what will be the most likely direction that this stock moves in most likely the price will move upwards if a new buyer sees the price moving higher and then looks at the market depth they would most likely place an order closer to the lowest sell order than the current highest buy order say $ 10.01 to be first in line in case a market sell order is placed on the market as new buy orders enter the market it drives the price higher and higher until the buy orders dry up

you can play with the numbers all you like and that 's good however here is a different way to look at it   the debt you have is risk it limits your choices and eats your cash flow without the debt you can invest at a much greater rate it frees up you cash flow for all the things you might want to do or decide in the future you might want to do right now is the easiest time for you to focus on debt repayment it sounds like you are not married and have no children it is much easier now to cut back your lifestyle and concentrate on paying off this $ 50k of student debt this will get harder as your responsibility increases build up a small amount of cash for emergencies and put the rest at the debt you can keep contributing to your 401k to the match if you want this will give you 2 benefits patience when you actually do start investing you will have a new appreciation for the money you are using if you sacrifice to pay off $ 50k now you wo nt look at money the same for the rest of your life   drive if you see the debt as a barrier to achieving your goals you will work harder to get out of debt   these are all things i would tell my 23 year old self if i could go back in time   good luck

there are two primary reasons shares are sold short   1 to speculate that a stock 's price will decline and 2 to hedge some other related financial exposure the first is acknowledged by the question   the second reason may be done for taxes shorting against the box was once permitted for tax purposes for arbitrage positions such as merger arbitrage and situations when an outright sale of stock is not permitted such as owning restricted stock such as employer granted shares why would a shareholder lend the investor the shares the investor loaning his stock out to short sellers earns interest on those shares that the borrower pays   it is not unusual for the annualized cost of borrowing stock to be double digits when there is high demand for heavily shorted shares   this benefit is however not available to all investors

it appears the company you 're talking about did not report as you expected them to which is not unusual for otc companies because as stated they are not well managed that being said reports on edgar are available as soon as they 're posted   i 'm not aware of any lag between when the company uploads their report and it is available on the edgar site looking at the profile of the company you 're referring to i 'm curious why you 'd be so interested in a company with huge negative earnings a near zero share price and an obviously spotty history of reporting its numbers   in order to make any money with this stock you 'd have to buy a huge number of shares which could be difficult to unload   further the fees you 're going to pay to make your trades are very likely to outstrip your return so you 'd be upside down on it this company has pretty negative financials and in a world of cheap oil alternative energy and the companies that deal in it are out of vogue so they 're not likely to see a turnaround anytime soon   they 're spending money on r d at a rate almost 17 times earnings and the losses are while revenues are not improving all that much   these guys are bleeding to death and there 's little prospect of a financial on the horizon this is as they say a dog with so your best bet is to find something else to put your money into i hope this helps good luck

this question is very open ended but i 'll try to answer parts of it an employer can offer shares as part of a compensation package instead of paying cash the employer can use the money to buy up shares and give them to the employees this is done to keep employees for longer periods of time and the employer may also want to create more insider ownership for a number of reasons another possibility is issuance of secondary offerings that are partially given to employees secondary offerings often lower the price of the shares in the market and create an incentive for employees to stay until the stock price rises all of these conditions can be stipulated look up golden handcuffs usually stock gifts are only given to a few high level employees and as part of a bonus package it is very unusual to see a mature company regularly give away large amounts of stock as this is a frowned upon practice start ups often pay their employees with stock up until the company is acquired or goes public

to be able to truly short something you technically need to be able to borrow the security so you can sell it   there needs to be a system for borrowing in place to be able to do this which is very robust for large u.s. stocks but does n't exist for cdos mainly due to the complex legal structures around them    however the word short is commonly used in finance to mean profiting from a loss of value of something   so the use in the movie title though a bit confusing was fine credit default swaps are not technically insurance as you do n't need own the thing you are insuring and for a few other reasons   however i agree with the movie that thinking of them as insurance is a pretty good way to understand them   as you are playing a monthly premium to for a contract that pays out when something goes very wrong    however the movie was a little fast a loose as cds of various types were regularly traded well before the bubble even started   though maybe not that particular type of cds   so while they may have been expensive it was the easiest route and reasonable idea

it 's very simple the whole purpose of a credit card for the credit card company is that you borrow money and then pay them interest for the rest of your life the way you describe yourself you are the perfect victim so the obvious thing for you to do is to not touch credit cards with a pole   if you decide to use a credit card then what you should really really do is to pay back the maximum amount possible all the time best is to pay off the credit card in full if at all possible   consider this if you owe them money the interest rate is so high that with the minimum payment your debt will be growing all the time spend $ 1,000 pay $ 10 a month and next year you owe $ 1,100 without having used the credit card at all if you pay $ 32 a month as you mentioned your $ 1,000 purchase is actually a multi year loan if you need a multi year loan for a $ 1,000 purchase an ordinary loan from your bank will be much much cheaper

okay so   gt lifting the offer hit bids lift offers and i suppose that 's a albeit a somewhat simple one passive routing strategies differ from firm to firm and algo to algo what is your customer going to think if you bid up a new price level only for the stock to rally completely away from it   i mean if you have an open order for more than 10 times the amount currently offered with a limit above the offer and you have nt gotten filled on the bid what can you do but lift the offer and try to be first at the next price level up at least you would have gotten some at the price they quoted or are they fill or kill   gt bidding it up to attract sellers sounds an awful lot like spoofing just a heads up sure though if you want to tighten a spread or create new levels with aggressive passive liquidity that is a strategy the same caveats as i mentioned above apply   just to be clear aggressively adding passive liquidity is the more apt way to put it i 'm talking about when you actually want to get filled on those bids but you 're having trouble finding sellers   could you give me an example of what you might consider passive or aggressive just for scale would a mkt impact of .10 raise any how do you gauge fair value or does that matter less to you than just accumulating selling what you can for what you were asked to   gt anyway if market impact is n't an issue for the customer sure take liquidity until you 're filled do n't forget about getting good size done in the opening and closing auctions moc if you 're too passive you risk the market moving away from you and pissing off the customer if you 're too aggressive you risk moving the market too much and pissing off the customer   so then is the question more how motivated is the buyer or seller   i 'm glad you bring up the moc are there certain securities that do n't have much of a market in those auctions   trying to out how a large firm can hold a position in some of the less popular names with next to no liquidity and little in the way of dark pool auction block sales etc

gt;i think you mean 60 of all mortgages on homes in nevada are underwater not every home has a mortgage so it 's not 60 of the homes it 's 60 of the mortgages   spot on in the us typically somewhere around 30 to 40 of homes have no mortgage at all i.e. 100 equity by the owners   so if nevada follows the us average which it may not having a lot of new developments then 60 of would be somewhere between 36 to 42 of homes   that of course is still huge if even 10 of homes in a locale are distressed sales it is enough to drive prices down   but another caveat is that just because a place is underwater does not mean that it has a high negative equity point of fact is that any home bought with an ltv mortgage or a really low down payment i.e. 0 to 10 down payment is probably underwater from day one and remains pretty close to that for the first couple of years    why because typical realtor fees are around 6 and closing costs are easily another couple of percent add in that with a self amortizing loan that very little equity is built up in the first few years and any loss for aging and owner cash out equity can easily be near zero or negative   that 's one of the reasons you should n't buy unless you are planning on living somewhere for at least 5 years because it takes that long to recoup the realtor amp closing costs ergo the whole flipping is in and of itself a sign that a market is in a speculative bubble

here is my perception of the situation obtained from reading degiro 's client agreement if degiro shuts down it will notify you about the fact at least one month in advance and you will have enough time to order a transfer of your positions to a different broker if degiro shuts down unexpectedly your assets will remain to be held at spv a separate legal entity which degiro uses to hold the financial instruments belonging to the clients since spv does nothing else but holding the assets it is very unlikely that something bad will happen with it on its own with some help from degiro and/or the regulator you should be able to transfer your assets from spv to a different custodian and broker and thus regain control over them if you have a non custody account you have slightly higher chances of losing your assets because degiro can borrow your securities held at spv if both the client for whom degiro borrowed a security and degiro itself go bankrupt at the same time the lent security will not be returned to spv there will arise a shortage which will be proportionally distributed among the accounts of the clients holding this particular security however then the investor compensation scheme should kick in and help you recover up to 20000 eur of your losses

for a non technical investor meaning someone who does n't try to do all the various technical analysis things that theoretically point to specific investments or trends having a diverse portfolio and rebalancing it periodically will typically be the best solution for example i might have a long term growth portfolio that is 40 broad stock market fund 40 large industry specific market funds and 20 bond funds   if the market as a whole tanks then i might end up in a situation where my funds are invested 30 market 35 industry 35 bonds   okay sell those bonds which are presumably high and put that into the market which is presumably low   now back to    then when the market goes up we may end up at say in which case we sell some of the broad market fund and buy some bond funds back to   ultimately ending up always selling high whatever is currently the other two and buying low whatever is underperforming    having the industry specific fund(s means i can balance a bit between different sectors maybe the healthcare industry takes a beating for a while so that goes low and i can sell some of my tech industry fund and buy that    none of this depends on timing anything you can rebalance maybe twice a year not worrying about where the market is at that exact time and definitely not targeting a correction specifically   you just analyze your situation and adjust to make everything back in line with what you want this is n't guaranteed to succeed any more than any other strategy is of course and has some risk particularly if you rebalance in the middle of a major correction so you end up buying something that goes down more   but for long term investments it should be fairly sound

budgeting is a tool for planning not for execution it sounds like you do n't have a problem budgeting planning what to spend on what things but rather with the execution of your plan that is living frugally this is primarily an issue of self control and personal psychology not an issue with the mechanics of budgeting and finance which explains why the most popular personal finance gurus dave ramsey suze deal as much with your relationship to money and spending as they do with financial knowledge there is no easy answer here but you can learn to spend less one helpful thought is to realize that whatever your current income is someone in your community is currently making less than that and surviving what would you do differently if your real actual income was $ 100 or $ 200 less than it is currently if your food budget is a concern learn to cook cheaply often this is more healthy you mentioned schooling so i assume you are on or near a college campus many colleges have all sorts of free food opportunities i used to eat free vegetarian meals weekly at a temple price of admission listening to the monk read from the fast food is of course a complete no no on low budget living it probably goes without saying but just in case you have n't cancel cable get a cheap phone plan is excellent if available in your area and otherwise see how you can squeeze a few dollars out of your bills on the subject of frugality i have found no book more enlightening than money secrets of the amish finding true abundance in simplicity sharing and saving

i assume by that you mean gradually buying the same mix of funds over time   if that 's the case there is no rational reason to do this    dollar cost averaging is an artifact of the way most people fund their 401(k   i would not consider it a viable strategy   neither does wikipedia   let 's say you have $ 100,000 that you add $ 10,000 at a time   when you add money one of three things can happen since you ca n't predict the future there 's no mathematical justification for buying in segments   there 's just as much chance that your funds will be worth more or less so on average it should make little to no difference    in fact given the time value of money there is a slight   advantage to investing it all now so you can capture any future returns   you can always rebalance later to capture gains on some funds and purchase funds that are down to hopefully catch them on a rebound

perhaps there is no single formula that accounts for all the time intervals but there is a method to get formulas for each compound interest period you deposit money monthly but there is interest applied weekly let 's assume the month has 4 weeks   so you added x in the end of the first month when the new month starts you have x money in your account after one week you have x + money after the second week you have x + + and so on always taking the previous ammount of money and multiplying it by the interest b you have this gives you for the end of the second month   this looks complicated but it 's easy for computers call it that is it is a function that gives you the ammount of money you would obtain by the end of the second month do you see that the future money inputs are given with relation to the previous ones then we can do the following for notice the x is the end of the formula it 's the deposit of money in the end of the month i 'm assuming it 'll pass through the compound interest only in the first week of the next month   and then write   there is something in mathematics called recurrence relation in which we can use these two formulas to produce a simplified one for arbitrary b and n. doing it by hand would be a bit complicated but fortunately cases are able to do it easily i used mathematica commands and it gave me the following formula   all the work you actually have to do is to figure out what will be and then write the f(n for in terms of notice that i used the command in my code mathematica comes with algorithms for formulas so if it did n't find something simpler you probably wo n't find it by yourself if the code looks ugly it 's because of mathematica formatting in the software it looks like this   notice that i wrote the entire formula for but as it 's also a recurrence relation it can be written as   that is this should give you much simpler formulas to apply in this method

there are books on the subject of valuing stocks p e ratio has nothing directly to do with the value of a company it may be an indication that the stock is undervalued or overvalued but does not indicate the value itself the direct value of company is what it would fetch if it was liquidated for example if you bought a dry cleaner and sold all of the equipment and receivables how much would you get to value a living company you can treat it like a bond for example assume the company generates $ 1 million in profit every year and has a liquidation value of $ 2 million given the risk profile of the business let 's say we would like to make 8 on average per year then the value of the business is approximately $ + $ 2 = $ 14.5 million to us to someone who expects to make more or less the value might be different if the company has growth potential you can adjust this figure by estimating the estimated income at different percentage chances of growth and decline a growth curve so to speak the value is then the net area under this curve   of course if you do this for nyse and most nasdaq stocks you will find that they have a capitalization way over these amounts that is because they are being used as a store of wealth people are buying the stocks just as a way to store money not necessarily make a profit it 's kind of like buying land even though the land may never give you a penny of profit you know you can always sell it and get your money back because of this it is difficult to value high profile equities you are dealing with human psychology not pennies and dollars

for question 1 at least some us based online brokers do permit direct purchases of stocks on foreign exchanges depending on your circumstances this might be more cost effective than purchasing us listed adrs one such broker is interactive brokers which allows us citizens to directly purchase shares on many different foreign exchanges using their online platform including in france for france i believe their costs are currently 0.1 of the total trade value with a 4 € minimum i should warn you that the ib platform is not particularly user friendly since they market themselves to traders and the learning curve is steep although accounts are available to individual investors ib also wo n't automatically convert currencies for you so you also need to use their foreign exchange trading interface to acquire the foreign currency used to purchase a foreign stock which has and minuses on the plus side their f x spread is very competitive but the interface is shall we say not very intuitive i ca n't answer question 2 with specific regards to us france at least in the case of ib though i believe any dividends from a eur denominated stock would continue to accumulate in your account in euros until you decide to convert them to dollars or you could reinvest in eur if you so choose

as far as i know the answer to this is generally no   the closest thing would be to identify the stock transfer company representing the company that you want to hold and buy through them i have held this way but i do n't know if it 's available on all stocks   this eliminates the broker but there 's still a middle man in the transfer company note this section from the stock transfer agent wikipedia article a public company usually only one company to transfer its stock stock transfer agents also run annual meetings as inspector of elections proxy voting and special meetings of shareholders they are considered the official keeper of the corporate shareholder records the decision to have a single transfer company is a practical one ensuring that there is one entity responsible for recording this data hence even if you could buy stock directly from the company that you want to own it would likely still get routed through the transfer company for recording

there are actual cases where this has occurred in cases where the beneficiary was suspected of knowing that the insured person was alive they have faced fraud charges in cases where they appeared to act in good faith the legal consequences are less severe but the likelihood of the insurance company to sue for their money back will depend on the circumstances and the amount of the payout one interesting case was a woman who abandoned her family and did n't reappear until 11 years later the family did n't know where she was so they probably wo n't end up paying back the relatively small $ 100,000 that they received

gt;if you 're argument held true in court no one could sue anyone successfully   that is my point   admittedly my above example is very simplistic but it was designed to simply illustrate my point   and no buying a shares of google or exxon or whatever other equity would not make you lawsuit proof otherwise all you would need to do is open a brokerage account   i wo n't go into this on post but i would be happy to type out a few real examples they involved trusts holding llc 's and even suing yourself   this whole conversation started by the article about robert kiyosaki getting sued by his partners getting a judgement against him and instead of paying his former partner he bk 's one of his companies to get out of debt   rich dad 's estimated personal net worth   $ 80 sites dad poor dad bankrupt    how many books has he sold   just the rich dad poor dad book has sold over 26 million wiki and obviously that does n't count future sales he has many books dvd 's educational material seminars etc   rich dad is also very diversified and has other business interest such as mining companies oil and gas solar venture capital wiki   the above referenced forbes article goes on to say rich dad co. ceo has informed them that kiyosaki would not be putting any of his personal fortune toward the settlement as for rich global sullivan claimed it only had a few million in its coffers   so here is a case of a legitimate lawsuit it was heard in court and rich dad was ordered to pay $ 24 million to his former   he claims he ca n't pay it and files for corp bk yet his personal net worth is over 3x that amount not to mention the net worth of his new company not to mention future sales   thanks to some financial and legal gymnastics his partners get screwed out of their share of earnings   i fail to see how this is n't an example of abusing the system   rich dad is n't even offering to pay out on future sales or even trying to negotiate a lower settlement   he just pulled out the bk card and fu his debtors will get pennies on the dollar   it seems that our perspectives on ethical business practices are at opposite ends of the spectrum   in my opinion utilization of the bk laws in this manner which effectively makes one completely exempt from liability or financial responsibility is exactly what is wrong with the states at least one reason   if you ca n't or refuse to see this or you truly think this is just good business then i do n't know what else to say other than you are part of the problem     oh and i never addressed your other point gt;first you would be breaking the law for driving without insurance    no problem i 'd pay the + ticket and keep moving while you drink your meals through a straw

as far as i can recall savings and chequing accounts exist due to regulations on the banking industry that put were into effect after the depression to prevent a run on the bank    a chequing account is a demand account meaning you can go and demand your money and they have to pay immediately by means of a withdrawal or a cheque   banks used to get out of hand and loan out pretty much all the money they had on deposit and of course those people with loans just put the money they borrowed into another chequing account and the bank loaned that out to someone else   the money that people believed they had access to multiplied indefinitely   however when everyone goes to take that money out at the same time you have a run on the bank   therefore government regulations stipulate a that the bank must have on hand   the typical number is 5   that effectively limits the money multiplier to 19 times savings accounts get around this restriction by putting limits on how much and how quickly you can withdraw the amounts   they pay you more interest because the money in a savings account is worth more to them because it 's not subject to those restrictions some chequing accounts pay interest but you have to maintain a minimum balance   some savings accounts allow you to write cheques but i assume the withdrawal limitations probably still apply there 's also something to do with deposit insurance as in the chequing accounts are covered by government deposit insurance but savings accounts are not   i 'm not 100 certain of that though

already touched on this but generally speaking there is a tendency in this country to lump unions together and put the shortcomings of one local or one unit or one member onto all of them an example would be the issue of corruption many people cry about rampant corruption in unions when in fact only somewhere between 1 2 of locals have ever had any corruption charges whereas i 'd be willing to bet that the corruption rate is much higher in the corporate world   gt honestly i ca nt think of any reason for minimum wage paying jobs to have a union if you think the wages are too low for cost of living then the minimum wage should be raised these people have no special skills little to no training and usually no education   genuine question what reasons do you think someone would could have for joining a union why would base pay education skill level of the job be a consideration     just so we 're on the same page collective bargaining came about because workers in certain areas were pissed off enough that they realized that to improve their situation they had to come together as a group because only as a group did they have any leverage all workers have the right to collective bargaining rights which were signed into law because pissed off workers were doing it anyway and the regulation of the practice helped smooth it out and drastically cut down on violence and debilitating drops in production     it takes quite a feeling of injustice and exploitation when not friends not family but colleagues some of which may not even like each other start seeing that they share common problems and decide to tie the fate of their working lives to one another and give up like 1 2 of their paychecks especially in a country with an culture like the us    so if workers at certain wal feel like working conditions are that bad for them then i ca n't see why they should n't organize

the fsa in contrast to the hsa is not an account that you put money in   fsa stands for flexible spending arrangement not account   technically it is a defined benefit plan   here is the difference with an account such as an hsa you put money into the account and you get that same money out   you ca n't take money out unless you first put money in the fsa does n't work that way   instead you pick an annual amount that your fsa will cover and work out a monthly fee to pay for it   for example you might decide on a $ 1800 fsa which will cost you $ 150 per month   however the $ 150 you pay each month does not go into an account for you instead it goes to your employer who is managing the plan let 's say that in january at the beginning of the plan year you have a large medical expense of $ 1000   you 've only had $ 150 taken out of your paycheck so far this year but you are covered for $ 1800 so you get reimbursed the full $ 1000   this is referred to as uniform coverage meaning that you get the full $ 1800 of coverage on day 1 of the year now let 's say that you leave your job in march   you 've only paid $ 450 and you 've received $ 1000 in benefit   you do not owe your employer the rest of the money your employer eats this cost   this is the trade off that the fsa offers over other types of accounts depending on an employee 's circumstances an employer might make money use it or lose it or might lose money uniform coverage on an individual employee the idea behind the use it or lose it provision of the fsa is to help the employer pay for the uniform coverage provision the details behind the fsa and other types of health plans are outlined in irs publication 969 i 'm sure that a secondary reason behind the use it or lose it provision is that it encourages an employee to keep his fsa plan small so he can use it all up and not have to lose too much of it at the end of the year   and a smaller fsa contribution means more tax money for the government to address your point that it should n't be this way i 'm personally not a fan of the fsa because of the use it or lose it provision   but participation is voluntary for both employers and employees   you proposed an alternative set of rules for the fsa but you are basically describing an hsa in which you can not spend more than you have and you get to keep whatever is left over   the recent rules changes that allow plans to feature a grace period or a small carryover balance were an attempt to make the fsa a little more attractive useful but if you want the ability to keep your money and not have to spend it at all use an hsa instead

at the very least you should invest as much as you can that your employer will match as they are basically giving you free money for saving after that i would prioritize a roth ira as that offers similar tax benefits with more liquidity provided you have enough money available in your emergency fund and have plenty for everyday expenses i see no reason not to max out your 401k after that if you can afford it however if your emergency fund is lacking be sure to put some there other investments like a 529 may come into play if you have kids you plan on sending to college but it all depends on your situation

a distribution is typically a return of capital in other words you 're getting money back that you 've contributed previously and thus would have been taxed upon in previous years when those funds were first to you distributions are nontaxable so they do not represent income from capital gains but do effect your cost basis when determining the capital gain loss once that capital gain loss is realized as an example publicly traded real estate investment trusts reits generally distribute a return of capital back to shareholders throughout the year as a distribution this is a return of a portion of the shareholder 's original capital investment not a share of the reits profits so it is simply getting a portion of your original investment back and thus is not income being received i like to refer to it as new income to differentiate however the return of capital does change the cost basis of the original investment so if one were to then sell the shares of the reit in this example the basis of the original investment has to be adjusted by the distributions received over the course of ownership in other words the cost basis will be reduced when the shares are sold i 'm wondering if the op could give us some additional information about his her s corp what type of business is it in the course of its business and trade activity does it buy and sell securities stocks etc does it sell assets or business property does it own interests in other corporations or partnerships sales of those interests are one form of capital gain long term capital gains are taxed at rates lower than ordinary income but the irs has very specific rules as to what constitutes a capital gain loss i hate to answer a question with a question but we need a little more information before we can weigh in on whether you have actual capital gains or losses in the course of your s corporation trade

no that will not count as a short sale although it may still affect your chances of getting a loan because some lenders wo nt want to see it on your credit if you are pursuing a new fha loan in the best case scenario you will need an explanation letter of why you did this in the worst case scenario the lender will want you to wait to get financing   try and find a lender with no fha which means they do n't put additional restrictions on giving you an fha insured loan that type of lender will be your best choice because they just follow fha rules and do n't add any additional requirements

gold since the ancient time at least when it was founded has kept its value for example the french franc currency was considered valuable in the years but in lost its value however who owned gold back then still got value   the advantage of having gold is you can convert it to cash easily in the world it hedges against inflation it is value rise when inflation gold has no income no earnings its not like a stock or a bond its an alternative way to store value the disadvantages of investing in gold   gold does nt return income needs physical storage and insurance capital gains tax rates are higher on most gold investments the best way to invest gold when there is inflation is expected source

if it was me i would drop out you can achieve a better kind of plan when there is no match   for example fidelity has no fee accounts for iras and roths with thousands of investment choices   you can also setup automatic drafts so it what happens with your 401k.   not an employee of fidelity just a happy customer some companies pass the 401 k fees onto their employees and all have limited investment choices the only caveat is income   there are limits to the deductibility of iras and roth contributions if you make too much money   for roth 's the income is quite high so most people can still make those contributions   about 90 of households earn less than $ 184 k when roths start phasing out now about this 401 k company it looks like the labor department has jurisdiction over these kinds of plans and i would research on how to make a complaint   it would help if you and other employees have proof of the shenanigans   you might also consult a labor this might make a great class

this is almost certainly a scam or a mistake   this is not good spendable money it is not yours to keep very simple to handle   tell the bank in writing that you were not expecting to receive this money and are a bit surprised to receive it preferably in a way that creates a paper trail    and then stop talking   why   because you honestly do n't know    this puts you at arm 's length to the money it but not refusing it dreams nobody wants it back ever     as for the person bugging you for the cash tell them nothing except work with their own bank   then ignore them completely   he probably hacked someone else diverted their money into your account and he 's you into transferring it to a third location him   leaving you holding the bag when the reversals hit months later   he does nt want you reversing that would return the money to the rightful owner   he works this scam on dozens of people and he wins if some cooperate now here 's the hard part   wait   this is not drama or gossip you do not need to keep people updated   you are not a bank fraud officer who deals with the latest scams everyday you do n't know what the heck you are doing in this area of practice   in fact playing amateur will make you suspicious   there is nothing for you to do   that urge to do something is how scammers work on you and these things take time   not everyone banks in real time on smartphone apps of course scammers target those who 'd be slow to notice this game is all about velocity    eventually months one of two things is likely to happen    the transfer is found to be fraudulent and the bank reverses it and they slap you with penalties and/or the cops come   you refer them to the letter you sent explaining your surprise at receiving it   that letter is your get out of jail free card    the other person works with their bank and back the money   one day it just disappears   not that this is your problem but they 'd file a dispute with their bank their bank talks to your bank your bank finds your letter oh ok   if a year goes by and neither of these things happens you 're probably in the clear   do n't get greedy and try to manipulate circumstances so you are more likely to keep the money   scammers prey on this too   i think the above is your best shot

the japanese stock market offers a wide selection of popular etfs tracking the various indices and sub indices of the tokyo stock exchange   see this page from the japan exchange group site for a detailed listing of the etfs being offered on the tokyo exchange as you have suggested one would expect that japanese investors would be reluctant to track the local market indices because of the relatively poor performance of the japanese markets over the last couple of decades   however this does not appear to be the case   in fact there seems to be a heavy bias towards tokyo indices as measured by the nav market cap of listed etfs   the main tokyo indices the broad and the large cap nikkei dominate investor choice the big five etfs tracking the nikkei 225 have a total net asset value of yen usd while the big four etfs tracking the have a total net asset value of yen usd   compare this to the small net asset values of those tokyo listed etfs tracking the s&p500 or the euro stoxx 50   for example the largest s&p500 tracker is the asset management s&p500 etf with net asset value of just usd and almost zero liquidity   if i remember my stereotypes correctly it is the japanese housewife that controls the household budget and investment decisions and the japanese housewife is famously conservative and patriotic with their investment choices   japanese government bonds have yielded next to nothing for as long as i can remember yet they remain the first choice amongst   the 1.3 yield on a nikkei 225 etf looks positively generous by comparison and so will carry some

this is a bit is n't it in that we 're looking at something we 'd like to do namely win the big lottery but probably wo n't ever have this happen to us anyway ignoring the fact that this is kind of a hypothetical question got ta go with the straight dope on this one when deciding whether to take an annuity or a lump sum what assumed interest rate is underlying the calculations do you think you can earn significantly more than that rate on your own if so take the lump sum cash value if not go with the annuity what are your financial needs both immediate and over the next twenty years do you need a steady flow of income if you take the lump sum and invest it poorly or lose it how much will it hurt you if you give up your job to enjoy your wealth what will happen if you 're still alive when the annuity payments stop you do n't want to blow it all in a spree and then find yourself in poverty in your old age what happens if you die before the annuity has been fully paid as noted there 's the question of whether to ask in advance for an annuity the tax treatment alone could overwhelm any other considerations

its a smart thought to play out your own one of a kind research on which wooden ground surface the absolute best for you rather than just what others say to you you can make a rundown of the considerable number of shops in your general vicinity and gather however much insights about each of them as could reasonably be expected you can ask about the things they offer and their rates notwithstanding the administrations they give you can truly look at posts like news items or magazine short articles about such shops close you not only that anyway you can in like manner look at stories on these shops from different clients

shipping costs tariffs mexico and us have nafta so comes in cheap to the country and local and national taxes   is made in mexico and is a short truck ride across the border to be distributed to get to australia it goes much slower and can cause more of the product to go bad before it gets there hence the cost goes up   same with budweiser except it has even less distance to travel within the states   by the way the us also has heavy sin taxes on alcohol i 'd imagine both of these products are cheaper in mexico   also i assume you are not exchanging $ 1 aus = $ 1 us right

there are non financial costs to having a debt you need to remember to make monthly payments perhaps keep track of changing interest rates be aware of conditions of the debt archive the related paperwork life is simpler with fewer debts and that has value of course if the difference in interest rate is large then that is more important and the higher interest should be paid off first but if the difference is only half a percentage point or so you may decide that having fewer debts is in itself worth the bit of extra interest you pay

a guy i used to work with would buy some shares in certain companies on a regular basis   the guy in question chose coke pepsi ge disney and some other old stable stocks   he just kept buying a few shared $ 50 or so at a time year after year after year   he worked his entire life but by the time he was ready to retire he had a pretty sizable investment he was worth a rather tidy sum the moral of the story is it is very much worth it to invest a bit at a time   do n't bother with the idea of buying low and selling high not right now   just go ahead and buy stable stocks or shares of index funds and wait them out   this strategy mixed with other retirement tactics like a 401 k from work and ira of your own social security in the us is a good way to build wealth do n't spend money you do n't have be ready for a long term investment and i think it makes great sense regardless of what country you live in

in my experience they charge you coming and going for example if a brokerage firm is advertising that their commissions are only $ then that means you pay money to buy the stock plus $ 7 to them and later on if you want to sell that stock you must pay $ 7 to get out of the deal   so if you want to make any money on a stock say priced at $ 10 you would have to sell it at a price above $ that kind of sale could take a few years to turn a profit however with flat rate fees like that it is advantageous to buy in bulk

i agree with buying gold as this is truly the worldwide currency and will only increase in value if the euro fails the only issue will be if your country all citizen 's gold it has happened many times throughout history   as for etfs be careful because unless you purchase these in terms of other currencies i am assuming you are n't than the etf you own is still in terms of euros making the whole investment worthless if you are trying to avoid euro currency risk
