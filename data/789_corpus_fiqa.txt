you tagged with s corp so i assume that you have that tax status   under that situation you do n't get taxed on distributions regardless of what you call them   you get taxed on the portion of the net income that is attributable to you through the schedule k that the s corp should distribute to you when the s corp files its tax return   you get taxed on that income whether or not it 's distributed if you also work for the small business then you need to pay yourself a reasonable wage   the amount that you distribute can be one factor in determining   that does n't seem to be what you asked but it is something to consider

gm acquired the startup cruise automation to develop their for $ million it was money well spent   cruise was and is led by kyle who sold his first company twitch for a billion dollars to amazon in 2014 at age 29   so he 's already had his paypal payday and now as cruise ceo and the youngest gm vice president ever he 's doing what he really wants to do which is build self driving cars    and the cruise team have the full force of general motors behind them they basically have free rein to strip the company for parts i guess it should be noted that participated in the 2004 self driving car grand challenge as an mit junior it 's been his thing since he was a kid so watch out kyle is major league right now kyle belongs to gm but in 5 or 10 years gm will belong to him   autopilot 2 which is tesla 's better late than never autonomous driving system has yet to surpass the capabilities of the comparatively tiny   chip used in autopilot 1   musk claimed last october that would be able to drive coast to coast without intervention before the end of the year which is bs i honestly do n't know how they managed to get it so wrong    the autopilot division is now on it 's 4th director in a year all is not well the system is way magical thinking is n't going to make cars drive themselves you need high 3d maps giant fucking computers and it takes years to fully   validate these systems and train them to handle every conceivable edge case that can occur in real world cruise has been at it since 2013   so when you see gm execs acting and calling elon full of shit there 's a reason for it

the answer likely depends a bit on which state you are in but this should be true for most states   i do n't know anything about pennsylvania specifically unfortunately the affordable care act created the shop marketplace which allows small businesses to effectively form larger groups for group coverage purposes   shop stands for small business health options program and requires only one common law employee on payroll this would effectively allow you to offer group coverage without having a group   talk to your tax accountant for more details as this is still very new and not necessarily well understood there are some other options all of which i would highly suggest talking to a tax accountant about as well   health reimbursement accounts allow the employer to set aside pre tax funds for the employee to use for approved medical expenses they 're often managed by a benefits company say wageworks etc   that would allow your employee to potentially pick a higher deductible health plan which offers poorer coverage on the individual marketplace with after tax dollars and then supplement with your there are also the concept of employer payment plans where the employer reimburses the employee for their insurance premiums but those are not compatible with the aca for the most part although there seems to be a lot of disagreement as to whether it 's possible to have something effectively the same work see for example this page versus this for example

gt bernie   i could probably live with a percent increase also right now it falls under capital gains which is 15 for most people and i think slides up to 20 at the highest brackets i could live with a couple more percent points added onto it i am a civilian now and left the military with no retirement pension as an owner of a company i have to build my own retirement just like most civilians nowadays i am counting on some portion of that retirement to be funded by stock mutual fund dividends interest growth while i would alter my plans slightly if it went from 15 to 20 i would n't have to change my plans    gt you are right there does need to be an enforcement agency however i do not believe it has to be government   you are right it does n't have to be government call it whatever you want but guess what those people who have to deal with that enforcement agency are going to call it government or big brother or the cops or whatever the point being at the end of a day does n't it equate to the same thing how will this enforcement agency get paid are they going to sell tickets are they going to make a product or service outside of enforcement probably not otherwise they are going to gain a reputation for having a conflict of interest and always have the suspicion of corruption hanging over them so then we are back to some form of tax on the market in order to pay for enforcement and what do we call that ladies and gentlemen a government   gt kansas   you dug down into the specifics which i appreciate most people just go he did n't reduce taxes and spending enough and that is why it failed and that is why they are now raising taxes to pay for gaping deficits    okay so lets say you are correct about kansas lets do some apples to apples comparisons most people say okay lets compare texas and california our two biggest gdp states i am fine with that even though their gdp comes from very different sources ca is a technology state while tx is an oil state they both have a little bit of farming on top of that ca has one of the highest and strictest tax policies of any state in the union tx is known for being a business friendly state and a tax although they surely do n't have a zero tax policy not having an income tax is nice while they have one of the highest real estate taxes of any state    ca currently has a gdp growth rate of california brown are jobs california growing hell lot faster and has a job growth rate that exceeds the national average tx is has fallen below the national average on both aspects mostly because of the oversupply of oil on the global market and of course tx was one of the top states while oil was up but still was ca the point being is that their very different tax policies did not make or break their positions and many would argue that tax policy can help gdp when it builds stability and infrastructure while states like ks seem to show the opposite to be true    lets do another comparison and see if we can get even more apples to apples lets find a couple of states the sit right next to each other have very similar economies and demographics but very different views on taxes and infrastructure how about wi and mn ks and mi nh and me and or and id    conservative with very lenient tax policy an emphasis on freedom and reduced government wi ks me and id liberal states with emphasis on infrastructure and social services mn nh or mi    in all of the above examples the liberal states exceeded the conservative states in job growth and gdp growth this does n't mean the liberal state exceeded the national average in the ks mi and mn wi examples both states lagged the national average however in both examples the liberal state better    people could argue it is in spite of the increased taxes or they could try to find minute differences in the economies those states are pretty close and yet the liberal states exceeded the conservative states    this can be seen on a global scale as well it is

assuming that blocks dark liquidity and auctions are n't available one of the biggest things that equity traders also have going for them is the availability of different execution venues as well as the aforementioned ability to strategically time execution child order placement based on the state of the order book at any given time   a security with a nyse primary listing bac or ibm for example will be traded on several exchanges ecns nasdaq nyse arca the various bats exchanges and that in itself opens up a lot of opportunity to spread out an order   as an alternative to simply going through several price levels on a single exchange you can also route out multiple orders simultaneously to different exchanges to scoop up liquidity   all of that being said i think it should be noted that you really ca n't exclude the execution methods that you mentioned in your original question   any large institutional investor looking to trade in size will only get so far with trading on lit venues especially in the us equity marketplace   taking advantage of block liquidity or floating part or all of an order in a dark pool is a good way to mask intentions and minimize market impact   if you 're part of a beta index tracking strategy you actually need to leverage auctions index rebalances like the msci russell s&amp;p all have a ton of participants executing market on close orders to account for adds     overall the buy side is becoming increasingly sophisticated when it comes to advanced execution and it has been interesting to see how fintech companies brokers and exchanges have been feeding into the innovation

when the vc is asking what your pre money valuation is he 's asking what percentage of shares his $ 200,000 will buy if you say your company is worth $ 800 k then after he puts the money in it will be worth $ 1 m and he will own 20 of all shares you 'll still own the remainder so when the vc is asking for a valuation what he really wants to know is how much of your company he 's going to own after he funds you   determining your pre money valuation then is a question of negotiation how much money will you need how likely are you to require more money later and thus dilute the vc 's shares or give up more of your own shares how likely is your business to survive and how much money will it make if it does survive it is n't about the actual value of your business right now as much as it is how much work has gone into this and how successful can it be the value is going to be a bit higher than you expect because the work is already done and you can get to market faster than someone else who has n't started yet vcs are often looking for long shots they 'll invest in 10 companies and expect 7 to fail 2 to be barely profitable and the last one to make hilarious amounts of money a vc does n't necessarily want 51 of your company you 'll probably lose motivation if you 're not in charge but they 'll want as much as they can get otherwise

in general you most definitely can in some cases you must however for each state you 'll have to check whether you can choose how to depreciate many states require you to take the same depreciation as on the federal schedule including sec 179 others wo n't allow sec 179 at all specifically to pa i have n't found any current guidance but the rules from 2012 put pa in the bucket that requires you to take the same sec 179 on the state return as appears on your federal return if you elect to expense section 179 property for fit purposes you are    required to expense the property for pit purposes however pa limit for sec 179 is $ 25 k so if your federal deduction is larger you can depreciate the rest check with a pa licensed cpa or ea for a more reliable opinion since i 'm not a tax adviser just googled it

they are just now where you might expect them they ca n't bring it to major cities yet but there are some companies bringing fiber to rural areas they are doing this where the max dsl speeds are not fast enough to be considered broadband and there is no other alternative that qualifies there is a government grant program which gives them money to bring fiber or any broadband but there 's no reason to not run fiber if you 're going to the trouble if when these companies can become profitable enough to move into territories without the grant you will see google fiber competitors in my town they are basically circling the city with fiber to the home just by covering the grant areas and expect to bring it in the city where we have charter which is actually pretty good except for the upload speeds within two years charter has already been upping their offerings in the area and has even doubled the speed at no cost for people in areas that are being served by the new fiber or will be soon as there is some overlap    fiber is n't that far off for most people because from what i understand almost everyone lives with 2 miles of a fiber run if you have cell phone access as most all cell phone towers have fiber to them and the way it works is odd in that no normal isp owns the fiber it 's by other companies that have to sell access to whoever can pay for it this is just what i 've heard from some discussions with people about the fiber company here so i do n't know everything maybe someone else here has more information

if you can afford it there are very few reasons not to save for retirement the biggest reason i can think of is that simply you are saving in general the tax advantages of 401k and ira accounts help increase your wealth but the most important thing is to start saving at an early age in your career as you are doing and making sure to continue contributing throughout your life compound interest serves you well if you are really concerned that saving for retirement in your situation would equate to putting money away for no good reason you can do a couple of things save in a roth ira account which does not require minimum distributions when you get past a certain age additionally your contributions only that is not your interest earnings to a roth can be withdrawn tax and penalty free at any time while you are under the age of 59.5 and once you are older than that you can take distributions as however you need save by investing in a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds you wo n't get the tax advantages of a retirement account but you will still benefit from the time value of money the bonus here is that you can withdraw your money whenever you want without penalty both ira accounts and mutual fund brokerage accounts will give you a choice of many securities that you can invest in in comparison 401k plans below often have limited choices for you most people choose to use their company 's 401k plan for retirement savings in general you do not want to be in a position where you have to borrow from your 401k as such it 's not a great option for savings that you think you 'd need before you retire additionally 401k plans have minimum distributions so you will have to periodically take some money from the account when you are in retirement the biggest advantage of 401k plans is that often employers will match contributions to a certain extent which is basically free money for you in the end these are just some suggestions probably best to consult with a financial planner to hammer out all the details

you are entirely correct that it is an assumption so i will not argue the point any further other than to say that i do n't think it 's a very large stretch of the imagination to say that a more robust bitcoin economy and a larger user base would smooth it out the volatility it seems pretty reasonable to me that the instability in prices ca n't be accounted for from the technology that runs bitcoin and yet it is obvious that the current bitcoin economy is borderline abysmal it 's the things bitcoin allows you to do outside of financial institutions that give it a over typical government backed fiat currencies when we utilize this advantage real people will use the technology and a genuine economy could flourish    as a caveat to this i 'm not 100 convinced that bitcoins are the answer to me bitcoins are one particular brand of free as in speech decentralized crypto currencies when i speak of bitcoins i 'm promoting the idea it represents more than this particular implementation although i do believe the exact software you can download and run at this moment have the potential for tremendously more use than they 're currently being used for

no the above calculation does not hold good when financial statements are prepared they are prepared on a going concern basis i.e. a business will run normally in the foreseeable future valuation of assets and liabilities is done according to this principle when a bankruptcy takes places or a business closes down immediately the valuation method will change for assets the value will be more relevant for example if you hold 100 computers in an normal situation they will depreciated at the normal rate every year some portion of the cost is written off as depreciation when you actually go to sell these computers you are likely to realize much less than what is shown in the statement similarly for a building the actual value may be more for liabilities they tend to increase in such situation hence just a plain computation can give you a very broad idea but the actual figure may be different

i 'd say that because you are young even the riskier asset classes are not as risky as you think for example assuming conservatively that you only have 30 years to retirement investing in stocks index might be a good option in short term share prices are volatile and prone to bull and bear cycles but given enough time they have pretty much always outperformed any other asset classes the key is not to be desperate to withdraw when an index is at the bottom some cycles can be 20 years so when you need get nearer retirement you will need to diversify so that you can survive without selling low just make sure to pick an index tracker with low fees and you should be good to go a word of warning is of course past performance is no indication of a future one but if a diversified index tracker goes belly up for 20 + years we are talking global calamity in which case buy a shotgun and some canned food

there are two types of 529 programs   one where you put money aside each month the one offered by your state may give you a tax break on you deposits you can pick the one from any state if you like their options better during the next 18 years the focus the investment changes from risky to less risky to no risk this happens automatically the money can be used for tuition room board books fees the 2nd type of 529 is also offered by a state but it is geared for a big lump sum payment when the child is young this will cover full tuition and fees not room and board or books at a state school the deal is not as great if they child wants to go out of state or you move or they want to go to a private school you do n't lose everything but you will have to make up the shortfall at the last minute there are provisions for scholarship money if you kid goes to west point you have n't wasted the money in the 529 the money in either plan is ignored while calculating financial aid other options such as the coverdell education savings account also exist but they do n't have the options and state tax breaks accounts in the child 's name can impact the amount of financial aid offered plus they could decide to spend the money on a car the automatic investment shift for most of the state 529 plans does cover your question of how much risk to take there are also ways to transfer the money to other siblings if one decides not to go to college keep in mind that the funds do n't have to be spent as soon as they turn 18 they can wait a few years before enrolling in college

apart from investing in their own infrastructure profits can be spent purchasing other companies mergers and acquisitions investing in other securities and frankly whatever they please the idea here is that publicly traded companies have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders to make as much money as they can with the resources including cash but including so much more than that available to the company it happens that the majority of huge companies eventually stopped growing and figured out that they were n't good at making money outside their core discipline and started giving the money back through dividends but that norm has been eroded by tech companies that have figured out how to keep growing and driving up share prices even after they become giants shareholders will pressure management to issue dividends if share prices do n't keep going up but until the growth slows down most investors hang on and do n't rock the boat

suppose everybody stopped all economic activity right now no more work for others no payments no trade in kind or otherwise would average wealth stay the same of course not economic activity is not a zero sum game most of our economic activity is organized in the form of companies if the companies manage to make more profits by doing useful things more efficiently or when they find new useful things to do for profit then not only the company 's value grows but also the sum total of all useful things produced in the economy that means it 's not zero sum when stock prices go up that is often because the companies really have become more

volume and prices are affected together by how folks feel about the stock there is no direct relationship between them there are no simple analysis techniques that work   some would argue strongly that there are few complex analysis techniques that work either and that for anyone but full time professionals and there is n't clear evidence that the full time professionals do sufficiently better than index funds to justify their fees for most folks the best bet is to diversify using low overhead index funds and simply ride with the market rather than trying to beat it

guaranteed annual return sounds too good to be true am i    right are there likely high fees etc you 're right guaranteed annual return is impossible especially when you 're talking about investments for such a long period of time ponzi and madoff their investors using promises of guaranteed return see this note in wikipedia in some cases returns were allegedly determined before the account was even her financial advisor does n't charge by the hour he takes a    commission so there 's obviously some incentive to sell her things    even if she may not need them definitely not a good sign if the advisor gets a commission from the sale then he 's obviously not an advisor but a sales person the problem with this kind of investment is that it is very complex and it is very hard to track the commission to the broker makes it hard to evaluate returns you pay 10 upfront and it takes awhile to just get that money back before even getting any profits and since you 're only able to withdraw in 20 years or so there 's no real way to know if something wrong until you get there and discover that no money also many annuity funds if not all limit withdrawals to a long period i.e. you can not touch money for like 10 years from investment regardless of the tax issues the tax deferred investment can be rolled over to another tax deferred account but in this case you ca n't i suggest you getting your own financial advisor that will work for you to look over the details and talk to your mother if it is really a scam

the important piece here is not necessarily understanding intimate details of biological engineering per se but rather understanding how the business operates as a singular unit it is also important to understand the business case for a firm the evolution of demand for its products services and the cost of its revenue to understand a particular sector of the market you should begin by studying how that sector interacts with and is influenced by the larger market and economy as a whole both domestic and abroad from there you should study individual companies and again see how they interact with one another the sector market etc many biotech firms have a different offering and meet different business and consumer demands some are near term solutions to existing problems some long it is important to see how the firms collectively interact with the consumer base and then differentiate on an individual level

congrats to your gf   how much depends a lot on how stable her income tends to be if she has stable salary $ 20 k plus $ k in contract work then having a larger ef is important if she has a consistent track record of pulling in $ 35 k each year with contract work then she may still need a somewhat higher emergency fund to tide her over between gigs   the rule of thumb is at least 3 months expenses before you start investing for better returns if she is reliant on contract work then holding up to 6 months expenses could be wise just in case she hits a slow patch with work   after that emergency fund is covered she can look at investment opportunities with varying levels of risk return   i would also recommend putting it down in writing why she 's investing saving is she saving up for an awesome vacation maybe that 's why she really is so far above a normal ef does she want a new car maybe there 's not really so much to spare bottom line assuming her monthly expenses are around $ 2 k per month she might have $ 4,000 to $ 5,000 that she could look to start investing safely

never trust a single source to give you a fair price especially if they are not in competition moreso if they know that 's the case   i would want to get a quote from at least one other broker in terms of what they feel they can sell the bonds for   and let them know they are not the only one you are getting a quote from   to start with you need information such as when is the last time a bond like the ones you have traded and what did it sell for also sources for where you can sell the bonds and more info on the entire subject the securities industry and financial markets association has a pretty helpful website called   i find it has a wealth of information and is relatively free of bias on the municipal markets at a glance page you can get history for various bonds if you have the pronounced que sip numbers for the bonds if these bonds are as good as the advisor is telling you they are then they should be selling for a premium and the recent sales history would reflect that   i 'd find one or two other potential sellers and get prices from each of them compare that against recent history and go with whichever one seems to be offering you the best deal in terms of choosing someone and how to go about selling bonds the same website has some excellent information and guidance on buying and selling bonds and how to choose an investment professional which includes how to check up on them to see if they have ever faced action etc   i would also consider any gains you might have to declare if you sell these for more than face value and if that would be taxable etc i would also question your too safe judgement   just because something is safe i would not necessarily throw it out   you need to look at the return relative to the risk and if you are not investing in a tax sheltered account the affect of taxes on your net return   if these are earning a really good return for fairly low risk they might be worth keeping especially if in today 's market you need to take substantially more risk to get a comparable return   taking more risk to get nearly the same return is n't very wise since an aspect of the risk is perhaps not getting any return or losing money    in a volatile market there can be a substantial benefit to having a lower risk foundation that you build upon with more risky investments in order to provide some risk diversity in your portfolio you might want to consider for example how these bonds have done over the last 13 years compared to a similar investment in the type of less safe vehicles you are considering   perhaps you 'd be better off just holding these to maturity instead of gambling on something with a lot more risk that could go south on you

i should think the primary reason is due why those countries have a higher standard of salary its not what you get but what it buys you in a high salary low exchange rate country like sweden you get a lot of services that your taxes buy you healthcare and quality of life in a stable country is something you want when you get old note that your viewpoint might be very different when you 're a kid moving to a country that has less impact on your finances is often because that country has significantly fewer services to offer so a swedish citizen might think about moving to a 3rd world country and find that their retirement income is n't sufficient to pay for the kind of lifestyle they actually want such countries tend to be pleasant to live in only if you are exceptionally wealthy   now this kind of thing does happen but only within reason there are a number of old people who retire to the coast in the uk at least and many people who used to work in london who retire to the south west for them the idea of moving does n't seem so bad as they are moving to areas where many other people in their situation have also moved see florida for an example for us citizens too

it sounds for the most part you are a buy and hold type investor and continue to contribute monthly   i follow the same philosophy and continue to contribute monthly as well   i use as my online broker for trading it costs a penny per share with a minimum cost of $ 4.95 so if you only buy 100 shares you will still pay $ 4.95 up to a maximum of $ per trade so if you buy 10,000 shares you only pay $ three trades at $ 4.95 per month across the year would be $   this is assuming you are trading less then share each trade   so switching to questrade would save you an additional $ per year   multiply over number of year before you retire plus compound interest which could accrue and that can quite a bit of extra savings you pay nothing else to questrade either   no management fees etc   you manage the accounts

loans are not taxable events the equity you took out is not income it 's a loan and you pay it back with interest you pay taxes on the capital gain of the home when you sell it the tax does not take into account any mortgages helocs or other loans secured by the house instead the tax is calculated based on the price you sold it for minus the price you bought it for which is known as the capital gain you can exclude $ 250k of that gain for a single person $ 500k for a married couple there are a few other as well that would be true regardless of the loan balance at the time

one reason a company might choose to pay a dividend is because of the desire of influential stockholders to receive the dividend    in the case of ford for example there are 70 million shares of class b stock which receive the same dividend per share as do the common stock holders   even though there are 3.8 billion shares of common stock the class b owners which are ford family hold 40 of the voting power and so their desires are given much weight    the class b owners prefer regular dividends because if enough were to sell their class b shares all class b shares as a block would have their voting power drop from 40 to 30 and with further sales all special voting would be lost and each class b share would be equivalent to a common share in voting power hence the class b owners both for themselves and for all of the family members holding class b avoid selling shares and prefer receiving dividends

capital losses do mirror capital gains within their holding periods an asset or investment this is certainly held for a year into the day or less and sold at a loss will create a short term capital loss a sale of any asset held for over a year to your day and sold at a loss will create a loss that is long term when capital gains and losses are reported from the tax return the taxpayer must first categorize all gains and losses between long and short term and then aggregate the sum total amounts for every single regarding the four categories then the gains that are long term losses are netted against each other therefore the same is done for short term gains and losses then your net gain that is long term loss is netted against the net short term gain or loss this final net number is then reported on form 1040 example frank has the following gains and losses from his stock trading for the year short term gains $ 6,000 long term gains $ 4,000 short term losses $ 2,000 long term losses $ 5,000 net short term gain loss $ 4,000 st gain $ 6,000 st gain $ 2,000 st loss net long term gain loss $ 1,000 lt loss $ 4,000 lt gain $ 5,000 lt loss final net gain loss $ 3,000 short term gain $ 4,000 st gain $ 1,000 lt loss    again frank can only deduct $ 3,000 of final net short- or long term losses against other types of income for that year and must carry forward any remaining balance

historically most economists considered a sustained negative interest rate impossible for just the reason you describe an investor could outperform a bond with a negative interest rate by simply hoarding cash for background see wikipedia by central banks in the wake of the 2007 financial crisis however demonstrates that slightly negative interest rates are possible first of all note that the zero lower bound on interest rates has everything to do with the existence of cash as an alternative it 's a lower bound on the nominal interest rate rather than the real interest rate that is on the rate before adjusting for inflation in most situations the real interest rate is more economically meaningful as it 's the real interest rate that measures the market 's preference for stuff now as opposed to stuff later there 's nothing in principle or in practice to stop a negative real interest rate there are always some people who want stuff now and some people who want stuff later a negative real interest rate just means that people who want stuff later are more dominant in the market as i stated earlier what creates the zero lower bound is the existence of cash as an alternative to bonds even though that lower bound applies it 's not strict hoarding cash in large quantities can be difficult and expensive especially when central banks are doing their best to prevent you from doing it consequently investors who strongly prefer stuff later to stuff now are willing to pay a slightly negative nominal interest rate on bonds in order to avoid those costs if it were significantly negative however you 're right that no sane investor would buy such a bond

the are a couple of explanations that i can think of though for determining exactly what is different you will want to print out both returns and compare them line by line to see how they differ if the company up your income to account for the taxes on housing possibly by paying the additional withholding you may be just benefiting from them estimating your tax rate this can especially be the case if your only work was the three month internship they would have to assume your salary was for the entire year there is an earned income tax credit for low wage earners that you may have qualified for it would depend your specific circumstances if you meet the criteria but that credit for a range of income actually pays out more the more you earn to encourage working that extra hour instead of reducing benefit because you had another hour of employment as for the housing subsidy itself while the value is quite high the irs considers that to be a taxable benefit that the employer provided you and so it needs to be added to your w-2 wages $ 8k a month seems quite high but i do n't know the quality of the apartment you were provided and what the going rates are in the area given that you said you worked for a major tech company i can imagine that you might have been working in an area with high rents if the employer did gross up your paycheck so as to cover your taxes that $ 24k would also include that extra tax payment e.g. if the employer paid $ 8k in additional taxes for you then the housing cost that they directly paid were $ 16k

i worked in the service industry for over 10 years and this came up every now and again   mostly in hypothetical situations    i 'm not a tax expert but my general understanding is that it is viewed as income by the irs if you performed a service of any kind in exchange for the money   in other words if you waited on the table and they left you a gift for doing so it is taxable    you 'll probably also find that if you pool tips with other employees or have to tip out the bartenders cooks or dishwashers they 'll generally agree with the irs that you clearly received a tip and want their fair share while the concept of gifting money to others in a situation like this is intriguing especially in the service industry it really does n't meet the definition of a gift in the eyes of the irs for it to truly be a gift the person would have had to intend to gift you the money even if they had n't come into your restaurant at all that night   that clearly is not the case here

the best way i know of to get the interest rate lowered is to call the credit card company and simply ask typically if a credit card company thinks you will leave them for another company they will be willing to work with you   there is also the option of transfering some of the higher interest debt to one of the lower interest credit cards it sounds like you have your friend on the right track by focusing all extra money on the credit card with the highest interest rate then after that one is paid off send all extra to the next highest one and so on   the classic snowball effect

what you 're referring to is the yield   the issue with these sorts of calculations is that the dividend is n't guaranteed until it 's declared   it may have paid the quarterly dividend like clockwork for the last decade that does not guarantee it will pay this quarter    regarding question number 2   yield is generally an after the fact calculation   dividends are paid out of current or retained earnings   if the company becomes hot and the stock price doubles but earnings are relatively similar the dividend will not be doubled to maintain the prior yield the yield will instead be halved because the dividend per share was made more expensive to attain due to the increased share price    as for the calculation obviously your yield will likely vary from the yield published on services like google and yahoo finance   the variation is strictly based on the price you paid for the share   dividend per share is a declared amount   assuming a $ 10 share paying a quarterly dividend of $ 0.25 your yield is now figure that you paid $ 8.75 for the share now the way dividends are allocated to shareholders depends on dates published when the dividend is declared   the day you purchase the share the day your transaction clears etc are all vital to being paid a particular dividend   here 's a link to the sec with related information i suppose it goes without saying but historical dividend payments should not be your sole evaluation criteria   personally i would be extremely wary of a company paying a 40 dividend $ 1 quarterly dividend on a $ 10 stock it 's very possible that in your example bar corp is a more sound investment additionally this has really nothing to do with p e price earnings ratios

i 'd have a good look at how much anonymity an llc offers in your state as far as i 'm aware this varies from state to state out here in nv an llc owner 's privacy is supposedly fairly well protected but in other states not quite as much also keep in mind that while the llc offers some protection and i 'm a big advocate of this sort of structure if you 're taking larger risks that might have a big impact on your overall personal finances this might not apply to financing a lot of banks tend to require an llc 's owner to guarantee loans to an llc once they go over a certain amount or even in general do some research in this area because the llc would be worth less as a protective shield to you if you 're on the hook for the full amount of the loans anyway

if you are struggling with debt and can not realistically pay your debts off with your current level of income these businesses offer for a fee to negotiate with your debt providers a sum that you can realistically afford to pay the debt providers will consider the offer because they would rather get some money back rather than nothing as these are usually unsecured loans for you it can be a better deal than going bankrupt or trying to struggle endlessly to pay off something you ca n't afford to pay off note that even though you wo n't be bankrupt you will be treated by lenders very similar to being bankrupt in other words it will be very hard for you to get new loans in the near future

is my math correct the math is correct however dividends do n't work this way the yield is post facto i.e. given the dividend that is declared every quarter once calculates the yield the dividends are not fixed or guaranteed these change from quarter to quarter or at times they are not given at all the yield is and the value is $ 114 per share assuming that the price remains exactly the same for an entire year and that i purchase only one share then this should be the math for calculating the yield 114 x = what the link is showing is that last dividend of mcd was for q3 that means total for a year will be 4 this means yield will be note this year there were only 3 dividend was on on and on it is unlikely that there will be one more dividend this year so for this year the correct post facto calculation would be + = and hence an yield of   also are there any fees deductions or would i receive the amount in full which should be $ 3.75 there are no fee deducted not sure about us tax treatment on dividends

the primary advantage of hfts is their speed to act upon opportunities that exist for only fractions of a second the reason why they are able to do this is because they invest heavily in hardware custom software and custom algorithms   most of the fleeting advantage as they all manage to top each other 's hardware seemingly every other day is from the hardware investment   to see the extremes that hfts will go to invest in hardware one might view this it is highly likely that the trader with the market making algorithm could have been ignorant of the hide not slide order and missed out on many more opportunities while still being successful   who is very much against this order type was not so lucky if it was truly an investment bank then it was unlikely that they were actually front running which is very illegal and easily possible with much more low tech means since companies like citadel handle most orders now and they have not been successful in investment banking the reality of hft is slowly coming to light that while hft can provide extremely consistent returns with enormous sharpe ratios the capital investment is equally enormous and the amount of capital that can be employed is also as enormously limited   after all the richest people on the planet are not hft owners also when it comes to time periods longer than their results become very human

market cap does n't mean that much money went into the system money in equals money out over time and is not directly tied to market cap which can actually be lower if price drops far enough these concepts are the same for all traded assets such as stocks bonds and commodities market cap is simply the current price times the number of shares available in the market so a $ 300 billion market cap does not mean $ 300 billion was paid to somebody to buy it all instead what 's happened is that some money went in at first but much much less and then price increased   bitcoin is a little different in that money in for many innovators and early adopters was in the form of time spent and contributing to the network what they call mining 1 now as to the price jump that 's an effect of market forces for many reasons the market has to buy bitcoin over the last year 2 but many already holding bitcoin were n't ready to sell supply and demand worked in a way that increased price supply low demand high price increases   this situation could easily reverse just as suddenly as the market wanted bitcoin it can decide it does n't want bitcoin supply and demand would work in a way that would decrease price supply high demand low price decreases   this kind of massive market price movement in this short timeframe is exactly what traders mean by volatile it 's actually not that unusual it 's just that most stocks and other assets that experience such gains do n't get much media attention further gains like this often reflect inflated prices market euphoria and trading bubbles all of these terms essentially mean price will correct go down eventually because price is currently much higher than actual value   if the market loses all faith in the asset price will drop to zero and the money in equals money out breaks down some traders will be left holding the bag   meaning they owned the stock at the moment trading permanently ceased 3 notes exact reasons can not be with facts instead we enter the realm of opinion on this point in my opinion bitcoin has increased massively in value mostly due to the media attention it has received and this media attention is not new it received equally pervasive attention in 2013 as an effect price went from under $ 100 to over $ 1000 back to under $ 200 in about 20 months it 's great news if you 're a trader you could have made tons of money as for the early it was actually kind of annoying because it then brought in all the skeptics calling it a ponzi scheme or pyramid scheme despite the quite obvious fact that bitcoin can not be either by definition further upward market forces may have come from the fact that bitcoin is built on an innovative technology that may very well change the way we do a lot of things in the future i 'm referring to blockchain this effect can be seen in several failing companies rising from the like simply by adding the work blockchain to their name i personally find this exactly analogous to the dot com bubble where companies in the late 1990 's made millions in stock simply by adding .com to their name despite having no profits or sometimes not even a working product for high volatility stocks this is not unusual many penny stocks fail and typically the road down is faster than the road up bitcoin may indeed fail but again it 's a bit different than a stock bitcoin is not a company there 's no financials for bitcoin no vc investors board members to report to no product to produce etc bitcoin is designed to simply be a thing itself the hope is to disrupt currency and commodity markets and create a new store of value literally bitcoin is designed to have intrinsic value whether it 's actually working at this point is still unknown

all of this assumes that this relationship is n't as employer employee relationship which would require you to withhold taxes if you send them a small token of appreciation and you are unable to record it as a business expense or some other deductible expense you do n't have to be concerned about how they claim it they decide if they want to risk claiming it was a gift or if they want to record it as an expense even if you say some magic phrase that you think will impress the irs the recipient can still decide declare it as income to have any hope of being able to treat it as a gift they would have to be able to demonstrate that there is a non business relationship   if you can claim it as a business expense or a deductible expense   they will have to also claim it as income because your documentation could point the irs to their lack of documentation   giving them a check or sending the payment electronically will require them to claim it as an income since an audit could require them to explain every line on their bank statements

the short answer is the annualised volatility over twenty years should be pretty much the same as the annualised volatility over five years for independent identically distributed returns the volatility scales proportionally so for any number of monthly returns t setting the factor m = 12 the volatility   it should be the same for all time scales   however note the discussion here scaling volatility like this only is mathematically correct when the    underlying price model is driven by geometric brownian motion which    implies that prices are log normally distributed and returns are    normally distributed particularly the comment its a well known fact that volatility is overestimated when scaled over long periods of time without a change of model to estimate such long term volatility now a demonstration   i have modelled 12,000 monthly returns with mean = 3 and standard deviation = 2 so the annualised volatility should be 2 =    calculating annualised volatility for return of various lengths 3 6 12 60 months etc reveals an for shorter   the five year sequence average got closest to the theoretically expected figure and as the commenter noted volatility is slightly overestimated when scaled over long periods of time annualised volatility for varying return sequence lengths   edit re comment reinvesting returns does not affect the volatility much   for instance comparing some data i have handy the dow jones industrial average capital returns cr versus net returns nr   the return differences are somewhat 0.1 each month 0.25 every third month   more erratic dividend reinvestment would increase the volatility

thanks for your question definitely pay the car down as soon as possible reasoning to follow in fact i would go even further and recommend the following why 1 make money risk free the key here is risk free by paying down the loan now you can avoid paying interest on the additional amount paid toward principal risk free imagine this scenario if you walked into a bank and they said if you give us $ 100 we 'll give you $ 103 back today would you do it that is exactly what you get to do by not paying interest on the remaining loan principal 2 the spread you might make by investing is not as large as you may think let 's assume that by investing you can make a market return of 10 however these are future cash flows so let 's discount this for inflation to a real 8 return then let 's assume that after fees and taxes this would be a 7 real after tax return you also have to remember that this money is at risk in the market and may not get this return in some years assuming that your friend 's average tax rate on earned income is 25 this means that he 'd need to earn $ 400 pre tax to pay the after tax payment of $ 300 so this is a 4 risk free return after tax compared to a 7 average after tax return from the market but one where the return is at risk the equivalent after tax risk free return from the market think t bills is much lower than 7 you are also reducing risk by paying the car loan off first in a few other ways which is a great way to increase peace of mind first since cars decline in value over time you are minimizing the possibility that you will eventually end up under water on the loan where the loan balance is greater than the value of the car this also gives you more flexibility in terms of being able to sell the car at any point if desired additionally if the car breaks down and must be replaced you would not need to continue making payments on the old loan of if your friend loses his job he would own the car outright and would not need to make payments finally ideally you would only be investing in the market when you intend to leave the money there for 5 + years otherwise you might need to pull money out of the market at a bad time remember annual market returns vary quite a bit but over 5 10 year periods they are much more stable unfortunately most people do n't keep cars 5 10 + years so you are likely to need the money back for another car more frequently than this if you are pulling money out of the market every 5 10 years you are more likely to need to pull money out at a bad time 3 killing off the buy now pay later mindset will result in long term financial benefits stop paying interest on things that go down in value save up and buy them outright and invest the extra money into things that generate income dividends this is a good long term habit to have people also tend to be more prudent when considering the total cost of a purchase rather than just the monthly payment because it feels like more money when you buy outright as a gut check for whether this is a good idea here is an example that dave ramsey likes to use suppose that your friend did not have the emergency fund and also did not have the car loan and owned the car outright in that case would your friend take out a title   loan on the car in order to have an emergency fund i think that a lot of people would say no which may be a good indicator that it is wise to reduce the emergency fund in order to wipe out the debt rather than maintaining both

voluntarily assuming a loan is a bad idea especially for a non investment purpose it would be one thing to take on a loan to operate a business or buy a piece of capital equipment like a machine that would make you money borrowing money to have a more luxurious house is foolish the smart move is to buy a good quality home that will meet your needs for as little as possible having $ 800,000 leaves a quit a bit of leeway in that department you do n't say where you live but if this occurred in my area eastern massachusetts i would buy a house for $ 500,000 and then invest the remaining $ 300,000 if i lived in the california bay area it might be necessary to spend the whole $ 800,000 either way there should be no need to borrow money also if you buy a house for cash often you can get a substantially better deal than if you have to involve a bank not owing anyone money is a huge psychological advantage in business and in life in general view being debt free as a to success and happiness

i would personally look at consolidating your debt at a lower interest rate by refinancing your mortgage i would leave any retirement funds alone unless it was absolutely necessary to touch it with no other avenues available however once you have consolidated your debt into the mortgage i would pay more than the minimum amount so that you do n't take too long to pay it off i would put about 50 of the freed up cash flow back into the repayments that way you will be paying more debt off quicker and you will have additional cash flow to help your monthly budget another good point would be to go through your monthly budget to see if there is any expenses you could reduce or eliminate

it is a dangerous policy not to have a balance across the terms of assets short term reserves should remain in short term investments because they are most likely needed in the short term   the amount can be shaved according to the probability of their respective needs but long term asset variance usually exceed the probability of needing to use reserves for example replacing one month bonds paying essentially nothing with stocks that should be expected to return 9 will expose oneself to a possible sudden 50 loss   if cash is indeed so abundant that reserves can be doubled this policy can be expected to be stable however cash is normally scarce   it is a risky policy to place reserves that have a 20 chance of being 100 liquidated into investments that have a 20 chance of declining by approximately 50 just for a chance of an extra 9 annual return financial stability should always be of primary concern with rate of return secondary only after stability has been reasonably assured

well sure but that rate wo n't continue for the next 18 years a lot of the increase in public school cost is due to government funding cuts and the increase stops once funding reaches 0   when you look at private schools say the average over the last 18 years is 4.6 a year higher than inflation 2.3 for sure but no where as bad as the overall numbers would suggest

you have a few options option 1 leave the money where it is if your balance is over $ 5k you should be able to leave the money in your former employer 's 401(k the money will stay there and continue to be invested in the funds that you elect to invest in you should at the very least be receiving quarterly statements for the account even better you should have access to some type of an online account where you can transfer your investments rebalance your account conform to target etc if you do not have online account access than i 'm sure you can still transfer investments and make trades via a paper form just reach out to the 401(k tpa or recordkeeper that administers your plan their contact info is on the quarterly statements you should be receiving option 2 rollover the money into your current employer 's 401(k plan this is the option that i tend to recommend the most roll the money over into your current employer 's 401(k plan this way all the money is in the same place and is invested in the funds that you elect let 's say you wanted to transfer your investments to a new fund lineup right now you have to fill out the paperwork or go through the online process twice for both accounts moving the money to your current employer 's plan and having all the money in the same place eliminates this redundancy and allows you to make one simple transfer of all your assets option 3 roll the money from your former employer 's plan into an ira this is a cool option because now you have a new ira with a new set of dollar limits you can roll the money into a separate ira and contribute an additional $ 5,500 or $ 6,500 if you are 50 + years of age so this is cool because it gives you a chance to save even more for retirement many ira companies give you a sign on bonus where if you rollover your former employers they will give you a bonus typically a few hundred bucks but hey its free money other things to note take a look at your plan document from your former employer 's 401(k plan take a look at the fees compare the fees to your current employer 's plan there could be a chance that the fees from your former employer 's plan are much higher than your current employer so this would just be yet another reason to move the money to your current employer 's plan do n't forget you most likely have a financial advisor that oversees your current employer 's 401(k plan this financial advisor also probably takes fees from your account so use his services you are probably already paying for it talk to your hr at your employer and ask who the investment advisor is call the advisor and set up an appointment to talk about your retirement and financial goals ask him for his advice its always nice talking to someone with experience face to face good luck with everything

i am not a financial advisor but i an tell you what i did in exactly this situation which is pretty much what you are proposing   i put money into the offset savings account until i had only a small amount of mortgage balance left less than a year 's worth of mortgage payments then i set it up so that each month i did the transfer from the offset savings pot into the mortgage itself this depleted the offset savings in line with the mortgage debt and the interest on the two balanced out almost to zero this was self sustaining and meant that i kept the same margin owing over time i.e. if i was in this situation for 5 years for the whole 5 years i would effectively have 1 year remaining on the mortgage meanwhile since i now did n't have any mortgage outgoings from my regular income i put any spare money into isa savings no need to withdraw money from the mortgage to move to the isa the benefits of this as opposed to just paying off the damn mortgage already were that i kept the full liquidity of the mortgage amount i could withdraw all the offset savings pot if i wanted to although i would then have to have funded the mortgage payments differently and as that liquidity went down over time i was building up other savings in parallel it worked well for me it almost does n't matter what the offset mortgage rate is since you are effectively paying it off by keeping the offset savings pot so high

my dad keeps complaining that i treat him like a kid but hey when the shoe fits right that right there is some wisdom i would question why you need a student account   if i found myself in this situation and decided to participate   i would open a savings account no debit card in both of your names   this account would have little or no fees have a branch convenient for both of you   and no ability for him to overdraft   when i wanted to i could deposit money into his account and he could withdraw you might even open your own account at the same bank that he does not have access to   then it is a matter of transferring the money into his account which can be done by mobile phone    the thing that i would say to you beyond your question is that you are choosing to participate and enabling this insanity   by quickly sending him money you are not allowing him to find alternatives for his poor behavior    if it was me i would require that he have some sort of financial literacy education   he needs help budgeting planning and managing a bank account   i am a dave ramsey guy so i would require him to attend that i would happily pay for ~$100   alternatives are more than fine mostly there has to be   progress in his financial literacy and behavior    if he asked for money in the future i would ask to see his budget and explain what went wrong   if there was no budget there would be no money   if there was some legitimacy to his need i would help meet it   one example would be the company he worked for did not meet payroll   that is something mostly beyond his control and can really hurt when a person is just starting to take control of their life   so yes i would send a check in that case    however that choice is yours for perspective when my son was 18 he came to me for help with bounced checks   he wanted me to pay the fee and probably pay it every month that he went crazy   i paid the fee once and i provided the education he needed   after that he learned and was quickly a self sufficient adult   i also made it very clear that i would only pay it once my situation was normal parents should teach their children   your situation is insanity   there is no way you should be put in the situation you are in with your father   he needs to grow up and you will have to help him somewhat   if nothing more you should cut him off financially

years ago when buying checks through one 's bank was the sole option if you got a business account with a bank you had to buy business checks   one difference between a business account and a personal account was that on the business account the incorporated or unincorporated company say simply wonderful apps had the option of changing from john doe to richard roe as the treasurer of simply wonderful apps and the person signing the checks whereas a personal account in john doe 's name could not be changed to allow richard roe signature authority over the account   for a self employed person doing business as simply wonderful apps a personal checking account would do just as well   since the need to change the person responsible for signing checks might never arise it was of course important to have a separate checking account for the business because it made book keeping simpler and also separated business expenses deductible on schedule c from personal expenses but it was not necessary to have a business account or business checks to run a small business in addition to the various advantages described in other answers one advantage that i found for larger checks is that various money management programs could do things like print an address below the name on computer checks so that after folding   the check could be put into a window envelope and mailed directly for the one check to a page format the programs could print additional information on the blank area below the check e.g. explanations about the check company logo etc so it was convenient if one had to write several checks each month but if   outgoing checks are infrequent and extra security is not much of an issue there   is less reason to spend a lot extra on business style checks rather than the personal style checks

actually the other answer is n't strictly correct   it 's an estimate giving a lower bound that gets less accurate as income increases   consider u.s. income tax is based on a progressive tax system where there are income bracket levels with increasing tax rates example given u.s. 2009 federal tax rates for an individual filing as single imagine somebody making $ 100000   assuming no other credits deductions or taxes then income tax based on the above brackets rates would be calculated as follows meaning the average tax rate for the single individual earning $ 100,000 is however a pre tax deduction from that income actually comes off at the top marginal tax rate   consider the same calculation but with taxable income reduced to $ instead i.e. simulating a pre tax $ 1000 deduction that 's a difference of $ 280 which is more than the $ savings that would have been estimated if just using the average tax rate method consequently when trying to determine how much money would be saved by a tax deduction it makes better sense to estimate using the marginal tax rate which in this case was 28   it gets a little trickier if the deduction crosses a bracket boundary   left as an exercise to the reader finally in the case of the deduction being discussed it also looks like payroll fica taxes paid by the employee social security 's 6.2 and medicare 's 1.45 would be avoided as well so add that to the marginal tax rate savings the surest way to know how much would be saved though would be to do one 's income tax return calculation without the deduction and then with and compare the numbers   tax software can make this very easy to do

there is a fourth option pay those taxes depending on the amounts it might be the easiest way if you make in interest and pay 6 $ in taxes on it and be done that might not be worth any other effort if the expected taxable amount is significant moving most of it to index funds or other simply switching existing investments to instead of pay out in would be the best approach again some smaller amounts in savings or accounts are probably not worth any effort transferring the money to the us does n’t save you taxes as any interest would still be taxable you have a risk to lose on the conversion back and forth and a potential to gain the exchange rate could go either way so if you are sure you go back it ’s not a good idea to move the money

that of arbitrage free pricing sounds a bit like the relative vs. fundamental approaches to asset pricing that cochrane outlines in his text asset pricing also makes this distinction with regard to term structure models in volatility and    on one extreme you have capm style models in which asset prices are completely determined by investors risk preferences on the other extreme you would have something like a sabr libor market model where you take everything up to and including the volatility surface as given    what 's interesting to me is the way in which these different classes of models get used in various parts of the financial industry so buy side firms tend to rely a lot more on equilibrium style models since they ultimately care about things like how the equity risk premium or the bond risk premium affect asset prices in contrast derivatives quants working at a big sell side bank who are pricing exotics do n't care about what the fundamental value of their underlying assets is they just take that as given and price the exotic accordingly

this works even better when you have a good credit score when you want to arbitrarily inflate it for bragging rights or lowest interest rates i 'm only pointing this out because it has nothing to do with your current score and ck 's recommendation the presence of an installment loans is 10 of your credit score according to some credit scoring models so theoretically someone with a solid 720 score could gain 72 points while someone with a 480 score would only gain 48 points but the scores are weighted so you would n't get that kind out outcome regardless it will have less of an impact you can do this amongst other things but if that installment loan alters your utilization of credit it will more greatly lower your score and the hard inquiry to apply for the loan will also temporarily hurt your score and you also might not be approved these are the things to consider but fortunately utilization has no history yes you can pay the loan off with a monthly payment the loan 's interest will cost slightly more than the monthly payments by the end of the loan term i 've done this with a 5 year $ 500 installment loan at a credit union as others pointed out you do n't have to spend money to raise your credit score unnecessary interest in this case but you certainly can

from getting rid of pmi per the federal homeowners protection act you can ask that your pmi be canceled when you 've paid down your mortgage to 80 of the loan if you have a good record of payment and compliance with the terms of your mortgage you make a written request and you show that the value of the property has n't gone down   what 's more when you 've paid down your mortgage to 78 of the original loan the law says that the lender must automatically cancel your pmi so in this case to prove it has n't gone down an appraisal is in order but all of this does n't answer the question the pmi is a separate line item once it 's removed your total monthly payment drops you are welcome to keep it in and indicate it should be a prepayment of principal if that 's your wish but that 's up to you it 's not automatic   in researching this the first time i ran into an article how to calculate pmi costs in which an example is given where a 91 ltv $ 200 k loan has a pmi cost of $ so the impact of not having that extra $ 20 k or so is to pay what amount to an extra 5 on the last $ 20 k of the loan the pmi does n't scale over time when you are $ 10 k away from 80 ltv you still pay the $ 1k yr for this reason if you absolutely must go over 80 ltv i 'd suggest shopping for a bank that will permit the excess to be a home equity loan   at least the payoff of that 2nd loan in totally in your control

time for redditors to not understand that the reason someone is losing cash matters far more than the fact that they 're losing cash in the first place    if you have positive unit economics on every transaction and spend your margins on customer acquisition you 're losing money but gaining market share once you stop growing all of the customer acquisition spend is now pure profit this is a great reason to be losing money and raising capital from equity debt    if you have negative unit economics on every transaction and have no margins you are resorting to financing to just keep your operations running when you stop growing you 're still losing money the only way you start having a margin is by reducing cost or increasing prices uber has experimented with raising prices and it is reducing their losses but it 's also reducing their market share revenue growth but market share loss means they 're growing slower than the rest of the market not great in fact catastrophic because it means people are jumping ship because of increased prices    people keep comparing kalanick to bezos and jobs and could not be any more wrong    jobs made incredibly high margin premium products that you could n't get anywhere else if you 're putting companies on a commodity axis apple is going to be on the opposite end of uber    amazon does deliver a lot of commodity goods but they lost money for so long not just to deliver goods at negative unit economics but to also build and scale infrastructure that let them achieve positive economies of scale they built an infrastructure that rivals the logistics ops of anyone in the world they also use negative unit economics as a loss leader so for instance selling the fire and kindle at a loss because people will buy zero marginal cost items like movies music ebooks etc through them in addition to serving as a portal for amazon 's entire online store i have bought hundreds of dollars of digital goods through amazon hardware that 's pure margin for them how is a loss leader    uber shares none of these traits with amazon or apple

he 's comfortably middle class but not wealthy the tesla was purchased in a multi owner shared arrangement and the solar panels were installed by a company that supplies the capital for the panels with a long term agreement to supply power to the homeowner and takes care of the more complex business agreements to feed back power to the grid the situation on paper looks like   a long term break even but we 'll have to see   overall even if he 's paying a bit more in electric cost the arrangement gives a lot of stability in exchange   to me it 's clear that going electric car + renewable electric is a long term good on the principle of becoming nationally independent from geopolitical but also more towards becoming individually independent in terms of being isolated from instability in gas prices utility prices and even in times of natural disaster

agriculture is down to single digits as part of the gdp what does that have to do with a gold standard and monetary policy   i was being sarcastic    gt;but as soon as the usa left the gold exchange standard total factor productivity began to dramatically stagnate   correlation does n't equal causation remember that this is also the same time that european japanese and soviet economies were picking back up after ww2 global production picked up and there was more international competition    gt;because our massive debt is doing so well for us in the beginning it looks nice because there is very little pain and is practically but as we see current events playing out in the us and to a greater extent europe which is nt as tightly economically as the us fiat currency has huge problems   the eu can not print money in the same way the usa can if anything the euro is a cautionary tale about currency 's with too stringent printing limitations along with tying together a set of countries at vastly different levels of economic development    the usa is not anywhere near the point of no return and seeing as we can finance our debt at ridiculously low rates compared to the rest of the world it would be much simpler to do that than try and restructure the entire monetary system of the usa   over what the last 40 years we are at about 80 90 years now    hardly enough time to call practical fact when the gold standard existed for hundreds and thousands of years   the gold standard has not been in use for hundreds of thousands of years nor was it the only currency previous to fiat   gt;i am not sure why you think that the usa is in such a great position the american dream is if you 're just starting out in life just ask any number of recent college grads who are increasingly living with parents not getting married and ca n't find jobs   i do n't think asking my local college grad is a good way of determining the usa 's macro economic situation you 're absolutely right that there is a major major disparity of wealth problem but the gold standard is n't the reason for that unemployment insurance and welfare are also comically small portions of the budget if you wanna talk about cutting spending defense and medicare are where it 's at and you do n't even have to hurt old people or soldiers to fix them

let 's do a real example of leverage on the spy imagine you have $ 20 k today and plan on having $ 100 k by jan 2018   you could get 100 shares of spy and ride it out   maybe buying another 100 shares every few months until 2018 ending up with less than 500 shares to your name and zero cash in the bank or you could lever with dec 2017 leap calls they 'll expire in 2.5 years so you 'd have to re up sooner than your plan    with 20 k starting cash in my example we 'll go with 5 contracts to start with   if we choose the $ 230 strike they 'd cost $ 1250 each putting roughly $ at risk    the plan in is if the stock market goes up you 've got leverage   you are the proud owner of contracts worth 500 shares of spy and have only spent 1/3rd of your present day dollars   if the market goes down in the next two years sure you lost the entire $ but likely saved $ powder dry and can try your luck with the 2021 leaps    probably get down votes for this but i 'll even argue that proper use of leverage can very much reduce your risk    one truth is you 'll never get a margin call from holding long options

having savings only in your home currency is relatively low risk compared with other types of low diversification this is because in a simple case your future cash outflows will be in your home currency so if the gbp fluctuates in value it will theoretically still buy you the same goods at home in this way keeping your savings in the same currency as your future expenditures creates a natural hedge against currency fluctuation this gets complicated for goods imported from other countries where base price fluctuates based on a foreign currency or for situations where you expect to incur significant foreign currency expenditures retirement elsewhere etc in such cases you no longer have certainty that your future expenditures will be based on the gbp and saving money in other currencies may make more sense in many circumstances diversification of the currency of your savings may actually increase your risk not decrease it be sure you are doing this for a specific reason with a specific strategy and not just to generally spread your money around even in case of a brexit consider what would you do with a bank account full of usd if the answer is convert it back to gbp when needed in 6 months 5 years 30 etc to buy british goods then i would n't call this a way to reduce your risk instead i would call it a type of investment with its own set of risks associated

at the most basic level of financing a business you are trying to acquire capital as cheaply as you can to invest in your projects   the measure for how expensive your capital is to acquire is weighted average cost of capital     the formula for wacc   equity ratio cost of equity + debt ratio cost of debt 1 tax rate this is also your discount rate when you 're making a dcf model   debt tends to be cheaper than equity when you do n't already have any and is also advantaged by tax rates since you do n't pay taxes on interest   in the real world banks and lenders will ratchet up rates the more debt you acquire or shut you out once you 've taken on too much and your debt service coverage is too low for them   in a classroom though most teachers are too lazy to make a formula for borrowing and will just state a rate for borrowing so you can load up on debt so long as you do n't fall below being able to service your debt cash flow to make your debt payments   this will ultimately juice the returns on equity   realistically you would find lenders would let you have ~20 equity in the business and debt without raising your teacher 's   if you have n't taken accounting yet be careful about the difference between cash and revenue in your analyses   revenue is recognition for work done not cash in hand   you can have all the revenue in the world but if no one 's paid you for it yet you ca n't pay anyone

what could the tax issues with the irs be i thought but not totally certain that the tax treatment of an iso option was based on difference between exercise price and fmv at the time of the sale   this is an accounting issue there were times not so long ago that companies actually did these things on purpose to boost the stock grant values for their employees especially senior employees they would give a grant but date it with an earlier date with a more favorable valuation this is called and it brought companies down and ceos into criminal courts in addition only reasonable compensation is allowed as a deduction for the company and incorrectly set strike price may be deemed unreasonable thus the deduction the company would take for your compensation can be denied leading to loss of tax benefit this was also a weapon used by the irs at the time against companies doing last but not least company that has intentions of going public can not allow itself such a blatant disregard of the accounting rules even if the mistake was not made on purpose as it sounds it is a mistake that has to be corrected what should i take into consideration to determine whether a 27 increase in shares is a fair exchange for an increase in 270 increase in strike price did you know the strike price when you signed the contract was it a consideration for you for most people the strike price is determined at the board approval since the valuations are not public and are not disclosed before you actually join which is already after you 've agreed to the terms so basically you agreed to get 100 sheets of toilet paper and instead getting sheets so you 're getting 27 sheets more than you initially agreed to why are you complaining in other words options are essentially random numbers which are quite useless by the time you get to exercise them they 'll be diluted through a bunch of additional financing rounds and their value will be determined for real only after the ipo or at least when your company 's stocks are trading otc with some reasonable volume until then it 's just a number with not much of a meaning the fmv does matter for early exercise and 83(b election if that is an option but even then i doubt you can actually negotiate anything

even where national law might allow such a practice the law in an individual province or state either for issuing or receiving bank might not or if that does then the receiving bank may have its own regulations or compliance practice which may not permit them to accept an altered cheque   in any case printed numbers are usually machine readable and a corrected cheque would not be   the question needs a specific answer which addresses the specific circumstances involved which are not stated at the time of writing this but for the general question should i alter a printed cheque the answer must be no cheque numbers are used for identification of the cheque in many cases there is no verification of and it would be perfectly acceptable simply to use cheques with duplicate numbers a cheque is merely an order to the bank to make a payment but you would not be able to identify a particular payment on your statement and neither would the issuing bank if you wanted one stopped where the number is verified as unique then clearing the payment may be refused or at best delayed in order to be making an obvious amendment to a cheque ’s details is likely to raise a red flag the receiving bank would not be able to tell if you did it or the payee they would not know why they may suspect that it was done in order to render the cheque even though the opposite is in fact the case and refuse to accept it they may refuse to accept it because it could not be read automatically any refusal would sour your relationship with your payees presumably your printing house or your bank if they printed them has made the error raise it with them and have them the batch ask your bank what to do with the incorrect cheques they may want them returned to the bank or they may be happy for you to keep and even use them if the latter i suggest you shred them

national economics editorial nee is a news site that purports to support economic nationalism while nee does cover some economic issues it is as the name implies mainly an editorial site the opinions expressed in the stories cover current affairs with a pronounced right wing bias nee is on the whole long on rhetoric and short on factual content and credible sourcing due to the overt bias and lack of factual information nee is rated questionable d.    does n't seem like a site that i 'd trust for anything apart from predictable far right national economics

when you get a loan car home student the lending company bank give the auto dealer previous home owner school money you as the borrow promise to pay this money back with interest   so in your case the 100,000 you borrow requires a payment for principal and interest of per month after 240 payments you will have paid the bank   so who got the in interest the bank did it was used to pay interest to the people who made deposits into the bank it was also used to pay the expenses of the bank salaries retirement rent electricity computers etc if the bank is a company with investors they may have to pay dividends to them to   of course not all loans are successfully paid back so some of the payment goes to cover the loans that are in default in many cases loans are also refinanced or the house is sold long before the 20 30 year term is up in these cases the amount of interest received for that loan is much less than anticipated but the good news is that it can be loaned out again

i 've read some great posts on here and either small business or entrepreneur subs re bars and i 've heard the complaints from friends of friends apparently theft wastage is rampant so good cash and alcohol controls are crucial even if you do n't have outright cash theft letting bartenders get away with free or big pours for bigger tips ultimately gets you the same result your manager should know how many pours he 's getting from and bottles if that adds up it wo n't then it could be a lack of business and you need some marketing but apparently tracking your pours is the key there are plenty of books and trade publications out there so if you do n't have a bar background i 'd suggest doing some reading or even talk to hire someone to help you figure it out it sounds like you have some systemic issues

a drop in credit score of 300 is pretty significant right   you describe the cause of this as unfortunate circumstances   lets say you observe a mother giving a small child a ball to play with in the median of a busy interstate   once the inevitable happens would you also describe that as unfortunate circumstances   because really it is the same thing you overextended yourself and did not consider risk in the decision to borrow money   this may sound harsh but you have proven that you can not handle credit   so your solution is to borrow more   that makes no sense the best thing you can do for your credit score is to reduce then eliminate all debt

you just disclosed that you are new investor to the stock market i 'd advise that you first understand investing a bit better as most will advise that investors need to be above a certain level before picking individual stocks   that said most stocks trade in high enough volume and have low enough short interest that they do n't fall under the category you seek you want to first ask your broker if they have such a process not all do if so they would need to provide you with the stocks that fall into this odd situation specifically the shares that have traders seeking to short the stock but the stock is unavailable even then the broker may have requirements that you do n't fall into minimum history with broker minimum size account etc worse they are not likely to offer this for 100 shares but may have a 1000 or higher share requirement are you willing to buy some obscure $ priced stock to lend out at the guy trying to short it is far smarter than both you and i at least regarding this particular stock this strategy is more appropriate for the 7 figure net worth investor   if any reader has actual experience with this i 'm happy to hear it this response is from my recollection of two articles i read about 3 years ago coincidence they both were published within weeks of each other

most folks would loan out money for the purpose of being re loaned   depositing money in the bank is loaning the bank money who will re loan it   buying bond based mutual funds is another way that it could be viewed that people are loaning money for the purpose of the money being re loaned   the reason why banks always have money available for withdrawal is because of the reserve   fractional reserve banking in its simplest explanation is that banks are allowed to take deposits and loan them out so long as they keep a set reserve   if the reserve rate is 10 it 's really much lower and somebody deposits $ 100 then the bank is allowed to loan out $ 90 keeping $ 10 as a reserve   now even with a reserve a bank does run some risk of the deposits being withdrawn faster than the loans are paid back this is called a run   what protects banks most from this is that deposits withdrawals loans and loan repayments all happen at a fairly steady and predictable rate short term so banks are able to judge how many loans they should give out   even when banks do see their reserve depleting they have options   the first and most common is simply getting a loan from another bank   the rule with the reserve is that banks need to meet it at the end of the day so banks will loan each other money overnight for the purpose of making up for the slight fluctuations that occur in a normal business day   if you have ever heard the fed talking about the overnight rate they are talking about the rate banks loan each other money for the night   another common way for banks to make up for a deficit in deposits in a longer term solution is to sell assets   fairly rare for a bank to sell actual physical assets but the loans they hold are assets and they can sell them to other banks   most banks will also hold some bonds that are available to sell   the major functions that allow a bank to be profitable would still apply to the op 's idea   the only real difference would be that commercial banks have direct access to the central banks and the op 's idea would need to have a commercial bank to act as the middle man between the central bank

idk why the comment before this got -10 and this one got + 30 when it 's all in the same vein   anyway the truth of the matter is regardless if trump is correct or not finding good solutions is n't about democracy democracy is about mitigating the risks of concentrated political power and granting the people a chance to influence the nation    however effective problem solving and finding the truth is about placing powerful people in their respective positions while considering their qualified opinions not everyone 's opinion should matter believe it or not democracy of capital causes misallocation democracy of information causes misunderstanding and why because we have unqualified opinions a doctor has a qualified opinion on health care and in a way so does a patient and perhaps an insurance company but a plumber who spends little time with his children does n't belong on the school board and a teacher does n't necessarily know anything about the coal industry   in the end our country is operated like a giant sub reddit where of people upvote this and that just because they feel like it we get a lot of important things right but we get some critical things incredibly wrong these stack up and produce problems of immense proportions with seemingly no answer for example health care and the government 's recommendation for diet in public schools as obvious examples with simple solutions that no one likes or agrees with   anyway the whole nation is sick from head to toe and the remedy is not democracy democracy is an tool it is neutral how we use it is how we benefit from it

the simplest most convenient way i know of to move your savings to canada is to purchase an exchange traded fund like the canadian dollar trust or a similar instrument i identify this fund because i know it exists not because i particularly recommend it your money will be in canadian currency earning canadian interest rates you will pay a small portion of that interest in fees since us banks are already guaranteed by the fdic up to $ 250,000 per account i do n't really think you avoid any risks associated with the failure of an individual bank but you might fare better if the us currency is subject to inflation or unfavorable foreign exchange movements not that such a thing would be a direct risk of a bank failure but it could happen as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve under the of the economy if the economy worsens in the wake of a financial crisis or for that matter if it worsens as a result of something else including legislative regulatory or executive policies read the prospectus to understand additional risks with this investment one of them is foreign exchange risk if the us economy and currency strengthen relative to the canadian economy and its currency you may lose substantial amounts of purchasing power additionally one of the possible results of a financial crisis is a flight to safety the global financial markets still seem to think the us dollar is pretty safe and they may bid it up as they have done in the past resulting in losses to your position at least in the short term i do not personally recommend moving all your savings to canada especially if it you of income from more profitable investments over the long term but moving some of your savings to canada at least is n't a stupid idea and it may turn out to be somewhat profitable having some canadian currency is also a good idea if you plan to spend the money that you are saving on canadian goods in the intermediate future

there 's probably no simple answer but it 's fair to say there are bad times to buy and better times   if you look at a house and see the rent is more than the mortgage payment it may be time to consider buying   right now the market is depressed if you buy and plan to stay put not caring if it drops from here because you plan to be there for the long term you may find a great deal to be had over the long term housing matches inflation   sounds crazy but even into the bubble if you looked at housing in terms of mortgage payment at the prevailing 30yr fixed rate and converted the payment to hours needed to work to make the payment the 2005 bubble never was not at the median anyway at today 's < 5 rate the mortgage will cost you 3.75 after taxes and assuming a 3 long term inflation rate less than 1 you have expenses to be sure property tax maintenance etc but if you fix the mortgage inflation will eat away at it and ultimately it 's over at retirement i 'll take a paid for house over rising rents any day

your questions in the world of technical analysis is candlestick charting an effective trading tool in timing the markets it depends on how you define effective but as a standalone and systematic strategy it tends not to be profitable see for example market timing with candlestick technical analysis using robust statistical techniques we find that candlestick trading rules are not profitable when applied to djia component stocks over period neither bullish or bearish candlestick single lines or patterns provide market timing signals that are any better than what would be expected by chance basing ones trading decisions solely on these techniques does not seem sensible but we can not rule out the possibility that they compliment some other market timing techniques there are many other papers that come to the same conclusion if used correctly how accurate can they be in picking turning points in the market technical analysts generally fall into two camps i those that argue that ta ca n't be fully automated and that interpretation is part of the game ii those that use ta as part of a systematic investment model automatically executed by a machine but generally use a combination of indicators to build a working model both groups would argue for different reasons that the conclusions of the paper i quoted above should be disregarded and that ta can be applied profitably with the proper framework psychological biases it is very easy to get impressed by technical analysis because we all suffer from confirmation bias whereby we tend to acknowledge things that confirm our beliefs more than those that contradict them when looking at a chart it is very easy to see all the when a certain pattern worked and miss the when it did not work and not missing those is much harder than it sounds conclusions

looking at the list of bonds you listed many of them are long dated in short in a rate rising environment it 's not like rates can go much lower in the foreseeable future these bond prices will drop in general in addition to any company specific events occurred to these names so be prepared for some paper losses   just because a bond is rated highly by credit agencies like s&p or moody 's does not automatically mean their prices do not fluctuate yes there is always a demand for highly rated bonds from pension funds mutual funds etc because of their investment mandates but i would suggest looking beyond credit ratings and yield and look further into whether these bonds are secured unsecured and if secured by what keep in mind in recent financial crisis prices of those cdos clos ended up even though they were given aaa ratings by rating agencies because some were backed by housing properties that were over valued and loans made to borrowers having difficulties to make repayments hence these type of bonds have greater default risks and traded at huge discounts most of them are also callable so you may not enjoy the seemingly high yield till their maturity date like others mentioned buying bonds outright is usually a big ticket item i would also suggest reviewing your cash liquidity and opportunity cost as oppose to investing in other asset classes and instruments

option prices are computed by determining the cost of obtaining the option returns using a strategy that trades the underlying asset continuously   it sounds like what you are describing is rapidly trading the option in order to obtain returns similar to those of the stock   the equality goes both ways    if the option is appropriately priced then a strategy that replicates stock returns using the option will cost the same as buying the stock because you ca n't trade continuously you wo n't actually be able to replicate the stock return and it may seem like you are making arbitrage profit puts may seem abnormally expensive but you do so by bearing tail risk i.e. selling puts loses more money than owning the associated stock if an unusually bad event occurs

in my experience in a house share situation it seems to come down to how comfortable the occupants feel and how much of their own space they want   for example i 've come across lots of situations where someone is renting a room from a live in landlord but in practice the two housemates or roommates if you prefer have equal run of the place and may even share food and hang out together and also the opposite where people are sharing a property as equals but tend to stick to their own room and do n't share or even more extreme where they are technically equals but subject to one or more very housemates roommates   this happened to someone i know who was renting with two friends but was forced to move out   i run a website aimed at and live in landlords and house to a lesser degree mostly from the uk but relevant everywhere as i deal with much more than legalities and tax i came across this thread as i wanted to explore the difference in the us between a lodger and a roommate   from what i gather the term lodger is understood but the term roommate is more typically used to mean a lodger which in itself suggests a more equal arrangement than in the uk where we 're more used to owning property than renting and certainly sharing   however i believe that if you 're letting a room to someone and they pay you a reasonable rent and respect both you and your home you should be prepared to treat them as an equal on a day to day basis   if you 're not then you naturally wo n't attract either the best rent or the best lodger roommate however desirable the property

the federal funds rate is one of the risk free short term rates in the economy we often think of fixed income securities as paying this rate plus some premia associated with risk for a treasury security we can think this way interest rate = fed funds rate + term premium the term premium is a bit extra the bond pays because if you hold a long term bond you are exposed to interest rate risk which is the risk that rates will generally rise after you buy making your bond worth less   the relation is more complex if people have expectations of future rate moves but this is the general idea   anyway generally speaking longer term bonds are exposed to more interest rate risk so they pay more on average for a corporate bond we think this way interest rate = fed funds rate + term premium + default premium where the default premium is some extra that the bond must pay to compensate the holder for default risk which is the risk that the bond defaults or loses value as the company 's prospects fall   you can see that corporate and government bonds are affected the same way approximately this is all hand waving by changes in the fed funds rate now that all refers to the rates on new bonds   after a bond is issued its value falls if rates rise because new bonds are relatively more attractive   its value rises if rates on new bonds falls   so if there is an unexpected rise in the fed funds rate and you are holding a bond you will be sad especially if it is a long term bond does n't matter if it 's corporate or government   ask yourself though whether an increase in fed funds will be unexpected at this point   if the increase was expected it will already be priced in   are you more of an expert than the folks on wall street at predicting interest rate changes   if not it might not make sense to make decisions based on your belief about where rates are going   just saying brick points out that treasuries are tax advantaged   that is you do n't have to pay state income tax on them but you do pay federal if you live in a state where this is true this may matter to you a little bit they also pay little because they are convenient for use as a cash substitute in transactions and convenience yield   in general treasuries just do n't pay much   young folk like you tend to buy corporate bonds instead so they can make money on the default and term premia

ponder this suppose that a reputable company or government were to come out and say hey we are going to issue some 10 year bonds at 6.4 anyone interested in buying some assume that the company or government is financially solid and there is zero chance that they will go bankrupt think those bonds would sell would you be interested in buying such a bond well i would wager that these bonds would sell like despite the fact that the long term stock market return beats it by a half percent heck vanguard 's junk bond fund is hot right now it only yields 4.9 and those are junk bonds not rock solid companies see vanguard high yield corporate bond fund every time you make an extra principal payment on your student loan you are effectively purchasing a investment with a rock solid guaranteed 6.4 return for 10 years or whatever time you have left on the loan if make no extra payments on top of that paying off a loan early builds your credit reputation improves your monthly cash flow once the loan is paid may increase your purchasing power for a house or car and if nothing else it frees you from being a slave to that debt payment every month   edit improved wording based on ross 's comment

disclaimer i am neither a lawyer nor a tax expert this page on the hmrc site lists several pages that appear to be relevant starting with foreign currency delayed remittances and on to foreign currency example which seems pertinent to your case paraphrased a property bought in 1983 is sold for a taxable gain in one tax year but the proceeds can not be released remitted to the uk until later by which time currency fluctuations have created a second taxable gain the size of the first gain selling the property is determined by the exchange rate in effect at the time of the sale but because of local restrictions this can be deferred   the size of the second gain currency movement is determined by the change in exchange rate between the time of the sale and the time of conversion in your case the first gain was actually a loss so i believe you should be able to use this to offset any tax due second gain   this page states that losses can be claimed up to four years after the end of the tax year in which they were incurred so you are probably still ok the example makes application under to defer the gain made on the original sale because of the inability to transfer funds but as i understand it this is primarily to avoid a tax liability in that year   since you made a loss on the sale there would n't have been a tax liability so there would be no need to defer it

gt the long run goal is to eliminate poverty through wealth creation if that makes for some weird new social interactions i 'd say that 's a reasonable cost   yes i agree but there 's a problem if we allow income inequality to become so rampant it causes macro geopolitical issues i 'm not sure how that would be solved it seems almost inherent in a model i suppose mitigating rent seeking in favour of actual wealth creation and spreading meritocracy in proportion rather than might be a start the current wave of green energy climate change and focus on health might be an indirect mitigating factor to this perhaps the limitation of land is the real issue space would be an interesting scenario but there 's likely a lot of time before that happens   gt i mention comparing to earlier periods simply as a measure of progress to determine whether or not there is a problem that needs correction such as a specific group in society experiencing real wage stagnation or truly anemic growth rates relative to earlier periods it 's the slope of the trend line for each group that i 'd be worried about where linear or exponential is good and logarithmic should indicate a potential crisis   that actually makes sense   gt ultimately i believe that it 's not a persons absolute circumstances that matter but the rate at which those circumstances are improving throughout their lives that most strongly affects their subjective well being but that 's just my theory   i have not read enough in both economics or human psychology to really have an opinion on this but so far i would lean towards an agreement   gt as for real estate costs you 're absolutely correct that this is a problem but it 's as easily problem supply is artificially constrained in most of the us due to the need for explicit government permission in the form of building permits and zoning laws in order to build new units basic economics says that when supply is artificially restricted prices will rise   i 'm on the fence on this issue because real estate is based on rent seeking and promotion of debt slavery while i wo n't argue against the principle of government restriction -&gt higher prices what exactly keeps private interests from raising living cost as high as it can even in the developed world people spend as much as half of their income on rent mortgage alone other than competition of course but in a high competitive area the incentive is to eat up market share the laws of accumulation would then argue that in the end a few large institutions would own the majority of residential homes and living apartments they can now set their own prices and that will in effect be as bad as government regulation

could the individual directly use the credit cards for the down payment no not directly indirectly either via cash advance or balance transfer to a bank account with a promotional rate could work however you may have to show the money sitting in a bank account and ready to go before the loan will be approved which means the money you took out on the credit cards will show up when they pull your credit unless you somehow timed it perfectly and even if you did that you 'd be breaking the law by lying on the disclosure statement about your current debts if he could are there any negative consequences from doing so other than probable high monthly payments on the cards definitely let 's assume we 're talking about the indirect method of cash advance or balance transfer since that is actually possible there are 3 things to compare final thought most of the time the rate you pay on a non mortgage loan will be higher than that of the mortgage and furthermore mortgage interest is oftentimes tax deductible so it would rarely ever make sense to shift would be mortgage debt into another type of loan down payment or otherwise

you should total the items first to get $ 3.00 then add the tax then round up down accordingly   your two examples above do n't offer this option even though your second example arrives at the same result   in your first example a number of items taxed one at a time might result in many results which would round to .01 a long enough list of items would result in an error of many cents depending how many items there are totaling first then applying tax results in your saving or losing cents maximum due to rounding   see a guide to sales and use tax which is a document put out by the massachusetts dept of revenue in the chart for tax it shows that $ is taxed at five cents but at 5 it would be so at least for this state i believe i correctly stated the rounding process

nope it 's just relevant to point out that no additional credentials are required when some dipshit claims that the requirements for a job are somehow much higher than they actually are my brother got a job at boeing 2 or 3 years after leaving high school he never attended college he had no additional certs welding etc same goes for all the other people i know that are working at boeing except they have varying levels of college education with the that none of them actually have even a 2 year degree completed you are just completely full of shit   but hey do n't take it from me take it from the requirements section of their job postings     i would love to know what possesses a person who clearly does not have the knowledge required for a conversation on a specific topic to enter it so passionately and to make such fraudulent claims i mean did you not do the 2 minutes of research necessary whatever the case it sure makes statements like this more hilarious   gt;you know what the problem is with guys that started using a immediately after junior year ended is they think they know about things they have no idea about

putting a dollar amount on the valuation of a start up business is an art form that often has very little at all to do with any real numbers and more to do with your salesman abilities when talking with the vc that said there are a few starting points first is past sales the cost of those sales and a hopefully realistic growth curve   however you do n't have that so this gets harder do you have any actual assets   machinery computers desks patents etc   things that you actually own   if so then add those in   if this is a software start up code is an asset but without sales it 's incredibly hard to put a value on it   the best i 've come up with is how much would it cost for someone else to build it after they 've seen yours   yes you may have spent 5,000 hours building something but could someone else duplicate it or at least the major parts in 200 hours after seeing a demo   use the lower number if i was you i 'd look hard at my business plan   hopefully you were as honest as you can be when writing it and that it is as researched as possible   what is it going to take to get that first sale   what do you actually need to get there hint your logo on the side of a building is not a necessary expense   nor is really nice office space   once you have that first sale what is the second going to take   can you extrapolate out to 3 years   how many key members are there   how much is their contribution worth   at what point will you be profitable    next is to look at risks   you have n't done this before that 's huge i 'm assuming simply because you asked this question   another is competitors hopefully they already exist because opening a new market is incredibly hard and expensive on the flip side hopefully there are n't that many because entering a crowded market is equally hard and expensive   note each are possible but take radically different approaches and sums of money and $ 200k is n't going to cut it no matter what it is you are selling that said competition should be able to at least point you in the direction of a price point and estimate for how long sales take   if any are publicly traded then you have additional info to help you set a valuation   are there any potential regulatory or legal issues what happens if a key member leaves dies or is otherwise no longer available   insurance only helps so much if the one guy that knows everything literally gets run over   god help you if this person likes to go i bring risks up because you will have to them during this negotiation   for example asking for $ 200k with zero hard assets while trying to sell software to government agencies assuming a 3 week sales cycle will have you laughed at for naivety   whereas asking for $ 10 m in the same situation with a team that has governmental sales experience would likely work another big question is exit strategy do you intend to ipo or sell to a competitor or a business in a related category   if selling do you have evidence that the target company actually buys others and if so how did those deals work out   what did they look for in order to buy   exit strategy is huge to a vc and they will want to make several multiples of their money back in a relatively short amount of time   can you realistically support that for how much you are asking for   if not then going through an angel group would be better   they have similar questions but very different expectations the main thing is that no one knows what your business is worth because it is 100 unproven after 2 years and is therefore a huge financial risk   if the money you are asking for is to complete product development then that risk factor just went up radically as you are n't even talking about sales   if the money is purely for the sales channel then it 's likely not enough however if you know what it 's going to take to get that first sale and have at least an educated idea on how much it 's going to cost to repeat that then you should have an idea for how much money you want   from there you need to decide how much of the business it is worth to you to give up in order to get that money and voila you have a pre money valuation the real trick will be to convince the vc that you are right which takes research and a rock solid presentation and negotiating from there   no matter what offer a small percentage of the business for the money you want and realize you 'll likely give up much more than that a few things you should know usually by year 3 it 's apparent if a start up is going to work out or not   you 're in year 2 with no sales that does n't look good unless you are building a physical product have a competent team with hard experience doing this have patents at least filed a proven test product and hopefully have a few pre orders and just need cash to deliver   although in that situation i 'd probably tell you to ask your friends and family before talking to a vc   even would be better    $ 200k just is n't a lot of money and should be very easy to raise from friends or angels   if you ca n't then that speaks volumes to an institutional vc   a plus is having two or three people financially invested in the company more than that is sometimes a problem while having only 1 is a red flag if it 's a web thing and you 've been doing this for 2 years with zero sales and still need another $ 200k to complete it then i 'd say you need to take a hard look at what you 've built and take it to market right now   if you ca n't do that then i 'd say it might be time to abandon this idea and move on as you 'll likely have to give up 80%+ to get that $ 200k and most vcs i 've run into would n't bother at that level   which begs the question how did the conversation with the vc start   did you approach them or did they approach you   if the latter how did they even find out about you   do they actually know anything about you or is this a fishing expedition   if the latter then this is probably a complete waste of your time the above is only a rough guide because at the end of the day something is only worth what someone else is willing to pay   $ 200k in cash is a tiny sum for most vcs so without more information i have no clue why one would be interested in you i put a number of hard questions and statements in here   i do n't actually want you to answer me those are for you to think about   also none of this should n't be taken as a rather it should shock you into a realistic viewpoint and hopefully help you understand how others are going to see your baby    if the vc has done a bit of research and is actually interested in investing then they will bring up all the same things and likely more in order to convince you to give up a very large part of it   the question you have to ask yourself is is it worth it   sometimes it is often it 's not

in the united states the general policy is that the irs would consider it income when you have access to the money i work for a company that has a contract with another company near the end of the year i turn in a time card that has my hours that i worked as of that date because they do n't pay me until early january the money on the check is counted in the new year i could n't touch the money until they issued the check if they had paid me on december 31st it would have counted as the old year even if i only had a short window to have access to it before the year ended it would even count as old year money if i held on to the december check but did n't deposit it until march so it would become income when you could use it so if you could access it via a check or debit card or transfer it to the bank it is now income of course that is in the united states you would need to see what the situation is in singapore the edge cases always depend on the country

nyt a nifty infographic that shows how the s&p 500 performs over various time horizons if you study it for a bit you 'll see that 10 percent is not likely over time that you 'll earn 10 percent annually after inflation most people quoting the higher number are working with numbers before inflation   the above linked chart is misleading in the following sense it groups into five categories who 's boundaries are by percentages of interest but we 'd rather see them clustered by those percentages for example percent falls into the neutral category better than investing in fixed interest securities but still below market average but 7.1 falls into the above average category the effect is that we will treat the neutral color that dominates the long term trend as being somewhere in the middle of 3 7 when i suspect that 's not the case some day i 'll probably make my own version and see how that plays out   so that all said if you look at the 30 year diagonal you can see there 's still quite a bit of variation in returns unfortunately i ca n't turn this into a single number for you but grab a spreadsheet and some market data if you want one

already hit on some of this   it 's hard to explain this to a five year old because there are some fairly abstract concepts involved but here goes    all actual money is debt all of it including monetary gold etc do n't argue with me yet i 'll get to that   imagine a pretend world with no money some kind of primitive or something now let 's invent paper money you ca n't just print a bunch of paper that says people have to give you stuff because nobody would honor it but you could print ious let 's walk through this   let 's say you 're an apple farmer and i 'm a hunter you want some meat but have n't harvested your crops yet you say to me hey go hunt me some meat and i 'll give you 1/10th of my apple harvest in the fall fair enough i give you meat you owe me apples there 's probably a lot of this kind of stuff going on in addition to normal barter in time standard prices start to emerge a deer is worth a bushel of apples or whatever    now let 's say a week later i realize that my kid needs a new pair of shoes more than i need a bushel of apples i come back to you and say   hey remember that bushel of apples you owe me could you write a marker redeemable for one bushel of apples that i can give to the shoemaker in trade for a pair of shoes you say okay and we have invented a transferable note something a lot like money    in time our little starts to figure out that a note redeemable for a bushel of apples can be swapped for all kinds of things the fisherman who does n't even like apples will accept apple certificates in trade for fish because he knows he can trade them to boat builder who loves apples in time you can even start to hire farm workers without giving them anything except a note promising a cut of the future harvest    now you are issuing debt a promise to provide apples the money is a transferable your workers get a promise to provide value equal to a day of farm work or whatever and it 's transferrable so they can use it to buy whatever they want the worker gets fish from the fisherman not in exchange for doing any work or giving him anything he can use but in exchange for an iou that the fisherman can redeem anywhere    so far so good but there are a couple of in the road here on the way to a realistic monetary system that we 'll address separately   what happens if your apple orchard is destroyed in a wildfire suddenly all the notes that everyone has been trading are basically wiped out it did n't go anywhere it 's just gone it does n't exist real value was genuinely destroyed there is no law of the conservation of monetary just as you and i created it by creating transferable debt it can also be genuinely destroyed we 'll get back to this in a minute it gets interesting    the second issue is that in all probability the whole town is not just trading apple certificates i could also issue promises to catch deer the fisherman could issue promises of fish and so on this could get pretty messy especially if you got the notion to issue more apple certificates than you can grow you could buy all kinds of stuff with self issued debt that you could never repay and the town would n't find out until harvest time comes once again value has been destroyed people worked and made stuff and gave you stuff in exchange for something that does n't exist and will never exist all that stuff they made is gone you consumed it and there is nothing to show for it   the above two concerns are likely to become manifest in our village sooner or later and probably sooner   this leads to the question of credit which is at its most basic a measure of every time you issue an apple certificate you are borrowing with a promise to repay from future apple    after the first couple of town scandals people will start taking a closer look at the credibility of the issuer let 's say the town potato farmer comes up with a scheme where his potato certificates are actually issued by some credible third party say the town priest or whatever who starts every growing season with a book of numbered certificates equal to the typical crop yield and no more and keeps half of the certificate on file issuing the other half now there is an audit trail and a very credible system that is likely to earn the potato grower a lot of credit compared to other farmers in town that means that the potato grower can probably issue more notes at a better exchange rate than some system similarly the town drunk probably wo n't get much value for his certificates promising a ship of gold    now we have something like a credit market emerging and the potato farmer is issuing something closer to what we might call a modern bond   continued in a reply to this post

update unfortunately citibank have removed the standard account option and you have to choose the plus account which requires a minimum monthly deposit of 1800 sterling and two direct debits absolutely there is   i would highly recommend citibank 's plus current account   it 's a completely free bank account available to all uk residents there are no monthly fees and no minimum balance requirements to maintain   almost nobody in the uk has heard of it and i do n't know why because it 's extremely useful for anyone who travels or deals in foreign currency regularly in one online application you can open a sterling current account and deposit accounts in 10 other foreign currencies when i opened mine around 3 years ago you could only open up to 7 accounts at any one time citibank provide a visa card which you can link to any of your multi currency accounts via a phone call to their hotline unfortunately not online which frequently annoys me but i guess you ca n't have everything   for usd and eur you can use it as a visa debit for usd eur purchases for all other currencies you ca n't make debit card transactions but you can make atm withdrawals without incurring an fx conversion best of all for your case a free usd cheque book is also available you can fund the account in sterling and exchange to usd through online banking   the rates are not as good as you would get through an fx broker like xe.com but they 're not terrible either you can also fund the account by usd wire transfer which is free to deposit at citibank but the bank you issue the payment from will likely charge a swift fee so this might not be worth it unless the amount is large enough to justify the fee if by any chance you have a citibank account in the us you can also make free usd transfers in out of this account subject to a daily limit

thinking about the business overall your profit would be since this is a sole proprietorship the taxes are going to depend on your marginal tax rate if you file jointly your income will determine what your marginal tax rate is   if you file separately there likely would n't be any tax on that income since it 's less than the standard deduction but you lose benefits of filing jointly combined exemptions etc so think about how much she would charge what expenses are involved before taxes what the taxes would be on that profit and what the opportunity costs are is it worth time away from the kids hobbies etc for that hobby how much should a hobby business make to make it worth the effort of charging for such services that would fall in the expense section   are you talking about the actual costs tax prep etc or just the hassle of collecting accounting etc   certainly those are a consideration but it 's harder to quantify that   if you can come up with some sort of cost then certainly it would fit in the overall value equation i 'm not sure using additional social security benefits as a gauge is helpful since you would n't see those benefits until you 're of retirement age according to ss and a lot can happen between now and then

a public company should have a link for investor relations which should help provide a trail of basis if this is a matter of company buyout takeover etc   this gets you close but if you do n't have an exact date it will just be close not exact   one clean way out of this assuming the goal is to get rid of the stock and move on is to donate the shares to charity you will take the present value as a deduction and be done you can use a charitable gift fund such as those offered by schwab or fidelity so if say the shares are worth $ 20 k and you typically donate $ 5 k per year the fund lets you do this transaction at once then send to the charities you wish over the next few years

mutual funds buy and sell shares in companies in accordance with   the policies set forth in their prospectus not according to the   individual needs of an investor that is when you invest money in or withdraw money from a mutual fund   the manager buys or sells whatever shares that in the manager 's judgement   will be the most appropriate ones consistent with the investment policies thus a large cap mutual fund manager will not buy the latest hot small cap stock that will likely be hugely profitable he she must choose only between various large capitalization companies some exchange traded funds are fixed baskets of stocks suppose you will not invest in a company x as a matter of principle unless a mutual fund prospectus says that it will not invest in x you may well end up having an investment in x at some time because the fund manager bought shares in x. with such an etf   you know what is in the basket and if the basket does not include stock in x   now it will not own stock in x at a later date some exchange traded funds are constructed based on some index and track the index as a matter of policy thus you will not be investing in x unless x becomes part of the index because standard or poor or russell or somebody changed their minds and the etf buys x in order to track the index finally some etfs are exactly like general mutual funds except that you can buy or sell etf shares at any time at the price at the instant that your order is executed whereas with mutual funds the price of the mutual fund shares that you have bought or sold is the nav of the mutual fund shares for that day which is established based on the closing prices at the end of the trading day of the stocks bonds etc that the fund owns   so you might end up owning stock in x at any time based on what the fund manager thinks about x.

stock trading as opposed to ipo does n't directly benefit the company but it affects their ability to raise additional funds if they 're valued higher they do n't need to sell as many shares to raise a given amount of money   and the stockholders are part owners of the company their votes in annual corporate meetings and the like can add up to a substantial influence on the company 's policies so the company has an interest in keeping them reasonably happy dividends distributing part of the company 's profits to the stockholders are one way of doing so you 're still investing in the company the fact that you 're buying someone else 's share just means you 're doing so indirectly and they 're dis investing at the same time

the only downside is for the agents not you agents especially selling agents prefer the concession over the price reduction for their own interests   they get a commission on a higher purchase price   that and the recorded sales price for the house is a tad higher which incrementally increases the comps for the next sales when we moved the agent conditioned me to get ready to offer a concession should we decide to sell our previous home   we decided to rent that property and have someone else manage it but with regard to your questions the concessions are applied against your closing costs   when we bought our last house they specified caps on the closing costs so money will be typically be withheld or not contractually the concessions are n't a taxable gain   your basis in the property will be higher than if you get a price reduction but the lower basis hopefully means a higher capital gain when you sell

it was the sole creditor we 're trying to avoid here is what i meant to say not the broker him herself   the reason a firm might extend their debt would be to extend their credit into monetary value in the scenario i just discussed and it would more often be the more well known firms that would be the most likely to provide a bond money supply think ibm bonds google bonds cheese board collective bonds tesla motor bonds ge bonds etc   all these firms would find a way to apply their bond funds in a way that would expand their output and make repaying the bonds much more likely just like a normal firm would today   the only difference is that in the mean time that bond becomes a monetary commodity which people can trade for goods and services until it is repaid once repaid people can see that the bond is worth using and the demand for that bond as money will increase just like how the demand for money will increase and that prompts a normal central bank to print more money   which means the firm is safe to take on stable debt again which people can reuse again   the major difference here is that we have a money supply that you can choose to participate in or not and it is up to the consumers of that currency how the money supply flows as opposed to a central authority   it does matter who 's first in line to get the new money in any economy and with multiple policies competing power is less concentrated

banks can not survive without the government   once people lose faith in the the banking system will fail   the banking system failing is a symptom of the issue not a cause   the banks protects the general populace and prevents runs which will actually destroy the banking system   the burden shifts from the banks to the government   but a is not an actual payment   the banks still operate as normal without any cash from the government but with the knowledge that if they are over extended the government will take on their debt   the government lowers the rates that the banks pay to raise debt to continue to operate   so let 's say piigs fully bail out their banking system paying off all debt that 's worse case   where does the money come from    revenues aka taxes   if the gov't takes on the bank debt and has revenue no problem a little less hand outs but the country as a whole benefits from having a functioning banking system   if revenues are poor or negative however it 's just adding to the deficit   gov't can print money do n't forget    but if revenues are poor and there 's no hope to see them improve boom all hell breaks loose and you get europe

a derivative in finance is simply any asset whose value is based on the value of another asset or based on the value of a group of assets a derivative contract is a type of contract usually a standardized contract with specific payout instruction based on the price changes of a different asset the basic idea is that it becomes easier to make a claim to an asset or property and profit from this claim without needing to physically transfer it or even the title to said asset and use much less capital to do so reduce risk they become problematic when multiple people may have claims to the real asset or when the value of the derivatives changes very quickly or are hard to calculate there are also liquidity problems the further you get from the real asset this is not a problem for all kinds of derivatives contracts and you must recognize that derivatives are used colloquially in a way that has nothing to do with reality to cause fear in people investors that are not financially savvy many derivatives also have dubious or no economic purposes such that regulators do n't allow them to be traded since they ca n't see how it is different from gambling this is seen in financial markets that are less liberalized or cultures with backgrounds typically the trick is to convince regulators that the derivative or financial product helps with reducing risk and hedging and it will get approved i 've mentioned some terminology but this depends specifically on what kind of derivatives contract you become interested in swaps credit default swaps futures options options on futures leveraged exchange traded funds inverse leveraged exchange traded funds warrants and more all have their own terminology how to trade them in a simulation it all depends on which financial product you really become interested in

for a time period as short as a matter of months commercial paper or bonds about to mature are the highest returning investments as defined by benjamin graham   an investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return operations not meeting these requirements are speculative there are no well known methods that can be applied to cryptocurrencies or forex for such short time periods to promise safety of principal the problem is that with $ 1,500 it will be impossible to buy any worthy credit directly and hold to maturity besides the need for liquidity eats up the return risk adjusted   the only alternative is a bond etf which has a high probability of getting crushed as interest rates continue to rise so that fails the above criteria the only alternative for investment now is a short term deposit with a bank for speculation anything goes the best strategy is to take the money and continue to build up a financial structure saving for risk adjusted and time discounted future annual cash flows   after the average unemployment cycle is funded approximately six or so years then long term investments should be accumulated internationally diversified equities

i second 's suggestion to wait and save a larger down payment   i 'll also add it looks like you neglected to consider cmhc insurance in your calculation   when you buy your first home with less than 20 down the bank will require you to insure the mortgage cmhc insurance protects the bank if you default it does not protect you   but such insurance does make a bank feel better about lending money to people it otherwise would n't take a chance on the kicker is you would be responsible for paying the cmhc insurance that 's protecting the bank   the premium is usually added on to the amount borrowed since a buyer requiring cmhc insurance does n't by definition have enough money up front   the standard cmhc premium for a mortgage with 5 down or as they would say a 95 loan to value ratio is 2.75   refer to cmhc 's table of premiums here so if you had a down payment of $ 17,000 to borrow a remaining $ from the bank to buy a $ property the money you owe the bank would be $ due to the added 2.75 cmhc insurance premium this added $ plus interest obviously makes the case for buying less compelling   then are there other closing costs that have n't been fully considered one more thing i ought to mention have you considered saving a larger down payment by using an rrsp   there 's a significant advantage doing it that way you can save pre tax dollars for your down payment when it comes time to buy you 'd take advantage of the home buyer 's plan hbp and get a tax free loan of your own money from your rrsp you 'd have 15 years to put the money back into your rrsp last after saving a larger downpayment if you 're lucky you may find houses not as expensive when you 're ready to buy   i acknowledge this is a speculative statement and there 's a chance houses may actually be more expensive but there is mounting evidence and opinion that real estate is currently over valued in canada   read here here and here

the benefit is that your earnings in the 401k are not subject to income tax until you make withdrawals this allows you to grow your money faster than if you made equivalent investments in a taxable account and had to pay taxes on dividends and capital gains along the way also the theory is that you will be in a lower tax bracket in retirement and thus you will pay lower taxes overall if this is not true especially if you will be in a higher tax bracket in retirement then there may not be any advantage for you to contribute to a 401k one advantage over the traditional ira is the higher contribution limit some 401k plans also allow you to take loans from the plan i do n't think this is possible with a traditional ira an alternative to both the 401k and traditional ira is the roth version of either plan with a roth you pay taxes up front but your withdrawals during retirement are tax free

the statistic you cited comes from the federal reserve board 's survey of consumer finances a survey that they do every three years most recently in 2013   this was reported in the september 2014 issue of the federal reserve bulletin   they list the percentage of americans with any type of debt as in 2013 down slightly from in 2010 the bulletin also has a table with a breakdown of the types of debt that people have and primary residence mortgages are at the top of the list   so the answer is yes the 75 statistic includes americans with home mortgages the bigger question is are you really in debt if you have a home mortgage   the answer to that is also yes   when you take out a mortgage you really do own the house   you decide who lives there you decide what changes you are going to make to it and you are responsible for the upkeep   but the mortgage debt you have is secured by the house   this means that if you refuse to pay the bank is allowed to take possession of the house   they do n't even get the whole house though they will sell it to recoup their losses and give you back whatever equity you had in the house after the loan is satisfied is it good debt   many people think that if you are borrowing money to purchase an appreciating asset the debt is acceptable   with this definition a car loan is bad credit card debt is very bad and a home mortgage might be okay   even dave ramsey radio host and champion of the debt free lifestyle is not opposed to home mortgages   home mortgages allow people to purchase a home that they would otherwise be unable to afford interestingly according to the bulletin credit card balances were only included as debt for the survey purposes if there was a balance after the most recent bill was paid not including purchases made after the bill   so people that do not carry a balance on their credit card were not considered in debt in this statistic

i think the dividend fund may not be what you re looking for you mentioned you want growth not income but i think of dividend stocks as income stocks not growth they pay a dividend because these are established companies that do not need to invest so much in capex anymore so they return it to shareholders in other words they are past their growth phase these are what you want to hold when you have a large nest egg you are ready to retire and just want to make a couple percent a year without having to worry as much about market fluctuations the etf you mentioned and other small caps are i think what you are after i recently made a post here about the difference between index funds and active funds the difference is very small that is in any given year many active etfs will beat them many wo nt it depends entirely on the market conditions at the time under certain conditions the small caps will outperform the s&p definitely however under other conditioned such as global growth slowdown they are typically the first to fall based on your comments like how you mentioned you do nt want to sell i think index funds should make up a decent size portion of your portfolio they are the safest bet long term for someone who just wants to buy and hold that s not to say they need be all do a mixture diversification is good as time goes on do nt be afraid to add bond etfs either this will protect you during downturns as bond prices typically rise under slow growth conditions and sometimes even under normal conditions like last year when tlt beat the s&p

how would having a 20 down payment change the conversation for you   and who are you looking to get a mortgage from   if you go to a local community bank or credit union you might have a better chance explaining your situation and having them take that into account rather than going to one of the mega banks bank of america chase wells fargo etc who may only look at your fico score when making a lending decision the thing to keep in mind is how much of a risk are you to the lending institution   if you have a strong down payment 15 to 20 you will be a much better candidate   bear in mind anything less than 20 down will require pmi private mortgage insurance which i think runs a certain dollar amount per $ 1k you have borrowed   if you have a strong downpayment and the only debts you have are your student loans which will be paid off in five years anyway then you are far less risky than someone in a similar situation with more debt

it 's not my industry so i may be wrong but i do n't believe there are any transactions or companies that would provide a worthwhile comparable hence my problem with the valuation attempt for the same reasons you would n't use a p e multiple or model on a startup you do n't just pick tangential comparables and slap a value on it if you 're seriously advising companies that shit will land you in court defending your valuation   it 's not a floor just because you know it 's inaccurate it 's irrelevant quite frankly i do n't think they released any value let alone $ 1bn   it 's merely a pr move with the hope that tesla 's technology will become the standard for all evs   at best major companies decide to use some of their patents in good faith and leverage the infrastructure that tesla has already put in place    at worst tesla still did not give away $ 1bn in value how much have they made off of licensing their patents how much have others offered for their patents how many companies are and how many lawsuits have they won from going after them if you ca n't put a hard figure on any of those or a solid rationale on how the patents are the only reason they 'll be able to gain market share then i do n't see how we can conclude on $ 1bn given away

going off hearsay here i believe your question is does not having a credit card lower your credit score if that is the question then in the uk at least the answer appears to be yes having a credit card makes you less of a risk because you have proven that you can handle a little bit of debt and pay it back i have a really tiny credit history never had a credit card and the only people who will lend to me are my own bank because they can actually see my income expenditure when i have my bank and at stores offering credit they have said that no credit history is n't far off a bad credit record simply having a credit card and doing the odd transactions show 's lenders you are at least semi responsible and is seen as a positive not having a credit card and not having much else for that matter makes you an unknown and an unknown is a risk in the eyes of lenders

inflation refers to the money supply think of all money being air in a balloon inflation is what happens when you blow more air in the balloon deflation is what happens when you let air escape inflation may cause prices to go up however there are many scenarios possible in which this does not happen for example at the same time of inflation there might be unemployment making consumers unable to pay higher prices or some important resource oil may go down in price due to political reasons war has ended etc compensating for the money having less value   similarly peoples wages will tend to rise over time they have to otherwise everyone would be earning less due to inflation however again there are many scenarios in which wages do not keep up with inflation or rise much faster in fact over the past 40 years or so us wages have not been able to keep up with inflation making the average worker poorer than 40 years ago at its core inflation refers to the value of the money itself as all values of other products services assets etc are expressed in terms of money which itself also changes value this can quickly become very complex most countries calculate inflation by averaging the price change of a basket of goods that are supposed to represent the average joe 's spending pattern however these methods are often criticized as they would be hiding inflation the hidden inflation may come back later to bite us

well that 's probably not even all of it if that stranger did his taxes properly then he already paid about a third of it to the government because wherever he got it from it was income for him and thus it must have been taxed now the remainder is in your hands and yes according to us law it is now your income and so now you too must pay about a third of it to the government and yes you are supposed to explain where it came from be careful giving it to somebody else or it 'll be taxed yet again disclaimer i am not a us citizen

yes except many many still owe debt on assets they purchased in the icelandic dollar before it collapsed   now many are stuck with homes vehicles etc on which they owe twice the underlying value   you 'll often see this referred to as private debt in financial news articles and it is not reported on nearly enough   just letting the banks fail does n't unwind all of the ridiculous currency speculation that took place in iceland   they may be on their way to recovery eventually but they 're still in terrible shape in the short term

this makes no sense because if those people did not eat those carbs they would have converted the fat into energy instead of storing it    both contribute to your calorie intake and unfortunately in western cuisine carbs also happen to generally come with a high amount of fat to flavour it eg chips mash pasta certain sandwiches and burgers etc

as i said i try to eat local instead of going to applebees i 'll hit the diner or hole in the wall burrito joint twice the food for half the price and it 's orders of magnitude better both in terms of and flavor it also supports friends neighbors local economy there are a number of local establishments that get my business over big box national chains   i do n't think the applebees food type is below millenials experience wise i actually think it 's not up to their standards from health tbh maybe i 'm missing what you 're saying though millenials in general have been raised to have higher food standards and expectations the entitlement gen where quality and health matter at least that 's how it is in my neck of the woods   a 's pizza opened up a few years ago and we visited often pizza was eh but all you can eat for 6 bucks sure why not a opened next door around the same time guess which one is still there hint it 's not the pizza despite it being more product for a lower price than literally anything at the salad place

dividend yields can also reflect important information about the company 's status for example a company that has never lowered or stopped paying dividends is a strong company because it has the cash earnings power to maintain its dividend regardless of the market ideally a company should pay dividends for at least 10 years for an investor to consider the company as a consistent payer furthermore when a company pays dividend it generally means that it has more cash than it can profitably reinvest in the business so companies that pay dividends tend to be older but more stable an important exception is reit 's and their ilk to avoid taxation these types of funds must distribute 90 of their earnings to their shareholders so they pay very high dividends just look at stocks like or to get an idea the issue here however is two fold so a high dividend can be great if it has been paid consistently or risky if the company is new or has a short payment history and dividends can also tell us about what the company 's status is   lastly taxation on dividend income is higher than taxation on capital gains but by reinvesting dividends you can avoid this tax and lower your potential capital gain amount thus limiting taxes   is an excellent paper on dividend yields and investing
