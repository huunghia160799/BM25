especially considering it has a mortgage on it technically a home    equity loan on my primary residence i 'm not following does it have a mortgage on it or your primary residence a different property was used as a security for the loan if it is heloc from a different property then it is really your business what to do with it you can spend it all on casinos in vegas for all that the bank cares is this a complicated transaction any gotchas i should be aware of    before on it obviously you should talk to an attorney and a tax adviser but here 's my two cents do n't fall for the incorporate in nevada delaware wyoming some other lie trap you must register in the state where you live and in the state where the property is incorporating in any other state will just add complexity and costs and will not save you anything whatsoever 2.1 state taxes some states tax llcs for example in california you 'll pay at least $ 800 a year just for the right of doing business if you live in california or the property is in california you will pay this if you decide to set up an llc 2.2 income taxes make sure to not elect to tax your llc as a corporation the default for llc is disregarded status and it will be taxed for income tax purposes as your person i.e. irs does n't care and does n't know about it and most states as well if you actively select to tax it as a corporation there 's such an option it will cost you very dearly so do n't and if someone suggest such a thing to you run away from that person as fast as you can mortgages it is very hard to get a mortgage when the property is under the llc if you already have a mortgage on that property the property is the one securing the loan it may get called once you transfer it into llc since from bank 's perspective that would be transferring ownership local taxes transferring into llc may trigger a new tax assessment if you just bought the property that will probably not matter much if it appreciated you may get hit with higher property taxes there are also many little things once you 're a llc and not individual you 'll have to open a business bank account will probably need a new insurance policy etc etc these do n't add much to costs and are more of an occasional nuisance

i was wondering how do we calculate the total capital of a company which items should i look for in the financial statements total capital usually refers to the sum of long term debt and total shareholder equity both of these items can be found on the company 's balance sheet this is one of the calculations that 's traditionally used when determining a company 's return on capital   i 'll use the balance sheet from gilead sciences 2012 10-k form as an example net long term debt was $ and total stockholder equity was $ which should give a grand total of $ for total capital i know you can do the math but i always find an example helpful if it uses realistic numbers   you may sometimes hear the term total capital referring to total capital stock or total capital assets in which case it may be referring to physical capital i.e. assets like inventory etc instead of financial capital leverage and how do i calculate notes payable is the same as accounts payable as the word payable suggests both are liabilities however i 've always been taught that accounts payable are debts a business owes to its suppliers while notes payable are debts a business owes to banks and other institutions with which it has signed a formal agreement and which use formal debt instruments e.g. a loan contract this definition seems to match various articles i found online   on a balance sheet you can usually determine notes payable by combining the short term debt of the company with the current portion of the long term debt these pieces comprise the debt that is due within the fiscal year in the balance sheet for gilead sciences i would only include the $ categorized as current portion of long term debt and other obligations net term since the other current liabilities do n't look like they would involve formal debt contracts   since the notes payable section of 's balance sheet does n't seem that diverse and therefore might not make the best example i 'll include the most recent balance sheet monsanto as monsanto 's balance sheet lists a term called short term debt including current portion of long term debt with a value of $ 36 million this looks like almost the exact definition of notes payable 1 note that this financial statement is called a statement of consolidated financial position on monsanto 's

you can not do this as per the reasons mentioned by others above mainly foreign banks can not hold mortgages over properties in other countries   if this was possible to do do n't you think many others would be applying overseas for mortgages and loans and even if it was possible the overseas bank would give you a comparative rate to compete with the rates already offered in australia to compensate with the extra risks if you can not afford to purchase a property at record low rates of below 5 in australia then you may want to re think your strategy

in general you can only be charged for services if there is some kind of contract the contract does n't have to be written but you have to have agreed to it somehow however it is possible that you entered into a contract due to some clause in the home purchase contract or the contract with the home owners association there are also sometimes services you are legally required to get such as regular inspection of heating furnaces though i do n't think this translates to automatic contracts but in any case you would not be liable for services rendered before you entered into the contract which sounds like it 's the case here

in general following the w-4 instructions should result in withholdings that are fairly close to the amount of taxes that you will owe for the year particularly if your situation is relatively claiming less withholdings than the form suggests can help ensure that you end up saving money in your interest free irs savings account and get a refund at the end of the year which some people prefer so they do n't need to budget separately for a tax payment i 'm guessing that the hr employee either prefers doing so himself or has on occasion received complaints from other employees that they did n't take enough out personally i 'd prefer to claim as many withholdings as i can and be sure to have some money aside in case it turns out that i have to owe a little bit since it means i get more take home pay throughout the year it 's good to keep in mind that a w-4 is n't written in stone if it turns out that too much or too little is being taken out you can always change it you can also try playing around with the irs withholding calculator to try some scenarios

the sale of shares on vesting matters in a way similar to how reinvested dividends are taxed but the newly purchased fund shares basis has to be increased you need to be sure to have the correct per share cost basis it 's easy to confuse the total rsu purchase with the correct numbers only what remained   the vesting stock is a taxable event ordinary income   you then own the stock at that cost basis a sale after that is long or short term and the profit is the to extent it exceeds that basis   the fact that you got these shares in 2013 means you should have paid the tax then and this is part two of the process of course the partial sale means a bit of math to calculate the basis of what remained

it would be preferable to purchase a bond with a negative yield if the negative yield was the smallest compared to similar financial securities the purchase or sale of a security is rarely a mutually exclusive event   an individual may have personal reasons or a desire to contribute to the activity the bond is financing   to an entity the negative yield bond may be part of a cost averaging plan diversification strategy a single leg of a multi leg transaction or possibly to aid certainty as a hedge in a pairs trade   and of course there may be other unique situations specific to the entity said another way is the queen of a good card   it depends on the game being played and what is in your hand

you re assuming that gdp shows the amount of wealth created and is an indicator of the standard of living but it is not govt spending adds to gdp but takes away from the productive of the private sector which is the part of the economy that is making things that people want and need the govt can spend 1 trillion on building a to obama and that would increase gdp by 1 trillion but no wealth is created and the govt shift a trillion of tax revenues to the workers who built the if a company spends 1 trillion building building some new gadget then the people who spend money to buy i have something to show for it and the workers have their wages as well so now the company makes back 1.2 trillion and the consumers have their gadget ie real wealth has been created    the wealthy may be on of cash but its not just sitting under their mattress its spread out between investments and savings savings is to build up productive capabilities the money the rich have sitting in banks is being used to help other businesses grow not just collecting dust i wish it were as simple as giving every poor person 10 grand and watching the economy take off remember when bush gave everyone a 1000 tax refund it sure was fun blowing that on a ps3 i ca nt argue with that but prosperity can not be printed it must be earned through hard work and productive activity what we need is not monetary stimulus we need the govt to stop the private sector with burdensome regulations and taxes we need lower barriers to entry so we maximize competition in every industry we need the govt spending less and pushing more workers into the private sector making things that american can get some utility from its not going to be a smooth ride getting there there will be lots of lay offs in the short run as the economy but if the govt got out of the way and let the free market prosper our society would be far better off in the future

you will not necessarily incur a penalty   you can potentially use the annualized income installment method which allows you to compute the tax due for each quarter based on income actually earned up to that point in the year   see publication 505 in particular worksheet 2 9   form 2210 is also relevant as that is the form you will use when actually calculating whether you owe a penalty after the year is over on my reading of form 2210 if you had literally zero income during the first quarter you wo n't be expected to make an estimated tax payment for that quarter as long as you properly follow the annualized income installment method for future quarters   however you should go through the calculations yourself to see what the situation is with your actual numbers

it 's generally a bad idea to use low risk credit low risk in sense you 're practically guaranteed to be forced to pay it off to buy high risk shares in optimistic scenario the profit from shares would be higher than your credit percentages in less optimistic scenario you come with nothing in worse scenario you have worthless shares and another credit to pay   if your only problem is the non profitable property you can always sell it and get rid of negative cash flow it wo n't affect your quality of life negatively in your high risk scenario you trade the opportunity for a bit better life with for a risk of turning it into disaster for you and your family

in many most cases luxury cars are leased rather than purchased so the payments on even an expensive car might not be as high as you 'd expect for simplicity take a $ 100,000 car if you were to buy that in cash or do a standard five year auto loan that would be incredibly expensive for all but the wealthiest of people but a lease is different when you lease a car you are financing the car 's depreciation over the lease term so let 's suppose that you 're signing up for a three year lease the car manufacturer will make an estimate of what that car will be worth when you bring it back in three years this is called the residual value if this number is $ 80,000 that means the is only financing the $ 20,000 difference between the car 's price and its residual value after three years rather than the full $ 100,000 msrp at the end of the lease he or she just turns the car back in luxury cars are actually especially amenable to leasing because they have excellent brand power just because of the name on the hood there are many people who would be happy to pay a lot for a three year old mercedes or bmw with a or low range car the brand is not as powerful and used cars have a lower residual value as a percentage of the msrp than luxury cars so do n't look at an $ 80,000 luxury car and assume that the owner has paying for the entire $ 80,000

new car loans used car loans and refinances have different rates because they have different risks associated with them different levels of ability to recoup losses if there is a default and different customer profiles   i 'm assuming third party lender for all of these questions not financing the dealer arranges as that has other considerations built into it a new car loan is both safer to some extent as the car is a known risk having no risk of damage etc prior to purchase but also harder to recoup losses because new cars immediately devalue significantly while used cars keep more of their value   thus the aprs are a little different in general for the same amount a new car will be a bit lower apr but of course used car loans are typically lower amounts refinance is also different customer profile wise the customer who is refinancing in these times is likely someone who is a higher risk as why are they asking for a loan when they 're mostly paid off their car   otherwise it 's fairly similar to a used car though probably a bit newer than the average used car

executive summary it sounds like the merchant just did an authorization then cancelled that authorization when you cancelled the order so there was never an actual charge so you 'll never see an actual refund and there 's no money to claim more detail from your second paragraph it sounds like they just did an authorization but never posted the transaction a credit card authorization is basically the merchant asking your credit card company does have enough credit to pay this amount and if so please reserve that amount for a bit the authorization will decrease the total credit you have available on the card but it 's not actually a charge so if your billing cycle ends it wo n't show up on your statement depending on which company issued your credit card you may be able to see the authorization online usually labelled something like pending transactions even if your credit card company does n't show pending transactions you 'll see a decrease in your available credit however you should n't see an increase in your balance the next step and the only way the original merchant gets paid is for the merchant to actually post a transaction to your card then it becomes a real charge that will show up on your next credit card statement and you 'll be expected to pay it unless you dispute the charge but that 's a different issue if the charge is for the same amount as the authorization the authorization will go away it 's now been converted to an actual charge if the amounts are different or the merchant never posts a transaction the authorization will be removed by your credit card company automatically after a certain amount of time so it sounds like you placed the order the merchant did an authorization to make sure you could pay for it and to reserve the money but then you cancelled the order before the merchant could post the transaction so you were never really charged for it the merchant then cancelled the authorization going by the start of your third paragraph so there was never an actual transaction posted you were never charged and you never really owed any money your available credit went down for a bit but now should be restored to what it was before you placed the order you 'll never see an actual refund reflected on your credit card statement because there was no actual transaction

second mortgages were also a popular way for home buyers without a down payment to borrow 100 of the money but avoid certain extra fees if they borrowed all the money from a single lender for example to borrow $ 100,000 on a house would incur something called pmi private mortgage insurance   so to borrow $ 100,000 to buy my house my payment might be $ 800/month but i would have an additional $ 100/month of pmi to pay   these numbers are totally made up and not based in math in any way so instead of that borrows might get a first mortgage for $ 80,000 so they do n't have to pay the pmi and get a second mortgage for the difference   this can be beneficial if the second mortgage payment is less than the pmi for borrowing 100 as far as i know they are n't as easy to get these days like any loan you need to be qualified and i think 100 financing is probably harder to come by   the negative connotation is no worse than any other loan   i am personally against borrowing money but if you had big medical expenses major home repairs or some other emergency i could see it justified   probably not for a big vacation or for new car though

you most definitely can invest such an amount profitably but it makes it even more important to avoid fees um at all costs because fees tend to have a fixed component that will be much worse for you than for someone investing € 200k so   edit the above assumes that you actually want to invest in the long run for modest but relatively certain gains maybe 5 above inflation while accepting temporary downswings of up to 30 if those € 2000 are funny money that you do n't mind losing but would be really excited about maybe getting 100 return in less than 5 years well feel free to put them into an individual stock of an obscure small company but be aware that you 'd be gambling not investing and you can probably get better quotes playing roulette

ah i got ya i partially agree with you but it 's far more complex i think that is simplifying the debate a bit too much when people go passive you are making the assumption that they are able to stay fully invested the full time period say 30 40 years until retirement when you might change the asset allocation this is not a fair assumption because many studies on behavioral finance have shown that people 90 plus are not able to sit tight through a full market cycle and often sell out during a bear market i 'm not debating you 're point that passive often outperforms due to the fees although there are many managers that do outperform but the main issue with self managing and passive investing is people usually make emotional decisions which then hurts their long term performance this would be the reason to hire an adviser assuming that people are able to stay passive the entire time and not make a single active decision is a very unfair assumption there was a good study on this referenced in forbes article below   another issue is that there are a lot active managers that really just replicate their benchmarks and do n't actually actively manage if you look at active managers who really do have huge under weights and over weights relative to their benchmarks they actually tend to outperform them look at the study below by martin he 's one of the most highly respected researchers when it comes to investment performance research and the active vs passive debate     i guess what i 'm trying to say is that for most people having an adviser and paying them a 1 fee is usually better than going it alone where they are going to a. chase heat i bet they always choose the hottest benchmark from the past few years and b. make poor emotional decisions relating their finances

there are interpersonal relationships risks which you should consider these are most likely to following a financial problem and depend on your existing relationship   in this answer i 'm going to focus on the financial risks   this is not financial advice but my understanding as someone who has done this this is best thought of as a loan from my parents to myself   the main financial risks for my parents the lenders to avoid these risks i need to ensure that i am sufficient ahead of loan repayments that i have the full amount of principal available to repay at any time    redraw facility while some loans may allow for redraw you should check the fine print of your loan agreement   a redraw is like borrowing from the bank using existing collateral   there could be some circumstances under which the bank does not allow redraw even though you are ahead of loan repayments   this might happen if house prices drop enough that you no longer have equity offset account to avoid this problem the loaned money is best put in an offset account   an offset account reduces the interest on the loan   importantly the money in the offset account is yours   withdrawal from the offset account does not represent a new borrowing but is a withdrawal from savings account   savings are government guaranteed to some figure

in most markets there are fixed fees known as commissions for instance with a retail broker in the stock market you can expect every trade to cost you $ 7.00 as an example it is $ 7.00 regardless of if you place a trade for $ 25 or $ 25,000 you will see that just opening the trade with a smaller amount will eat up all of your profits and a majority of your capital but if you opened the trade with more capital through the investment group then the $ 7.00 commission will be much less of a tax on your trade basically the only advantage is that the tax of commissions will be less if you have a larger account if the commission is a fixed dollar value which is not always true either regardless at $ 25 per month not many markets will be accessible there is also the possible educational aspect of investing with a group of people or it can simply be ideals

diversification is extremely important and the one true free lunch of investing meaning it can provide both greater returns and less risk than a portfolio that is not diversified the reason people say otherwise is because they are talking about true portfolio diversification which can not be achieved by simply spreading money across stocks to truly diversify a portfolio it must be diversified across multiple unrelated return drivers i describe this throughout my best selling book and am pleased to provide complimentary links to the following two chapters where i discuss the lack of diversification from spreading money solely across stocks including correlation tables as well as the benefits of true portfolio diversification jackass investing myth 8 trading is gambling investing is safer jackass investing myth 20 there is no free lunch

gt i 'm not sure how to answer that it 's all just speculation the competition is waiting for the first big mover to do just what tsla is going being the first mover then coming in and wiping the floor with them   it 's very funny that you call an analysis of the current state of the industry speculation and then go on to talk about something you think is going to happen which by the way has had six years to happen and has n't yet   also it 's as if you do n't think first mover advantage exists   six years is a long time to build up a lead especially in automotive where product cycles and development times are so long   gt;if you want to argue that all of the last 30 years of free markets and the value of specialization is wrong go ahead   honestly look up the words vertical integration before continuing the conversation   and the word panasonic as well   gt;they are committing massive capital to old technology that 's a loser play but it will help the industry as a whole and those that are going to come in with the next generation of batteries while tsla is stuck with massive capital in lithium ion   but wait i thought you said they were wrong because actual battery companies are n't involved   and that actual battery companies know better than them   but i guess the actual battery companies do n't actually know anything and they should listen to an idiot on the internet who has so far proven himself to be wrong about everything he 's said   gt;it seems panasonic is not as optimistic about the plant as you are   well again if you listened to the call which is a pretty basic first step to talking about the quarterly results which for some reason you insist on continuing to do despite being completely ignorant of them then you might not be saying such stupid things   panasonic you see is a rather conservative japanese company   this is even mentioned in your article when they talk about plasma displays   this is why they are always measured in their public statements because that 's what japanese companies do   but as specified in the call panasonic 's actions as a partner to tesla have always been excellent   and if you actually bothered to read your own article you would see that they 've committed to 2 billion cells and 200 300 million for the factory   you know an actual battery company   and if you actually bothered to read any other article you would see that that very same quote of yours was followed up with however tesla is a very important partner to us and discussions are continuing we need to look very carefully at auto demand and respond appropriately so of course that means taking a step by step approach to investment   also there have been rumors of talks with lg and samsung should panasonic not decide to partner   i 'm not sure i believe the rumors and also i think they 're unnecessary because panasonic will be a full partner in the gigafactory   they know that tesla has been a huge source of profit for them and their automotive supply i.e. tesla has been one of the best performing parts of their company for some time now   mark my words panasonic 's investment will end up being approximately $ 1 billion all told   you can come back in a few years and check if you like   gt;to keep the sucks putting up money   you mean like an actual battery company   the ones putting up the money   so since your point was so reliant on actual battery companies having expertise and specialization and so on does that mean you 're now dropping that point because you realized your bullshit would n't fly and moving on to another sort of bullshit until one of them sticks   because if you 'd like to fix your ignorance i can help you with that   but if you would n't as seems to be the case it seems somewhat like a waste of time to continue trying to explain basic concepts to you

credit card limits are for the most part soft limits sometimes a credit card will allow you to charge a little over your limit the large amount they allowed you to go over your limit is unusual but not unheard of   it is your responsibility to keep track of how much you charge on your credit card not the bank just like with a checking account you are supposed to keep track of everything you charge so that you always know how much you have spent and can pay it off   raising your limit will not help your problem it would only make it worse you have already charged more than you can afford and they have already effectively raised your limit by $ 1200   i realize that this situation is tough but fortunately you have a learning opportunity here i recommend you resolve to stop using the credit card in this way and work toward paying off your debt to zero at that point treat your credit card as if it was a debit card and only charge what you already have in the bank to pay off right away or just use a debit card and get rid of the credit card learning to do this now will save you lots of money in interest   if you do n't learn to do this you will find yourself in even more debt in the future and it will be even harder to dig yourself out   if you need some more help on getting out of debt and learning to budget your money i recommend the book the total money makeover by dave ramsey

you do n't understand government financing at all   earn revenue aka taxes   they also spend money   the different between the money they spend and they money they earn is the deficit   if you run a deficit for a long period of time you incur a very large national debt   now you can finance aka pay for a deficit by borrowing money   this means you can sell bonds and instead of pay off the debt each year you just pay the interest   if your spending balloons out of control your the likely hood of you paying your debt decreases   if you are very unlikely to payback your debt people wo n't buy any more of your bonds and you no longer have the income from borrowing to pay off your interest from other debt you owe or what ever other obligations you own think mortgage payments or teachers salaries etc   here 's were europe and usa differ european nations ca n't just print money   they can issue more debt but they ca n't just create more euros   if you can print money you can pay off your debt with money you literally created out of thin air at the expense of your people this is called inflation   but this is a form of cheating eventually people wo n't trust you and wo n't buy your debt either   so where do the banks come in   if the government is sound and the banks are not the government can backstop the banks   this is what the us and uk did   greece spain ireland all had to back stop their banks also   however greece spain and and italy and portugal also have    1   a lot of debt   2   structurally high deficits   3   extremely high borrowing costs high interest rates because people do n't trust them because   4   weak underlying economies   the fourth point gets you in real trouble   if you have high entitlements lots of out of work who the hell is paying taxes and what are they going to   you have no revenue   remember a govt works just like a household   it is easy for a good household to support one member but it is difficult for a member to support an irresponsible household

but how does the quantity matching happen for example if i want to buy 1000 shares at $ 100 but there is only one seller to sell 10 shares at $ 100 what happens then this depends on the type of order you 've placed if you placed a fill or kill order your order to buy or sell a certain number of shares is routed to the trading floor for immediate execution if the order can not be immediately filled it is cancelled killed automatically note that the order must be filled in its entirety partial fills are not allowed in your example your buy order would n't be filled because it could n't be matched to a sell order of the same volume this is similar to an all or none order which is an order that contains   a condition instructing the broker to fill the order completely or not at all if there is insufficient supply to meet the quantity requested by the order then it is canceled at the close of the market in this case if your order was n't matched to an order of the same volume by the time the market closes it 's cancelled if you simply placed a market limit order and in the case of the limit order part of your order was matched to another order with the right price that part of your order will be filled while the rest will remained unfilled

question 1 how do i start or the broker problem get an online broker   you can do a wire transfer to fund the account from your bank question 2 what criticism do you have for my plan dividend investing is smart   the only problem is that everyone 's currently doing it   there is an demand for yield not just individual investors but investment firms and pension funds that need to generate income to fund retirements for their clients   as more investors purchase the shares of dividend paying securities the share price goes up   as the share price goes up the dividend yield goes down   same for bonds   for example if a stock pays $ 1 per year in dividends and you purchase the shares at $ then your yearly return not including share price fluctuations would be 1/20 = 5   but if you end up having to pay $ 30 per share then your yearly return would be or 3.3 yield   the more money you invest the bigger this difference becomes with $ 100 k invested you 'd make about $ 1.6 k more at 5   btw do n't put all your money in any small group of stocks you want to diversify   etfs work the same way where new investors buying the shares cause the custodian to purchase more shares of the underlying securities thus driving up the price up and yield down   instead of etfs i 'd have a look at something called closed end funds or cefs which also hold an underlying basket of securities but often trade at a discount to their net asset value unlike etfs   cefs usually have higher yields than their etf counterparts   i ca n't fully describe the ins and outs here in this space but you 'll definately want to do some research on them to better understand what you 're buying and how to successfully buy ie make sure you 're buying at a historically steep discount to nav and where to screen regardless of whether you decide to buy stocks bonds etfs cefs sell puts or some mix the best advice i can give is to a diversify personally with a single rare exception i never let any one holding account for more than 2 of my total portfolio value and b space out your purchases over time   b is important because we 've been in a low interest rate environment since about 2009 and when the risk free rate of return is very low investors purchase stocks and bonds which results in lower yields   as the risk free rate of return is expected to finally start slowly rising in 2017 and gradually over time there should be gradual downward pressure ie selling on the prices of dividend stocks and especially bonds meaning you 'll get better yields if you wait   then again we could hit a recession and the central banks actually lower rates which is why i say you want to space your purchases out

i 'll summarize here our discussion in the comments first thing to remember is that you can only deposit up to $ 6k year into the roth ira you can not seed it with some large amount unless its a rollover second thing to remember is that you can only qualify 10 k distribution for the home purchase with that in mind it seems that you 'll have to have high returns to make use of the maximum tax benefit 15 20 of the 10 k non qualified distributions will be taxed at ordinary income rates + 10 penalty so if you ca n't qualify the distribution instead of saving money on taxes you 'll end up paying twice as much as you would have without the ira also keep in mind that reporting of the distributions and justifying the qualifications might require assistance of a tax preparer which will also reduce your savings bottom line imho you 'll end up with a wash or very insignificant savings compared to the magnitude of the home purchase costs at best which renders the whole thing kindof

i think you are mixing two different concepts here the average investor in the quoted reference means an average single investor like you or like me the average investor consistently under performs the market however you then ask the question and you seem to refer to all investors as a group individuals institutions investment banks et al since together investors own 100 of the stock in every company every investor could match the performance of the market easily and at low fees by simply buying an s&p index fund and holding it in fact some investors can even beat the market with the addition of some stocks here is the ten year chart of berkshire hathaway b compared to the s&p 500    there are other examples however few of us have the discipline to do so we read questions here every week about the coming in the market about the next big trend about the next bubble etc the average investor thinks he is smarter than the market and buys on a whim or sells likewise and misses out on the long slow overall growth in the markets finally the title of your question is dalbar how can the average investor lose money i doubt that the average investor loses money in the past several years not making as much money as is easily possible is not at all the same as losing money

i do n't have a direct answer for you but here are some other things you might consider to help you decide on a course of action in addition to joe 's note about consulting a cpa   get a couple contractors out to look the place over and give you some quotes on the work needed most will do so for free or a nominal fee   everything about the extent and cost of repairs is complete guess work until you have some firm numbers you might also consider getting an up to date appraisal particularly if you can find someone willing to give you an after improvements estimate as well   the housing market has fluctuated a bunch in the last couple years your current value may have shifted significantly from where you think it is if you have n't done one recently   you will definitely have to pay for this service i would estimate around $ 500 based on one i got in st louis a few months ago    you might also consider reaching out to a local property management company to find out where they think you would fall in the scope of the current rental market and what improvements they would recommend   you will probably want to be onsite to talk to any of the above people about the work they are proposing and your intended goals so figure some travel costs and time into your evaluation as one of your noted concerns was the state of the roof i can tell you that in st louis county and the spec sheet for most shingle manufacturers you are limited to two layers of shingles then the roof is supposed to be stripped and from the bare wood   personally i wo n't even do the second layer i always go to bare wood and start over if for no other reason than it gives me an opportunity to inspect the deck and deal with any minor problem areas before they become big problems i do n't know county to know what the local code may be like but odds are high that the shingle manufacture would not honor any warranty with this installation another potential gotcha that may be out there is your ex may still have a lingering claim to the home if you go to sell it   i do n't know the rules in missouri off hand but where i grew up with family in the real estate and title insurance businesses there was a law regarding homestead rights   if a spouse spent even one night in a property they had an interest in it and an explicit waiver had to be signed to release said interest   review your divorce settlement and/or contact your attorney to confirm your status in this regard also consider the potential of refinancing your mortgage to either reduce the payment or get funds for the improvements repairs    final note i understand wanting to help out a friend i have done similar things more times than i can count but seriously look at the situation and see if you ca n't get the rent or other compensation up to the level of the mortgage at least    you mentioned that you have belongings still on the property what would a storage unit for said items cost in terms of juggling the numbers you could potentially use that value as justification to adjust the friends rent as a fee without any issue   verify with your cpa talk to the friend and see if there are other parts of the job they would be willing and able to take on as consideration for the reduced rent make sure you have at least a simple contract on any such agreement    or if none of the above are sufficient to balance the numbers see if they would be willing to take on an actual room mate to help make up the difference

who determines company value at ipo the owners based on the advice from lead bankers and other independent auditors who would determine the value of the company at the time of listing at times instead of determining a fixed price a range is given lower side and higher side the market participants fi institutional investor segments then decide the price by bidding at an amount there are multiple aspects in play that help the ipo and roles of various parties a quick read of question with ipo tag is recommended edits generally at a very broad level one of the key purpose of the ipo is to either encash owner equity owner wants some profits immediately or raise additional capital more often it is a mix of both if the price is too low one loose out on getting the true value this would go to someone else if the price is too high then it may not attract enough buyers or even there are buyers there is substantial sentiment this is not good for the company read the question from facebook 's perspective was the fall in price after ipo actually an indication that it went well   this puts determining the price of ipo more in the realm of art than science there are various mechanism lead bankers institutional investors underwriters the a company would put in place to ensure the ipo is success and that itself would moderate the price to realistic level more often the price is kept slightly lower to create a positive buzz about the stock

sorry i did n't mean to knock your post   i do think you have valid points   i think it 's great to see discussions on the pros and cons on the vc start up world   my previous work experience was at a start up that made it big sold 90 to news corp at $ 400 mm valuation but was funded by angel investors so it was a different situation   i 'm currently getting my mba now so am looking at the space from both the vc perspective and the start up perspective   vcs can provide real value to start ups and they can also harm them   however no one is forcing the start ups to take vc money most do because it provides a higher probability for a faster path to success   the investment does n't come free obviously as you pointed out   the hours are horrible and you lose significant control   in many situations founders are taken away from the main leadership role   that does n't seem fair   however if someone sold the voting shares of their company they are opting in for that risk   the truth of the matter is that a lot of the people who are amazing at the ideas that birth the start ups are horrible at the day to day management   sometimes vcs step in and make the necessary changes to ensure the best chance at company profitability   is it fair yes   does it suck for the person ousted absolutely   it 's an oversimplification to say this is all bad or all good   it all depends on the situation   however yes there are vcs who are predatory and use their superior knowledge of how business financing and whatever else work to extract as much as they can from their portfolio companies   yet there are also some who honestly love the industry and want to help companies grow     your article 's stance is good because it prompts a discussion   however as i originally felt it does not do it as effectively as it could in my opinion   that 's awesome you got a ton of re tweets but as you say on your blog it 's about substance not the glitter and     edit voting do n't count as glitter and

did n't lose your job you just had temporary employment   same as back in the late 1990 's when unemployment was really low a lot of people got jobs they really were n't qualified for and were paid far more at least on a scale relative to their co workers than they were really worth   the sad thing about that is that they came to believe they were truly worth that amount of money   the same with houses   my home bought in late 2000 increased in estimated market value by 75 i.e. to 175 of it 's previous sale price when i bought it and the bubble around here was n't anything like it was in other regions of the us and of course now it has ostensibly sunk back down to very nearly the price i paid for it   the problem for a lot of people with that is that even if they did n't buy during the peak bubble years they refinanced or based on that higher estimated value and so ended up basically removing and then spending the lion 's share of equity that they had built up in their house   for others it was much the same as the late 90 's employment they came to believe that their house was worth more and they have difficulty letting go of that illusory estimated market price   so they are experiencing the wealth loss effect just as they once experienced a wealth effect   i was saved from those things because    a i realized that the price of houses is always at the margin and is never guaranteed by what the place cost or what you have invested in it or even what the owner or mortgage company thought it was worth rather when you go to sell it will be determined by what the want are capable of paying    b i was far more concerned with what my total cost of buying would be including all of the interest paid on the mortgage this led me to first of all only buy what i needed in a house i.e. single guy = small place and secondly to pay the whole thing off asap which i did dramatically lowering the total lifetime cost of the place    and finally and probably most importantly though in part due to b above   c it does n't really matter to me whether the price goes up or down because i know that i will always need a place to live and that generally speaking due to overall market conditions the prices of all houses will tend to go up down together and though not necessarily in lock step there are always factors of neighborhood local economy housing trends etc but still should i desire to move i will essentially be able to trade my house for a similar one in a similar market with only a small 6 to 10 cost   d but i also know that if i move up market attempt to move to an area house that has a relatively higher demand higher price that i will then have to pay more or get an even smaller place smaller home less land no garage shop etc yet conversely if i for some reason decide to move down market to an area house with a relatively lower demand price i may be able to either pay less or to get slightly more house additional land etc   note i also took into account demographic changes when i bought and think i made the right choice even though it has n't played out yet with the typical household actually becoming smaller single parents fewer kids more retirees wanting to downsize etc i figured way back in 2000 that in 15 20 30 years circa 2015 2045 the big would be aging and in huge oversupply whereas smaller homes would be in relatively higher demand and given things like smart growth planning probably in lesser supply and so would be more likely to retain value   again this has n't played out yet though there definitely are signs that it is starting but i am also really not interested in selling so it 's a moot point at present and even if i am proved wrong it will probably merely prove to be the loss of an upside and not an actual loss per se

exactly that is paying double the money for no better coverage it makes no sense the paperwork when you file a claim will ask you if there is coverage from another policy making the same claim to two different policies without telling them   would be considered insurance fraud for that kind of money the insurance company would be involved with paying the re builder money periodically obviously only one re builder is involved and they would notice if they were getting paid more than was required while you could decide to take the money and not rebuild but that would n't work if you had a mortgage the lender would want their money or force you to rebuild

firstly the banks are far less risky than the people they lend to most of the interest banks charge borrowers covers defaults but banks rarely default to the fed especially those able to borrow from the fed   secondly most banks borrowing is in the form of overnight loans to cover short term reserve fluctuations they are not borrowing dollars to lend to you   thirdly if govt does it 's job of keeping some competition in the banking sector then the rates offered you and me should be near the actual cost to service such loans so are the true value of those loans since there are a significant number of banks that i can borrow from with a multitude of options in how to borrow there is likely still decent competition for my business   finally the fed funds rate is not currently 0 so the banks are not getting interest free money

yeah i guess the entire report is probably false because of that what you 're saying is applicable to the renewable industry too there 's all kinds of other investments made on behalf of renewables that are n't calculated into dollar amounts most obviously is the money that never even hits the books by subsidizing through consumer corporate tax breaks   for example the company you work for more than likely has a recycling program it does n't make money because it 's not profitable to recycle anything but aluminum but if they did n't have the program they would get penalized not directly necessarily but would lose out on green initiative funding    the rest of what you are saying is as intangible as the first thing if you think solar panels on your roof is going to keep the military out of other countries you 're clinical and if you ca n't notice a correlation between the total lack of production coupled with the massive amounts of money being wasted then there 's no discussion to be had    by the by that article has no citations and the link to any additional sourcing is broken

bernie sources   gt heading out to open land to make your society in your image would definitely prove your point as long as it works   and do that how buy my own island sea and hope the us military does n't just drop a seal team on my head   gt;we just have plenty of evidence that no government is less so   no we really have evidence that structure is better than nothing i 'm not advocating for no structure businesses charities organizations etc obviously work better when they are well structured   to answer your enron example no corporation would have enough power to actually do something like that if they did n't have at least partial backing by the government    you know the drill big business buy politicians contributions politicians write big business laws anti competitive to push small guys out then when big business needs additional help politicians come in to save the day bailouts   the market would be extremely more competitive if for example the dodd frank act which to my understanding the repeal just recently passed the house went away it has been community banks just like glass did it essentially only allowed the big banks to compete surprise they did some stupid things great recession but if you do n't think they did n't already know that they those bailouts were coming if needed you are fooling yourself   these messages are almost getting to the point of tldr   i want to simplify our debate a bit   the crux of my whole belief is this the only way for a government to spend their citizens money in a better way than the citizens could would be if the government knew the utility of every single citizen it is absolutely impossible to do that the only people that truly know their own utility from something is them self    from here on i would like to debate the headlines like what i wrote above and not necessarily bullet points we can every now and then but i find that we then start working on tangents of tangents of tangents and can get a little messy   however i do not want to leave the current stones with your response   i would say that if it was privatized you are not going to have scope creep at least not to the same extent say we have the la militia that is wanting to help protect their ports they want to help develop a new boat that is fast and can help maneuver around big ships quickly like a better version of the new mark patrol boat   that money is their money directly or the peoples money who they 've asked to voluntarily give their money up to help protect their area   if they screw up and start asking for above necessary stuff or pick a developer who wastes their money etc they are going to lose business they will stop getting donations lose profit etc   however the government does n't have that why because their revenue donations are n't voluntary there really is n't accountability especially in bureaucracy    to the exchange stock problem i would say that exchanges are private businesses too they should have full reign on whether they allow trades if they believe that there is an unnecessary selloff because of a fake tweet saying that president has been shot they can stop that if fact it would be in there best interest to do so because it could limit unnecessary investor losses   it is unfortunate that the whole world is covered with governments i wish there was another western to populate and try new ways with   however i would say that there is a clear shift away from government is society   a few examples the driverless car elderly people and people who are disabled will be able to rely on the government less for transportation additionally assuming everyone will eventually have a driverless car there will be much less demand for traffic cops etc   cryptocurrency as there are now more and more businesses that stop accepting cash mainly starting with change there will naturally be less robbers because there is no money to steal you could make the argument that there will be an increase in cyber theft which i agree but not on a 1:1 ratio of the decrease in physical this decrease will help also lessen the demand for police officers   package delivery if it was n't for the post office their ability to deliver letters and using they would have gone broke a long time ago imagine amazon dhl ups fedex etc all competing to deliver you letter i 'm assuming that it would be less than the cost of a current stamp and with a lot more assurance that it will actually get to its destination   those are just a few examples

in finance we make a distinction between investments that tend to grow in value and assets that hold value   investments that grow in value are generally related to investing in well thought out businesses   investments can be done in retirement accounts through stocks and bonds but also owning part of a business directly   good investments make more and more money off the money you put in common examples of assets include gold and other non productive property like real estate you do n't rent or cars   you can even have some assets in your retirement account as many would argue government bonds behave like assets   all of these things tend to more or less go up in value as the cost of everything goes up in value but do n't tend to make you any excess money in the long run there is certainly a place for both investments and assets   especially as a young person it is good to lean toward investments as you likely have a lot of time for the money to grow as you get older   as suggests in the united states this is fairly easy as retirement accounts are common there is a long history of stable financial law even in crises   pakistan 's institutions are fairly stable and improving but still assets and investments of all types can be riskier so i recommend taking your father 's advice partially having some assets are good in riskier situations but good investments are generally the way to grow comfortably wealthy   a good mix of the two is the way to grow wealthy slowly while protecting yourself from risk   you your father and your neighbors know you local situation better than i who has only visited a number of pakistan 's neighboring countries so i ca n't really give more detailed advice but hopefully this gets you started

a simple way to ask the question might be to say why ca n't i just use the same trick with my own shares to make money on the way down why is borrowing someone else 's shares necessary to make the concept a viable one why is n't it just the inverse of going long a simple way to think about it is this to make money by trading something you must buy it for less than you sell it for   this applies to stocks like anything else   if you believe the price will go up then you can buy them first and sell them later for a higher price   but if you believe the price will go down the only way to buy low and sell high is to sell first and buy later   if you buy the stock and it goes down any sale you make will lose you money i 'm still not sure i fully understand the point of your example but one thing to note is that in both cases i.e. whether you buy the share back at the end or not you lost money   you say that you made $ 5 on the share price dropping but that is n't true at all you can see in your example that your final account balance is negative in both cases   you paid $ 20 for the shares but only got $ 15 back you lost $ 5 or in the other version of your example paid $ 20 and got back $ 5 plus the depreciated shares if you had bought the shares for $ 20 and sold them for say $ 25 then your account would end up with a positive $ 5 balance that is what a gain would look like   but you ca n't achieve that if you buy the shares for $ 20 and later sell them for less at a guess you seem to be confusing the concept of making a profit with the concept of cutting your losses   it is true that if you buy the shares for $ 20 and sell them for $ 15 you lose only $ 5 whereas if you buy them for $ 20 and sell for $ 10 you lose the larger amount of $ 10   but those are both losses   selling early as the price goes down does n't make you any money it just stops you from losing more money than you would if you sold later

if a company is doing well it seems less likely to go bankrupt   if a company is doing poorly it seems more likely to go bankrupt   the problem is where is the inflection point between well and poorly   when does a company start to head into oblivion   sometimes it is hard to know   but if you do n't call that right and hold onto your shares when a company is tanking others who call it before you do will sell off devalue the share price and now you 've missed your chance to get out at a good profit   if you hang on too long the company may just go bankrupt and you 've lost your investment entirely a healthy profitability of the company therefore has to bolster investor confidence in avoiding this very unpleasant scenario   therefore the more profitable a company is the more shareholder confidence it and the more willing to pay for it in the form of increased share price   and this then has a meta effect in that each shareholder thinks all other investors think this way too and so each feels good about holding the stock since he knows he can likely easily liquidate it for good cash if he needs to either now or in the next year or sometime hence

it depends how detailed you want to get in your calculation but fundamentally 1 k < 25k.    on a very basic level divide the cost less what you sell it for by the time you 'll have the car for   if you junk it $ month = $ to buy tires to have a car for a year if you sell it for $ 1 k then it become $   plus other maintenance etc obviously if you pay 25 k and keep the new car for ten years and sell it for nothing it becomes roughly $ plus maintenance if you want to get more accurate there are a lot of variables you can take into account time cost of money financing maintenance costs of different vehicle types etc

institutions may be buying large quantities of the stock and would want the price to go up after they are done buying all that they have to buy   if the price jumps before they finish buying then they may not make as great a deal as they would otherwise   consider buying tens of thousands of shares of a company and then how does one promote that   also what kind of pr system should those investment companies have to disclose whether or not they have holdings in these companies   this is just some of the stuff you may be missing here the wall street analysts are the investment banks that want the companies to do business through them and thus it is a win win relationship as the bank gets some fees for all the transactions done for the company while the company gets another to try to play up the stock

absolutely superstar employees are a conceived threat to management and managers who know they they are not to the level of those employees and those employees may gain too much power etc pure political games   also once you get rid of a superstar employee you need to hire 10 other people to replace that person who will make a big mess so you need even more managers management and also more employees   it 's very simple   the only reason superstar employees keep their job is the fear of a big mess if they are let go   also never ever promote those superstar employees despite the urgent need for their talent to be transferred to others and use their talent in higher up positions   i am a superstar employee 20 years in my company know things and systems that no one else knows and systems i created are responsible to 90 of sales i am not kidding i am not making up things and yes i can brag i do the work of at least 10 normal employees   despite that i would have been fired long time ago   i did not and will not for next 4 years until my planned retirement when i want to get fired   i am smart to not get fired because i limit the ton and arguments i have with the enemies i am also very passive aggressive i found it much better to let them go their way and watch them and help them fail why do they fail because i know they right way and because i know the right way they will automatically select another way which is doomed   think this comics are actual true and accurate representation of what happens in almost all companies   oh the stories i can tell you i am 20 years in the company and many many brilliant managers came and let go   lastly i am well respected in the company but the enemies who do n't like me make it not so nice at times for me   p s an even bigger superstar employee than me a friend of mine a different company was let go because of politics he told me that his work is now done by 16 new employees and a big mess still going on i am totally believe him and not surprised at all

the same applies if you were looking for a business to buy would you pay more for a business that is doing well making increasing profits year after year or for a business that is not doing so well and is losing money a share in a company is basically a small part of a company which a shareholder can own so would you rather own a part of a company that is increasing profits year after year or one that is continuously losing money someone would buy shares in a company in order to make a better return than they could make elsewhere they can make a profit through two ways first a share of the company 's profits through dividends and second capital gains from the price of the shares going up why does the price of the shares go up over the long term when a company does well and increases profits because when a company increases profits they are making more and more money which increases the net worth of the company more investors would prefer to buy shares in a company that makes increasing profits because this will increase the net worth of the company and in turn will drive the share price higher over the long term a company 's increase in profits creates higher demand for the company 's shares think about it if interest rates are so low like they are now where it is hard to get a return higher than inflation why would n't investors then search for higher returns in good performing companies in the stock market more investors and traders wanting some of the pie creates higher demand for good performing stocks driving the share price higher the demand for these companies is there primarily because the companies are increasing their profits and net worth so over the long term the share price will increase in line with the net worth over the short to medium term other factors can also affect the share price sometime opposite to how the company is actually performing however this is a whole different answer to a whole different question

anyone who claims they can consistently beat the market and asks you to pay them to tell you how is a liar this can not be done as the market adjusts itself there 's nothing they could possibly learn that analysts and institutional investors do n't already know they earn their money through the subscription fees not through capital gains on their beat the market suggestions that means that they do n't have to rely on themselves to earn money they only need you to rely on them they have to provide proof because they can not lie in advertisements but if you read carefully there are many small letters and disclaimers that basically remove any liability from them by saying that they do n't take responsibility for anything and do n't guarantee anything

the main difference between a mutual fund and an etf are how they are bought and sold from the investors perspective an etf is transacted on the open market this means you normally ca n't buy partial shares with your initial investment having to transact on the open market also means you pay a market price the market price is always a little bit different from the net asset value nav of the fund during market hours the etf will trade at a premium discount to the nav calculated on the previous day morningstar 's fund analysis will show a graph of the premium discount to nav for an etf with a mutual fund on the other hand your investment goes to a fund company which then grants you shares while under the hood buying the underlying investments you pay the nav price and are allowed to buy partial shares usually an etf has a lower expense ratio but if that 's equal and any initial fees commissions are equal i would prefer the mutual fund in order to buy partial shares so your initial investment will be fully invested and so you do n't have to worry about paying premium to nav

then we do agree in a sense pensions are an in the modern economy and likely were never a good idea that said i do not agree with putting those owed and promised pensions behind other creditors you would not bring down the credit system you would simply kill what is left of the seriously broken pensions system and punish any company that was fool enough to play games with their pension system    all that said i am not against a bankruptcy court discharging pensions and saying tough to the employees i just want that consideration by the court to happen when whatever is left of the cash pile is still big enough to matter to the pensioners   if you are a company dumb enough to operate such a system today i see no reason why your creditors should not be aware of the promised debt load you carry that is bound up in your employees and take it into account does it make credit more expensive for them it better

the largest problem and source of anxiety ruin for homeowners during the housing market collapse was caused by the inability to refinance many people had bought homes which they were stretched to afford by using variable rate mortgages   these would typically offer a very attractive initial rate with an annual cap on the potential increase of rate   many of these people intended to refinance their variable rate to a fixed rate once terms were more favorable   if their house wo n't appraise for the value needed to obtain a new loan they are stuck in their current contract with potentially unfavorable rates in the later years above prime was not unheard of also many people especially those in areas of high inflation in the housing market used a financial device known as a balloon mortgage which essentially forced you to get a new loan after some number of years 2 5 10 when the entire note became due   some of those loans offered payments less than principal + interest so say you move near los angeles and ca n't afford the $ 1.2 m for the ranch in which you wish to live   you might work out a deal with your mortgage broker banker in which you agree contractually to only pay $ 500/month with a balloon payment of $ 1.4 m due in 5 years which seemed like a good deal since you and everyone else actually expect the house to be worth $ 1.5 m in 5 years this type of thing was done all the time back in the day   now imagine the housing bubble bursts and your $ 1.2 m home is suddenly only valued at perhaps $ 750k   you still owe $ 1.4 m sometime in the next several years maybe very soon depending on timing and can only get approved financing for the current $ 750k value so you 're basically anticipating becoming homeless and bankrupt within the same year that is a source of much anxiety about being upside down on a loan see this question for an unfortunate example

the credit card may have advantages in at least two cases in some instances at least in the us a merchant will put a hold on a credit card without charging it   this happens a lot at hotels for example which use the hold as collateral against damages and incidental charges   on a credit card this temporarily reduces your credit limit but never appears on your bill   i 've never tried to do it on a debit card but my understanding is that they either reject the debit card for this purpose or they actually make the withdrawal and then issue a refund later   you 'll actually need to account for this in your cash flow on the debit card but not on the credit card if you get a fraudulent charge on your credit card it impacts that account until you detect it and go through the fraud resolution process   on a debit card the fraudulent charge may ripple through the rest of your life   the rent payment that you made by electronic transfer or in the us by check for example is now rejected because your bank account is short by the amount of the fraud even if you did n't use the debit card to pay it   eventually this will probably get sorted out but it has potential to create a bigger mess than is necessary personally i never use my debit card i consider it too risky with no apparent benefit

i realize this question is a few years old now but i wanted to address one of the op 's questions that had n't been answered yet my answer is framed as though the question were recent however on the plus side the monthly payment would likely be $ 200 less mo with this house vs our current rent on a 30 year mortgage it would be almost $ 3 400 less this makes me think that i could use the difference to pay directly toward the principal each month is my logic sound the way amortization works if the interest rate between 30 and 15 were the same then making principal only prepayments on the 30 year to cover the difference in monthly payments would result in the exactly the same schedule as if you did minimum payments on the 15-year i.e. the numbers would be practically indistinguishable   of course in practice the interest rate is slightly better on the 15-year which makes the 30-year with prepayments compare slightly less favorably if you 're confident that you 'll be able to reliably keep up with the monthly payments the 15-year would minimize the total amount of interest you pay and help you get off of pmi slightly faster   but the 30-year w/ prepayments gives you the option to skip a prepayment or two if you run into any financial difficulty which is a nice option to have   but you do have to be disciplined about making the prepayments every month

plenty of retired people do stay in the us for longer than 60 days and do n't pay taxes in this irs document 60 days stay appears to be the test for having a substantial presence in the us which is part of the test for determining residency however the following is also written even if you meet the substantial presence test you can be treated as a nonresident alien if you are present in the united states for fewer than 183 days during the current calendar year you maintain a tax home in a foreign country during the year and you have a closer connection to that country than to the united states   in other words if your property in the us is not your main one you pay tax in another country and you stay there less than half the year you should be treated as a non resident i am not a lawyer and this is not advice this irs webpage describes the tax situation of nonresident aliens as i understand it if you are not engaged in any kind of business in the us and have no income from us sources then you do not have to file a tax return you should also look into the subject of double tax agreements if your home country has one and you pay taxes there you probably wo n't need to pay extra tax to the us but again do n't take my word for it

because amazon is not even close to being a monopoly look at wal mart revenue to amazon revenue even with   aws and everything else not even close to being the largest retailer they are just the largest e commerce retailer even there they still are n't a monopoly   add in the fact that a lot of amazon sales are marketplace sales other online vendors selling through amazon and you see that amazon is n't even close to being a monopoly   amazon is just really good at retail being so good at something that you gain market share is not covered under anti trust law

assuming that you have capital gains you can expect to have to pay taxes on them it might be short term or long term capital gains if you specify exactly which shares to sell it is possible to sell mostly losers thus reducing or eliminating capital gains   there are separate rules for 401 k and other retirement programs regarding down payments for a house this leads to many other issues such as the hit your retirement will take

afaik individual 401k accounts are supposed to be funded from self employment earnings not from rollovers from 401k plans of previous employers so check with your accountant before making opening an individual 401k account and getting your previous 401k plan to re issue the checks to be payable to your individual 401k account you might also want to ask about whether loans are permitted from individual 401k accounts my guess is they are not because the possibility of abuse of the privilege is too high since the employer and employee are the same individual   in any case loans against 401k plans are generally not a good idea and many people on this forum have about this matter

i know i can not trade futures realistically i never claimed i could all i wanted was some exposure to commodities   if i could just trade many of these things in an etf like gld or i would have done that    on the topic of margin i appreciate your explaining that to me i admit readily that i could never invest in futures straight but i would like to get into commodities and other types of investments i have tried to look for value in the market but i have not found many things i would put my money in i have gone as far as to look through otc adrs to find some foreign value and i found nothing i just want to be able to trade in any market and i would consider shorting but i do n't like to be too risky i want to go long on positions and it seemed like commodities may be a good speculation to look into taking rough rice as an example there are millions if not billions of people who eat rice to survive people will always need oil to fuel their cars people will always need electricity so i guess what i am trying to do is look into things that allow me to profit regardless of where equities are going the only thing i want to do is trade the options of the futures not the actual futures themselves i hope i did not confuse you if i can earn even $ 20 from buying an option at a lower price and selling higher it would allow me to have a greater breadth of tools to use when the market may be overvalued

you forgot the biggest thing japan still controls its own currency and greece does not    if you do n't control your currency you have much more limited options when it comes to borrowing money it is why us states ca n't borrow a lot of money they all have to share the us dollar which no one state controls so states are used to making cutbacks in hard times but the eurozone nations have not adopted this mindset   greece is n't in trouble because it borrowed too much it 's in trouble because it borrowed so much and has to share the greece ca n't inflate its currency so if they ca n't make a payment they default no one wants to lend to a place that might default if greece had its own currency still there would be no currency crisis in europe just some inflation

central banks are essentially a cartel designed to let banks in general borrow money from depositors at relatively low interest rates   they do this in two ways   by reassuring depositors that momentary cash flow problems at banks will not result in banks failing they lower the interest rates that depositors demand   and by imposing strict regulations on banks that are borrowing from depositors at high interest rates   people who move money to the banks offering the highest interest rates are especially likely to participate in bank runs borrowing too much from the central bank is considered to be a sign of a bank that is too weak to attract deposits from depositors at reasonable interest rates if a bank borrows too much as a percentage of the bank 's assets from the central bank the bank regulators will subject the bank to heavy scrutiny   if the bank fails to find ways to reduce its borrowing from the central bank the bank regulators are likely to steal the bank from its shareholders and sell the bank to a stronger bank that pays lower interest rates

your calculations are correct if you use the same mortgage rate for both the 15 and 30 year mortgages   however generally when you apply for a 15 year mortgage the interest rate is significantly less than the 30 year rate   the rate is lower for a number of reasons but mainly there is less risk for the bank on a 15 year payoff plan

there are two reasons why most options are n't exercised   the first is obvious and the second less so the obvious an option that 's practically worthless does n't get exercised options that reach expiry and remain unexercised are almost always worthless bets that simply did n't pay off this includes calls with strikes above the current underlying price and puts with strikes below it a heck of a lot of options if an option with value was somehow left to expire it was probably a mistake or else the transaction costs outweighed the value remaining not quite worthless but not worth it either the less obvious an option with value can be cancelled any time before expiration a trader that buys an option may at some point show a gain sooner than anticipated or a loss in excess of his tolerance if a gain he may want to sell before expiry to realize the gain sooner similarly if a loss he may want to take the loss sooner in both cases his capital is freed up and he can take another position and this is the key part the other end matched up with that option sale is often a buyer that had created written exactly such an option contract in the first place the option writer and who is looking to get out of his position option writers are the traders responsible in the first place for creating options and increasing the open interest   anybody with the right kind and level of options trading account can do this a trader that writes an option does so by instructing his broker to sell to open a new instance of the option the trader then has a short position negative quantity in that option and all the while may be subject to the obligations that match the option 's exercise rights the only way for the option writer to get out of that short position and its obligations are these not by choice   to get assigned that is to say a buyer exercised the option the writer has to fulfill his obligation by delivering the underlying if a call to the option holder or buying the underlying if a put from the option holder not by choice the option expires worthless this is the ideal scenario for a writer because 100 of the premium received less transaction costs is profit by choice the writer is free to buy back exactly the same kind of option before expiry using a buy to close order with their broker once the option has been purchased with a buy to close it eliminates the short position and obligation   the option is cancelled   the open interest declines options thus cancelled just do n't live long enough to either expire or be exercised

after this happened the second time i wonder if there could be a catch on this   no i mean what is my bank 's real motivation for allowing me to spend more money   credit card companies make money in a few ways by giving you a higher limit the credit card company hopes you will spend more on the card this immediately gets them more merchant fees and if they are lucky means you will have to carry the balance for a while earning them interest if they get really lucky you will miss a payment or two earning them some fees of course if they let you borrow too much you might never pay it back so the credit limit is a balancing act letting you borrow more money gives them the potential to make more money but also the potential to lose more money as you build up a history of paying as agreed they feel comfortable lending you more money

in finance a lot say corporate tax is the original sin   corporate taxes make debt financing more attractive so every company 's debt ratio is much higher than it would be if there were no corporate tax which makes them more vulnerable to shocks in cashflow and at higher risk of default in a downturn   a slight downturn can snowball into a larger one because companies are so heavily debt financed they end up unable to service their debt and end up in worse situations than if they were more equity financed subsequently banks become much more important in the economy because everyone is more leveraged and more company value is tied up in bank debt balances   of course the voting public does n't generally want to lower the corporate tax rate because the general population believes this is how they get their pound of flesh out of corporate america however that is rarely the case

congratulations on deciding to save money and choosing to invest it one thing to know about mutual funds including index funds is that they typically require a minimum investment of a few thousand dollars $ 3000 being a typical amount unless the investment is in an ira in which case $ 1000 might be a minimum in some cases automated monthly investments of $ 50 or $ 100 might need to be set up if you are beginning with a small balance there is nothing wrong with your approach you now should go and look at the various requirements for specific index funds the fidelity and vanguard families are good choices and both offer very low cost index funds to choose from but different funds can have different requirements regarding minimum investments etc you also have a choice of which index you want to follow the s&p 500 index midcap indexes small cap indexes total stock market indexes etc but your choice might be limited   until you have more money to invest because of minimum investment rules etc    most important after you have made your choice i urge you to not look every day or even every month to see how your investment is doing you will save yourself a lot of anxiety and will save yourself from making wrong decisions   far too many investors ignore the buy low sell high and pull money out of what should be long term investments at the first of a downturn and end up buying high and selling low finally the time is approaching when most stock funds will be declaring dividends and capital gains distributions if you invest now you may end up with a paper profit on which you will have to pay taxes in   non tax advantaged accounts on your 2012 tax return this is called buying a dividend and so you might want to spend some time investigating now but actually make the investment in late december after your chosen fund has made its distributions the date for this will be on the fund 's web site or in early 2013

the answer comes down to what you expect the future tax rate to be if that tax rate is the same 25 marginal here then it is a wash yes you will pay more taxes when you pull the money out with a traditional but it is the same fraction of the original contribution as when you pay the tax now to convert to roth all you did was invest uncle sam 's money well so if you expect to pay higher tax rate on retirement then a roth could be beneficial also a roth does not have a required minimum distribution but congress can change that and it has been proposed the argument for leaving the money in the traditional is that you expect a lower tax rate on retirement or you do n't trust that a future congress wo n't decide to add a nominal tax to roth distributions   now if there is a year where your tax rate is very low then a partial conversion may well be worth it also if you your balance is insufficient for a good portfolio and future contributions will be to a roth due to income limits then that would also be a very good reason to convert

i do n't follow the numbers in your example but the fundamental question you 're asking is if i can borrow money for a low cost and if i think i can invest it and receive returns greater than that cost should i do it it does n't matter where that money comes from a mortgage that 's bigger than it needs to be a credit card teaser rate or a margin line from your stock broker the answer is maybe depending on the certainty you have about the returns you 'd receive on your investments and your tolerance for risk only you can answer that question for yourself if you make less than your mortgage rates on the investments you 'll wish you had n't as an aside i do n't know anything about belgian tax law but in us tax law your deductions can be limited to the actual value of the home your law may be similar and thus increase the effective mortgage interest rate

every bank and credit union in the us has a deposit agreement and disclosures document bank of america is no different our general policy is to make funds from your cash and check deposits    available to you no later   than the first business day after the day    of your deposit however in some cases we place a hold   on funds that    you deposit by check a hold results in a delay in the availability of    these funds that sounds great but for determining the availability of your deposits every day is a    business day except saturdays    and federal holidays    if    you make a deposit on a business day that we are open at one of our    financial centers before    p.m. local time or at one of our atms    before p.m. local time in the state where we   maintain your    account we consider that day to be the day of your deposit however    if you make   a deposit after such times or on a day when we are not    open or that is not a business day we   consider that the deposit was    made on the next business day we are open some locations have     different cutoff times so if you deposit a check on friday afternoon the funds are generally available on tuesday but not always in some cases we will not make all of the funds that you deposit by    check available to you by the   first business day after the day of    your deposit depending on the type of check that you deposit   funds    may not be available until the second business day after the day of    your deposit the first   $ 200 of your deposits however may be    available no later than the first business day after the day   of your    deposit   if we are not going to make all of the funds from your    deposit available by the first business   day after the day of your    deposit we generally notify you at the time you make your deposit we    also tell you when the funds will be available ok what happens when the funds are available in many cases we make funds from your deposited checks available to    you sooner than we   are able to collect the checks this means that    from time to time a deposited check may be   returned unpaid after we    made the funds available to you please keep in mind that even though     we make funds from a deposited check available to you and you withdraw    the funds you are   still responsible for problems with the deposit    if a check you deposited is returned to us unpaid   for any reason you    will have to repay us and we may charge your account for the amount of    the   check even if doing so your account fidelity has a similar document each check deposited is promptly credited to your account   however    the money may not be available until up to six business   days later    and we may decline to honor any debit that is applied   against the    money before the deposited check has cleared if a deposited check does not clear the deposit will be removed   from    your account and you are responsible for returning any   interest you    received on it i would think that the longer holding period for fidelity is due to the fact that they want to wait long enough to make sure that the number of times they have to undo investments due to the funds not clearing is nearly zero

i think the problem is that you 've made a math error this child would not be costing you 300 per month it will be costing you 1400 per month   1100 of this is in a donation of salable hours rather than cash but you have a number right there as to how much someone is willing to pay for these hours so the math is still doable so if you are indeed splitting your expenses fifty fifty you should chip 1100 into the pot to match your wife 's contribution   it would make the most sense i think to have your part of this contribution cover some of your mutual expenses and if any is left over save it up for the day that your child would cost more than that 300 in a month when you need extra clothes or have to replace something they destroyed or want to pay for extra opportunities camps educational games lessons or a a savings that can be used for major future expenses higher education first car milestone celebrations safety net when starting out of course if your family is indeed a priority you might consider making an equal investment in your family say half your income 1800 to match half her time going into the building of the family   after all the decision to start a family should be an investment of time and value not just a minimum bid for expenses   and again any extra can be spent on mutual expenses saved up for future costs or left as your child 's savings for major expenses or safety net i suppose i should mention that you perhaps could get away with covering half her contribution 550 per month on the face of it as that should also balance out the monthly expenses   even this much would be enough to put her back into the green on her covering her own costs   of course in this case you might want to take into account that while she 's working hours per week now running a household is i 've heard more closely equivalent to a week plus or minus being on call for a further 100 hours a week   trying to calculate the absolute minimum payment on your part to match the investment of hours on hers is likely to be a bit more tricky than just matching the salable hours not worked if you 're set on income ratios and splitting costs as they are also you might want to rethink your criteria for sharing income completely or what makes certain divisions of costs unfair you mention one reason it would be unfair is that you have a more stressful job well your job may well be more stressful than her job now but it is likely to be less so than raising a child her new job   as for investment of time and energy for your education entitling you to a larger amount of pay again raising a child is likely to be a larger investment of time money and anxiety than your education but her pay or even share of the costs does n't seem to be balanced in response   i 'm not gon na tell you what is fair that 's for you to work out just suggesting you really think it through before deciding what would be fair or not

basically you have 4 options use your cash to pay off the student loans put your cash in an interest bearing savings account invest your cash for example in the stock market spend your cash on fun stuff you want right now the more you can avoid 4 the better it will be for you in the long term but you 're apparently wise enough that that was n't included as an option in your question to decide between 1 2 and 3 the key questions are   what interest are you paying on the loan versus what return could you get on savings or investment   how much risk are you willing to take how much cash do you need to keep on hand for unexpected expenses what are the tax implications basically if you are paying 2 interest on a loan and you can get 3 interest on a savings account then it makes sense to put the cash in a savings account rather than pay off the loan you 'll make more on the interest from the savings account than you 'll pay on interest on the loan if the best return you can get on a savings account is less than 2 then you are better off to pay off the loan however you probably want to keep some cash reserve in case your car breaks down or you have a sudden large medical bill etc how much cash you keep depends on your lifestyle and how much risk you are comfortable with i do n't know what country you live in at least here in the u.s. a savings account is extremely safe even the bank goes bankrupt your money should be insured you can probably get a much better return on your money by investing in the stock market but then your returns are not guaranteed you may even lose money personally i do n't have a savings account i put all my savings into fairly safe stocks because savings accounts around here tend to pay about 1 which is hardly worth even bothering you also should consider tax implications if you 're a new grad maybe your income is low enough that your tax rates are low and this is a minor factor but if you are in say a 25 marginal tax bracket then the effective interest rate on the student loan would be more like 1.5 that is if you pay $ 20 in interest the government will then take 25 of that off your taxes so it 's the equivalent of paying $ 15 in interest similarly a place to put your money that gives non taxable interest like municipal bonds gives a better real rate of return than something with the same nominal rate but where the interest is taxable

the three basic needs are food clothing and shelter housing falls into the third category because it is basic housing takes up a large part of one 's disposable income the rule of thumb is that you should n't spend more than 25 of your income on rent or mortgages and that is income before taxes anything much more than that takes up too much of one 's budget you simply can't double housing 's share of the budget from 25 to 50 whereas it 's easy to go from 1 to 2 for say a cellphone upgrade in the long run housing prices are constrained by the size of people 's housing budgets which in turn are tied to incomes nowadays that includes foreign buyers so there may be a case where west coast housing prices are driven up by asian buyers or florida housing by buyers from latin america driving americans out of local markets

gold can be thought of to have value in one of two ways 1 as a means and 2 as an end   means takes the shape of currency in this form we value gold in the same way we value the dollar it allows us to purchase things we want as a medium of exchange gold has no definitive value and is only assigned one during the process of an exchange for example i would be valuing one of gold to be worth a dog if i traded a dog for one of gold the value of gold in this sense is subjective as each person decides for themselves what gold is worth during the transaction gold as an end is valued for its own sake a good example of this is a who purchases gold directly because of the intrinsic gold possesses this is closer to the true value of gold than using it as a means but virtually no one in our society views gold in this manor because virtually no one can use gold in this manor you know what i could use right now a block of gold said no one ever   but even if you are one of the select few who value gold for its own sake this is usually done because gold provides a function for example if people no longer want to jewelry then a will likely have to find a new line of work where he would likely no longer view gold as valuable as an ends to sum up gold has a perceived value for most people and an intrinsic value to a select few for the time being

other people have pointed this out but there are a few considerations in whether you should do a roth or traditional ira such as one of the major arguments for using a traditional ira is that you can at least in theory afford to contribute more money initially than you 'd be able to afford if you were using a roth ira while this is in theory true i 'm not at all convinced that using a traditional ira will actually cause people to contribute more to it realistically how many people will actually contribute say $ 500 more to their ira because they knew that their contribution for this year will save them $ 500 to know if this is the case consider the last time that you actually invested some of your tax refund in your retirement account i have n't seen any actual statistics on this but i 'm guessing that very few people do this please see other people 's answers for details on the mathematics behind that the second argument for contributing to a traditional ira is if you expect your future income tax rate to be lower than your current tax rate for some reason e.g. due to a change in government policy e.g. replacing income taxes with value added tax or something like that the fact that you 're doing the contribution relatively close to when you 're planning on withdrawing it etc please see this question for more discussion about this keep in mind that while a traditional ira saves you tax money this year a roth ira saves you money when you withdraw it so it 's not really a question of paying taxes on $ 5000 now or $ 5000 later it 's a question of paying taxes on $ 5000 now vs. for example $ 50,000 later or however much the money 's grown by the time you withdraw it maybe the traditional ira is still worth it though if there are changes to tax policy or you end up with a lot more money in your traditional ira due to being able to contribute more

let me answer by parts when a company gives dividends the share price drops by the dividend amount   not always by that exact amount for many different reasons e.g. there are transaction costs if you reinvest dividend taxes etc i have tested that empirically now if all the shareholders choose to reinvest their dividends will the share price go back up to what it was prior to the dividend that is an interesting question the final theoretical price of the company does not need to be that when a company distributes dividends its liquidity diminish there is an impact on the balance sheet of the company if all investors go to the secondary market and reinvest the dividends in the shares that does not restore the cash in the balance sheet of the company hence the theoretical real value of the company is different before the dividends of course in practice there is not such a thing as one theoretical value in reality if everybody reinvest the dividend that will put upward pressure over the price of the company and depending on the depth of the offers meaning how many orders will counterbalance the upward pressure at the moment the final price will be determined which can be higher or lower than before not necessarily equal i ask because some like spy automatically reinvest dividends so what is the effect of this reinvestment on the stock price let us see the mechanics of these purchases when a non distributing etf receives cash from the dividends of the companies it takes that cash and reinvest it in the whole basket of stocks that compose the index not just in the companies that provided the dividends the net effect of that is a small leverage effect let us say you bought one unit of spy and during the whole year the shares pay 2 of dividends that are reinvested at the end of that year it will be equivalent to having 1.02 units of spy

if you 're in the 25 tax bracket then you probably should n't be doing a roth conversion right now   you 'd prefer to do roth conversions when you can do so at a 15 rate   you could contribute some of your current annual contributions to roth directly but even that is n't a great idea except to diversify your holdings odds are you wo n't be paying 25 average tax rate on your retirement unless you 're doing very well in your retirement account   odds are you 'll be somewhere around 15   converting at a 15 rate therefore is fine basically you 'll have something like this based on some assumptions i 'm making up dollars brackets etc obviously these will change doing this you pay 0 15 tax on up to 75k then pay 0 tax after that on the roth which you paid 15 tax on already   therefore you do n't end up paying more than 15 on any single dollar and you pay less on the total sum   but you also do n't really want to be paying 25 on any of it since that wo n't really help you out any and could hurt you will hurt you if you end up getting some of that 15 bracket income from the roth if you 're in the 25 bracket now then you probably are better off just keeping everything in regular ira unless you 're expecting to be in the 28 bracket after retirement   putting some in roth is n't a terrible idea just for diversification 's sake but it 's probably going to cost you money unless tax rates rise dramatically which they certainly could though not as likely to rise on the middle class 0 100k range   they 'd have to double for you to be worse off this way and finally do not ever withdraw from the 401k to pay taxes on a conversion you 're subject to a 10 penalty for doing that as it 's an early withdrawal and also have to pay taxes on that withdrawal      for more information about when roth makes sense read site joetaxpayer 's blog article on the subject which explains this in great detail

the finance buff discusses why the roth 401k is often disadvantaged compared to a traditional 401k in the article the case against the roth 401k including the following reasons paraphrased contributions to the 401k come from the top of your highest tax bracket rate but withdrawals fill in from the bottom   for example suppose you are in the 28 tax bracket   every marginal dollar you contribute to the traditional 401k reduces your tax burden by cents   however when withdrawing the first $ of income is tax free from standard deduction and exemption 2014 numbers $ for married couples joint filing   the next dollars are at the 10 tax bracket and so on   this is an advantage for the traditional 401k only if you earn less when withdrawing than you did when contributing a reasonable assumption avoid high state income tax there are many states that have low or no state income tax   if you live in a state with a high income tax paying tax now through the roth 401k reduces the benefit of moving to a state with a lower income tax rate avoid triggering credit many tax credits e.g. student loan interest child tax credit hope credit roth ira eligibility etc begin phasing out as your income increases   contributing to the traditional 401k can help you realize more of those credits when you starting running up against those limits as described in the article if these items do n't apply contributing to the roth 401k can be a valuable component of tax diversification

i think the biggest reason is price it 's a lot cheaper now than it was to offer these   that 's because for the most part when you get a credit score for free you 're not getting a true fico score   you 're getting instead a vantagescore vantagescore was created by the three credit bureaus and as such they can offer it without paying fair isaac a licensing fee   that makes it a lot cheaper to offer and while it 's not absolutely identical to fico or more accurately to any of the fico provided scores it 's close enough for most peoples purpose and of course undoubtedly fair isaac has some price pressure on their side now that vantage is big enough that many people see them as fungible   as such they 've had to make it easier or they 'd lose business no longer being a monopolist the other relevant piece here is that probably in many of these cases they 're really just offering you what experian would give you directly so it 's just a cross marketing thing where experian or perhaps another bureau gets access to you as a customer so they can up sell you id theft insurance and whatnot while the bank gets to offer the free score

i love the flat rate vat scheme it 's where you pay a percentage based on your industry an example might be computer repair services where you 'll pay 10.5 of your total revenue to the hmrc but you 'll be invoicing for vat at 20 still would definitely recommend registering for it since you 're expecting to cross the threshold anyway and like dumbcoder said you also get a first year discount of 1 so in the example above you 'd end up paying 9.5 vat on your turnover i personally found it a pain to invoice without vat my clients expected it so registering made sense regardless of the fact i was over threshold the tricky bit is keeping under the £ 150k turnover so you stay eligible for the flat rate it does get more complex otherwise

lots of good answers here about budgeting and other ideas   here 's a couple more think about offense and defense   offense is how much money you make   are you making enough to survive on   is there a way you could bring in more income   defense is what you do with your money   do you have expensive habits   do you have problems with impulse spending   do you live in an expensive area with a high cost of living   think about some of these areas and pick one to attack first if it is the defense side that is causing you problems you did mention trying to live on less consider reading your money or your life by joe and robin   there 's a really good summary of it on the authors site   the basic idea of the mechanical part of the book is that you figure out how much you 're truly making per hour and then evaluate your expenses based on how many hours of your life energy you are using for that expense   then you evaluate whether you think that 's a fair trade or not   there 's a lot more to it than that but it 's an interesting way to get a different perspective on your spending habits and may be enough to entice you to change those habits

the value of a company is simplified the sum of the value of the equity and the value of the debt there are some other things to add subtract to that but just think about those for now   you could also say the value of a company is the value of its assets or more precisely the value of the net cash flows those assets will generate in the future   so let 's say you want to start a company so you want to buy some assets maybe you want to buy a $ 200 asset well you only have $ 100 so you take out a loan debt for $ 100 for the remainder you buy the asset and start generating income   let 's say after a month you get bored and decide to sell the company let 's assume the value of the assets has n't changed your equity is worth $ 100 and you find a buyer who is willing to pay $ 100 for your company great right   well there 's still the $ 100 loan you owe so you have to pay that back and suddenly you now have $ 0    so in fact you should have negotiated $ 200 with the buyer because that 's what the assets are actually worth then you can pay back the loan and still have the $ 100 in equity you deserve alternatively you could have negotiated the buyer to assume responsibility for the loan same outcome for you   did that help

it is just a different category of stock issued by a company that gives its owners different treatment when it comes to dividend payment and a few other financial transactions preferred stock holders get treated with some preference with regard to the company 's profits and assets for example dividends are typically guaranteed to preferred stock holders whereas the leadership in the company can elect at any time not to pay dividends to common stockholders in the event the company is liquidated the preferred stockholders also get to be in line ahead of common stockholders when the assets are distributed

i think it 's great that you want to contribute course instructor you may want to take a look at becoming an instructor for a course like dave ramsey 's financial peace university these are commonly offered through churches and other community venues for a fee this may be a good fit if you want to focus on basic financial literacy setting up and sticking to a budget and getting their financial house in order it may not be a good fit if you do n't want to teach an existing curriculum or if you find the tenets of the course too unpalatable a significant number of the people in dave 's audience are close to or in the middle of a financial meltdown and so his advice includes controversial ideas such as avoiding credit altogether often because that 's how they got into their current mess counselor if you want to run your own show i know of several people who have built their own practice that is run along the lines of a counselor charging hourly rates and they work with couples who are having money problems building a reputation and a network of referring counselors and professionals is key here and definitely seems like it would require a full time commitment i would avoid credit counseling and the like most of these organizations are focused on restructuring credit card debt not spending time on behavioral change you do n't need a series 7 63 65 etc or even a cfa i 've previously acquired a number of these and can confirm that they are investment credentials that are intended to help you get a job and/or get more business as a broker or conventional financial planner i.e. salesperson of securities the process is necessary to protect consumers from advice that serves the investment sales force but is bad for the consumer and because you must be licensed to provide investment advice there is a class of fee only financial planners but they primarily deal with complex issues that allow them to make money and often give away basic personal finance advice for free in the form of articles podcasts etc   charity for part time or free work in my area there are also several charity organizations that help people do their taxes and provide basic budgeting and personal finance instruction but this is very localized and may vary quite a bit depending on where you live however if there are none near you you can always start one journalism if you have an interest in writing there are also people who work as journalists and write columns books or newsletters and it is much easier now to publish and build a network online either on your own through a blog or contributing to a website speaker at community events there are also many opportunities to speak to a specific community such as a church or social organization for example where i live there are local organizations for spanish speaking polish speaking elderly young professional young mother and retiree groups for example all of who might be interested in your advice on issues that specifically address their needs good luck

the biggest issue i can see is that in order to have your parents protected properly they 'll have to register an interest in the property ie the 25 i ca n't see the mortgage lender being too happy to have a second lienholder on the house for a total of 100 of the purchase price usually their conditions state that they 'll need to be informed of other debts secured on the house and might actually have a say in that another way of accomplishing this is putting your parents on the house 's deeds but that might also complicate matters with the lender and cause additional problems when it comes to selling the property not to mention that if anything bad happens to your parents their stake in your property would be counted as one of their assets and you might find yourself in the situation where you have to come up with 25 of the property value right now or you might find that you have to sell the property to the first bidder simply because you do need the money as quickly as possible personally i would n't do it especially without legal advice the legal structure can be a nightmare and you 'll just end up painted into a corner

you can contribute to a traditional ira instead of a roth   the main difference is a contribution to a roth is made with after tax money but at retirement you can withdraw the money tax free   with a traditional ira your contribution is tax deductible but at retirement the withdrawal is not tax free   this is why most people prefer a roth if they can contribute you can also contribute to your work 's 401k plan assuming they have one   and you can always save for retirement in a regular account

here 's what you do without on the negative side just for balance a bill when i last had comprehensive insurance it cost something like 3 4 of the value of the car per annum   obviously ymmv enormously but i think that 's somewhere near the middle of the range and i 'm not especially risky   so compared to the total depreciation and running costs of the car it 's actually fairly substantial   over the say 10 years i might keep that car it adds up to a fair slice of what it will take to buy a replacement financial crisis costs i do n't know about you but my insurance went up something like 30 in recent years despite the value insured and the risk going down said by the insurer to be due to market turmoil   so at least hundreds of dollars is just kind of loss and i 'd rather not pay it with the insurer if you have insurance and a loss you have to persuade them to pay out perhaps document the original conditions or the fault perhaps argue about whether their payment is fair   i 've done this for small non automotive claims and it added up to more hassle than the incident itself   obviously all insurers will claim they 're friendly to deal with but until you actually have a big claim you never know moral hazard i know i 'm solely responsible for not having my car crashed or stolen   somehow that just feels better free riders i 've seen people fudge their insurance claims so that things that should n't have been covered were claimed to be   you might have too   buy insurance and you 're paying for them choice insurers are typically going to make the decision for you about whether a claim is or not and in my experience are reluctant or refuse to just give you the cash amount of the claim see also moral hazard   do it yourself and you can choose whether to live with it make a smaller or larger repair or replace the whole vehicle with a second hand one or a brand new one or indeed perhaps do without a vehicle a distraction hopefully by the time you 've been working for a while a vehicle is not a really large fraction of your net worth   if you lose 10 of your net worth it 's not really nice but well you could easily have lost that off the value of your house or your retirement portfolio in recent years   what you actually need to insure is genuinely serious risks that would seriously change your life if they were lost such as your ability to work   for about the same cost as insuring a $ x car you can insure against $ x income every year for the rest of your life and i think it 's far more important if i have a write off accident but walk away i 'll be perfectly happy and obviously liability insurance is important because being hit for $ millions of liabilities could also have a serious impact    coverage for mechanical failures if your car needs a new transmission insurance is n't going to help yet it may cost more than the typical minor collision   save the money yourself and you can manage those costs out of the same bucket flexibility if you save up to replace your car but some other crisis occurs you can choose to put the money towards that   if you have car insurance but you have a family medical thing it 's no help i think the bottom line is insure against costs you could n't cope with by yourself   there are people who need a car but can just barely afford it but if you 're fortunate enough not to be in that case you do n't really need comprehensive insurance

its a topic and to answer your question in full will require a book with a small booklet of legal advice attached to it i 'm not going to write it here but i 'll give you some very specific points to start your research with arm big no no do n't touch that get rid of those you have any way you can and then never ever do it again that 's the kind of crap that got us into the housing bubble mess to begin with especially with the rates as low as now the only future with arm is that you 're going to pay more way more than your initial period payments rates the rates now are very low they were even lower 12 24 months ago but are still extremely low make sure you get a fixed rate loan in order to lock these rates in for the remainder of the loan any arm loan will have higher rates in the future so go with fixed rate period fixed rate loans are given for periods up to 30 years the shorter the period the lower the rate however at the level they 're now you 're practically getting money for free the apr is comparable to the inflation even for 30 yr fixed loans pmi private mortgage insurance since you do n't have much equity the lender is likely to require you paying pmi this is a significant amount of money you pay until you have at least 20 equity it changes from lender to lender so shop around and compare government assistance that 's what the broker was referring to there were programs allowing people refinance even under water mortgages check what programs are still available in your area some banks will not refinance with less than 20 equity but some government assistance programs may help you get a loan even if you do n't have enough equity closing fees and points that 's the money out of your pocket shop around these vary wildly generally credit unions being non profits are cheaper on this item specifically while comparable to big banks on everything else

gt ummm i bet we did n't work less   i 'll take that bet   research studies suggest that hunter gatherers work somewhere between 20 and 40 hours a week on average depending on just what you count as work moreover they do not work according to the clock they work when the time is ripe for the work to be done and when they feel like it there is ample time in hunter gatherers lives for leisure activities including games of many sorts playful religious making and playing musical instruments singing dancing traveling to other bands to visit friends and relatives and just lying around and relaxing the life of the typical hunter looks a lot like your life and mine when we are on vacation at a camp with friends

if you have a relatively stable income and deductions you can get a fairly good estimate using last year 's tax bill suppose you paid $ 12000 of actual taxes last year and you are paid once a month    if you plan to make a similar amount of money with similar deductions you need each monthly paycheck to have $ 1000 of federal income taxes withheld    i go to a paycheck calculator and find the withholding required to make sure i have that amount withheld every paycheck

to calculate any daily return all one need do is divide the final value by the initial value subtract 1 and multiply by 100 this can be applied to either the futures alone the investments used as margin collateral alone or all together margin collateral as a factor of a derivative 's return collateral can take many forms many suggest that cost and revenue for a derivative trade should also take into account margin requirements   this can become problematic if a futures position moved against the trader yet the margin was secured with equities at the maximum and the equities moved with the trader the futures trade could be interpreted as less of a loss because the collateral which is probably totally with the futures position increased in value then again if a futures position moved with the trader yet the margin collateral moved against the trader then taken together the futures trade would look less profitable furthermore most likely the result of a futures position and its collateral would never produce the same result so would become ever more difficult for ease of analysis a position 's cost and revenue should be from another unless if those positions are meant to hedge each other   margin is not a cost but it is a liability so margin will affect the balance sheet of a futures trade but not its income statement again unless if the collateral is also used to hedge such futures position

here 's the purely mathematical answer for which fees hurt more you say taking the money out has an immediate cost of $ 60,000 we need to calculate the present value of the future fees and compare it against that number let 's assume that the investment will grow at the same rate either with or without the broker that 's actually a bit generous to the broker since they 're probably investing it in funds that in turn charge fees we can calculate the present cost of the fees by calculating the difference between as it turns out this number does n't depend on how much we should expect to get as investment returns doing the math the fees cost 1 = $ that is the cost of the fees is comparable to paying nearly $ 100,000 right now nearly half the investment if there are no other options i strongly recommend taking the one time hit and investing elsewhere preferably in low cost index funds details of the derivation for simplicity assume that both fees and growth compound continuously the growth does compound continuously we do n't know about the fees but in any case the distinction is n't very significant fees occur at a continuous rate of rf = which is negative and growth occurs at rate the ops current principal is p and the present value of the fees over time is f. we therefore have the equation p = p f t solving for f we notice that the components cancel and we obtain f = p p t = p p t = p p 1 t

is it true that due the to the increase in interest rates that inflation is likely to increase as well it is typically the reverse where inflation causes interest rates to rise interest rates fundamentally reflect the desire for people to purchase future goods over present day goods   if i loan money to someone for 5 years i lose the ability to use that money   in order to entice me to loan the money the borrower would have to offer me an incentive that is they would have to give me additional money at the end of that 5 years   this additional money is the interest rate and it reflects the desire of people to spend money in the future versus the present day   if offered the same amount of money today versus 5 years from now almost everyone would chose to take the money now   money in the present is more valuable than the same amount of money in the future interest rates would still exist even with a currency that could not be printed i would still prefer to have the currency today than in the future if the currency is continually devalued i.e. the issuer is printing more of the currency than borrowers may charge additional interest to compensate for the loss in purchasing power when they make a loan also it is hard to compare interest rates and inflation   inflation is very difficult to calculate new products and services as well as ever changing consumer desires continually change the mixture of goods in the market so it is nearly impossible to compare a basket of goods today to a basket of goods 5 10 20 or 30 years ago

can they reject a hundred dollar bill as a payment of debt no a creditor can not refuse payment in cash whatever denomination you use however when you 're buying stuff you do n't owe anything to the business owner there 's no debt so the above rule does n't apply as long as there 's no debt in existence the matter of payment is decided between two parties based on the mutual agreement the demand not to use large bills is reasonable in places like or taxi cab that are frequently robbed or at a small retailer that does n't want to invest into forgery detection and fraud prevention so the answer to this question is it the case where this practice of accepting small bills and    rejecting large bills is perfectly legal is yes you can find the full explanation on including code references

you owe taxes to the state where you earned the income and also to the state where you physically live most maybe all states have laws that let you claim credits for taxes paid to other states so that you 're not paying double taxes by living in one state while working in another most states have deals with all their neighboring states so that you only have to file taxes in one for example i live in michigan and michigan borders ohio lots of people who live near the border live in one state but work in the other so the two have a deal that anyone who lives in michigan but works in ohio just has to file a michigan tax return and pay michigan taxes and anyone who lives in ohio and works in michigan just has to pay ohio taxes oh i should note that these adjacent state deals apply only to employment income not business income if you own a business in another state you 'll still have to file taxes in that state you still should get tax credits in your residence state in general the fact that you use a server in another state does n't make you liable for taxes in that state i understand that new york says that if you work from home and the company headquarters is in new york you have to pay new york taxes maybe there are a few other states who do this but just because a server is in their state i 've never heard of this if i order business supplies that are shipped from a warehouse in arizona that does n't make me liable for arizona income taxes etc   you are legally a resident of the state where you actually live if you have a home and live in it most of the time then you are a resident of the state where that home is a home does n't have to be a house it could be an apartment an rv that you live in in a trailer park a tent etc if you do n't own any sort of fixed home and you travel around a lot this could be tricky you mentioned oklahoma oklahoma defines resident as follows   an oklahoma resident is a person domiciled in this state for the entire tax year domicile is the place established as a person ’s true fixed and permanent home it is the place you intend to return whenever you are away as on     vacation abroad business assignment educational leave or military assignment a domicile once established remains until a new one is adopted i 'm not sure that that clears things up for you you ca n't just pick a state with low taxes and claim that as your residence no way is the state where you actually live going to accept that if you are in an ambiguous situation like you spend 6 months per year in state a and 6 months in state b and you have no fixed home in either maybe you stay at or live in your minivan you might get away with picking the state with the most favorable tax laws as your residence but if you spend 7 months in state a and 5 months in state b state a will almost surely claim you are a resident and owe them taxes if you regularly wander the country never spend more than a few days in any one place and rarely come back to the same place twice then you have a complicated situation and you probably need to talk to a tax lawyer

both explanations are partly true there are many investors who do not want to sell an asset at a loss   this causes resistance at prices where large amounts of the asset were previously traded by such investors   it also explains why a break through of such a resistance is often associated with a substantial move in price there are also many investors who have stop loss or trailing stop loss limit orders in effect   these investors will automatically sell out of a long position or buy out of a short position if the price drops or rises by a certain percentage typically 8 10 there are periods of time when money is flowing into an asset or asset class   this could be due to a large investor trying to quietly purchase the asset in a way that avoids raising the price earlier than necessary   or perhaps a large investor is dollar cost averaging   or perhaps a legal mandate for a category of investors has changed and they need to rebalance their portfolios   this rebalancing is likely to take place over time   or perhaps there is a fad where many small investors at various times decide to increase or decrease their stake in an asset class   or perhaps for demographic reasons the number of investors in a particular situation is increasing so there are more investors who want to make particular investments   all of these phenomena can be summarized by the word momentum traders who use technical analysis including most day traders and algorithmic speculators are aware of these phenomena   they are therefore more likely to purchase or sell or short an asset shortly after one of their buy signals or sell signals is triggered   this reinforces the phenomena there are also poorly understood long term cycles that affect business fundamentals and/or the politics that constrain business activity   for example note that even if the markets really were a random walk it would still be profitable and risk reducing to perform dollar cost averaging when buying into a position and also perform averaging when selling out of a position   but this means that recent investor behavior can be used to predict the near future behavior of investors which justifies technical analysis

according to the book of hull american and european calls on non dividend paying stocks should have the same value american puts however should be equals to or more valuable than european puts the reason for this is the time value of money in a put you get the option to sell a stock at a given strike price if you exercise this option at t=0 you receive the strike price at t=0 and can invest it at the risk free rate lets imagine the rf rate is 10 and the strike price is this means at you would get if on the other hand you exercise the option early at you would simply receive the strike price 10 $ basically the strike price which is your payoff for a put option does n't earn interest another way to look at this is that an option is composed of two elements the insurance element and the time value of the option the insurance element is what you pay in order to have the option to buy a stock at a certain price for put options it is equals to the s 0 where k = strike price and stock price   the time value of the option can be thought of as a risk premium it 's difference between the value of the option and the insurance element if the benefits of exercising a put option early earning the risk free rate on the proceeds outweighs the time value of the put option it should be exercised early yet another way to look at this is by looking at the upper bounds of put options for a european put today 's value of the option can never be worth more than the present value of the strike price discounted at the risk free rate if this rule is n't respected there would be an arbitrage opportunity by simply investing at the risk free rate for an american put since it can be exercised at any time the maximum value it can take today is simply equals to the strike price therefore since the pv of the strike price is smaller than the strike price the american put can have a bigger value bear in mind this is for a non dividend paying stock as previously mentioned if a stock pays a dividend it might also be optimal to exercise just before these are paid

options are generally viewed as having two types of value intrinsic value and time value   the intrinsic value is based on the difference between the strike price on the option and the spot price of the underlying   the time value is based on the volatility of the underlying and the amount of time left until expiration   as the days pass toward expiration the time value generally decreases and the intrinsic value may move up or down depending on the spot price of the underlying in theory time value could increase at some points if the volatility is also rising in your case it looks like the time value is decreasing faster than the intrinsic value is increasing this may happen because the volatility is also going down as suggested in the answer by cqm or may just happen because the time to expiration is getting shorter at equal volatility as noted by dumbcoder in a comment to the original question the black scholes formula will give you more analytical insight into this if you 're interested

the way to resolve your dilemma is to consult the price to rent ratio of the property according to the price to rent ratio is a measure of the relative affordability of renting and buying in a given housing market it is calculated as the ratio of home prices to annual rental rates so for example in a real estate market where on average a home worth $ 200,000 could rent for $ 1000 a month the price rent ratio is that ’s determined using the formula $ 200,000 ÷ 12 x $ 1,000 also goes on to give a table comparing different cities price to rent ratio and then claim that the average price to rent ratio is currently if your price to rent ratio is lower than then yes your rents are more expensive than the average house claims that a high price to rent ratio is an argument in favor of tenants renting properties while a low price to rent ratio favors people buying either to live in the property or to just rent it out to other people so let 's apply the price to rent ratio formula towards the properties you just quoted there 's a specific house i could buy for 190 perhaps even less that rents for exactly 2000 month 12 = there 's a house for sale asking 400 been on the market 2 yrs could probably get for 350 which rents for 2800   12 = 12 = one can quite easily today buy a house for that would rent out for 1700 2100 month   lower bound 12 = upper bound 12 = even so the rental returns here seem ridiculously high to me based on other markets i 've noticed considering how the average price to rent ratio is and your price to rent ratio ranges from to you are indeed correct they are indeed ridiculously high qualification i was involved in real estate and used the price to rent ratio to determine how long it would take to recover a person 's investment in the property keep in mind that it 's not the only thing i care about and obviously the price to rent ratio tends to expenses involved in actually owning properties and trying to deal with periods of vacancy there 's also the problem of taking into account demand as well according to detroit mi has the lowest price to rent ratio with which should suggest that people should buy properties immediately in this city but that 's probably more of a sign of people not wanting to move to detroit and bid up the prices of properties edit i should also say that just because the properties are ridiculously expensive right now does n't mean you should expect your rents to decrease rather if rents keep staying at their current level i 'd predict that the property values will slowly increase in the future thereby raising the price to rent ratio to non ridiculous mode

in general stock markets are very similar to that however you can also put in limit orders to say that you will only buy or sell at a given price these sit in the market for a specified length of time and will be executed when an order arrives that matches the price or better traders who set limit orders are called liquidity or price makers as they provide liquidity i.e. volume to be traded to be filled later if there is no counterparty i.e. buyer to your seller in the market a market maker a large bank or brokerage who is licensed and regulated to do so will fill your order at some price that price is based on how much volume i.e. trading there is in that stock on average this is called average daily volume adv and is calculated over varying periods of time we use which is the 30 day average you can always sell stocks for whatever price you like privately but a market order does not allow you to set your price you are a price taker therefore that kind of order will always fill at a market price as mentioned above limit orders will not fill until the price is hit but will stay on book as long as they are n't filled expired or cancelled

am i allowed to transfer into nre account from paypal credits into nre accounts are restricted it has to be established that the funds being credited are income outside of india in case of paypal paypal uses local clearing to credit funds into bank accounts so essentially one can not credit nre account by domestic clearing network like it is best that you withdraw the funds into bank account outside india and use swift or remittance service to credit your nre account i do not want to transfer to an nro account since the money credited into it will become taxable this is not the right assumption credits into nro are not taxable by default if you establish that the funds are from outside india there is no tax on the income money transferred from abroad into the nro account however the interest that will be paid by the bank on the balance of the nro account is taxable income in india and is subject to tds in contrast interest paid on the balance in an nre account is not taxable in india and is not subject to tds as long as you maintain nri status however it does make sense to keep accounts segregated i.e. income generated in india credit the nro account and income generated outside india credit to nre

the other answers have touched on amortization early payment computation of interest etc which are all very important but i think there 's another way to understand the importance of knowing the p i breakdown the question mentions the loan payment as cash outflow that is true but from an accounting perspective disclaimer i am not an accountant but i know enough of the basics to be dangerous the outflow needs to be directed to different accounts the loan principal appears as a liability on your personal balance sheet which you could use for example in determining net worth the principal amount in your payment should be applied to reduce the liability account the interest payment goes into the expense account   another way to look at it is that the principal while it does reduce your cash account can be thought of as an internal transfer to the liability account thus reducing the size of the liability the interest payment can not aside from this perspective the value of the home is an asset and the difference between the asset account and the loan liability account is the equity in the house as pointed out in different language by the accepted answer of course precisely determining the value of an illiquid asset like a house at any given moment pretty much requires you to actually sell it so those accounts are hard to maintain in real time the liability of the loan is much easier to track

i do n't get it are you saying they did commit fraud but it 's hard to pin on any one person you say there is little evidence there was fraud but that it 's too hard to prove there was fraud so what did they do if it was n't fraud this is what wikipedia says happened    gt;the subprime mortgage crisis arose from bundling american subprime and american regular mortgages into mbss which were traditionally isolated from and sold in a separate market from prime loans these bundles of mixed prime and subprime mortgages were the basis asset backed securities so the probable rate of return looked superb since subprime lenders pay higher premiums and the loans were anyway secured against real estate and so theoretically could not fail   if selling shit you know is bad but looks good to investors is n't fraud i do n't know what is    is deception deliberately practiced in order to secure unfair or unlawful gain

see started new job rollover previous employer 401k to new 401k ira or roth ira for a start   kevin the discussion is far more complex than you might think say your account grows by x pretend it 's 10 if you wish and your tax rate is y 25 if you take the initial sum tax it at y but then grow it x the result is identical to doing it in the reverse order so $ 1000 to start can grow to $ 10,000 then after tax $ 7500 or $ 1000 taxed to $ 750 then grow to $ 7500   for pretax deposits the key is that you deposit those contributions at your marginal rate i.e. the rate you 'd pay on the last $ x taxed but withdrawals start at zero   in the perfect scenario you will save 25 28 tax on deposits but at retirement enjoy taxation at for a large portion or all of the withdrawals   note others can suggest rates will rise and they may be right my answer is based on the current tax structure a new earner at 10 or 15 may be better off starting with roth and as they earn their way to 25 or higher slide over to pre tax deposits my 14 year old baby sits and makes enough to fund a roth but pays no tax as she earns less than her own standard deduction for what that 's worth

i used to work for one of the three ratings agencies awhile ago first there are lots of different ratings the bulk of ratings are for corporate debt and public finance so senior debentures fixed income and general obligations e.g. tax free muni bonds respectively ratings agencies are not paid by the investment banks they are paid by the corporations   or state that is issuing debt the investment banks are the syndicate that pulls the transaction together and brings it to market   for mortgage backed securities collateralized debt cdo clo 's all of which are fancy structured securitizations well that is a different matter those   transactions are the ones where there is an close tie between the investment bankers and ratings agencies and those were the ratings that blew out and caused problems   ratings agencies continued to do a decent job with what was their traditional business corporate and municipal bond ratings as far as i know    what said was 100 correct s&amp;p 's fees were paid by investors the people who were purchasing the bonds until about 50 years ago around the same time that hill purchased s&amp;p in 1966 they from that model and started charging the bond issuers for ratings i do n't know if that decision was driven by hill or not though   one more thing not all credit ratings agencies are paid by the issuers one of the 10 's a designation given by the is jones their revenue comes from the investors bond purchasers not the companies issuing bonds unlike the moody 's business model so there is an alternative which i consider hopeful and reason not to totally despair   edit what mentions is also totally accurate the part about roubini who is a professor at or columbia or such and a sensible though slightly high sort is consistent with my impression as for whether it would require government action to implement the changes advocated by roubini yes i guess it would but i do n't know if the government would do that it would be better if the credit ratings agencies would find their own way to a different less conflicted payment incentive model   keep in mind too that many of the provisions of dodd frank have removed the existing regulatory requirements for credit ratings on bonds and other securities this is the scary part though there is n't anything to replace the credit ratings agencies not at the moment as far as i can tell eventually the government is supposed to come up with an alternative but that has n't happened yet which is better not requiring ratings at all or the past situation of sometimes inflated ratings which a false sense of confidence i do n't know

my experience is with cruise lines it may be different on other lines the two biggest things that will run up your tab are drinks and shore excursions drinks expect to pay $ for a beer or coke and $ for a mixed drink you can often buy a fountain card or something like that that is a fixed price for sodas throughout the cruise probably a good deal if you are a big soda or are with kids you get juice iced tea and water at no charge   oh yeah and they add an automatic tip on every drink i 'm sure you could ask them to take the tip off but you 'd look like a tool for doing it considering the mostly who serve you drinks are probably working 16 hour days for peanuts shore excursions these can really add up you could easily double the price of your cruise if you do a lot of the higher end ones you can usually save a ton of money by not booking them through the cruise ship and just pre arranging them through the internet or booking them at the kiosks that are inevitably right next to the dock at each port the cruise director will tell you all sorts of scary stories to dissuade you from doing this but it is mostly bunk often the cruise ship goes through the exact same tour companies and they add as much as a 2 3x markup the fancy dining option there is usually a high end restaurant that you need reservations for and charges a $ i never bother with them the regular dining options are good enough for me but if you are a surf turf you might want to budget for that internet is super expensive around 70 cents a minute if i recall you can buy bulk minutes but it is n't that much cheaper you are better off just bringing a laptop or smartphone and using them in ports i had no trouble finding free wifi at most ports   cell phone danger will your cell phone will work on board but be prepared for a huge bill when you get back i strongly suggest turning off your phone on board or at least disabling the ability to receive calls and text messages you can passively run up a bill that way tips this is one thing i like about cruises they just add about $ person to your bill for tips and there is an option at the end of the cruise to add to that tip for the room etc    there is absolutely no pressure at all to add to that tip i.e. there is no one standing with their palm out   i never minded tipping for service i always just hated having to carry cash around to do it they make this process very easy on board you really do n't need to have cash on board at all bottom line i tend to buy at least a few drinks day and find my own shore excursions with a few thrown in here and there i typically spend about 50 of the cruise price in extras per person

depends what you mean by simplify i thought i would save money when i talked the family into dropping cable tv but it ends up coming out as a wash because we rented more and bought tv shows online from amazon.com   then we bought a new computer so i could keep working on my laptop while the family watches streaming internet we save money but not as much as i thought we did a great purge of stuff from the garage and a couple of summers ago because i wanted to simplify some clothes extra pots and pans a coat rack unused electronics and now i am seeing their replacements coming back into the house in the form of new purchases i guess my lesson is that you can not make another person simplify their life   i love my wife for trying so hard to help me with my plan and i certainly do n't blame her for wanting a coat rack again it is just who she is she does n't see the irony but i should have considered how my desire impacted those around me

the common way to frame the should i sell question is ask yourself would you buy it today at the current price   if you would n't   sell it is sounds like this may be a paper certificate   you will have to research how to present the certificate to a broker to trade it or if the company has a direct shareholder program   i have periodically been offered to sell odd lots to shareholder programs which if one exists may be less hassle than other options   as a part of this your mother 's estate administrator should decide if the estate is selling it 's interest or giving it 's interest to heirs before the sale

this information is clearly material large impact and non public according to the statement of the problem   also decisions like united states v. carpenter make it clear that you do not need to be a member of the company to do illegal insider trading on its stock importantly though stackexchange is not a place for legal advice and this answer should not be construed as such   legal compliance at company a would be a good place to start asking questions
