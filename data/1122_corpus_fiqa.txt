withdrawals from a traditional 401(k plan are always treated as cash income and the taxable portion is taxed at ordinary income tax rates even if the money was held in stocks within the 401(k plan and the amount withdrawn is equal to whatever capital gains you made by selling the stock within the 401(k plan if your plan permits you to take the distribution as stock shares transferred to your taxable brokerage account then for tax purposes it is treated as if you took a distribution of cash equal to the market price of the shares as of the day of the distribution and promptly bought the same number of shares in your brokerage account   and yes if the 401(k plan assets in your ex employer 's plan consists solely of pretax contributions and the earnings then the entire distribution is ordinary taxable income regardless of whether you sold the stock within the 401(k plan or took a distribution of stock from the plan and promptly or after a few days sold it the capital gains or losses if any from such a sale are of course outside the 401(k plan and taxable accordingly finally the 10 penalty for premature withdrawal from a traditional 401(k will also apply if you are not 59.5 years of age or older or maybe 55 since you are separated from service and it will be computed on the entire distribution

you pay tax on the entire amount not just the capital gains    when cashing out such a plan you would pay the top marginal tax rate on the full amount plus another 10 in penalties   it is very likely that the additional income of the balance withdrawal will increase your top marginal rate    it is impossible to come up with a precise answer as we do n't know the following however you can take a concept away from this that is important   you will be taxed and penalized on the entire 401 k balance not just the capital gain    in the best case scenario that is you had little or no income in a given year   under current tax law you would owe about 31 of your 401 k balance in taxes   as this is such an inefficient use of money most authors recommend against it except in the case of extreme circumstances

what you have to remember is that options are derivatives of another asset like stocks for example   the price of the option is derived from the price of the underlying if the underlying is a stock for example as the price of the stock moves up and down during the trading day so will the market maker 's fair value for the option   as options are usually less liquid than the underlying stock market makers are usually more active in providing a market with options thus if you place a limit order half way between the current bid and ask and the underlying stock price moves towards your limit order the market maker will do their job and provide a market at that price thus executing your order

in addition to the issues discussed in 's answer i think you need to consider your medium term saving needs and existing savings in particular do you have a sufficient rainy day fund a fund you will spend if things go wrong for example if you are dependent on a vehicle that is not covered by a guarantee or service plan you should have enough money saved for a couple of major repairs depending on how secure your job is whether it carries sick leave and long term disability and how easy or difficult it would be to find another job in the event e.g. of your employer going bankrupt due to a downturn in your industry you should have months to years of minimal living expenses in your rainy day fund if you do n't have those things covered you should urgently save as much as you can until they are covered if you do then the next savings priority is to put money by for retirement of course if all goes well the rainy day fund will ultimately get folded into retirement but it needs to exist now in a form you can access quickly

actually the other answer is n't strictly correct   it 's an estimate giving a lower bound that gets less accurate as income increases   consider u.s. income tax is based on a progressive tax system where there are income bracket levels with increasing tax rates example given u.s. 2009 federal tax rates for an individual filing as single imagine somebody making $ 100000   assuming no other credits deductions or taxes then income tax based on the above brackets rates would be calculated as follows meaning the average tax rate for the single individual earning $ 100,000 is however a pre tax deduction from that income actually comes off at the top marginal tax rate   consider the same calculation but with taxable income reduced to $ instead i.e. simulating a pre tax $ 1000 deduction that 's a difference of $ 280 which is more than the $ savings that would have been estimated if just using the average tax rate method consequently when trying to determine how much money would be saved by a tax deduction it makes better sense to estimate using the marginal tax rate which in this case was 28   it gets a little trickier if the deduction crosses a bracket boundary   left as an exercise to the reader finally in the case of the deduction being discussed it also looks like payroll fica taxes paid by the employee social security 's 6.2 and medicare 's 1.45 would be avoided as well so add that to the marginal tax rate savings the surest way to know how much would be saved though would be to do one 's income tax return calculation without the deduction and then with and compare the numbers   tax software can make this very easy to do

thanks man even the credit default swaps were initially an amazing deal for the banks selling them they got to collect huge amounts of premium for awhile thinking they 'd never have to pay out for the stories we heard in the big short i bet there 's hundreds of people out there who paid premiums for years until they could n't anymore and never got their big payout        it 's crazy that you could basically take out an insurance policy on something you had no stake or equity in it was literally a bet the data supported the defaults too though looking at delinquency series q1 of 2010 had a staggering of all mortgage payments being late that 's insane some people saw it creeping up and recognized that q1 08 was 76 higher than the previous year and was only climbing and knew it was going to pop

this is either laundering money or laundering non money   all the other answers point out how a cheque or bank transfer will take days to actually clear   that is a red herring there are lots of ways to illegally transfer real money out of existing accounts   stolen cheque books stolen banking details partly in connection with stolen smartphones and credit cards and cards money transfers from other people duped in a similar manner as you are it is much easier to steal money than invent it and it takes quite longer until stolen rather than invented money will blow up at the banks all of those payments will likely properly clear but not leave you in actual legal possession of money   people will notice the missing money and notify police and banks and you will be on the hook for paying back all of it cheques and transfers from non existing accounts in contrast tend to blow up very fast and thus are less viable for this kind of scam as the time window for operating the scam is rather small whether or not the cheque actually clears is about as relevant of whether or not the rolls royce you are buying for $ 500 because the owner has an toe nail and can not press down the accelerator any more has four wheels better hope for the rolls to be imaginary because then you 'll only be out of $ 500 and that 's the end of it   if it is real your trouble is only starting

depends on how long you 're willing to invest for broadly speaking the best by which i mean more reliably repeatable way to make money from market corrections is to accept them as a fact of life and not sell in a panic when they happen such that the money you already invested can ride back up again put another way just invest your money in one or two broad low cost index funds with dividends reinvested maybe spreading your investment over the course of six months or so and then let time do its work have you worked out how much you 've missed out on by holding your money as cash all this time i presume you 've been saving up a while instead of investing it as you went i suspect that by waiting for your correction you 've already missed out on more than you 're going to make from that correction

the question mentions a trailing stop a trailing stop is a type of stop loss order it allows you to protect your profit on the stock while keeping you in the stock a trailing stop is specified as a percentage of market price e.g. you might want to set a trailing stop at 5 or 10 below the market price a trailing stop goes up along with the market price but if the market price drops it does n't move down too the idea is that it is there to catch your profit if the market suddenly moves quickly against you there is a nice explanation of how that works in the section titled trailing stops here the url for the page stops is misleading and a typo i suspect

if you have a huge disparity in incomes maybe    if you make roughly in the same ballpark    the ability to file separately and have one partner the higher earner itemize and claim all the home related deductions while the other takes the standard deduction is one of the greatest middle class loopholes in modern tax law   when married even if filing separately you have to both itemize or both take the standard deduction    you just need to take care that the person itemizing has provably contributed at least the amount they claim toward the house   so have one of you write the checks for the mortgage and property tax and the other pay for everything else and it 'll probably come out roughly even over time   going back to my first line the us tax code seems to be designed around the reed 1950s household with a single earner   the closer you are to equal the bigger the marriage tax penalty gets

with regards to the stock market there are actually two markets involved here primary market value is created in the primary market where capital is exchanged for a residual interest in an opportunity   as a theoretical example if a person operating solo or with a small team were to discover or create a breakthrough product such as an retro aging pill that person likely would n't have the financial means to fully capitalize on his new found idea   others with more capital may also soon discover his idea or improve upon it and exploit it before he has a chance to for a real life example a person studying at a california university during the 1990s discovered a method to index internet webpages and was approached by some students after a talk on the subject   he returned to his native southern europe country seeking funds to develop the web indexing business and failed to do so   two of the students that approached him found capital readily available from investors in their campus sphere their business is today one of the biggest in the world   they had exchanged part of their residual interest for capital to develop their business the primary market of the stock market works mostly same in creating value   it is also dependent upon the secondary market secondary market the secondary market indicates the day to day value of an enterprise   that market allows shareholders to manage their risk appetites and the enterprise 's operators to execute their shareholders interest for gains   in most cases a secondary market reference will be used for pricing a primary market issuance   without that reference capital would be allocated less efficiently creating additional costs for all involved issuers and investors consider what would happen if you sought to purchase a house and the mortgage lenders had no indication what the property was worth   this would make capital very expensive or possibly deny you access to credit   by having an indication all involved are better off   that is value creating there are some large developed economies equity markets such as that in germany where many large enterprises stay privately held and credit financing mostly from banks is used   the approach has proven successful as well so why do some nations financial markets still rely on capricious stock markets when private credit financing may do just fine in many cases   it 's largely a matter of national culture   countries such as the netherlands the uk and the us have long had active equity markets in continuous use that investors have trusted for centuries conclusion when leaders of an enterprise wish to grow the business to a large size with investment from the stock market they are n't limited by the size of their banks capital   those leaders and their prospective investors will rely on the secondary market to determine values   in addition if the leaders raise equity instead of debt capital they are usually accorded more flexibility to take risks since shareholders usually have their own flexibility to transfer those risks to other investors if for any number of reasons they choose to do so stock markets create value in many other ways   the above are the main ways

answer all of their questions honestly and as accurately as you can but do n't stress too much about it   if you do n't know the answer to something ask the insurance agent what it means that 's what they 're there for   if you 're doing this online email the support or the live chat feature many of them have   or do n't do it online if you feel better having an agent in person nowadays most of the major insurers are similar on price so it 's not a massive savings to skip the agent as far as whether it 's important to pick a specific insurer that 's really your call   read reviews understanding that folks with bad experiences are more likely to write reviews than the 90 of folks who get no benefit from homeowner 's insurance you need to make the decision as to how important reputation and ease of claims process is versus price that 's why there are multiple insurers after all you can decide how important it is to you it sounds like you would prefer a simpler claims process so perhaps you should go with someone who is known for an easier claims process understanding that no insurer is always going to agree with every claimant 100

the stock market is not a zero sum game   some parts are forex some option trading but plain old stock trading is not zero sum that is to say if you were to invest at random you would on average make money   that 's because the market as a whole makes money it goes up over time 6 10 annually averaged over time   that 's because you 're not just gambling when you buy a stock you 're actually contributing money to a company directly or indirectly which it uses to fund activities that on average make money   when you buy caterpillar stock you 're indirectly funding caterpillar building tractors which they then sell for a profit and thus your stock appreciates in value   while not every company makes a profit and thus not every stock appreciates in true value the average one does to some extent buying index funds is pretty close to investing at random   it has a far lower risk of course since you 're not buying a few stocks at random but instead are buying all stocks in an index but buying stocks from the s&p 500 at random would on average give the same return as voo with way more volatility so for one you definitely could do worse than 50/50 if you simply sold the market short sold random stocks short you would lose money over time on average above and beyond the transaction cost since the market will go up over time on average secondly there is the consideration of limited and unlimited gains or losses some trades specifically some option trades have limited potential gains and unlimited potential losses take for example a simple call option   if you sell a naked call option meaning you sell a call option but do n't own the stock for $ 100 at a strike price of $ 20 for 100 shares you make money as long as the price of that stock is under $ 21   you have a potential to make $ 100 because that 's what you sold it for if the price is under $ 20 it 's not exercised and you just get that $ 100 free    but on the other hand if the stock goes up you could potentially be out any amount of money   if the stock trades at $ 24 you 're out $ 400 100 = $ 300 right   plus transaction costs    but what if it trades at $ 60   or $ 100   or $ 10000   you 're still out 100 that amount so in the latter case $ 1 million   it 's not likely to trade at that point but it could if you were to trade at random you 'd probably run into one of those types of situations   that 's because there are lots of potential trades out there that nobody expects anyone to take but that does n't mean that people would n't be happy to take your money if you offered it to them    that 's the reason your vs argument is faulty   you 're absolutely right that if there were a consistently losing line that the consistently winning line would exist but that requires someone that is willing to take the losing line   trades require two actors one on each side if you 're willing to be the there 's always someone happy to take advantage of you but you might not get a

very generally speaking if you have a loan in which something is used as collateral the leader will likely require you to insure that collateral    in your case that would be a car   yes certainly a lender will require you to insure the vehicle that they finance toyota or otherwise   of course if you purchase a vehicle for cash which is advisable anyway then the insurance option is somewhat yours some states may require that a certain amount of coverage is carried on a registered vehicle   however you may be able to drop the collision rental car and other options from your policy saving you some money so you buy a new car for cash $ 25 k or so and store the thing   what happens if the car suffers damage during storage   are you willing to save a few dollars to have the loss of an asset   you will have to insure the thing in some way and i bet if you buy the proper policy the amount save will be very minimal sure you could drop the road side assistance rental car and some other options during your storage time but that probably will not amount to a lot of money

any deductable expense will reduce your taxable income not your tax payable your example 1 above is correct and gives you 100 deduction it is like having a business where your sales are $ 100,000 and your expenses in making the sales is $ 40,000 the expenses are your tax deductions and reduce your profits on which you pay tax on to $ 60,000 if your example 2 was correct then the situation above would change that you would pay say $ 30,000 tax on $ 100,000 sales then apply your deductions or expenses of $ 40,000 so that you would pay no tax at all and in fact get $ 10,000 back in your return in this case the government would not be collecting any taxes but paying out returns to everyone your example 2 is incorrect

if you 're really strapped for cash you can get one on the off chance the furnace or air conditioner goes   but if you do have the cash to self insure against these kinds of things i would n't bother with the home warranty here was our experience   our daughter was only a few months old and the air conditioner went in june in virginia   we called in the warranty   they came out tried the cheapest fix they could to fix the leak   it did n't work again in two days   two weeks later they try again with the next cheapest fix   by this point we had gotten a window unit for our bedroom   it did n't work again in two days   two more weeks later they finally got authorization to replace the unit   they replaced it with the cheapest one they could and wanted to charge me $ 75 to haul the old one away   when i said no thanks to that extra service i was calling from work at the time the guy ended the conversation in a walked away from the phone and drove off   i later found out when i called a reputable hvac guy that they did n't even hook the thing up correctly what happens is the contractors get squeezed by the warranty company at every turn   these calls get low priority and the quality of service is as low as they can get away with without violating the terms of their contract with the warranty company for the big stuff it 's better than nothing but not much better   check to see that the big stuff is still covered before buying it at all and drop it after getting a payout like we did

middle class taxes are about as low as they have ever been they are much lower than most of the industrialized world   gt;so proportionally the middle classes end up paying the most tax and gets the least for it   no the rich pay the largest percentage of the tax dollars and they pay more per dollar earned than the middle class you can check this easily from irs tax statistics a person paying a million in taxes a year does n't use the roads 50 times as much as someone paying 20,000 a year either and most other services scale similarly so i 'd say the middle class actually gets more use out of their tax dollars than the rich

with respect to the 401(k before taking a hardship withdrawal one must first deplete the ability to take any 401(k loans available this is a regulation the 401(k loan limit is the lesser of $ 50k 50 your vested balance or $ 50k minus the highest loan balance within the last year here 's the good news it is not a taxable event you can pay back over a maximum of 5 years interest is low usually 4.25 or so the bad news if you terminate employment then the loan balance must be repaid or else it becomes taxable income plus a 10 penalty i suggest you consider eliminating the credit card debt via this option pay back as aggressively as possible and if when you terminate you can take the 10 penalty it will be far less of an impact than 25k accruing approximately 25 annually

short answer no it only matters if you want to use covered calls strategies the price of a share is not important some companies make stock splits from time to time so that the price of their shares is more affordable to small investors it is a decision of the company 's board to keep the price high or low more important is the capitalization for these shares if you have lots of money to invest the best is to divide and invest a fixed of your portfolio in each company you choose   the only difference is if you eventually decide to use covered call strategies to have a buy write on google will cost you a lot of money and you will only be able to sell 1 option for every 100 shares bottom line the price is not important capitalization and estimated earnings are hope this answers your question

the united nations is already working on stripping us of our world reserve currency status so are the brics people think we need to maintain the status quo and give a specific country the world reserve currency there are serious discussions to create a neutral global currency so no country has an edge   i found a lot of posts on the topic but am linking to a really interesting post from a well known publication   gt;the us dollar is getting close to losing its status as the world ’s reserve currency should it cross the line the 2008 financial crisis could look like a summer storm yes worries about insolvency in europe dominate the headlines last week standard amp poor ’s cut spain ’s bond rating to a clear sign that europe ’s financial crisis is far from over but america ’s escalating debt problem is far more likely to a truly global crisis because the dollar has for decades played such a central role in the world economy how bad is the us problem former treasury official lawrence recently pointed out that investors are us bonds and notes the lack of other buyers forced the federal reserve to buy a stunning 61 percent of the total net issuance of us government debt last year like many others he warns that ballooning debt puts the us economy at risk for a sharp correction   reuters the greenback ’s losing to the yuan   but the even larger risk is the potential loss of the dollar ’s reserve currency status a key support of the world economy for the last four decades it started with the 1973 saudi commitment to accept only us dollars as payment for oil followed by opec ’s 1975 agreement to trade only in dollars trading of other commodities came to be priced in dollars reinforcing the dollar ’s reserve status as a result central banks worldwide have held onto large reserves of dollars to facilitate trade that in turn has enabled the us to print much larger amounts of its currency with seemingly little inflationary consequences it ’s also made it easier for americans to import more than they export to consume more than they produce and to spend more than they earn but all that is changing rapidly a number of countries are abandoning the dollar for the chinese yuan last december japan and china agreed to trade in yen and yuan in january the 10 nations of the association of southeast asian nations finalized a non dollar credit agreement equivalent to $ 240 billion strengthening their links with china japan and south korea that same month chinese premier signed a currency swap agreement with the united arab which holds 7 percent of the world ’s oil reserves iran has agreed to accept rubles and yuan in trade with russia and china and now is trading oil with india in rupees and gold in late march the china development bank agreed with its counterparts in brazil russia india and south africa to eschew dollar lending and extend credit to each other in their own respective currencies with global demand for dollars falling central banks around the world will inevitably reduce their dollar reserves that selloff further weakens the dollar against other currencies and in turn drives up inflation all this comes as us federal debt is soaring adding to concerns about the future value of that debt and of the dollar it ’s suddenly much easier to imagine a dollar collapse which would be a highly unexpected occurrence known as a black swan event this would unprecedented disruption because the dollar remains the world ’s most important currency let ’s hope we can avert a global crisis triggered by reckless us government spending what ’s needed is new leadership in washington with the courage to get our fiscal house in order and to defend the dollar against attack in a competitive global market   here is another opinion on the topic   edit let me add if we are constantly adding stimulus from the central banks we are going to be seriously the faith the rest of the world has in us as well the fed was the buyer of what like 10 of our bonds before the crisis now they are buying 60 we have using quantitative easing and stimulus for three years to fix the economy if we were suddenly having a recovery that would be fine because people would know we would be ready to start paying down our debts however we have spent trillions and our gdp growth is about two thirds the average since that 's a sign that there is something wrong with our economy right now clearly not an argument to end stimulus because without it we would be in a major depression the problem is that once people realize that they will question how stable our economy really is   your argument that we are the most stable economy in the world and deserve the reserve currency status is circular logic we have had the reserve currency status since 1944 that has helped us maintain the stability the rest of the world has n't enjoyed for a very long time without it we may never have become anything near the country we are today it gave us access to tremendous capital which we were able to use to expand our nation incredibly we have built an empire on our ability to take on massive amounts of debt i am sure we would have been a superpower without it but no one can say how much or how harder other recessions would have been if we had never been granted that privilege

i think you take some pretty big liberties assuming i think people deserve failure if you assume i think that please note that this speaks more to how you view people who are not wealthy than i do   that aside i think you 're using lucky in a way that most people do not in this instance   is it lucky to eventually achieve a reasonable goal with decades of consistency sure in the ways that i mentioned nuclear war did n't break out no fatal traffic accidents happened etc   do you think that is what people usually mean when they say people who have more money are just lucky or do you think they use the term lucky to mean there is no merit basis for the difference   side note i 'm not saying everyone with money has it because of merit any more than i am saying everyone without money deserves to be broke if anything i 'm disagreeing with the semantics used to discuss wealth and income disparity partly because it is divisive

credit unions have long advocated their services based on the fact that they consider your character   unfortunately they are then at a loss to explain how they determine the value of your character other than to say that you 're buddies play pool together so they 'll give you a loan your credit history score is as accurate a representation of your character in business dealings as can be meaningfully quantified   it tracks your ability to effectively use and manage debt and your propensity to pay it back responsibly or default on obligations   while it is n't perfect it is certainly one of the best means currently available for determining someone 's trustworthiness when it comes to financial matters

wire transfers are not the same as ach transfers   i regular transfer money between chase ally capital one 360 and fidelity and have never been charged a fee because i never do wire transfers   the default for all these banks is ach you must explicitly choose wire transfers edit to answer the modified question one of the fastest ways to send money is via wire transfer although a wire transfer can take days in most cases a wire transfer takes place within minutes it is a direct bank to bank transaction that allows you to move money from your account directly into the account of someone else while it may seem similar to a wire transfer a transaction accomplished with the help of an automated clearing house ach is not the same thing when you arrange for the electronic transfer of funds all of the information is included in a batch which is then sent to the clearing house all of the transactions in the batch are then handled by the clearing house rather than as a direct bank to bank transaction as a result your money is not available as quickly as it often is with a wire transfer the ach process can be more convenient and is less expensive but it also takes a little bit longer

no   if the share price drops to $ 0 it 's likely that the company is in bankruptcy usually debt holders especially holders of senior debt are paid first and you 're entitled to whatever the bankruptcy proceedings decide to give holders of equity after the debt holders are paid off more often than not equity holders probably wo n't get much to give an example corporate bankruptcy usually involves one of two options liquidation or reorganization in the us these are called chapter 7 and chapter 11 bankruptcy respectively canada and the united kingdom also have similar procedures for corporations although in the uk reorganization is often referred to as administration many countries have similar procedures in place i 'll use the us as an example because it 's what i 'm most familiar with in chapter 7 bankruptcy the company is liquidated to pay its debts investopedia 's article about bankruptcy states during chapter 7 bankruptcy investors are considered especially low on the ladder usually the stock of a company undergoing chapter 7 proceedings is usually worthless and investors lose the money they invested if you hold a bond you might receive a fraction of its face value what you receive depends on the amount of assets available for distribution and where your investment ranks on the priority list on the first page in chapter 11 bankruptcy the company is turned over to a trustee that guides it through a reorganization the investopedia article quotes the sec to describe what happens to stockholders when this happens during chapter 11 bankruptcy bondholders stop receiving interest and principal payments and stockholders stop receiving dividends if you are a bondholder you may receive new stock in exchange for your bonds new bonds or a combination of stock and bonds if you are a stockholder the trustee may ask you to send back your stock in exchange for shares in the reorganized company the new shares may be fewer in number and worth less the reorganization plan spells out your rights as an investor and what you can expect to receive if anything from the company the exact details will depend on the reorganization plan that 's worked out local laws court agreements etc for example in the case of general motor 's bankruptcy stockholders in the company before reorganization were left with worthless shares and were not granted shares in the new company

before we all argue about his pricing blah blah let me explain to you how he absolutely fleeced consumers under the guise of helping them   had a handful of sales strategies   40 off   50 off   buy one get one for $ 0.01   buy one get one for $ 0.99   60 off   green tag clearance where things were up to 90 off discounted prices items as low as $   what he did was basically eliminate all of the different kind of sales and just discount a straight 40   meaning that before when you were screwed the worst you would do is their everyday low pricing today if you went in and bought at their worst 40 sale you got exactly what he offers you right now if you were lucky and went in at a better time you actually saved more generally around 50 with type of stuff   not only that he killed coupons this is where you could really rake you would   save money with your card   $ 10 off orders of $ 25   $ 10 off orders of $ 30   $ 10 off orders of $ 50 $ 15 off $ 75 $ 25 off $ 100   again these all varied but you could stack coupons on top of savings   shoppers like me stopped going there because the savings ceased to exist we 're not stupid but he played us like we were and he counted on people 's outrage of sales to dupe them as you can see by the scheme i 've shown you not only saved more before but way more and the argument that it 's better now is patently false because their prices are identical to their worst sale without any coupons   why do you think the red stickers go over the price because they want to hide it the same items at kohls have the sticker from union bay or whoever on it it 's all the same msrp it 's just that he tried to fool the shoppers he did n't have with false outrage but alienated the rest of the shoppers who look at their receipt

question is what do we need to do as far as the irs is concerned i    mean we 'll get the money from them and pay it back less than two    months later you 're probably worried about the gift tax since you 're a couple the maximum exclusion amount is calculated like this the reason the pg multiplier stands separate is that gift splitting does require form 709 filed even if no tax is due unless they actually write separate checks for their respective portions so the math shows that you and your wife can get at least $ 28 k from anyone without the need of gift tax to be paid or gift tax return to be filed you can get up to $ 56 k from your parents but the gift splitting may need to be documented on form 709 since you 're in fact talking about a loan you 're going to repay you 'll need to document it with a note and everything and document the repayment if interest is being paid your parents must declare it on their tax return for the year obviously in this case if the loan is properly documented repaid and the interest is declared the irs wo n't even bother claiming it was a gift even if there 's no real interest it should n't be an issue the irs might assign some deemed interest at their rates that would be considered a gift but assuming no other gift transactions between you exist for the year the amount would be miniscule and way below the $ 14 k exclusion level of course as with any tax concern you get here what you paid for for a proper advice talk to a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state

if you are buying and selling mutual funds in the same family of funds e.g. vanguard then you can set up an on line account on the vanguard website and it is easy vanguard offers a transaction service that allows you to sell shares of vfinx say and buy shares of say from the proceeds of the sale all in one swell but if you are holding the vfinx shares through your on line account with say etrade then it depends on what services etrade provides to you will it allow doing all that in one transaction or will it wait for the cash to come from vanguard and then send the money back to vanguard to invest in in any case selling vfinx shares and investing the proceeds in shares say   can not be done on the vanguard site only vanguard will send the proceeds of the sale of the vfinx shares only to your bank account not anywhere else you   then need to tell t. rowe price where you presumably have an account already that you want to invest $ x in shares and to withdraw the cash from your bank account if you are doing it all through etrade then the money from the sale of vfinx goes from vanguard to etrade into something called a sweep account or maybe your cash account at etrade and you invest it in after appropriate delays in receiving the money from vanguard into etrade etc if your cash account bank or etrade has enough of a balance you could sell vfinx and buy on the same day where the purchase is made from the money in the cash account and replaced a few days later by the proceeds from vanguard bouncing of checks or inability to act on a hot tip to invest in something in the interim is your problem not the bank 's or etrade 's

i live in kenya and also here we have corruption however we use eft rtgs mobile money and its more safe than cheques beware that paper based payments cost you way more than anything electronic often the bank charge you for the cheque book they charge for receiving paper based payment instruments and settlement is often a day or two while mobile electronic settlement is instant seen from a tenants perspective its also easier imagine too the small likelihood that you loose the cheques from your tenants   your fear for your account is understandable but you may need to learn a little now about how accounts are handled in an online community only the persons with the necessary electronic credentials can withdraw from your account being it online via your screen or at the cashier or by other means   therefore your money are safer via the electronic means the cause of your concern can be that you are your control from a paper based visible system into a system which you may not know so much about maybe because of that you have not done so much on computers yet   as a most recent caveat though do n't get into the so called bitcoin technology it is not safe and as you saw most recently the very owner himself became the perpetrator breaking his very own bank by artificially inflating amounts on his own account according to japanese authorities now electronic banking has been in existence since soon 40 years its based on cash so behind the scenes between the banks huge deposits of cash are being moved physically around from vault to vault in the bank 's money exchange transaction settlement system thereby a bank does not need to physically transfer money from one physical bank building to another as they have huge loads of cash stashed in central between which they can now exchange money as compensation for cheques and electronic transfers so behind the scene of the electronic world there are still physical cash being moved around deep under the ground in such vaults i hope this has given you a little bit of confidence in the modern times if you have further questions you are welcome   these were my 50 cents my background is in software development where i have worked on banking systems for more than 10 years making banking systems as part of huge teams working for the largest banks in the world

tl dr   yes the david popularized the debt snowball the method of paying low balance first   it 's purely psychological the reward or sense of accomplishment is a motivator to keep pushing to the next card   there 's also the good feeling of following one you believe to be wise the david is very charismatic and speaks in a no nonsense my way or the highway voice history is riddled with religious leaders who offer advice which is followed without question   the good feeling in theory leads to a greater success rate and really it 's easier to follow a plan that comes at a cost than to follow one that your guru takes issue with   in the end when i produce a spreadsheet showing the cost difference say $ 1000 over a 3 year period the response is that it 's worth the $ 1000 to actually succeed my sole purpose is to simply point out the cost difference between the two methods $ 100 go with the one that makes you feel good $ 2000 just think about it first   if it 's not clear my issue is less with the fact that the low balance method is inferior and more with its proponents wishing to obfuscate the fact that the high interest method is not only valid but has some savings built in when a woman called into the david 's radio show and said her friend recommended the high rate first method he dismissed it and told her that low balance was the only way to go   the rest of this answer is tangent to the real issue answered above   the battle reminds me of how people brag about getting a tax refund with all due respect to the tax software people the goal should be minimizing one 's tax bill getting a high refund means you all year and lent uncle sam money at zero and yet you feel good about getting $ 3000 back in april disclosure when my father in law passed away i took over my mother in law 's finances her ira rmd and taxes first year i converted some money to roth and we had a $ 100 tax bill face on mom since then i have schwab hold too much federal tax and we always get about $ 100 back this makes her happy and i 'll ignore the 27 cents lost interest   1 i need to acknowledge that there are cases where the taxpayer has had zero dollars withheld yet receives a tax refund the earned income tax credit eitc produces a refundable benefit i.e. a payment that 's not conditional on tax due obviously those who benefit from this are not whom i am talking about   also in response to a comment below the opportunity cost is not the rate the bank would have paid you on the money had you held on to it it 's the 18 card you should be paying off that $ 3000 refund likely cost over $ 400 in the interest paid over the prior year

repurchase agreements are a way of financing a security position you have a collateralized loan where you give your security in exchange for cash let 's say you have a 10 year treasury note paying 3.5 while the repurchase rate is 0.5 you loan the security to someone with a promise to repurchase it from them some time in the future you   collect the 3.5 coupon and you pay the 0.5 interest clearly it makes no sense for someone to collect interest on money and also collect coupon payments and for the counter party it makes no sense to be not getting coupon payments and also to be paying interest this how one website explains the process during the transaction any coupon payments that come due belong to    the legal owner the borrower however when this happens a cash    amount equal to the coupon is paid to the original owner this is    called manufactured payment in order to avoid the tax payment on    the coupon some institutions will repo the security to a tax exempt    entity and receive the manufactured payment and avoid the tax coupon    washing i find this description to be the clearest during the life of the transaction the market risk and the credit risk    of the collateral remain with the seller because he has agreed to    repurchase the asset for an agreed sum of money at maturity provided    the trade is correctly documented if the collateral has a coupon    payment during the life of the repo the buyer is obliged to pay this    to the seller

in a word budgeting in order to have money left over at the end of the month you need to be intentional about how you spend it that is all a budget is a plan for spending your money   few people have the discipline and abundance of income necessary to just wing it and not overspend by making a plan at home ahead of time you can decide how much you will spend on food entertainment etc and ensure you have enough money left over for things like rent mortgage and utility bills and still have enough for longer term savings goals like a car purchase or retirement   if you do n't have a plan it 's simply not reasonable to expect yourself to know if you have enough money for a cup as you drive past the starbucks a good plan will allow you to spend on things that are important to you while ensuring that you have enough to meet your obligations and long term goals   another thing a budget will do for you is highlight where your problem is if your problem is that you are spending too much money on luxuries the budget will show you that it might also reveal to you that your rent is too high or your energy consumption is too great on the other hand you might realize after budgeting that your spending is reasonable but your income is too low in that case you should focus on spending more of your time working or looking for a better paying job

diversification is spreading your investments around so that one point of risk does n't sink your whole portfolio the effect of having a diversified portfolio is that you 've always got something that 's going up though the corollary is that you 've also always got something going down winning overall comes by picking investments worth investing in not to state the obvious or anything it 's worth looking at the different types of risk you can mitigate with diversification   company risk this is the risk that the company you bought actually sucks for instance you thought gold was going to go up and so you bought a gold miner   say there are only two abc and xyz   you buy xyz then the ceo reveals their gold mine is played out and the stock goes you 're wiped out but gold does go up and abc does especially now they 've got no competition   if you 'd bought both xyz and abc you would have diversified your company risk and you would have been much better off say you invested $ 10 k $ 5 k in each xyz goes to zero and you lose that $ 5k. abc goes up 120 and is now worth $ 11k. so despite xyz bankrupting you 're up 10 on your overall position   sector risk you can categorize stocks by what sector they 're in we 've already talked about one gold miners but there are many more like utilities bio tech transportation banks etc stocks in a sector will tend to move together so you can be right about the company but if the sector is out of favor it 's going to have a hard time going up     lets extend the above example what if you were wrong about gold going up then xyz would still be bankrupt and abc would be making less money so they went down as well say 20 at that point you 've only got $ 4 k left but say that besides gold you also thought that banks were cheap so you split your investment between the gold miners and a couple of banks lets call them and op for $ 2500 each in xyz abc and op say you were wrong about gold but right about banks goes up 15 and op goes up 40   at that point your portfolio looks like this xyz start $ 2500 -100 end $ 0 abc start $ 2500 + 120 end $ 5500 start $ 2500 + 15 end $ op start $ 2500 + 40 end $ 3500 for a portfolio total of $ or a total gain of   see how that works   region country currency risk so now what if everything 's been going up in the usa and everything seems so overpriced well odds are some area of the world is not over bought like brazil or england so you can buy some brazilian or english companies and diversify away from the usa that way if the market tanks here those foreign companies are n't caught in it and could still go up this is the same idea as the sector risk except it 's location based instead of business type based   there is an additional twist to this currencies   the use the pound and the use the real most small investors do n't think about this much but the value of currencies including our dollar fluctuates if the dollar has been strong and the pound weak as it has been lately then what happens if that changes say you own a british bank and the dollar weakens and the pound strengthens even if that bank does n't move at all you would still make a gain   example you buy british bank bbb for 40 pounds a share when each pound costs $ 1.20 say after a while bbb is still 40 pounds share but the dollar weakened and the pound strengthened such that each pound is now worth $ 1.50 you could sell bbb and because of the currency exchange once you 've got it converted back to dollars you 'd have a 25 gain    market cap risk sometimes big companies do well sometimes it 's small companies the small caps are riskier but higher returning when you think about it small and mid cap stocks have much more room to run than large caps do it 's much easier to double a company worth $ 1 billion than it is to double a company worth $ 100 billion   investment types stocks are n't the only thing you can invest in there 's also bonds convertible bonds cds preferred stocks options and futures it can get pretty complicated especially the last two but each of these investment behaves differently and again the idea is to have something going up all the time   the classical mix is stocks and bonds the idea here is that when times are good the stocks go up when times are bad the bonds go up because they 're safer so more people want them but mostly they 're there to providing steady income and help keep your portfolio from along with the stocks currently this may not work out so well stocks and bonds have been moving in sync for several years and with interest rates so low they do n't provide much income   so what does this mean to you i 'm going make some assumptions here based on your post you said single index self managed and do n't lower overall risk and return i 'm going to assume you 're a small investor young you invest in etfs and the single index is the s&p 500 index etf spy   s&p 500 is roughly the 500 biggest companies in the usa further it 's weighted how much of each stock is in the index such that the bigger the company is the bigger a percentage of the index it is   if is right the top 5 companies combined are already 11 of the index apple microsoft exxon amazon and johnson johnson the smallest news corp is a measly of the index   in other words if all you 're invested in is spy you 're invested in a of giant american companies and a little bit of other stuff besides   to diversify company risk and sector risk are n't really relevant to you since you want broad market etfs they 've already got that covered the first thing i would do is add some smaller companies get some etfs for mid cap and small cap value not small cap growth it sucks for structural reasons examples are for mid cap and for small cap value    after you 've done that and are comfortable with what you have it may be time to branch out internationally you can get etfs for regions such as the eu check out or countries like japan see but you 'd probably want to start with one that 's all major countries that are n't the usa check out efa   in any case do n't go too crazy with it as index investing goes the s&p 500 is not a bad way to go feed in anything else a little bit at a time and take the time to really understand what it is you 're investing in   so for example using the etfs i mentioned add in 10 each and then after you 're comfortable maybe add 10 efa and raise to 20 what the ultimate percentages are of course is something you have to decide for yourself   or you could just chuck it all and buy a single target date retirement fund from say vanguard or t. rowe price and just not worry about it

they are actually pretty common and it 's the reason that anyone who takes a board seat at a company without insurance is playing russian roulette   now winning a shareholder suit on the merits whether personal or derivative liability is a whole different story at least in delaware fun fact de has two judicial systems one for corporate stuff with world class talent and one for everything else     there 's this doctrine called the business judgment rule which is a very high bar for a shareholder to overcome otherwise you 'd see shareholder suits for every business deal that went wrong   the other problem these uber investors might run into is they have n't realized a loss nor are they likely to have a negative return on the initial investment marking down a gain against a high water mark is an uphill battle   based on what it public idk the cause of action maybe kalanick is going back on contractual language in his separation agreement which is currently non public or that some of his actions as ceo could be considered self dealing again not information currently in the public domain or maybe it 's just a threat to put all the non public shitty things he has done in a and therefore put it in the public domain

first to clear a few things up    it is definitely not a gift the people are sending you money only because you are providing them with a service    and for tax purposes it is not a donation it has nothing to do with the fact that you are soliciting the donation as charitable organizations solicit donations all the time for tax purposes it is not a donation because you do not have 501(c)(3 non profit status    it is income the question is then is it business income or hobby related income    firstly you have n't mentioned but it 's important to consider how much money are you receiving from this monthly or how much money do you expect to receive from this annually    if it 's a minimal amount say $ 50 a month or less then you probably just want to treat it as a hobby mostly because with this level of income it 's not likely to be profitable in that case report the income and pay the tax the tax you will owe will be minimal and will probably be less than the costs involved with setting up and running it as a business anyway as a hobby you wo n't be able to deduct your expenses server costs etc unless you itemize your taxes on schedule a.    on the other hand if your income from this will be significantly more than $ now or in the near future then you should consider running it as a business    get it clear in your mind that it 's a business and that you intend it to be profitable perhaps it wo n't be profitable now or even for a while what 's important at this point is that you intend it to be profitable    the irs will consider if it looks like a business and it acts like a business then it 's probably a business so make it so    come up with a name for your business register the business with your state and/or county as necessary in your location get a bank account for your business get a separate business paypal account keep personal and business expenses and income separate    as a business when you file your taxes you will be able to file a schedule c form even if you do not itemize your taxes on schedule a. on schedule c you list and total your business income and your business expenses then you subtract the expenses from the income to calculate your profit or loss    if your business income is more than your business expenses you pay tax on the difference the profit   if your business expenses are more than your business income then you have a business loss you would not have to pay any income tax on the business income and you may be able to be carry the loss over to the next and following years you may want to have a service do your taxes for you but at this level it is certainly something you could do yourself with some minimal consultations with an accountant

after 30 years you 'd have a million dollar house vs a quarter million dollar house you 've captured three quarters of a million dollars in rent given my napkin math hypothetical as i figure the math a 250,000 house appreciating to a million dollar house in 30 years requires a sustained appreciation every year seems unrealistic the historical rate of inflation on average has been closer to 3 3.5 a 3 appreciation would give a final value of $   this also does n't taken into account the idea that you may have bought a property during a housing bubble and so then you would n't get 3 year over year returns but also in terms of capturing rent you are not factoring in necessary or possible costs that renting does n't have   mortgage interest and insurance maintenance property tax insurance buying and selling associated fees and importantly opportunity costs in that the money not tied up in the house could be invested elsewhere    so it is not such a slam dunk as you make it out   many use the ny times buy rent calculator to compare renting vs. buying

having worked at a financial institution this is a somewhat simple two part solution 1 the vendor financial institution simply turns off the overdraft protection in all its forms if no funds are available at a pin presented transaction the payment is simply declined no fee no overdraft no mess 2 this sticking point for a recurring transaction is that merchants such as netflix gold 's gym etc choose to allow payments like this because they are assured they are going to get paid by the financial institution it prevents them from having issues only a gift card will not cost you more money than you put in but i know of several institutions that too many non payment periods can cause them to cease doing business with you in the future tl dr imo if you do n't want to pay more than you have gift cards are the way to go you can re charge them whenever you choose and should you run into a problem simply buy a new card and start over

normally under law today at least in the united states perhaps there is somewhere in the world where things are different debts expire upon the death of someone debt may consume much of their estate but there can not be a net debt passed on to their children   that 's a bit unsatisfactory if you are a lender   people can only sell their future labor to you up to a point they can not sell that of their children   there 's only so much debt that they can run up   however that is only true of private debt   public debt is a whole different ballgame   there debts can be passed down from generation to generation

there is a substantial likelihood over the next several years that the us dollar will experience inflation you may have heard terms like quantitative easing with inflation the value of each dollar you have will go down this also means that the value of each dollar you owe will go down as well   so taking out a loan issuing a bond at a very good rate converting it into an asset that 's a better way to store value possibly including stock in a big stable company like msft and then watching inflation reduce the real value of the loan faster than the interest piles up that 's like getting free money combine that with the tax shelter games alluded to by everyone else and it starts to look like a very profitable endeavour

if you are looking for numerical metrics i think the following are popular price earnings p e you mentioned this very popular one in your question   there are different p e ratios forward essentially an estimate of future earnings by management trailing etc   i think of the p e as a quick way to grade a company 's income statement i.e how much does the stock cost the amount of earnings being generated on a per share basis some caution must be taken when looking at the p e ratio   earnings can be by the company   revenue can be moved between quarters assets can be depreciated at different rates residual value of assets can be adjusted etc   knowing this the p e ratio alone does n't help me determine whether or not a stock is cheap in general i think an affordable stock is one whose p e is under 15 price book i look at the price book as a quick way to grade a company 's balance sheet   the book value of a company is the amount of cash that would be left if everything the company owned was sold and all debts paid i.e. the company 's net worth   the cash is then divided the outstanding shares and the price book can be computed   if a company had a price book under 1.0 then theoretically you could purchase the stock the company could be liquidated and you would end up with more money then what you paid for the stock this ratio attempts to answer how much does the stock cost based on the net worth of the company again this ratio can be by the company   asset values have to be estimated based on current market values think about trying to determine how much a company 's building is worth unless of course mark to market is suspended   this involves some estimating   again i do n't use this value alone in whether or not a stock is cheap i consider a price book value under 10 a good number    cash i look at growth in the cash balance of a company as a way to grade a company 's cash flow statement   is the cash account growing or not as they say cash is king   this is one measurement that can not be which is why i like it   the p e and price book can be tuned but in the end the company can not hide a shrinking cash balance return ratios return on equity is a measure of the amount of earnings being generated for a given amount of equity roe = liabilities   this attempts to measure how effective the company is at generating earnings with a given amount of equity   there is also return on assets which measures earnings returns based on the company 's assets i tend to think an roe over 15 is a good number these measurements rely on a company accurately reporting its financial condition   remember in the us companies are allowed to accounting reports if approved by the government so be careful   there are others who simply do n't follow the rules and report whatever numbers they like without penalty there are many others   these are just a few of the more popular ones   there are many other considerations to take into account as other posters have pointed out

you 're asking if lottery ticket can ever produce a positive expected value ev the short answer is no there 's an interesting article that goes into the details and is heavy on the math and graphs the key point even if you think you have a positive expected value due to the size of the jackpot being larger than the number of possible numbers as more tickets are purchased and the jackpot grows larger the odds of someone else picking the winner goes up and your ev goes down the article concludes it paints a picture for anyone    still holding out hope that a lottery ticket can ever be an    economically rational investment as the jackpot grows in value the    number of people who try to win it grows super linearly this human    behavior has a mathematical consequence even though the jackpot    itself can theoretically grow without bound there is a point at which    the ticket buying grows to such a fever pitch that the    expected value of the jackpot actually starts going down again

first a couple of quick points many people have an ira of any type and a 401k. over your professional career the retirement packages for every employer will be different   for this year you do n't need to decide on the roth or not until april 15th you will be able to put 2014 money into the account as late as april 15th 2015 you will have a better understanding of your job situation at that time it is possible that your post graduation employer does n't offer 401 k matching or has high expense funds only or has no 401k do n't worry about retirement funds and dividend season yes if you invest right before the mutual fund issues the end of year dividend the price per share will go down but in the retirement account you should just allow it to repurchase shares in a non retirement account the dividend would be a taxable event which means you will end up sending money to the irs the retirement account avoids this issue

there are no guarantees in the stock market the index fund can send you a prospectus which shows what their results have been over the past decade or so or you can find that info on line but past results are not a guarantee of future performance returns and risk generally trade off against each other trying for higher than average results requires accepting higher than usual risk and you need to decide which types of investments in what mix balance those in a way you are comfortable with reinvested dividends are exactly the same concept as compounded interest in a bank account that is you get the chance to earn interest on the interest and then interest on the interest on the interest it 's a slow exponential growth curve not just linear note that this applies to any reinvestment of gains not just automatic reinvestment back into the same fund but automatic reinvestment is very convenient as a default this is separate from increase in value due to growth in value of the companies yes you will get a yearly report with the results including the numbers needed for your tax return you will owe income tax on any dividends or sales of shares unless the fund is inside a 401k or ira it 's just normal property and you can sell or buy shares at any time and in any amount of course the advantage of investing through those special retirement accounts is advantageous tax treatment which is why they have penalties if you use the money before retirement re predicting results guesswork and rule of thumb and hope that past trends continue a bit longer really the right answer is not to try to predict precise numbers but to make a moderately conservative guess hope you do at least that well and be delighted if you do better and to understand that you can lose value and that losses often correct themselves if you can avoid having to sell until prices have recovered you can of course compute historical results exactly since you know how much you put in when how much you took out when and how much is in the account now you can either look at how rate of return varied over time or just compute an average rate of return both approaches can be useful when trying to compare one fund against another i get an approximate version of this reported by my financial management software but mostly ignore it except for amusement and to myself that things are behaving approximately as expected as long as i 'm outperforming what i need to hit my retirement goals i 'm happy enough and unwilling to spend much more time on it and my plans were based on fairly conservative assumptions if you invest $ 3k it grows at whatever rate it grows and ten years later you have $ if you then invest another $ 10k you now have $ all of which grows at whatever rate the fund now grows when you go to sell shares or fractional shares your profit has to be calculated based on when those specific shares were purchased and how much you paid for them versus when they were sold and how much you sold them for this is a more annoying bit of record keeping and accounting than just reporting bank account interest but many most brokerages and investment banks will now do that work for you and report it at the end of the year for your taxes as i mentioned

is this an employee stock purchase plan espp if so and there is no required holding period selling right away is essentially a guaranteed bonus with minimal risk one caveat is that sometimes it takes a while to actually receive the shares at your brokerage and in the meantime your company may have an earnings report that could cause the share price to drop if your discount is only 5 for example a bad earnings report could easily wipe that out the only other cons i can think of is espp contributions being withheld from you for months albeit for a virtually guaranteed return and it complicates your taxes a bit on the flip side another pro is that after you sell the shares you are more likely to invest that money rather than spend it

what is a dividend essentially for every share of a dividend stock that you own you are paid a portion of the company ’s earnings you get paid simply for owning the stock for example let ’s say company x pays an annualized dividend of 20 cents per share most companies pay dividends quarterly four times a year meaning at the end of every business quarter the company will send a check for 1/4 of 20 cents or 5 cents for each share you own this may not seem like a lot but when you have built your portfolio up to thousands of shares and use those dividends to buy more stock in the company you can make a lot of money over the years the key is to reinvest those dividends source what is an ex dividend date once the company sets the record date the ex dividend date is set based on stock exchange rules the ex dividend date is usually set for stocks two business days before the record date if you purchase a stock on its ex dividend date or after you will not receive the next dividend payment instead the seller gets the dividend if you purchase before the ex dividend date you get the dividend source that said as long as you purchased the stock before you are entitled to the next dividend if not you 'll get the following one after that

not sure how this has got this far with no obvious discussion about the huge tax advantages of share buy backs vs dividend paying   companies face a very simple choice with excess capital pay to shareholders in the form of a taxable dividend invest in future growth where they expect to make more than $ 1 for every $ 1 invested or buy back the equivalent amount of stock on the market thus concentrating the value of each share the equivalent amount with no tax issues of these dividends are often by far the worst choice virtually all sane shareholders would just rather the company put the capital to work or concentrate the value of their shares by taking many off the market rather than paying a taxable dividend

i 've seen a lot of long and complicated answers here so here is my simple and short answer let 's say the economy consists of 10 apples and then an apple costs if you print 10 $ more you have 10 apples and then an apple costs that is it it 's not what said   over time prices go up however i would like to add something more on the topic inflation is theft if i hack the bank and steal 10 from each account it 's obvious that it is theft it 's a bit less obvious when the government prints out money and people loose 10 of the value in their bank accounts but the end result is the same final note some may disagree but i do not consider inflation when 5 of the apples rot and you have 5 apples and 10 $ and an apple now costs this is a drop in supply and if the demand stays the same prices will rise

in the united states investing towards donation is a great idea because you can donate appreciated securities directly rather than donating cash   notice how much this can benefit you so you get to both a donate untaxed money and then b deduct that unrealized money from your income total on your tax return with the above in mind a good strategy for investing towards this type of donation would be to pick securities that are likely to increase in market value but not likely to produce any other sort of income   so bonds which produce lots of interest income or stocks with dividends or equity mutual funds which distribute dividends as capital gains would all be suboptimal for this purpose of course an even better strategy would be to establish a widely diversified investment portfolio without thought to future donations   then once a year or whenever evaluate all your investments and find some where the market value has increased   then donate some of those shares   no special advance planning necessary note that your tax consequences could be more complicated depending on your exact situation   read the section about capital gain property in irs pub 26 for all the details   there may be special limits on the amount you can deduct   also donations of short term capital gains are treated much less favorably so make sure you donate only long term capital gain property

i just want to point out something that seems to be generally true if you are supposed to report something to the irs and you do n't the irs will probably send you a letter assuming the maximum possible tax liability and it 's up to you to prove that scenario is incorrect in your case you obviously owe no tax but since you did n't report it the irs simply assumed that you do owe tax until you prove otherwise you 're one form away from fixing the issue i have first hand experience that this is also true if you forget to report an hsa distribution i received a letter considering my entire distribution as if it was for non eligible medical expenses this made the amount taxable and had an additional 20 penalty to boot of course i have medical receipts for all of the distributions which makes them not taxable and had i simply put the correct number on my return to begin with i would n't have had to fill out the additional form to correct my mistake

no this is incorrect you can not exclude a portion of your income that would be false reporting what you can do is not use the feie at all and instead use the foreign tax credit if the foreign tax is higher than the us tax there 's a chance that you will have the us tax liability reduced to zero by the credit while still keeping all of your earned income in the agi and thus eligible for the ira contributions

your math is correct if you take the same amount of pre tax wages assuming that that amount can be fully contributed in both traditional and roth cases and assuming the same flat tax rate when contributing and withdrawing then the two are the same however we do n't have a flat tax and due to the way our tax brackets work there is often a slight advantage to traditional accounts recall that not every dollar of your income is taxed at the same rate the tax bracket only describes the rate that the last dollar of your income is taxed at but some of your income will be taxed at lower brackets no matter what your income is your first $ x of income will be taxed at 10 then $ y at 15 etc so what is the tax rate of the dollars of income that you used to contribute to a retirement account is it the first dollars of income the last dollars of income or what since we are comparing an after tax contribution roth versus a pre tax contribution traditional whose income does n't show up in taxable income and all other income is equal the dollars contributed is considered to come from the top in the roth case similarly when you withdraw in the traditional case the withdrawal counts as income is it the first dollar of income or the last dollar of income again since we are comparing the situation where the withdrawal counts as income traditional with the one where it does n't roth all other income being equal the taxable income is considered to be added to the top the difference is that when you contribute to a retirement account you contribute a very small percentage of your income every year probably no more than 5 10 if we count down from the top this small percentage of your income probably falls wholly within a bracket in other words the taxable income in traditional and roth cases are likely in the same bracket so the entire contribution is at the same rate your marginal rate the rate you cite as your tax bracket however when you withdraw in retirement it is likely that every year the retirement account withdrawals account for a large percentage of your income maybe even half or more if we count down from the top this large percentage of your income probably crosses into lower brackets in other words the taxable income in traditional and roth cases are likely to be in different brackets so the withdrawal is partly taxed at one rate partly taxed at another so if your tax bracket is 15 in the traditional case it 's likely that your withdrawal is taxed partly at 15 and partly at 10 so in this case the average tax rate on the withdrawal is lower than your bracket

it depends on the definition of earnings   a company could have revenue that nets in excess of expenses so from that perspective a good cash flow or ebitda but have debt servicing costs taxes depreciation amortization that alters that perspective so if a company is carrying a large debt load then the bondholders are in the position to capture any excess revenues through debt service payments and the company is in a negative equity positions no equity or dividends payable to shareholders and has not produced earnings if a company has valuable preferred shares issued and outstanding then depending on the earnings definition there may be no earnings for the common stock until the preferences are satisfied by the returns so while the venture itself revenues minus costs could be cash flow positive this may not be sufficient to produce earnings for shareholders whose claim on the company still entitles them to zero current liquidation value i.e. they get nothing if the company immediately all value goes to bondholders or preferred   it could also be that taxes are eating into revenue or the depreciation of key assets is greater than the excess of revenues over costs e.g. a bike rental company by the beach makes money on a weekly basis but is out half its stock every 3 months and replacement costs will overwhelm the operating revenues

couple things i will admit i was wrong about the total graduates at each of those programs however numbers taper out the lower the program is down to about 250 300 a class also cut each of those numbers down to about 1/2 1/3 and you get the group that 's actually focused on finance many mbas do consulting marketing product development etc nowadays   also i 'm a bit offended by you saying i do n't understand the cfa could n't be more mistaken boss i 'm for l3 in june like you the requirement is only 2 years in an investment decision role this also means a lot of back office risk guys qualify that 's a pretty fungible qualification you do n't have to be a pm to qualify i have a buddy who qualified having done 2 years in fund accounting not exactly sell side er   i 'm also going to guess you 're a trader brokerage cap markets guy if you wanna throw titles around i 'm in a front office role at a bb too and worked at worked on buy side research at a value shop cfa is definitely more desired in sell side markets focused as opposed to ibd where an mba is more useful more strategy focused    the cfa is vital for up on quantitative skills an mba wo n't cover i 'll absolutely give you that but a lot of people fall into the trap of assuming a cfa is their ticket to bigger and better things if you 're working in back office risk management getting a cfa does n't immediately qualify you to do er which is a very common pitfall i see like an mba it teaches everyone how to do the same type of analysis too another reason   the title means less and less    last weekend i had a conversation with a friend of a friend about this very thing he 's sitting for l3 cfa works back office at a very notable hf and expects to be moved up without any indication that he will to research when he 's done i asked his opinions about things like the european situation fiscal cliff and a hard landing in china not only was he not familiar these concepts he did n't even know what hft was the cfa gives you the tools to analyze the impacts of pension liabilities on eps but it still takes a passion about the markets as well as creative analytical judgement to make it to er    my only point is an mba and cfa are very similar in many ways both tend to hold their noses way to high too it 's about what you chose to get out of it and too often people care more about the title than the process which is why they are still stuck in mediocrity after completing the designations    go through a list of the biggest pms in the business most do n't have either mbas or they achieved alpha by not following standard quantitative models but exploring creative and strategic avenues others undervalue while maintaining strict discipline a model is a tool to better describe behavior and understanding of markets it 's not a solution

i 'll assume you live in the us for the start of my answer do you maximize your retirement savings at work at least getting your employer 's match in full if they do this do you have any other debt that 's at a higher rate   is your emergency account funded to your satisfaction if you lost your job and tenant on the same day how long before you were in trouble   the pay early question seems to hit an emotional nerve with most people while i start with the above and then to would you be happy with a long term 5 return there 's one major point not to miss money paid to either mortgage is n't liquid the idea of owing out no money at all is great but paying anything less than paid in full leaves you still owing that monthly payment you can send $ 400 k against your $ 500 k mortgage and still owe $ 3 k per month until paid and if you lose your job you may not so easily refinance the remaining $ 100 k to a lower payment so easily   if your goal is to continue with real estate you do n't prepay you save cash for the next deal do n't know if that was your intent at some point   disclosure my situation maxing out retirement accounts was my priority then saving for college over the years i had multiple refinances each of which was a no cost deal the first refi saved with a lower rate the second was in early 2000s when back interest was so low i took a chunk of cash paid principal down and went to a from the original 30 the kid starts college and we target retirement in 6 years i am paying the mortgage now 2 years into a 10yr to be done the month before the kid flies out if i were younger i 'd be at the start of a new 30 yr at the recent 4.5 bottom i think that a cost of near 3 after tax and inflation soon to near exceed 3 makes borrowing free and i can invest conservatively in stocks that will have a dividend yield above this jane and i discussed the plan and agree to retire mortgage free

as others have posted the company gains capital in return for its new shares however the share price can still fall the problem is that the share marked is affected by supply and demand like any other marked   if the company just issues the new shares at marked price they will have problems finding buyers   the people who are willing to pay that price has already bought as many shares as they want the company does this to raise capital and depends on the shares actually selling for this to work   so they issue shares at below marked price to attract buyers and the shares get diluted   in the end the share will usually end up somewhere between the old marked price and the issue price the old share owners are probably not too happy about this and will not accept this plan at least here in norway share issue has to be accepted at a shareholder meeting so what is often done instead is to issue buy options for the required number of shares at the below marked price   these options are given for free to the current share holders proportional to their current holding if everybody exercises their options they get new cheap shares that compensates for the loss of share value   if they do n't have the capital themselves they can sell the options and get compensation that way instead

mhoran answered the headline question but you asked could someone shed some light on and differentiate between a retirement account and alternative savings plans retirement accounts can contain nearly anything that one would consider an investment yes there are exception not the topic for today so when one says they have an s&p fund or etf and some company issued bonds etc these may or may not be held in a retirement account   in the us when we say retirement account it means a bit more than just an account earmarked for that goal it 's an account 401(k 403(b ira etc that has a special tax status money can go in pre tax and be withdrawn at retirement when you are in a lower tax bracket the roth flavor of 401(k or ira lets you deposit post tax money and never pay tax on it again if withdrawn under specific conditions   in 2013 a single earner pays 25 federal tax on taxable earnings over $ but a retiree with exactly $ 46 k in gross income who then has $ 10 k in standard deduction plus exemption has a tax of $ less than 11 average rate on that withdrawal this is the effect of the deductions 10 and 15 brackets   as with your other question there 's a lot to be said about this topic no one can answer in one post that said the second benefit of the retirement account is the mental i have retirement money not to be touched emergency money used for the broken down car or appliance replacement and other funds it does n't feel bad to tap for spending vacations etc nothing a good spreadsheet ca n't handle but a good way to keep things physically separate as well    i answered as if you are in us but the answer works if you rename the retirement accounts eg canada has similar tax structure to the us

the setting of interest rates or repurchase rates varies from country to country as well as with the independence of the central bank there are a number of measurements and indices that central bankers can take into account this is a limited overview but should give an indication of just how complex tracking inflation is let alone attempting to control it   house prices are in the mix but which house or which price the choice of what to measure faces the difficulty of attempting to find a basket which really affects the majority regularly and not everyone is buying several new houses a year so the majority are ring from fluctuations in prices at the capital end but not from the interest rate end and this is only when the various agencies statistics central bank labour etc are independent   in countries like venezuela or argentina government has taken over release of such data and it is frequently at odds with individual experience links for the us and for australia

it 's rarely advisable to pay interest for something you can afford with cash just because you have no credit or loan history does n't mean you are n't credit worthy when applying for loans or credit the lending institutions look at your credit report not just your credit score there are lots of things that show up on the reports they receive including but not limited to right now so many people are focused on their credit score they 're taking on unnecessary debt and potentially losing money in the long run yes having a higher credit score will ultimately be beneficial but your score will start growing naturally as you live your life unless of course you can and do pay for everything with cash the concept of monitoring your score and striving to get it as high as possible is being shoved down our throats by advertisers at the moment do n't fall for it rather than taking out a loan which will cost you money in interest and actually show up as a closed account once it 's paid off you might be better served by applying for a credit card and using it sparingly just to start getting that credit history together add usual do n't spend more than you can pay back mantra here get a card with no annual fee and maybe some cash back options and use it as the auto payment for a utility if possible you build credit history increase your score and it does n't cost you any more than you 'd be paying anyways    with regards to the investment question with little to no credit history you 're not going to be approved for a loan with a low enough interest rate anyways think double digits with a co signer you 'll get a better rate but then you need a co signer i do n't know the exact math but in today 's market i 'd say you 'd need a loan interest rate of 2 or lower for investing to be worth thinking about   i believe this answer helps clarify the loan to invest math

yes you can withdraw the excess contribution or actually any amount you contributed for 2015 not necessarily an excess plus earnings from that withdrawn contribution by april 15 and not incur a penalty for the excess contribution it would count as if you did not contribute that amount at all the earnings would be taxed as regular income and the earnings may incur a penalty yes you can recharacterize all or part of your roth ira contribution as a traditional ira contribution or vice versa by april 15 recharacterization means you pretend the contribution was originally made as a traditional ira contribution and did not involve roth ira at all conversion is something very different and can only go from traditional to roth not the other way around you are likely not eligible to deduct that traditional ira contribution so you will have to report it as a non deductible traditional ira contribution on a 2015 form 8606 part 1 note that after you 've it as a traditional ira contribution you can also then convert that traditional ira money to a roth ira if you want achieving the same state as what you have now contributing to a traditional ira and then converting to a roth ira is called a backdoor roth ira contribution if you do n't have any existing pre tax money in traditional ira or other iras then this achieves the same as a regular roth ira contribution except with no income limits when you convert the earnings you have made since contributing will be taxed as income if you had done the backdoor originally to begin with convert right after contributing you would have had no earnings in between and no tax to pay but since if you do the conversion now you have waited so long you are disadvantaged by having to pay tax on the earnings in between if you convert you will have to fill out form 8606 part 2 for the year you convert 2016

basically the easiest way to do this is to chart out the what ifs applying the amortization formula see here using the numbers you supplied and a little guesswork i calculated an interest rate of 3.75 which is good and that you 've already made 17 semi monthly payments 8 and a half months worth of $ out of a 30-year loan term these are the numbers i will use let 's now suppose that tomorrow you found $ 100 extra every two weeks in your budget and decided to put it toward your mortgage starting with the next payment that makes the semi monthly payments $ 780 each you would pay off the mortgage in 23 years making more payments instead of more your total payments will be $ down from $ so your interest costs on the loan were reduced by $ but my mistake we ca n't count this amount as money in the bank it 's included in the next amount of money to come in now after the mortgage is paid off you have $ 780 semi monthly for the remaining 73 months of your original 30-year loan a total of $ which you can now do something else with if you stuffed it in your mattress you 'd earn 0 and so that 's the worst case scenario for anything else to be worth it you must be getting a rate of return such that $ 100 payments 24 times a year for a total of payments must equal $ we use the future value annuity formula here v = plugging in v $ our fv goal $ 100 for p the monthly payment and for n total number of payments we 're looking for i the interest rate we 're making 24 payments per year so the value of i we find will be of the stated annual interest rate of any account you put it into we find that in order to make the same amount of money on an annuity that you save by paying off the loan the interest rate on the account must average however you 're probably not going to stuff the savings from the mortgage in your mattress and sleep on it for 6 years what if you invest it in the same security you 're considering now that would be 146 payments of $ 780 into an interest bearing account plus the interest savings now the interest rate on the security must be greater because you 're not only saving money on the mortgage you 're making money on the savings assuming the annuity apr stays the same now vs later we find that the apr on the annuity must equal surprise 3.75 in order to end up with the same amount of money why is that well the interest growing on your $ 100 semi monthly exactly offsets the interest you would save on the mortgage by reducing the principal by $ 100 both the loan balance you would remove and the annuity balance you increase would accrue the same interest over the same time if they had the same rate the main difference to you is that by paying into the annuity now you have cash now by paying into the mortgage now you do n't have money now but you have way more money later the actual real time values of the money however are the same the future value of $ 200/mo for 30 years is equal to $ for 24 years and then $ for 6 years but the real money paid in over 30 years is $ 72,000 vs $ that kind of math is why analysts encourage people to start retirement saving early one more thing if you live in the united states the interest charges on your mortgage are tax deductible so that $ you saved by paying down the mortgage take 25 of it and throw it away as taxes assuming you 're in the most common wage earner tax bracket that 's $ in potential tax savings that you do n't get over the life of the loan if you penalize the pay off early track by subtracting those extra taxes you find that the break even apr on the annuity account is about

even though when the u.s. canada catches a cold i would suggest considering a look at canadian government bonds as both a currency hedge and for the safety of principal of course in terms of cad not usd we like to boast that canada fared relatively better pdf during the economic crisis than many other advanced economies and our government debt is often rated higher than u.s. government debt that being said as a canadian i am biased   for what it 's worth here 's the more general strategy recognize that you will be accepting some currency risk in addition to the sovereign risks in such an approach consistent with your etf approach there do exist a class of international treasury bond etfs holding short term foreign government bonds but their holdings wo n't necessarily match the criteria i laid out although they 'll have wider diversification than if you invested in specific countries separately

neither you nor others have mentioned the costs of being a homeowner   first there are monetary costs if you own a house you have to pay taxes they will vary by jurisdiction but are usually not zero you also need insurance which again comes with monthly rates   then once in a while you 'll be hit with unpleasant lump sum payments in 30 years the mortgage is over and you own the house but by that time it will probably need a new roof that 's in the price range of a new car and over that time you 'll rack up several other repairs which your landlord covers when you rent   another thing which feels less like an expense emotionally but ends up thinning your wallet is the cosmetic changes you make just because it 's your own home you would n't put marble floors in the bathroom if you rent but you might be tempted to if you live in the house it might be even worth it from a life satisfaction point of view but we are talking finance right now and that 's a minus   and then there are the opportunity costs a house binds you geographically you may pass up on a nice job offer because your house is too far away for example or you might experience liquidity problems because a house is difficult to turn into money in a hurry if you are able to do so it is usually a much larger sum than you need and you are paying the costs inherent in that large transaction these are just examples you can probably come up with more costs   then it is not sure how much money you can get of the house if you change your mind say you take this job at the other end of the country or you become a parent of four and need more space at the time you decide to sell the market may have gone down due to the overall state of the economy or to the house location 's popularity or your own house may have turned undesirable what if you get a mold infestation which would only go away if you strip it to the concrete and rebuild you could let it to renters but that 's a hassle of its own it takes time to find renters it may be expensive income tax regulations like in germany it is risky if they do n't pay you might not see money even if you sue them   then there is the problem that prices reflect not some kind of true value but the intersection of supply and demand and the home market is not as efficient as in a first semester microeconomics textbook the buyers of private homes deal in small volumes have little knowledge in the market pay intermediaries cuts and are emotionally attached to the idea of owning my own house this drives demand up and creates higher prices than if you had perfectly rational actors on both sides people pay money for the feeling of being home owners so those who forego spending on that feeling have more money to invest in something else   owning something always causes expenses you have to calculate the savings of having the house vs. the expenses of having it before you can decide if it is a good deal or not if you only calculate one side of the equation you 'll be badly mistaken

saving money for the future is a good thing whether spending those savings on a business venture makes sense will depend on a few factors including 1 how much money you need that business to make ie will you be quitting your job and relying on the business for your sole income or will this just be a hobby you make some pocket change from 2 how much the money the business needs up front some businesses like simple web design consulting might have effectively $ 0 in cash startup costs where starting a franchise restaurant might cost you $ m on day 1 3 how risky it is the general stat is that something like 50 of all new businesses fail in their first year and i think for restaurants that number is often given as but if you do n't have a business idea yet and save for one in the future but never get that perfect idea the good news is that you 've saved a bunch of money that you can instead use for retirement or whatever other financial goals you have so it 's not the saving for a new business that is risky it 's the spending part of good personal financial management is making financial goals tracking your progress to those goals and changing them as needed in a simpler case many people want to own their own home this is a common financial goal just like early retirement or starting your own business or paying for your kids college education all those goals are helped by saving money so your job as someone mindful of personal finances is to prioritize those goals in accordance to what is important for you

if you are intent on becoming a quant i concur with most of the opinions in this thread you will need a graduate degree because it is a relatively small field and it is densely populated with people who have graduate degrees specializing more closely in the field than engineering will ever touch upon   however do n't give up searching for killer work opportunities like the kind you are currently getting if you maintain an excellent gpa in combination with these work placements you can easily secure a spot in a top degree program you are placed in an comparable program meaning you will possess a top notch understanding of math and have demonstrated experience in business    if you plan to search for work in canada after graduation i would highly recommend getting your graduate degree from university of toronto while it is often a poorly regarded undergraduate finance school when employers are looking for soft skills and queens slaughter undergrads for job placements absolutely no one disputes that university of toronto students have a top notch grasp of theory and it is commonly regarded from what i have heard at least as one of the toughest schools   at u of t there are two degrees that might fit for your field the and index mfe it would probably be prudent to call around or tap people in the industry in nyc or toronto to let you know which is preferable or a best fit i sense the but my opinion is next to worthless here    if you are interested in working in nyc and have the money for a graduate degree in the states without putting yourself under a mountain of debt get educated there your program directors will know the street better than those in toronto most likely gave excellent advice though i would add one thing know that doing this work in canada and the us are very different propositions especially for the sell side you probably know this but look no further than places like wso or colleagues at internships for horror stories related to hours conditions perks pay etc at american banks these days i have friends that have worked 55 hours straight in their offices if you consider that a point of pride go crazy otherwise be wary

well the first one is based on the formula for continuously compounded present value while the second one is the periodically compounded variant   typically the continuously compounded models represent the ideal as the compounding period of time valued money shrinks towards zero and the discount rate or interest rate if positive stays constant over the time period examined the periodic equation 's results approach that of the continuously compounded equation those two assumptions a constant rate and continuous balance adjustment from interest that allow simplification to the continuous form are usually incorrect in real world finance virtually all financial institutions accrue interest monthly for a variety of reasons including simpler bookkeeping and less money paid or owed in interest they also unless prohibited by contract accrue this interest based on a rate that can change daily or even more based on what financial markets are doing most often the calculation is periodic based on the average daily balance and an agreed rate that if variable is based on the average daily rate over the previous observed period so you should use the first form for fast calculation of a rough value based on estimated variables you should use the second form when you have accurate periodic information on the variables involved stated alternately use the first form to predict the future use the second form in retrospect to the past

gt can i use venture like that in a financial context or does it refer specifically to venture capital   yes any business is a venture so to speak    gt so they would receive a smaller return yes   possibly yes   mezzanine investors are well middle investors they 're beyond seed and venture capital but before more late stage private investment that does n't necessarily mean they 're after a seed or venture capital investment it can mean that or it can simply mean the business is a little more advanced than a pure idea or pre revenue etc   let 's say a company is pre destined to get to $ 100 m in value if it can secure funding naturally later investors will have a smaller return of course private investments are generally for smaller younger companies and thus are more risky so an investor can still lose value in a private equity investment   gt is mezzanine investing particularly profitable   yes absolutely you have to understand with investments in private equity firms and individuals are often looking for a multiple of their investment i.e. if an investor invests $ 1 m they expect $ 2 m $ 3 m etc back this is not necessarily for all levels of private equity but many levels will attempt this generally the idea as far as i 'm aware is a 20 irr which means that generally the investment grows by 20 compounding yearly    gt secondly why is dilution so important further down the road is it to do with valuation   absolutely let 's think of our example earlier where you me and joe each own 33 at $ 300 total value   if suddenly another company wants to buy all of our equity for $ 600 then we 're all pretty happy each of us will get $ 200 however let 's say joe had n't come along if that other company then made an offer for $ 600 we 'd both get $ 300 for the company    there 's some other things about dilution too such as the possible loss of control but we 'll save that for later   gt finally at what point would a company aim to meet an ipo is it case specific or is there a general understanding of the best time   it 's very case specific in most cases depending on the industry the company will be relatively a bit older have both revenue and profitability and a history of operations in some cases companies like this will choose to never go ipo such as the big 4 auditing firms for one among others    there are of course exceptions many smaller are pre revenue and are traded on the market tesla is getting revenue but not profitable and it 's on the markets as well these are naturally riskier investments but at least you 've got liquidity to help a bit with that    when a private equity pe firm is looking to exit sell their stake through an ipo they will try to engineer the company to be as attractive as possible to public investors in fact many pe firms will stipulate specific terms and possibly get control of the company from the owner when they initially invest but there 's a lot that goes into it perhaps /u or /u can go into a bit more detail on pe exits as while it 's my chief interest and my career goal it 's not quite where i 'm at yet

you have to balance several concerns here the primary problem is that if you go to the effort of saving your money you want to also be sure that your savings will not lose too much of its value to inflation ukraine had a terrible inflation spike in 2015 for obvious reasons even as inflation has settled down in 2016 it is stabilizing around 12 which is very high   exchange rates are your next concern if you lose a large percentage of the value of your money just in the process of exchanging it that also eats away at the value of your money if you accept the us federal reserve target of 2 inflation then you should only exchange money that you will hold long enough that both exchange fees will outweigh the 10 inflation advantage even in cases where you have placed your money in a foreign currency there 's a chance that your government could freeze accounts denominated in foreign currencies so there 's always the political risk that you have to factor in for that reason keeping foreign currency in cash also has some appeal because it can not be confiscated as easily you could still certainly be robbed so keeping all of your savings in cash is n't a great solution either all in all you are diversifying your savings if you use the strategy of balancing all three methods splitting it evenly to 5 for each method is n't the most important i would suggest taking advantage of good exchange rates as they appear to time when you buy foreign currency

a loan is most generally a liability a part of the balance sheet   expenses income are part of the income statement   income is the net of revenues after expenses the interest is an expense on the income statement but the loan itself does not reside there unless if it is defaulted and forgiven   then it would become a revenue or contra expense depending on the methodology the original purpose of the income statement is to show the net inflows of short term operational accruals which would exclude new borrowing and repaid loans the cash flow statement will better show each cash event such as borrowing debt repaying debt or paying off a bill to show how a loan may have funded a bill which in theory it directly did not because an entity be it a person or business is like a single tank of water with multiple pipes filling and multiple pipes extracting so it is impossible to know which exact inflow funded which exact outflow unless if there is only one inflow per period and one outflow per the same period that being said with a cash flow statement the new loan will show a cash inflow when booked under the financing portion and paying a bill will show a cash outflow when booked under the operating portion   with only those two transactions booked and an empty balance sheet beforehand it could be determined that a new loan funded a bill payment

what does negative total equity means in mcdonald 's balance sheet it means that their liabilities exceed their total assets   usually is means that a company has accumulated losses over time but that 's just one explanation    but is n't mcdonald a very healthy company and never lost money just because a company has always money does not mean it 's a healthy company   it may have borrowed a lot of money in order to operate and now the growth is not able to keep up with the debt load in mcdonald 's case the major driver in the equity change is the fact that they have bought back over $ 20 billion in stock over the past few years which reduces assets and equity   if they had instead paid off debt their equity would not be negative but their debt may be so cheap in terms of interest rate that it made more financial sense to buy back stock instead of paying off debt   there are too many variables to assess that in this forum

yep but it you did n't answer my question edit i know it was phrased as a question but i do know you re supposed to model changes in cash when bankers calculate all three approaches how do they compare them from what i see the conclusion of each approach gives us   public company approach enterprise value transaction approach enterprise value discounted cash flow approach enterprise value + minimum level of operating cash   does an investment banker subtract out that minimum level of operating cash at the end of the calculation to get to a value that he can then compare

yes you can make a direct hsa contribution and deduct it on your 1040 to see an immediate tax benefit for the tax year you can even make a contribution for the previous tax year all the way through tax day of the following year if you opt to do this be sure to contact your financial institution before making the contribution to make sure they apply it to the appropriate tax year just be careful not to exceed the yearly caps so long as you have had coverage all year this is easy to do if you 've only had coverage for part of the year and it 's not your first year with an hsa plan you may need to do some math to make sure you are n't breaking the contribution rules

using your uber vs. medallion taxi driver as an example   the problem in the sharing economy is an individual working as an independent contractor takes on all the risk and diminishing rewards while the profit of the company to which the individual is contracted increases significantly    case in point with uber let 's say you decide you want to drive for you lease a prius and thus are on the hook financially for $ 350/month + $ 100/month insurance + $ 300/month gas and other car expenses and you 'll have that for three years that 's a $ 750 nut    your nut remains the same but you have very little protection to ensure that your earnings are going to continue to come in especially if you look at it long term i am most familiar with the ridesharing market here in seattle and just in the last two years the number of ridesharing drivers lyft sidecar has exceeded an estimated 3,000 sure the customer base grows but there is also a continuing influx of additional drivers competing for those fares with the medallion system there is some level of protection to ensure that the industry remains viable for those who carry a medallion i am not advocating completely for this system and realize that the the government protection gave to the taxi industry led to customer service quality issues    so back to uber as uber fights for market share both capturing from the taxi industry but also competing against lyft and people driving their own cars they lower prices in some cases these lower prices have been in the form of discounts in some cases lower fares in seattle currently the minimum fare for an ride is $ 4 it was $ 6 a year ago uber takes a 20 percent cut from drivers and also charges drivers $ 10 a week to use their service if a driver makes $ 1000 a week in fares they pull down $ 800 of that after taxes let 's call it $ 600 so over the course of a month you 're looking at $ 2400 minus your nut including phone rental let 's call it $ 1600 take home pay    these people are n't getting rich to begin with and are at a huge risk for when uber or lyft or task rabbit or whoever decides to cut their prices again these services are beyond great for the consumer but are a temporary for anyone relying on them for work the big problem here is that companies like uber are advertising heavily that you can make $ on their service enticing people to make investments in things like cars to drive with them but at the end of the day you 're an independent contractor and uber owes you nothing    i believe uber i single them out because i think lyft is a little better at this on the ignorance of potential drivers to lure them into the system

it would essentially make goods from other countries more cheaper than goods from us and it would make imports from these countries to china more expensive   the below illustration is just with 2 major currencies and is more illustrative to show the effect it does not actually mean the goods from these countries would be cheaper 1 gbp = 1.60 usd   1 eur = 1.40 usd 1 cny = 0.15 usd lets say the above are the rates for gbp eur cny the cost of a particular goods assume in international market is 2 usd this means for the cost of manufacturing this should be less than gbp 1.25 in uk less than 1.43 in euro countires less than cny in china only then export would make sense if the real cost of manufacturing is say 1.4 gbp in uk 1.5 eur in euro countires clearly they can not compete and would loose now lets say the usd has appreciated by 20 against other currencies the cny is at same rate 1 gbp = usd 1 eur = usd 1 cny = 0.15 usd now at this rate the cost of manufacturing should be less than gbp gbp less than eur in euro countires in effect this is more than the cost of manufacturing so in effect the goods from other countires have become cheaper and goods from china have become expensive similarly the imports from these countires to china would be more expensive

as cryptocurrencies are rather new compared to most assets there has n't been a lot of specific guidance for a lot of situation but in 2014 the irs announced that it published guidance in notice 2014 21 i 'm not aware of further guidance that has been published beyond that though it would n't surprise me if treatments changed over time in that notice the answer to the first question describes the general treatment for federal tax purposes virtual currency is treated as property general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency your specific questions about what constitutes a business and when you 're considered to be selling the are likely to be considered on a case by case basis by the irs as the amounts involved here are so small relatively speaking my recommendation would be to read through what the irs has published carefully make reasonable assumptions about what scenarios that are described are closest to what you 're doing and document doing so clearly as part of your tax preparations and when in doubt on the side of whichever option incurs more tax is unlikely to be objected to by them of course i 'm not a lawyer or tax advisor i 'm a stranger on the internet so for real advice you should contact somebody qualified i doubt you 'd be too much for not doing so given the amounts involved you could also attempt contacting a local irs office or calling them with your specific questions and they may be able to provide more specific guidance tailored to you though doing so may not save you from an auditor deciding something differently if they were to examine your return later there are also phone numbers to contact specific people listed at the end of notice 2014 21 you could try calling them as well

gt;so i would like to ask you which at this project poor management skill of oracle staffs or plan of oregon are worse to be accused   i believe there is an increased burden on the employer oregon to effectively manage the scope of the work required for the project that the contractor oracle is working   otherwise the contractor has plausible for being able to provide deliver a quality working solution   gt;or do you think that plan was made mainly by oracle   i think the plan was mostly made by oracle with the requirements given by oregon and that 's where things seem messy   my gut tells me though that when an employer hires a contractor for the creation of a fully integrated enterprise system that the employer essentially signs their financial life away to the project in a way that the contractor of indirect or direct damages that come from the result of unforeseen implementation requirements or issues   oracle has been around long enough to know how to legally cover their asses   if there is anything that oregon may have traction on it would be a few of their fraud claims given that oracle has made two wiki with federal agencies of ~$100 amp ~$200 million since 2011 which were from allegations of fraud or false claims   such claims by oregon may be supported by the fact that they allegedly have a former oracle employee who can substantiate the poor quality of the product they were giving to oregon but that blame might go back to oregon 's specifications which i have no insight into   as someone who has witnessed a couple of employer and contractor relationships between public amp private entities my hope out of all of this is that   sales people for contractors think twice before over promising technology solutions that their company ca n't fully deliver on given resource constraints or lack of employer specifications   employers hiring such entities manage them expectations plus the overall project effectively while accepting personal accountability amp responsibility   i think the only people who have a clear picture of what was going on were anyone from either party who were on the front lines of managing the project developing the systems or running them

the article is filled with terrible arguments    the entire point of corporate tax reform is to stop having a situation where startups and small businesses which are net job creators are paying 40 corporate tax rates whereas large established businesses which tend to be net job pay 6 effective tax rates due to the tax advantages of debt the author simply glosses over this and keeps repeating corporations already pay 20 and no new jobs are created    then the author also tries to point towards tax deals as evidence that tax reform is n't needed when that 's exactly why it is needed high corporate taxes result in a situation where large companies can lobby for lower taxes for themselves but smaller companies lacking political influence are stuck paying the high rates illinois is a great example of this phenomenon their corporate taxes are sky high so large companies just threaten to move every time they want lower taxes so you end up with the large company tax which may be like 2 and the small company tax which may be something like 8    overall it 's clear the author has absolutely no understanding whatsoever of the issues involved with corporate tax reform the us corporate tax system is terrible precisely because it rewards debt driven growth and cronyism while punishing real economic growth

how do i determine what to pay the person you pay them either what you believe the work is worth to have done for you vs doing it yourself or how much they ask for after negotiation there 's no rule of thumb because it 's driven by the market   there will always be people who are willing and able to do the work for less than you but ca n't always get work which is the reason they are charging less just as there will always be people who charge much more than you and have to turn work away you are at a comfortable medium where you have enough work to charge a moderate rate and can amplify your reputation network client by the work out as an example if i charge $ to do engineering work but i want to subcontract it out then i have to take into account that so let 's say i have a contract for 20 hours of work at $ $ 2,400 and i figure that i can subcontract out all of it   however it 's going to cost me about 4 hours of work to review their 20 hours of work deal with administrative overhead interpret and pass along requirements etc so if i work 4 hours then the maximum i can pay the contractor for 20 hours of work is the remaining 16 hours x $ 120 the contractor would be doing 20 hours for $ to break even on cash and i only make worth of profit for 4 hours worth of work   that 's actually a net loss unless you can already fill those other 16 hours with paying work i do n't think that would be worth it but if the contractor only required $ then you 're paying him $ 1,200 for 20 hours of work and you get to keep $ 1,200 for only 4 hours of your time   the subcontractor has turned your $ rate into $ now you still only net $ 1,200 rather than the full $ 2,400 so your revenue is down but if you can find work for that other 16 hours at your normal rate then you 're still ahead   alternately you might find that working only 12 hours a week is a fine way to live and choose to forgo that revenue for personal time the costs and break even point vary greatly from situation to situation but hopefully this gives you a framework to evaluate the decision for yourself

both explanations are partly true there are many investors who do not want to sell an asset at a loss   this causes resistance at prices where large amounts of the asset were previously traded by such investors   it also explains why a break through of such a resistance is often associated with a substantial move in price there are also many investors who have stop loss or trailing stop loss limit orders in effect   these investors will automatically sell out of a long position or buy out of a short position if the price drops or rises by a certain percentage typically 8 10 there are periods of time when money is flowing into an asset or asset class   this could be due to a large investor trying to quietly purchase the asset in a way that avoids raising the price earlier than necessary   or perhaps a large investor is dollar cost averaging   or perhaps a legal mandate for a category of investors has changed and they need to rebalance their portfolios   this rebalancing is likely to take place over time   or perhaps there is a fad where many small investors at various times decide to increase or decrease their stake in an asset class   or perhaps for demographic reasons the number of investors in a particular situation is increasing so there are more investors who want to make particular investments   all of these phenomena can be summarized by the word momentum traders who use technical analysis including most day traders and algorithmic speculators are aware of these phenomena   they are therefore more likely to purchase or sell or short an asset shortly after one of their buy signals or sell signals is triggered   this reinforces the phenomena there are also poorly understood long term cycles that affect business fundamentals and/or the politics that constrain business activity   for example note that even if the markets really were a random walk it would still be profitable and risk reducing to perform dollar cost averaging when buying into a position and also perform averaging when selling out of a position   but this means that recent investor behavior can be used to predict the near future behavior of investors which justifies technical analysis

you mentioned you have a bunch of credit cards with no balance while others have fairly high balances i would not recommend you to close the 0 balance credit cards if they have lower apr you can transfer the balance to those cards with lower apr now if those 0 balance cards do not have lower apr closing them will reduce my overall balance and hurt my credit rating and that is true assume that you mean overall credit line instead of overall balance but to my understanding if you keep the payments good and on time that effect is only temporary and therefore you can definitely close them   do n't forget paying off your balance can also lower your utilization rate and therefore increase your credit ratings and you can focus more on that instead also larger number of accounts with amounts owed can indicate higher risk of over extension therefore you should pay off your low balance accounts first and do not open new credit accounts until you have paid off the current balance

this is a great question   i 've participated in a deal like that as an employee and i also know of friends and family who have been involved during a buyout   in short   the updated part of your question is correct there is no single typical treatment   what happens to unvested restricted stock units rsus unvested employee stock options etc varies from case to case furthermore what exactly will happen in your case ought to have been described in the grant documentation which you hopefully received when you were issued restricted stock in the first place anyway here are the two cases i 've seen happen before immediate vesting of all units   immediate vesting is often the case with rsus or options that are granted to executives or key employees   the grant documentation usually details the cases that will have immediate vesting   one of the cases is usually a change in of control or provision triggered in a buyout   other immediate vesting cases may be when the key employee is terminated without cause or dies   the terms vary and are often negotiated by shrewd key employees conversion of the units to a new schedule   if anything is more typical of regular employee level grants i think this one would be   generally such rsu or option grants will be converted at the deal price to a new schedule with identical dates and vesting percentages but a new number of units and dollar amount or strike price usually so the end result would have been the same as before the deal i 'm also curious if anybody else has been through a buyout or knows anybody who has been through a buyout and how they were treated

i 'm in the us and i once transferred shares in a brokerage account from schwab to fidelity   i received the shares from my employer as rsus and the employer used schwab    after i quit and the shares vested i wanted to move the shares to fidelity because that is where all my other accounts are   i called fidelity and they were more than happy to help and it was an easy process   i believe schwab charged about $ 50 for the transfer the only tricky part is that you need to transfer the cost basis of the shares   i was on a three way phone call with schwab and fidelity for schwab to tell fidelity what the purchase price was

this summer i used a loan from my 401(k to help pay for the down payment of a new house we planned on selling a condo a few months later so we only needed the loan for a short period but wanted to keep monthly payments low since we would be paying two mortgages for a few months i also felt like the market might take a dip in the future so i liked the idea of trying to cash out high and buy back low spoiler alert this did n't happen so in july 2017 i withdrew $ 17,000 from my account technically $ principal and $ 150 processing fee at an effective apr 4 rate and then the fee with 240 scheduled payments of $ 2 per month for 10 years over the lifetime of the loan the total finance charge was $ but that money would be paid back into my account i was happy with the terms and it helped tide things over until the condo was sold a few months later but then i decided to change jobs and ended up having to pay back the loan ~20 weeks after it was issued using the proceeds from the sale of the condo during this time the market had done well so when i paid back the funds the net difference in shares that i now owned including shares purchased with the interest payments was $ less than today 's value of the original count of shares that were sold to fund the loan combined with the $ 150 fee the overall cost of the 20 week loan was about that is n't the interest rate interest was paid back to my account balance but the value lost due to the principal having been withdrawn on paper my account would be worth that much more if i had n't withdrawn the money now if you extrapolate the current market return into 52 weeks you can think of that loan having an apr cost of around 10.5 probably not valid for a multi year calculation but seems accurate for a 12 month projection again that is not interest paid back to the account but instead the value lost due to the money not being in the account sure the market could take a dip and i may be able to buy the shares back at a reduced cost but that would require keeping sizable liquid assets around and trying to time the market it also is not something you can really schedule very well as the loan took 6 days to fund not including another week of clarifying questions back forth before that and 10 day to repay from the time i initiated the paperwork to when the check was cashed and shares repurchased so in my experience the true cost of the loan greatly depends on how the market does and if you have the ability to pay back the loan it probably is worth doing so especially since you may be forced to do so at any time if you change jobs or your employment is terminated

once you buy stocks on x day of the month the chances of stocks never actually going above and beyond your point of value on the chart are close to none how about enron   gm worldcom lehman brothers   those are just a few of the many stocks that went to 0   even stock in solvent companies have an all time high that it will never reach again    please explain to my why my thought is   it is based on flawed assumptions specifically that stock always regain any losses from any point in time   this is not true   stocks go up and down sometimes that have losses that are never made up even if they do n't go bankrupt   if your argument is that you should cash out any gains regardless of size and you will never lose i would argue that you might have very small gains in most cases but there are still times where you are going to lose value and never regain it and those losses can easily wipe out any gains you 've made    never bought stocks and if i try something stupid i 'll lose my money so why not ask the professionals first if you really believe that you ca n't lose in the stock market then do not buy individual stocks   you may as well buy a lottery ticket not really those are actually worthless   stick to index funds or other stable investments that do n't rely on the performance of a single company and its management   yes diversification reduces not eliminates risk of losses   yes chasing unreasonable gains can cause you to lose   but what is a reasonable gain   why is your guaranteed x% gain better than the unreasonable y% gain how do you know what a reasonable gain for an individual stock is

generally anyone can selling them is an interesting point as the buyer has a counterparty risk that you wo n't be able to pay at the term of the contract so if i was a vendor buying a derivative in my example i would definitely get that derivative from a bank as opposed to my friend jim bob especially in cases of bespoke derivatives it does n't make sense for anyone except people who have material interest to by it as the expectation value of the hedge is negative essentially you 're more likely to lose money than gain money from a hedge the exception is when you have information above that of the market which could allow for a positive return that is the reason that people advocate for derivatives as mechanisms of price discovery because large imbalances are n't likely to form when someone could arbitrage or even just take positions when the market goes out of whack that only really works in publically traded markets however bespoke derivatives do n't really contribute to better pricing afaik   of course that 's the simple explanation to a huge complex and varied field certainly speculators exist particularly in the more commoditized derivatives especially in the to the financial crisis large amounts were spent on exotic derivatives that blew up in people 's faces the easiest thing to say about them is that they are double edged in theory they 're fantastic as it allows risk to be spread around to people that want it it should lead to a safer system as hedged are less exposed to shocks and are more resilient but in practice we 've seen them used as risk aig we 've seen cases where correlations arise that were n't assumed before and what used to be manageable positions become lead weights we 've seen the dangers that large systemically important financial institutions have when they are a counterparty to tens of trillions in notional derivatives as when they fail the risk of failure is over every derivative they are counterparty to not just the hedged exposure    sorry this is more than you asked for i tend to get carried away

at this stage i would think about education   you can attend open houses and often times real estate agents and bankers put on seminars for first time home buyers   borrow books from the library and i would watch some hgtv   many of the shows are entertaining and quite educational    secondly you may want to get your finances in order   make and stick to a budget   start building a down payment and emergency fund   pay down consumer debt student loans   picking up side work or overtime will help    you will look far more attractive to a lender if you go in with a large down payment and an emergency fund then someone with better credit scores and 100 financing   that is if the lender does manual underwriting   if not then use a different lender once you get a budget figured out how much of a down payment and emergency fund you need and how much consumer debt to pay off you can then predict when you will hit your goals   then you will know when you are ready to buy   if it seems too far off cut spending and work more if it is that important to you you can make a prioritized list about what is most important features to you and your wife i would wait on doing this until after you view some homes   open houses are a great way to do this but be careful not to get house fever and rush into a decision   you will get some encouragement to do so by the selling agents    after viewing some homes and developing your list you can get an idea as of what the home will cost   this will further refine your budget goals and timeline     i think that is a lot of work to start

looks more like an idea for a business rather than an actual business especially since it has n't even launched that said it does have its merits what bank actually holds the deposit funds becomes irrelevant and may change from time to time as they forge better partnerships with different banks   think of it like a mutual fund the individual stocks if there are stocks in the fund are less important than the balance of risk vs. income and the leveling of change over the course of time it offers services banks offer without fees at least that is the proposal with the addition of capability as well it does have downsides as well there is an increased level of between you and your money they propose to simplify the banking business model but in fact are only hiding it from you   the same complexity that was there before is still there with the added complexity of their service on top of it   it 's just a matter of how much of that complexity you would have to deal with directly with that in mind i would reiterate that they are not a business yet just a proposed business model   even the sign up process is a red flag for me   i understand they need to gauge interest in order to forge initial relationships with various banks but i do n't see the need for the invitation only sign up method   it just sounds like a way to increase interest who does n't like feeling exclusively invited and is a bit too for my taste but like i said the idea has merit i have my reservations but will reserve full judgement until they are an actual operating business

as you can see from the graphs above as absolute distance from atm at the money increases the ratio represented by delta begins to approach or 1:1 meaning as delta approaches 1 the option price moves up 1 dollar for every 1 dollar the stock price moves up as delta approaches 0 the option price does not move as the stock price moves as the absolute distance from atm increases gamma approaches zero 0 meaning as the price of the option increases or decrease the change in delta is at its highest as the option price is nearest the money as the price of the option moves away from the money in either direction it changes less drastically interestingly delta is the first derivative of the value of the option price with respect to the underlying asset price and gamma is the first derivative of delta definition of delta definition of gamma

investing is always a matter of balancing risk vs reward with the two being fairly strongly linked   risk free assets generally keep up with inflation if that these days advice is that even in retirement you 're going to want something with better for at least part of your portfolio a whole market strategy is a reasonable idea but not well defined you need to decide how to weight stocks vs bonds for example and short long term and you may want international or reit in the mix again the question is how much again the tradeoff is trying to decide how much volatility and risk you are comfortable with and picking a mix which comes in somewhere around that point and noting which assets tend to move out of with each other stock bond is the classic example to help tune that the recommendation for higher risk return when you have a longer horizon before you need the money comes from being able to tolerate more volatility early on when you have less at risk and more time to let the market recover that lets you take a more aggressive position and on average higher returns over time you generally want to dial that back in the direction of lower risk if not risk free so a late blip does n't cause you to lose too much of what you 've already gained but see above re risk free that 's the theoretical answer the practical answer is that running various strategies against both historical data and statistical simulations of what the market might do in the future suggests some specific distributions among the categories i 've mentioned do seem to work better than others the mix i use which is basically a whole market with weighting factors for the categories mentioned above was the result of starting with a general mix appropriate to my risk tolerance based on historical data then checking it by running about 100 monte carlo simulations of the market for the next 50 years

closing the card will be fine the consequences are related to your available credit and actual potential utilization if you have less total credit any credit you actually use will be a greater percentage of your total credit manipulating your score downwards more greatly the next consequence will be related to the age of your credit history which is an average of your credit lines this seems negligible and also beneficial for you since your credit history is so young to begin with

you need to contact the lender your copy of the title should show that your lender has a lien on the car the potential buyer will want to be able to walk away with good title without risking their money   it will not be as simple as signing the back of the title the lender does n't drop their lien until they get their money when trying to sell a car with a lien to a private buyer you may have to both go to the lender to complete the transaction or the buyer might want to send the money directly to the lender or may insist on an escrow service the fact you do n't own the car may scare most individuals from the process you will have to do whatever makes them comfortable   a dealer will not be concerned about this type of transaction but the fact that most individuals are   may give the dealer enough competitive advantage to lower their offer to you steps keep in mind that after only 7 months many car loans are upside down

fair statement but two points    1 slow change in politics is one of the primary intentions of the design of our system from the beginning   2 these reference points are all over the map pairing economic trends with wars makes things seem more drastic than they are we all knew from the beginning and other regulations were n't going to change shit the reality is that the market is back to all time highs we 're up something like ~12 already this year alone    beyond that i do n't agree with using the market as a proxy specifically for the reason that while the market is crushing it us average joes do n't feel that the more important metric would be incomes and net worth of the middle class which according to buffet is at all time historical highs though i 'm not sure i agree with that either

gt;i could be wrong but you will still get tax at 10    this is n't true for roths   if i put 5k post tax of course money into a roth 401k or a roth ira i can withdraw that 5k whenever i want penalty and tax free   now lets say that 5k has grown to 7k and i take out all 7k the first 5k is penalty and tax free but the extra 2k is taxed with the extra 10 penalty added on   so as long as you do n't touch any growth in your roth accounts you can withdraw the principal amount with the same consequences you would experience if you were to take money out of your checking account at your bank     also money in and ira does not have to be invested it could be in a liquid position     now a pre tax retirement account does n't have the same luxury   if i stick 5k into a traditional ira and it grows to 7k and i pull that money out the entire ammount gets taxed and penalized even the principal amount is subject the 10 penalty      now if you do a roth conversion pre tax to post tax retirment account conversion the principal ammount the amount you paid taxes on is still subject to the 10 penalty for 5 years   after the 5 years you can withdraw the converted ammount tax and penalty free well you already paid the taxes it would just be the growth that is subject to the penalty

if this is your friend and he that convinced he will get rich from this then there 's really nothing you can do   you 've obviously done your best to explain the situation to him but he 's been caught up in their sales pitch and that 's more convincing to him i worked in sales for many years and the answers he gives you the one about not needing to know the details of how your smartphone works is a classic variation of typical objection handling that salespeople are taught proves that he has been sucked in by their scheme at this stage all you 're going to do is ruin your friendship with him if you continue to press the matter because he has made it clear he ca n't be convinced that this is anything other than legitimate   the reality is he is probably in too deep at this stage to just walk away from it so he has to convince himself that he made a wise choice schemes like this use a scarcity approach there 's only so much to go around and if you do n't get yours now then someone else will get it coupled with ego boosting boy mr. prospect this is such a great opportunity and you 're one of only a few who are sophisticated enough to understand and take advantage of it to get people to lower their guard and not ask a whole lot of probing questions nobody wants to feel stupid and they do n't want others to think they 're stupid so these schemes will present the information in such a way that ordinarily prudent questions come across as sounding dumb making the questioner seem not so smart   rather than walking away from it peoples pride will sometimes make them double down on it and they 'll just go along with it to come across as though they get it even when they really do n't the small payouts at early stages are a classic sign of a ponzi scheme   your friend will never listen to you as long as those little checks continue to come in because to him they 're absolute proof he 's right and you 're wrong   it 's those checks or payouts however they 're doing it that will make him step up his efforts to recruit other people into the scheme or worse yet invest more of his own money into this keep in mind that in the end you really have no power to do anything in this situation other than be his friend and try to use gentle persuasion   he 's already made it clear that he is n't going to listen to your explanations about why this is a scam for a couple reasons   first and probably greatest it would be an admission that he 's dumb or at least not as smart as you and who wants that   second he continues to get little checks that reinforce the fact this must be real or why else would he be getting this money   third he has already demonstrated his commitment to this by quitting his job so from his point of view this has become an all or nothing ticket to wealth    the bottom line is these schemes work because the sales pitch is powerful enough to overcome ordinary logic for people who think there just has to be an easy way to easy street all you can do is just be there as his friend and hope that he sees the light before the damage to himself and anyone else gets too great   you ca n't stop him from what he 's doing any more than you can stop the sun from rising as long the message and checks he 's getting from other people keep him convinced he 's on the right path edit after reading the comments posted in this thread i do want to amend my statements because many good points have been raised here   you obviously ca n't just sit by and do nothing while your friend talks others into taking the same or worse risks that he is   that 's not morally right by any measure at the same time however be very careful about how you go about this   your friend as you stated sounds pretty much like he 's all in with this scheme so there 's definitely going to be some serious emotional commitment to it on his part as well   anyone and everything that threatens what he sees as his ticket to easy street could easily become a target when this all comes crashing down as it inevitably will   you could very well be the cause of that in his eyes especially if he knows you 've been discouraging people from buying into this nightmare people are not rational creatures when it comes to money losses   it 's called costs where they 'll continue to chase their losses on the rationale they 'll make up for it if they just do n't give up   the more your friend committed to this the worse his about losing so he 'll do whatever he has to in order to save his position   this is what gamblers do and why the house does so well for itself some have suggested making anonymous flyers or other means of communicating that do n't expose you as the person spreading the message and that 's one suggestion   however the problem with this is that since the receiver has no idea who sent the message they 're not likely to give it the kind of credibility or notice that they would to something passed to them by a person they know and trust and your anonymous message will have little weight in the face of the persuasive pitch that got your friend to commit his own money and future another problem as you 've noted is that you do n't travel in the same circles as the people he 's likely to recruit so how would you go about warning them   how would they view their first contact with you when it comes with a message not to trust what someone else they already know is about to tell them   would they write it off as someone who 's   hard to tell another huge ploy of these schemes is that they tend to preemptively strike at what you propose doing that is warning people to stay away   they do this by projecting the people giving the warnings as losers who did n't see the opportunity for themselves and now want to keep others away from their own financial success   they 'll portray you as someone who is n't smart enough to see this huge opportunity and since you ca n't understand it you do n't think anyone else does either   they 'll point out that if you were so good with finances why are n't you already successful these guys are very good and they have an answer for every objection you can raise whether its to them or to someone else   they 've spent a long time honing their message which makes it difficult for anyone to say something persuasive enough to sway others away from being duped   this is a hard path no doubt i hope you are able to warn others away   just be aware that it may come at a cost to you as well and be prepared for what that might be i hope this helps good luck

predictions especially doomsday predictions can go wrong quickly   i would be careful of anyone calling an end to a country like the u.s. especially if they have something to gain and a history of being wrong   on the other hand someone warning of something with a past of financial credibility can be quite useful   for instance compare frank stansberry to jesse colombo on twitter   jesse was one of the few who predicted the financial crisis in 2004 and is currently warning of new bubbles ie the higher education bubble even admitting to profiting off of some of them and encouraging others to do the same   however his assertions can be investigated to verify accuracy but they are hardly the end of the end in fact jesse likes to boast that he 's an and thinks eventually we 'll usher in a golden age   frank stansberry on the other hand does n't seem to carry the credibility a brief internet search generated some issues he 's had with the sec about misleading investors completely forgot to add mike mish also has made some predictions that have come true and with some other financial advisers over inflation vs. deflation   while people were screaming hyper inflation back in 2008 2009 mish constantly attacked them for being wrong and has continued to be right   some of his political views of course are n't popular but some of his financial predictions have been stellar anyone who warns of anything should always be checked out for both what they 've said what they are currently saying and what their agenda is   as one of my mentors warned me everyone has an agenda and that 's not always bad their agenda may align with yours just make sure it does on a humorous side note my father has predicted the end of the world every six months since 1994

as soon as the usa left the gold exchange standard total factor productivity began to dramatically stagnate    we can trace it back to the early 1900s but because of electricity oil automobiles and computers it is best to track it from nixon taking us off the gold standard     coincidence i do n’t think so a fundamental change in the nature of the money supply almost exactly with a fundamental change to the shape of the nation ’s economy is the simultaneous in income inequality a coincidence too   keynesians may respond that correlation does not necessarily imply causation and though we do not know the exact causation there are a couple of strong possibilities that may have productivity   the gold exchange standard was a free lunch for policymakers gdp growth could be achieved without any real gains in productivity or efficiency or in infrastructure but instead by just pumping money into the system   the gold exchange standard was a free lunch for businesses revenue growth could be achieved without any real gains in productivity or efficiency   and it ’s not just total factor productivity that has been lower than in the years when america was on the gold exchange standard as a bank of england report recently found gdp growth has averaged lower in the pure fiat money era 2.8 vs 1.8 and financial crises have been more frequent in the non gold standard years   it is the best explanation for a fall in productivity even factoring in computers

assuming you max out your roth ira with $ 5000 in inflation adjusted contributions every year from 25 65 your balance at age 65 will depend on the post inflation return you get in the account   assuming you withdraw 4 per year after that here is what your income will be all numbers are in inflation adjusted 2011 dollars    if your post inflation return is zero if you buy treasury bonds money market accounts or something like that you 'll have a simple $ 5000 40 = $ 200,000 which will give you an income of around $ 8000 per year if you get a 3 post inflation return e.g. fairly safe muni bonds corporate bonds and boring stocks you 'll approximately double your money to around $ giving you an income of over $ 15,000 per year if you get a 6 return e.g. more aggressive stocks and more risk taking you 'll approximately double your money again to over $   a 4 withdrawal rate will give you an income of around $ per year stocks have historically returned around inflation + 8 that will get you over $ 1.4 million and an annual income of over $ per year so yes it is feasible to retire on nothing but a maxed out roth ira

governments only have a few ways to get income tax income tax consumption tax property cars boats tax real estate or tax services hotel meals the national state county city and town taxing authorities determine what is taxed and what the rate will be to get enough money to run their share of the government in general the taxing of real estate is done by the local government but the ability to tax real estate is granted to them by the state in the united states the local government decides generally through a public hearing what the rate will be you can usually determine the current rate and tax value of the home prior to purchase though some jurisdictions limit the annual growth of value of the property and then catch it up when the property is sold that information is also in   public records    all taxes are used to build roads pay for public safety schools libraries parks the list is very long failure to pay the tax will result in a lien on the property which can result in your losing the property in a tax sale   most of the time the bank or mortgage company insists that your monthly payment to them includes the monthly portion of the estimated property tax and the fire insurance on the property this is called escrow this makes sure the money is available when the tax is due in some places is is paid yearly on other places every six months with an escrow account the bank will send the money to the government or insurance company here is the big secret you have been indirectly paying property tax the owner of the apartment townhouse or home you have been renting has been paying the tax from your monthly payment to them

a general rule of thumb is to avoid having more than 5 of your investments in any single stock to avoid excessive risk it 's usually even more risky if you 're talking company stock because an adverse event could result in an inferior stock price and you getting laid off under other circumstances the ideal amount of company stock is probably 0 but there are tax benefits to waiting as you 've noted and if you 're reasonably confident that the stock is n't likely to jerk around too much and you have a high risk tolerance i.e. lots of extra savings besides this and you 're comfortable the risk of losing some money it might make sense to hold onto the stock for a year but never any longer the real risk to holding a lot of company stock does n't depend on how often you buy it and sell it per se but having period purchases every month should make it easier for you to ladder the funds and regularly sell your old shares as you purchase new shares you might also consider a stop loss order on the stock at or near the price you purchased it at if the stock is at $ 100 then you buy at $ 85 and then the stock drops to $ 85 there are no more outstanding tax benefits and it makes no sense to have it as part of your portfolio instead of any other speculative instrument you probably get better diversification benefits with any other speculative instrument so your risk adjusted returns would be higher

i think there are two questions here a is it better to continue living with your parents while you save up for a bigger down payment on a house or to move out as soon as possible b is it better to pay off a student loan and make a smaller down payment on the house or to keep paying on the student loan and use the cash for a larger down payment on the house regarding a this is mostly a personal priorities question you do n't say if you 're paying your parents anything but even if you are it 's likely a lot less than the cost of your buying your own home it is almost certainly economically better to stay with your parents but do you like living with your parents and do they like having you around or are they pushing you to move out are you fighting with them regularly do you just like the idea of being more independent if you 'd prefer to have your own place how important is it to you is it worth the additional cost these are questions only you can answer regarding b you need to compare the cost of the student loan and the mortgage loan start with the interest rates of each for the mortgage loan if your down payment is below a certain threshold 20 last time i bought a house you have to pay for the lender 's mortgage insurance so add that in if applicable if you are paying points to get a reduced interest rate factor that in too then whichever is more expensive that 's the one that you want to make smaller if one or both are variable rate loans well you say the student loan is fixed than you have to guess what the rates might be in the future

you have a high risk tolerance then learn about exchange traded options and futures or the variety of markets that governments have decided that people without high income are too stupid to invest in not even kidding it appears that a lot of this discussion about your risk profile and investing has centered around stocks and bonds the similarities being that they are assets issued by collections of humans corporations with risk profiles based on the collective decisions of those humans that does n't even scratch the surface of the different kinds of asset classes to invest in bonds boring bond futures happening over there also there are potentially very favorable tax treatments for other asset classes for instance you mentioned your desire to hold an investment for over a year for tax reasons well every futures trade gets that kind of tax treatment partially whether you hold it for one day or more see the 60/40 rule a rebuttal being that some of these asset classes should be left to professionals stocks are no different in that regards either educate yourself or stick with the managed 401k funds

i 'm not an accountant and you should probably get the advice of one to be sure about what to do   however if the business is a sole proprietorship you 'd complete a schedule c for the business and you 'd end up with a loss at the end   if the investment you made in the business is considered to be entirely or partially at risk per the irs definition you 'd get to claim all or part of the loss as a reduction in your income   if the business was an llc then you 're beyond my already limited knowledge there may be some other considerations based on whether this was really a business vs a hobby and whether or not you 're going to try to continue with the business or whether you 've shut it down   i 'm not sure about those parts but they 'd be worth exploring with an accountant

its fraudulent because it is feeds on new investment to pay the old investors the exact definition of a ponzi    and it now is contingent on the faith of the us as with most other debts there is no trust fund of this wealth sitting waiting for us if the usa fails   but do tell me how is ss not a ponzi scheme does it not use new money to pay the old if the new money ran out would it not default on its debts in the future and what part of the constitution says the us government should collect some of my wages and save it for me for later   you do know some people have opted out of ss even the us government will not take the fight to court they know its a sham

if you sell a stock you do n't own it 's called a short sale you borrowed the shares from an owner of the stock and eventually would buy to close on most normal shares you can hold a short position indefinitely but there are some shares that have a combination of either a small float or too high a short position that shares to short are not available   this can create a short squeeze where shorts are burned by being forced to buy the stock back   last when you did this you should have instructed the broker that you were selling to open or selling short in the old days when people held stock certificates you were required to send the certificate in when you sold today the broker should know that was n't your intention

keep in mind that if you choose a loan for the boat you may be required by the lender to maintain a minimum coverage of insurance during the term of the loan further some states require you to carry some level of liability insurance on your boat and some entities require liability insurance when using certain bodies of water within their jurisdiction if neither apply to you and if you could suffer the loss of the boat itself could you similarly suffer the damages caused by your boat if you lose control   let 's say you hit a much larger more expensive boat or your boat breaks free from it 's dock and damages the dock well beyond the cost of your boat are you also able to withstand these costs if not you may want to invest in minimum liability insurance if at this point you are still convinced that you are not at financial risk due to the boat i 'd strongly suggest a plan of self insurance   take the money you would normally spend on insurance and invest it in low risk investments that can be liquidated in a matter of months   if you do have a problem with the boat your risk is mitigated by the self insurance   if you do n't then you have not only saved that money but increased its value

the owner of a long futures contract does not receive dividends hence this is a disadvantage compared to owning the underlying stock if the dividend is increased and the future price would not change there is an arbitrage possibility for the sake of simplicity assume that the stock suddenly starts paying a dividend and that the risk free rate is zero so interest does not play a role one can expect that the future price is equal to the stock price before the dividend if the future price would not change an investor could buy the stock and short a futures contract on the stock at expiration he has to deliver the stock for the price set in the contract which is under the assumptions here equal to the price he bought the stock for but because he owned the stock he receives the announced dividend hence he can make a risk free profit consisting of the if interest do play a role the argument is similar

just for clarification my perspective on education background is from a front office associate at a bb that interacts with the traders and analysts at other bb 's and hf 's daily many of whom have become good friends   take it for what you will   it 's not my role to tell you which is right for you but i can definitely give an honest perspective of which is far more common    gt there were people who passed l3 last year    does n't take into account the number of these that were already mba holders quite a larger percent as mba has become less competitive and a cfa is required to demonstrate the quantitative capacity of a mba holder   this is a huge factor in the skew of your numbers as mba 's have become dime a dozen mba holders are now being expected to hold a ms or get a cfa to establish that their quantitative skills are qualified for working on modern day wall st front office roles   gt and became charter holders   wrong   passing l3 does n't automatically make you a charterholder   you need the 48 months of approved experience in portfolio management investment analysis or market research   these roles are becoming more and more exclusive to target graduates and mba holders so the likelihood of a cfa charterholder already having a mba is actually increasing   gt now lets just take the top 25 mba programs that 'd be 460 people class graduating to reach this number actual numbers are much lower than this   clearly you do n't realize the graduate enrollment levels at target schools   lets take a look at full time enrollment meaning 1/2 graduates each year for the top 10 for finance   wharton     nyu   columbia mit   stanford   harvard   uc   ucla   750 northwestern     that 's averaging graduates year per school at the top 10 schools for finance   to argue that there are no graduates from unc duke usc cornell dartmouth yale rice etc on wall st would be ignorance in its form   gt trust me i 'm a big fan of the cfa    you might be a fan but clearly you do n't know much about the exam keep reading and you 'll see why   gt but i know some really dumb people who are charter holders because they learned to memorize a test   memorize a test   you can def argue that for l1 not for l2 or l3   there 's a reason there 's such a collective failure amongst candidates that pass 1 and move on to l2 and l3   l2 requires critical scenario understanding of the concepts more than the formulas itself   it tests your ability to understand complex and unique fra such as repatriated foreign delta 's on cash flows not just memorizing a formula and regurgitating   l3 is even more removed from just formulas as requiring detailed essay responses   3 hour section with 10 15 essay questions yeah sounds like formula memorizing /s   gt these same people would never get admitted to a top 10 no less 25 mba program   this is an irrelevant point   there are plenty of top 10 and top 25 mba program grad 's that would n't pass the cfa either   both emphasize different skillsets   front office wall st is becoming more and more geared towards ms holders and cfa charters many mba 's holders and mba programs lack the quantitative focus to take these roles and are being denied   gt;one thing i will give you there are way too many mbas in general partially because of all the part time night time executive ones but an mba is very different then a cfa in that its banded by school and category   absolutely   that reinforces my entire point that mba 's are dime a dozen   what are we arguing about again   mba 's are very different than a cfa in that even within target schools they each emphasize on entirely different skills   mit finance mba grads are far more likely to possess strong quantitative than say a harvard mba   the reason is that the cfa is a standard qualification that focuses entirely on quantitative capacity it is like a ms in the sense that its a mile deep and a foot wide whereas mba 's are a foot deep and a mile wide   gt everyone with a cfa has the same cfa however a wharton degrees sure carries a lot more clout than a one   you 're right   but a cfa is n't meant to be comparable and interchangeable with a wharton degree   the cfa 's closest comparison is a ms in quantitative computational finance   so if you 're trying to say cfa is less valuable than a mba it 's apples and oranges   you never will see a job require a mba or cfa the cfa will always be listed on a job role as preferred ms cfa   try comparing cfa against a ms from columbia or carnegie mellon grad and you might have valid results

you are comparing a risk free cost with a risky return if you can tolerate that level of risk the ups and downs of the investment for the chance that you 'll come out ahead in the long run then sure you could do that    so the parameters to your equation would be if you assume that the risky returns are normally distributed then you can use normal probability tables to determine what risk level you can tolerate to put some real numbers to it take the average s&p 500 return of 10 and standard deviation of 18   using standard normal functions we can calculate the probability that you earn more than various interest rates so even with a low 3 interest rate there 's roughly a 1 in 3 chance that you 'll actually be worse off the gains on your investments will be less than the interest you pay   in any case there 's a 3 in 10 chance that your investments will lose money

berkshire hathaway would be a good example of a company that has yet to pay dividends yet is a highly valued stock a couple of key points here to note is how on the first hand you have that the dividend policy will never change yet could n't one argue that there will always be new investors wanting more shares and thus the price keeps going up until someone gains control and decides to issue dividends   i 'm just pointing out how on the one hand you are claiming a never changing and yet on the other thinking there will be a termination when the reality is that unless there is a zombie apocalypse of some form life will continue and there will be new people to want to buy the stock and some people be willing to sell at the new prices

black scholes is close enough for american options since there are n't usually reasons to exercise early so the ability to do so does n't matter which is good since it 's tough to model mathematically i 've read early exercise would usually be caused by a weird mispricing for some technical market action reason where the theoretical option valuations are messed up if you sell a call that 's far in the money and do n't get any time value after the spread for example you probably sold the call to an who 's just going to exercise it but unusual stuff like this does n't change the big picture much

i should think the primary reason is due why those countries have a higher standard of salary its not what you get but what it buys you in a high salary low exchange rate country like sweden you get a lot of services that your taxes buy you healthcare and quality of life in a stable country is something you want when you get old note that your viewpoint might be very different when you 're a kid moving to a country that has less impact on your finances is often because that country has significantly fewer services to offer so a swedish citizen might think about moving to a 3rd world country and find that their retirement income is n't sufficient to pay for the kind of lifestyle they actually want such countries tend to be pleasant to live in only if you are exceptionally wealthy   now this kind of thing does happen but only within reason there are a number of old people who retire to the coast in the uk at least and many people who used to work in london who retire to the south west for them the idea of moving does n't seem so bad as they are moving to areas where many other people in their situation have also moved see florida for an example for us citizens too

how much should my down payment be ideally 20 of the purchase price because with 20 of the purchase price you do n't have to pay a costly private mortgage insurance pmi   if you do n't have 20 down and come across a good property to purchase it is still a good idea to go forward with purchasing with what you are comfortable with because renting long term is generally never a good idea if you want to build wealth and become financially independent how much should i keep in my emergency fund people say 3 12 months of living expenses   keep in mind though in most cases if you lose your job you are entitled to unemployment benefits from the government how long should my mortgage be 30 year amortization is the best you can always opt to pay more each month   but having that leverage with a 30 year loan can allow you to invest your savings in other opportunities which can yield more than mortgage interest best of luck

reversing your math i am assuming you have $ k to work with   in that case i would simply shop around your local banks and/or credit unions and have them compete for your money and you might be quite surprised how much they are willing to pay a couple of months ago you would be able to get about 4.25 from israel bonds in canada on 5 years term the product with minimum investment of $ 25 k   it 's a bit lower now but you should still be able to get very good rates if you shop around banks or credit unions who are more hungry for capital than the well funded banks or you could look at preferred shares of a large corporation   they are different from common shares in the sense they are priced according to the payout rate i.e. people buy it for the dividend a quick screen from your favorite stock exchange ought to find you a few options another option is commercial bonds   you should be able to get that kind of return from investment grade and higher bonds on large corporations these days   i just did a quick glance at marketwatch 's bond section and found aaa grade bonds that will yield > 5   you will need to investigate their underlying fundamentals coupon rate and etc before investing second thought grab a introduction to bonds book from chapters first hope these helps

i think you raise a very good point here    it is a very well known fact that the us is not a leader in automated manufacturing europe has traditionally been the place that consumes the majority of the automated manufacturing equipment that in turn comes out of japan    japan specializes in the manufacture of automated manufacturing equipment and has since the us this market to them in the 1950s offering the japanese access to the technology created at general motors called ladder logic and logic controllers these technologies were created from scratch on the shop floor at general motors at a time when there was a saying that what is good for general motors is good for the america   this was back before were affordable those early manufacturing robots actually used of and ladder logic which is still used till this days in the robots that come out of japan is still based on although they are now virtual    the japanese ran with the tech and now many people believe that the japanese invented it certainly they refined it over the years but the early work was handed to them in part as an effort to win them over from their potential allegiance with the japan was always a much larger lynch pin than either korea or vietnam where the actual military battles went down what was really scary to america was losing japan and the transfer of robotics technology to the japanese was part of the arrangement to keep them cozy with the us military empire    but the largest customer was not within japan the actual sales of equipment went to the europeans that 's where automated manufacturing is currently at its peak however things have been rapidly changing and for over a decade the fastest rising automation market has been china    currently foxconn or the large contract manufacturer famous for their apple contracts is in the process of building an automation base in the middle of taiwan    if you want jobs in automated manufacturing technology you should be studying chinese as well as
