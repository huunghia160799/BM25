i believe it 's not only legal but correct and required a 1099 is how a business reports payments to others and they 're required by the irs to send them for payments of $ 600 or more for payments like this the payment is an expense to the landlord and income to you and the 1099 is how that 's documented although note that if they do n't send you a 1099 it 's still income to you and you still need to report it as such it 's similar to getting a 1099-int for interest payments or a 1099-div for dividend payments you 'll get a 1099-misc for a miscellaneous payment if you were an employee they 'd send you a w-2 not a 1099
# 282681
it is legal   they 're probably going to give you a 1099-misc which is required of businesses for many cash payments over $ 600 in value to all sorts of counterparties   probably box 3 of 1099-misc as is typical in cash for keys situations where one is paid to early    a 1099-misc is not necessarily pure income but in this case you do have money coming in   this money is n't a return of your security deposit or a gift the payment could possibly be construed by you as a payment to make you whole but the accounting for this would be on you   this is not a typical situation for irs reporting    however if you are uncomfortable with potentially explaining to the irs how you implemented advice from strangers over the internet the safest course is to report it all as income   look at it this way you did enter into a mutual contract where you were paid consideration to release your leasehold interests in the property

you can accept almost anything mutually agreeable to you and the other party as payment that 's the definition of barter if you agree to trade manufactured goods for livestock as long as both parties agree on the terms i 'm not aware of any law that would prohibit it i hedged with almost because of course you ca n't accept something that is explicitly illegal like you ca n't say you 'll accept cocaine as payment less obviously there are laws regulating the sale of guns nuclear fuel agricultural products etc you 'd still have to pay taxes and it can get complicated to determine the taxable value of the transaction sorry but you ca n't avoid taxes by getting your income in something other than cash

ethically you and your landlord should always report both income and expense as there technically exists a service and a rent so it is subject to taxation on the other hand it can be considered an exchange of a simple favour and if it does n't involve a money exchange or any profits i am assuming that you are not selling what you or your landlord produce on the market no value can be calculated thus no taxation can be applied this changes though if a contract is involved as a legal value can be estimated caution these subjects can vary on an extreme level of of what can and can not be claimed as income and expense which can vary per country state province and even per judge as well as the nature and sector of the work also if you intend to formalize this relationship the type of contract and reporting forms do vary per state as well so it might be best to confirm it with a local legal advisor to avoid unfortunate surprises

when inflation is high or is rising generally interest rates will be raised to reduce people spending their money and slow down the rate of inflation as interest rates rise people will be less willing to borrow money and more willing to keep their money earning a good interest rate in the bank people will reduce their spending and invest less into alternative assets but instead put more into their bank savings when inflation is too low and the economy is starting to slow down generally interest rates will be raised to encourage more spending to restart the economy again as interest rates drop more will take their saving out of their bank accounts as is starts to earn very little in interest rate and more will be willing to borrow as it becomes cheaper to borrow people will start spending more and investing their money outside of bank savings

ok it 's a bit of a but here goes you only pay corporation tax in the uk on any profit made so your salary would not be classed as part of the profit so in the example you give you would only pay corporation tax on £ 4k less your salary ie £ so profit on the £ 800 remaining gross profit you do n't say if your figures are monthly annual etc but you only pay income tax if you earn over £ in any given tax year the rates increase as your income does check here   you may have a different tax code you would need to check that with hmrc but the link gives the default position which is correct for most people if the figures you give are monthly then i would consult an accountant as they are likely to save you more than they will charge for their services you will probably find it is most tax efficient to pay yourself a dividend from the company 's profits but check with an accountant more info

i 'm not an expert by any means but pretty much every source i 've seen says that one year is far too short for any sort of real investment   most guides suggest that anything less than 3 5 years should stay in no risk accounts like savings or cds   if you need to be sure you get all of the money back after just one year any sort of market based investment e.g. stocks or bonds is too risky one option is to buy i bonds   you can buy up to $ 10,000 worth in a calendar year and 12 months is the minimum holding period   the advantage of i bonds is that the interest rate is indexed to inflation so that roughly speaking they can not lose value in real dollars   right now they pay per year which is substantially better than you 're likely to get with a savings account or 12-month cd   this would come to $ if you buy $ 10k of i bonds if you sell before holding them for five years which you will under your plan you forfeit the last 3 months worth of interest   even so your effective rate will likely be better than a savings account or cd   also you could get 12 months worth of interest if you 're able to buy them slightly early and/or postpone your sabbatical slightly so that you hold them for 15 months your other option is to find the best rate you can in a cd or savings account   nerdwallet for instance suggests you could get between 1 and 1.1 for a $ 10k deposit in a 1-year cd which would be about $ 100 as you can see either way your money is not going to grow that much   you 'll be gaining somewhere in the ballpark of a couple hundred dollars at most   there just is n't a way to earn more than that in one year without some risk of losing principal i 'm assuming based on your texas flag pic that you live in the usa   to buy i bonds you must be a us citizen resident or government employee

note i am the currency units   while i strongly suspect it 's us$ i do n't know from the chart   the system works the same no matter what the currency a call or a put is the right to sell put or buy call shares at a certain price on a certain day this is why you see a whole range of prices   not all possible stock values are represented the number of possibilities has to be kept reasonable   in this case the choices are even units for an expensive stock they may be spaced even farther apart than this the top of the chart says it 's for june   it 's actually the third friday in the month june 15th in this case   thus these are bets on how the stock will move in the next 10 days while the numbers are per share you can only trade options in lots of 100 the left side of the chart shows calls   suppose you sell a call at 19 the top of the chart   the last such trade would have gotten you a premium of per share the flip side of this is when the third friday rolls around it will most likely be exercised and they 'll be paying you only 19 a share for a stock now trading at something over 26   note the volume bid and ask columns though you're not going to get for such a call as there is no buyer   the most anybody is offering at present is a share now lets look farther down in the chart say a strike price of 30   the last trade was only .10 think it 's very unlikely that fb will rise above 30 to make this option worthwhile and thus you get very little for being willing to sell at that price   if fb stays at 26 the option will expire worthless and go away   if it 's up to 31 when the 15th rolls around they 'll exercise the option take your shares and pay you 30 for them   note that you already gave permission for the trade by selling the call you ca n't back out later if it becomes a bad deal going over to the other side of the chart with the puts here the transaction goes the other way come the 15th they have the option of selling you the shares for the strike price   lets look at the same values we did before   19   there 's no trading you ca n't do it 30   here you will collect 3.20 for selling the put   come the 15th they have the right to sell you the stock for 30 a share   if it 's still 26 they 're certainly going to do so but if it 's up to 31 it 's worthless and you pocket the 3.20 note that you will normally not be allowed to sell a call if you do n't own the shares in question   this is a safety measure as the risk in selling a call without the stock is infinite   if the stock somehow up to 10,000 when the 15th rolls around you would have to come up with the shares and the only way you could get them is buy them on the open market you would have to come up with a million dollars   if there simply are n't enough shares available to cover the calls the result is catastrophic whoever owns the shares simply gets to dictate terms to you   and in the days of old this sometimes happened

since your child is 2 he has a long time horizon for investment   assuming the savings will be used at age 19 that 's 17 years   so i think your best bet is to invest primarily in equities i.e. stock based funds and inside an resp why equities   historically equities have outperformed debt and cash over longer time periods   but equities can be volatile in the short term so do purchase some fixed income investments e.g. 30 government bonds and money market funds and do also spread your equity money around as well e.g. buy some international funds in addition to canadian funds   rebalance every year and as your child gets closer to university age start shifting some assets out of equities and into fixed income to reduce risk   you do n't want the portfolio by an economic crisis the year before the money is required next why inside an resp finally what if your kid does n't attend post secondary education   first you should probably get a family resp not a group resp   group resps have strict rules and may forfeit contributions if your kid does n't attend   have a look at choosing the right resp and canadian capitalist 's post the pros and cons of group resp plans in a family plan if none of your kids end up attending post secondary education then you forfeit the government match money the feds get it back through a 20 on withdrawals   but   you 'll have the option of rolling over remaining funds into your rrsp if you have room

the risk of any investment is measured by its incremental effect on the volatility of your overall personal wealth including your other investments   the usual example is that adding a volatile stock to your portfolio may actually reduce the risk of your portfolio if it is negatively correlated with the other stuff in your portfolio common measures of risk such as beta assume that you have whole market diversified portfolio in the case of an investment that may or may not be hedged against currency movements we ca n't say whether the hedge adds or removes risk for you without knowing what else is in your portfolio   if you are an eu citizen with nominally savings or otherwise stand to lose buying power if the euro depreciates relative to the dollar than the hedged etf is less risky than the unhedged version   on the other hand if your background risk is such that you benefit from that depreciation then the reverse is true hedging means reducing the risk already present in your portfolio   in this case it does not refer to reducing the individual volatility of the etf   it may or may not do that but individual asset volatility and risk are two very different things

almost everyone needs an insurance you should also probably buy it if you are good at planning which it seems from your question you should stick to pure term insurance and avoid any other types variants of   is only advisable if one can not commit to investing or is not good at saving money or one feels that one loses money in term insurance otherwise term insurance is best

i remember reading in an earlier version of pub 590 or possibly the instructions for form 8606 that timely contributions for year x to an ira are deemed to have been made on january 1 of year x regardless of when they were actually made but i do n't seem to be able to find it now in current versions of pubs or 590b and so can not include a citation of chapter and verse be that as it may the calculations on on form 8606 part i effectively track basis on an annual basis rather than on a daily basis and so the fact that the traditional ira has a zero balance and basis 0 too at some time during the year does n't matter in the least   in detail though you did n't ask for it note that the whole $ 6500 that you put in remains non deductible in its entirety but you owe taxes on only $ of that $ 100 k that you rolled over into a roth ira and not on the whole $ 100 k as you were assuming would have been the case so in effect of that $ 6500 nondeductible contribution to your traditional ira you did really get to deduct $ from your taxable income for 2016 and make only a $ 400 nondeductible contribution exactly equal to your basis in your traditional ira as per the form 8606 calculations   i can only assume that the software package that you are using the above calculations exactly and does what the irs says you must do on form 8606 rather than what you get by tracking the basis on a daily basis irs regulations and instructions are not necessarily the same as what the tax law says they are interpretations of the tax law based on what the irs understands the tax law to say people have challenged various specific irs regulations and interpretations as being different from what the law says in tax court and been successful in some cases and failed in others if you believe that tracking basis on a daily basis is what the law says instead of just being reasonable and rational and rationality are not required either of congress in the laws that they write or the irs regulations that interpret the laws you should take up the matter with the irs or the tax court

plenty   following are just a few for things like resp and rrsp which have an end date as you or your children age you should be migrating to less speculative investments and more secure ones   when children are young for example you might be in a growth type fund   later on you would likely want to switch that to an income fund which is also more conservative and less likely to lose principal are you getting the best benefit from your credit cards   is there another card with benefits that you would get more back from using   is that fee based air miles card worth it   is cash back better for you if you have regular investment withdrawals can you increase them   do you like the plan they are going in to   similarly look over any other long term debt repayment   student loans car loans mortgage   what is coming up this year what is ending   if for example car payment will end how will you earmark that money so it just does not disappear into general funds while you could go over things like these more often once a year should be plenty often to keep tabs and not obsess good luck

yes if and only if you properly use p y and c y.    for your familiarity i recommend also trying it with i = 12 and p y and c y = 1   i like to think of p y and c y as per period and prefer to divide the interest rate by the number of periods per year but so long as you keep everything coherent in the solver you will get the correct answer with both approaches

the penny pilot program has a dramatic effect on increasing options liquidity bids can be posted at .01 penny increments instead of .05 increments a lot of money is lost dealing with .05 increments issues are added to the penny pilot program based on existing liquidity in both the stock and the options market but the utility of the penny pilot program outweighs the discretionary liquidity judgement that the cboe makes to list issues in that program the reason the cboe does n't list all stocks in the penny pilot program is because they believe that their data vendors can not handle all of the market data but they have been saying this since 2006 and storage and bandwidth technology has greatly improved since then

it 's not at all different from anything that happens in reality everybody deals with risk and uncertainty everybody worries about the future and everybody puts their best mind to bear on it you gamble you hedge your bets you try to do your best with what you 've got and what you 're willing to give up people who are n't in the financial industry can also think about their goals in a fine tuned strategic mathematical way being able to accurately model reality is useful for pretty much everything   the way in which it is actually totally different is not addressed people who deal in derivatives can do a very precise job of predicting the future so can and fish the difference is that people who deal in derivatives have the ability to leverage reality to obtain a preferred future reality in a uniquely influential way the guy is acting like investment banks live up on a mountain and look at tea leaves and send down about securities once a year    the shape of the graph is in some loose sense the business of the financial system particularly the big investment banks which are sometimes thought of as dealers in risk    so are drug dealers but the guesses investment banks make about the future affect the actual future of investment banks in a way that is n't available to say so they are dealing with much less of their own risk than most people    and selling derivatives means consciously trafficking in risk and uncertainty in a relatively form this makes it interesting to people who do n't buy or sell derivatives for a living but who are curious about risk and uncertainty   it also makes it interesting to people who are curious about why their lives are affected by the the risk and uncertainty of people who trade in derivatives

should i invest the money i do n't need immediately and only withdraw it next year when i need it for living expenses or should i simply leave it in my current account this might come as a bit of a surprise but your money is already invested we talk of investment vehicles an investment vehicle is basically a place where you can put money and have it either earn a return or be able to get it back later or both the neither case is generally called spending there are also investment classes which are things like cash stocks bonds precious metals etc different things that you can buy within an investment vehicle you currently have the money in a bank account bank accounts currently earn very low interest rates but they are also very liquid and very secure in the sense of being certain that you will get the principal back now when you talk about investing the money you are probably thinking of moving it from where it is currently sitting earning next to no return to somewhere it can earn a somewhat higher return and that 's fine but you should keep in mind that you are n't really investing it in that case only moving it the key to deciding about an asset allocation how much of your money to put into what investment classes is your investment horizon the investment horizon is simply for how long you plan on letting the money remain where you put it for money that you do not expect to touch for more than five years common advice is to put it in the stock market this is simply because in the long term historically the stock market has outperformed most other investment classes when looking at return versus risk volatility however money that you expect to need sooner than that is often recommended against putting it in the stock market the reason for this is that the stock market is volatile the value of your investment can fluctuate and there 's always the risk that it will be down when you need the money if you do n't need the money within several years you can ride that out but if you need the money within the next year you might not have time to ride out the dip in the stock market so for money that you are going to need soon you should be looking for less volatile investment classes bonds are generally less volatile than stocks with government bonds generally being less volatile than corporate bonds bank accounts are even less volatile coming in at practically zero volatility but also have much lower expected rates of return for the money that you need within a year i would recommend against any volatile investment class in other words you might take whichever part you do n't need within a year and put in bonds except for what you do n't foresee needing within the next half decade or more which you can put in stocks then put the remainder in a simple high yield deposit insured savings account it wo n't earn much but you will be basically guaranteed that the money will still be there when you want it in a year for the money you put into bonds and stocks find low cost index mutual funds or exchange traded funds to do so you can not predict the future rate of return of any investment but you can predict the cost of the investment with a high degree of accuracy hence for any given investment class strive to minimize cost as doing so is likely to lead to better return on investment over time it 's extremely rare to find higher cost alternatives that are actually worth it in the long term

when you buy a bond you 're giving a loan to the issuer the interest rate on the bond is the interest rate on the loan usually and this is also the case with the treasury bonds the rate is fixed for the term of the loan thus if the market rate for similar loans a year later is higher the rate for the loan you gave remains the same

the calculation can be made on the basis that the loan is equal to the sum of the repayments discounted to present value   for more information see calculating the present value of an ordinary annuity with deriving the loan formula from the simple discount summation   as you can see this is the same as the loan formula given here in the uk and europe apr is usually quoted as the effective interest rate while in the us it is quoted as a nominal rate   also in the us the effective apr is usually called the annual percentage yield apy not apr using the effective interest rate finds the expected answer the total repayment is £ n = £ using a nominal interest rate does not give the expected answer

assuming that you accept the premise that technical analysis is legitimate and useful it makes sense that it might not work for a small market or at the very least that it would n't be the same for a small market as it is for a large market   the reason for this is that a large stock market like the u.s. stock market is as close to a perfect market as you will find compare this to a small market in a small country market information is harder to get because there are not as many media outlets covering the news there are n't as many participants and possibly it might be more expensive to participate in and there might be more regulatory intervention than with the large market   all of these things can affect the prices the closer you get to a perfect market the closer you get to a point where the prices of the stocks reflect the true value of the companies without external forces affecting prices

perhaps the real question you are asking is how can the tax code be fixed to make it simple for everyone including me and what would it take to effect those changes there are really two causes for the complexity of the tax code many of those who enter government hold a desire for power and government uses the tax code as one lever of power to distribute to their supporters and to nudge everyone to behaviors which they favor the current system enables incumbents to spend taxpayer money to reward those they favor and thus they accumulate power and security those who enter government also love to spend money especially other people 's money and their behavior recognizes no boundaries they will spend money without control until the taxpayers them to a brutal stop they enact complex rules which are used to ease the tax burden for some which buys their support with taxpayer money and they spend money to benefit those which they favor the system of lobbyists and contributors exists to entice government to treat them and the causes they support favorably this system enables incumbents to spend taxed money to reward those they favor and to tax those they thus their greed is satisfied and their power is increased the freedom you seek is not available although you can minimize the effort required for compliance you can take the standard deduction and use nothing but the w-2 provided by your employer and unless you are subject to the alternative minimum tax you will find that the tax software will do most of the work for you do you want to approach the of minimal effort to appease your tax collectors avoid starting your own business charitable donations investment income 1099 income and you will need minimal paperwork avoid earning enough to risk the amt alternative minimum tax refuse to take the mortgage interest deduction tax credits for electric vehicles tax credits for high efficiency appliances and air conditioners tax credits for residential solar panel installations do not own investments which pay interest or own stocks where you need to track the basis purchase price of the stocks nor buy and then sell valuable items that might gain value where you would need to track the purchase price the basis avoid owning and leasing a rental home for income deducting businesses expenses and mileage for business purposes contributions to a retirement plan outside an employer plan all complicate your tax filing the solution you truly desire is either a flat tax or the fair tax these solutions would effect either a single tax rate with no deductions or adjustments to income yeah right or a national retail sales tax which would tax the money spent in the economy regardless of the source of the money legal gifts crime and there would be no need to report income or classify it the largest objection to either is that the tax code might become less progressive increasing tax rate with increasing income good luck

you ask about the difference between credit and debit but that may be because you 're missing something important regardless of credit debit there is value in carrying two different cards associated with two different accounts the reason is simply that because of loss fraud or your own mismanagement or even the bank 's technical error any card can become unusable for some period of time exactly how long depends what happened but just sending you a new card can easily take more than one business day which might well be longer than you 'd like to go without access to any funds in that situation you would be glad of a credit card and you would equally be glad of a second debit card on a separate account so if your question is i have one bank account with one debit card and the only options i 'm willing to contemplate are a do nothing or b take a credit card as well then the answer is yes take a credit card as well regardless of the pros or cons of credit vs debit even if you only use the credit card in the event that you drop your debit card down a drain so what you can now consider is the pros and cons of a credit card vs managing an additional bank account unless you seriously hate one or more of the cons of credit cards the credit card is likely to win my bank has given me a debit card on a cash savings account which is a little scary but would cover most emergencies if i did n't have a credit card too of course the interest rate is rubbish and i sometimes empty my savings account into a better investment so i do n't use it as backup but i could your final question can a merchant know if i give him number of debit or credit card is already asked can merchants tell the difference between a credit card and debit card yes they can and yes there are a few things you ca n't or might prefer not to do with debit the same could even be said of visa vs. mastercard leading to the conclusion that if you have a visa debit you should look for a mastercard credit but that seems to be less of an issue as time goes on and almost everywhere in europe apparently takes both or neither if you travel a lot outside the eu then you might want to be loaded down with every card under the sun and three different kinds of cash but you 'd already know that without asking

i would n't go quite that far     it 's formatted and not written i 'll give you that   i 'd guess it 's written by someone who believes they they have a flair for and the dramatic and writes as they would talk   assume amy hoy is a slightly awkward gal at you and this all seems a little more tolerable     but i find her points somewhat solid     i think she 's presenting from a ideological standpoint where safety and security are paramount and the risk associated with startups is too much risk   but i think the point that s he 's making about the poisonous rhetoric associated with glorious death and working for a startup being very similar is well thought out and quite an interesting perspective   i go to a school whose idea of business is entrepreneurship   i left their business program because my career goals simply can not be sustained by entrepreneurship until a very long while into my career and i found the here 's how to have a startup focus of the bulk of the courses essentially valueless to me where i am now     having seen what the author refers to as the of successful startups great word by the by i can not help but those courses and the ways we were sold on this ideology     much was made about how much money was made by successful startups   much was made of the independence the power the glory of winning the startup lotto and making it big   the guys that did it young were and lauded as the greatest of our generation     no mention was made of the failures   no mention was made of the failure rate   no mention was made of the costs associated with failure   no mention was made of the people who got fucked as these entrepreneurial saints made their fortunes     further the ones that got the most attention were the ones who went back and did it a few more times   anyone clever who won big and cashed out and quit while ahead was mentioned as a success but their retirement or cashing out went   some sort of shameful detail maybe     the guys that won big and went back and tried again were praised for their determination and   if they set themselves back to square one betting on an unsuccessful attempt that was     vcs were praised as the greatest thing that happened to entrepreneurship   we were given no real warnings about hey those contracts can be kinda shady sometimes or they want a big cut yo instead they were the grease to our machine   it was a money making machine   a machine of winners   of the great men and women of our generation   of everything that is good about western society     and we are letting our generation down if we do n't play     seriously     i had a prof tear a strip off a kid for asking something along the lines of but what 's wrong with working for a company that already exists and can pay a steady wage   the prof got started in on how our generation is and just fall into things and accomplish little on our own   he moved into how it 's merely riding someone else 's and it 's not really achieving anything for yourself   the tl;dr of what was a fifteen minute in class of a student who asked what i thought was a reasonable question was if you 're not signing your own you are a huge failure and are contributing nothing of note to society or it 's progress     this particular rant pretty much sealed my withdrawal from the business aspect of my school   if my very goals render me a huge failure in my profs eyes i 'm not interested in what they have to say or in contributing to their employment at the university     but off that somewhat personal tangent the culture of glory of the startup that amy hoy somewhat complains about in her article certainly exists   in the form she 's complaining about     your rebuttal makes sense too it 's not that vc are or are n't a risk it 's not that people do n't have the right and the opportunity to take that risk if they see it as a valid opportunity to make money it 's not like it 's fair to expect a vc to fund you without seeing a profit in the long run     but you 're her thesis with something that does n't actually address it     the culture that she 's complaining about exists in my experience the culture glosses over so much of what you her article with that risks exist and that failures exist and that there are a lot of harsh realities associated with the startup world   the culture does indeed all the best parts of startup dom and creates a toughness challenge that renders no this may not be a good idea because failure are personal while successes are cultural    successful startups and people who have done very well by them are held up as everything startups are supposed to be and look at how their hard work paid off and if yours does n't work it is entirely that you did n't work hard enough   someone who has bought in wholesale holds that there are no bad startups any startup can be successful you just need to bust balls working harder if you fail     startups are akin to gambling   they 're not the roulette of it 's all luck but closer to five card skill plays a lot of a role but there 's still luck involved     startup culture represents all this as far closer to texas hold em where luck in minimized where skill and diligence play the greatest role   it assumes that everyone going in already knows all the things you brought up in your rebuttal without ever actually giving them that information   it keeps just work harder without really saying hey guys check the odds you 're playing with and know when to hold and when to

since most developed countries view a low but positive inflation rate as ideal it is very likely that we will end up with positive inflation   however modern societies such as japan have experienced extraordinarily long periods of deflation   in their case however it is mostly due to a political unwillingness to impose the costs on savers as savers are politically in control as to your point about things being so much cheaper in our grandparents days this is actually completely untrue for the vast majority of goods when measured in real terms e.g. relative to the median workers wages   today a decent bicycle can be bought with the average worker 's earnings over a few days whereas our grandparents would have had to work over a month   a modern radio can be bought for perhaps an hours worth of work $ 10 on amazon.com but our grandparents may have had to spend months working to buy their first radio   there is no reason for this trend not to continue point is inflation is not such a bad thing so long as wage growth keeps up or exceeds it

i would also be getting out of the stock market if i noticed prices starting to fall and a crash possibly on the way there are some good and quite simple techniques i would use to time the markets over the medium to long term i have described some of them in the answer to this question of mine what are some simple techniques used for timing the stock market over the long term you could use similar techniques in your investing and in regards to back testing dca to timing the markets i have done that too in my answer to the following question investing in low cost index fund does the timing matter timing the markets wins hand down in regards to back testing and the concerns kent anderson has brought up when i back test a trading strategy if that strategy is successful i then forward test it over a year or two to confirm the results as with back testing you can sometimes curve fit your criteria too much by forward testing you are confirming that the strategy is robust over different market conditions one strategy you can take when the market does start to fall is short selling as mentioned by some already i am now short selling using cfds over the short to medium term as one of my more aggressive strategies i have a longer term strategy where i do not short but tighten my stop losses when the market starts to tank sometimes my positions will keep going up even though the market as a whole is heading down and i can make an extra 5 to 10 on these positions before i get taken out the rare position even continues going up during the whole downturn and when the market starts to recover so i let the market decide when i get out and when i stay in i leave my emotions out of it the best thing you can do is have a written trading plan with all your criteria for getting into the market your criteria for getting out of the market and your position sizing and risk management incorporated in the plan

financial advisers like to ask lots of questions and get nitty gritty about investment objectives but for the most part this is not well founded in financial theory   investment objectives really boils down to one big question and an addendum   the big question is how much risk you are willing to tolerate   this determines your expected return and most characteristics of your portfolio the addendum is what assets you already have background risk   your portfolio should contain things that hedge that risk and not load up on it   if you expect to have a fixed income some extra inflation protection is warranted   if you have a lot of real estate investing your portfolio should avoid real estate   if you work for google you should avoid it in your portfolio or perhaps even short it given risk tolerance and background risk financial theory suggests that there is a single best portfolio for you which is diversified across all available assets in a market cap weighted fashion

how would this trade behave irl i do n't know how the simulation handles limit orders and bid ask spreads to know it 's feasible but buying at when the current ask is 8.00 seems unlikely   that would mean that all other sell orders between 8.00 and were fulfilled which means that there were very few sellers or that sell pressure spiked both of which seem unlikely in reality it seems more likely that your order would have sat there until the ask dropped to $ if it ever did and then you 'd have to wait until the bid rose to $ in order to sell them at that price however that kind of swing in option prices in not unrealistic   options near at the money tend to move in price at about 50 of the change in the underlying so if amazon suddenly dropped by $ 5 the option price could drop by $ from to $ and then rise back to $ if the price rose $ 8 which would be 1 swing and not unheard of intra day but it sounds like you got very lucky or the simulation does n't handle option trading realistically i 've traded options in the past and have had some breaks similar to yours   i 've also had bad breaks where i lost my entire investment the options expire out of the money so it should be a very limited part of your portfolio and probably only used for risk management e.g. buying put options to lock in some gains but keeping some upside potential

the short answer is that you can use student loans for living expenses   joe provides a nice of loans   i would just add that some loans are not only guaranteed but also subsidized   essentially the government buys down the rate of the loan the mechanics are that a financial aid package might consist of grants work study job subsidized and guaranteed loans   one can turn down one or more of the elements of the package   all will be limited in some form the work study will have a maximum number of hours and generally has low pay   many find better deals working in the businesses surrounding the college or starting their own services type business   the grants rarely cover the full cost of tuition and books   the loans will both be limited in amount   it mainly depends on what you qualify for and generally speaking the lower the income the more aid one qualifies for now some students use all their grant all their loan money and buy things that are not necessary   for example are you going to live in the $ dorm or the new fancy apartments that are running $ 800/month   are you going to use the student loan money to buy a car   will it be a new bmw or a 8 year old i see this first hand as i live near a large university   the pubs are filled with college students not working but drinking and eating every night   many of them drive very fancy cars the most onerous example of this is students at the military   attendees have their books and tuition completely paid for   they also receive a stipend and more money can be earned over the summer   they also all qualify for a 35 k student loan in their junior year   just about every kid takes this loan   most of those use the money to buy a car   i know a young lady who did exactly that and so did many of her friends so kids with a starting pay of 45 k also start life with a   buying a nice car in the military is especially silly as they can not drive it while deployed and they are very likely to be deployed   at least however they are guaranteed a starting job with a nice starting pay and upward potential college kids who behave similarly might not have it as good   will they even find work   will the job have the ability to move up   how much security is in the job   one might say that this does not apply to engineers and such but i am working with a fellow with a computer science degree who can not find a job and has not worked in the past 6 months   this even though the market is super hot right now for computer engineers so in a word be very careful what you borrow

will buying a flat which generates $ 250 rent per month be a good decision whether investing in real estate is a good decision or not depends on many things including the current and future supply demand for rental units in your particular area there are many questions on this site about this topic and another answer to this question which already addresses many risks associated with owning property though there are also benefits to consider i just want to focus on this point you raised i personally think yes because rent adjusts with inflation and the rise in the price of the property is another benefit could this help me become financially independent in the long run since inflation is getting adjusted in it in my opinion the fact that rental income general adjusts with inflation is a hedge against some types of economic risk not an absolute increase in value first consider buying a house to live in instead of to rent   if you pay off your mortgage before your retire then you have reduced your cost of accommodations to only utilities property taxes and repairs this gives you a relatively known fixed requirement of cash outflows if the value of property goes up by the time you retire it does n't cost you anything extra because you already own your house if the value of property goes down by the time you retire then you do n't save anything because you already own your house if you instead rent your whole life and save money each month instead of paying off a mortgage then when you retire you will have a larger amount of savings which you can use to pay your monthly rental costs each month by the time you retire your cost of accommodations will be the market price for rent at that time if the value of property goes up by the time you retire you will have to pay more on rent if the value of property goes down by the time you retire you will save money on rent you will have larger savings but your cash outflow will be a little bit less certain because you do n't know what the market price for rent will be you can see that because you need to put a roof over your own head just by existing you bear risk of the cost of property rising so buying your own home can be a hedge against that risk this is called a natural hedge where two competing risks can mitigate each other just by existing this does n't mean buying a house is always the right thing to do it is just one piece of the puzzle to comparing the two alternatives see many other threads on buying vs renting on this site or on google now consider buying a house to rent out to other people   in the extreme scenario assume that you do everything you can to buy as much property as possible maybe by the time you retire you own a small apartment building with 11 units where you live in one of them as an example and you have no other savings before owning your own home was among other pros and cons a natural hedge against the risk of your own personal cost of accommodations going up but now the risk of your many rental units is far greater than the risk of your own personal accommodations that is if rent goes up by $ 100 after you retire your rental income goes up by $ 1,000 and your personal cost of accommodations only goes up by $ 100 if rent goes down by $ 50 after you retire your rental income goes down by $ 500 and your personal cost of accommodations only goes down by $ 50 you can see that only investing in rental properties puts you at great risk of fluctuations in the rental market this risk is larger than if you simply bought your own home because at least in that case you are guaranteeing your cost of accommodations which you know you will need to pay one way or another this is why most investment advice suggests that you diversify your investment portfolio that means buying some stocks some bonds etc if you invest to heavily in a single thing then you bear huge risks for that particular market in the case of property each investment is so large that you are often if you invest heavily in it you ca n't just buy a house $ 100 at a time like you could a stock or bond of course my above examples are very simplified i am only trying to suggest the underlying principle not the full complexities of the real estate market note also that there are many types of investments which typically adjust with inflation cost of living real estate is only one of them

i strongly discourage leasing or loans but at least you own the car at the end of it in any situation it 's just a bad deal but that does n't answer your question   most new cars are loss leaders for dealerships   it 's too easy to know what their costs are these days so they make most of their money though financing   they might make a less than $ 500 on the sale of a new car but if it 's financed though them then they might get $ 2,000 $ 4,000 commission sale on the financing contract    yes it is possible and entirely likely that the advertised rate will only go to the best qualified possibly with a credit score about 750 or 800 or so other high number for example if the meets the requirements then they wo n't deny you they really want your business but it is more likely to start the process and do all the paperwork for them to come back and say well you do n't qualify for the $ leasing program but we can offer you the $ lease since that 's the price you 're giving from other dealerships from there you just need to negotiate again note make sure you always do your research and negotiate the price of the car before talking about financing

if your father is still able to make financial decisions and sign contracts i see a better option have your father borrow against his equity to finance the renovation   example the house is worth 400 now he can borrow 100 against that he spends it on the addition making the house worth 500 with the same 400 of equity as before in some cases spending 100 might add 150 to the house value but let 's assume here the increase is just what was spent when he dies the mortgage has to be repaid if he has no other money that the two of you would otherwise split then the mortgage has to be repaid by the two of you putting in cash so you pay your brother 250 half the new total value of the house but he gives 50 of that to the bank for the mortgage you also give 50 of your own money to the bank for the mortgage net result your brother has 200 the same as if he had inherited half the house and you have a 500 house after paying out 300 your gain is also the same as if the house was now if the house went up 150 by spending 100 or went up 60 by spending 100 you and your brother would also be sharing this profit or loss if you do n't want that to happen you will need a different agreement the advantage of the approach i 'm suggesting is you just need one appraisal after your father dies   not accounted for in this is that you lived without paying rent in your father 's house for some time and that you worked without being paid as a caregiver to your father for that time some families might think those two things balanced others might feel you need to be compensated for caring for him and others that you need to compensate the others for your benefit of living in the large house be sure to discuss this with your brother so that you agree in advance whether a plan is fair or not

disregarding the particular example and focusing on the actual questions yes definitely the whole concept of pump and dump scheme refers to the many cases when this was intentionally done everything has a limit but the limit can be quite high especially if starting from a low value a penny stock and if the stock is low volume then inflating ten or hundred times over a real value may be possible and any value might be infinitely times overvalued for a company that turns out to have a value of zero yes unless it 's done very blatantly you should expect that the has much more experience in hiding the signs of inflation than the skill of average investor to notice them

one of the best answers to this question that i 've ever read is in a paper published by robert lucas in the journal of economic perspectives that journal is meant to a be a place for experts to write about their area of expertise in economics for a general but still technically minded audience they recently opened up the journal as free to the public which is a fantastic resource you no longer need a subscription to or whatever to read it   you can read the abstract to the paper and find a link to it here one of the things that i like a lot about this paper is that it strips out absolutely everything even slightly unnecessary to thinking about a and just discusses what one can arrive at with a very very simple model of course with great simplicity come sacrifice about details however it does a great job of answering your question why do people care about growth a quick note the key to understanding the answer to your question is to think about things in terms of the long term   not even looking forward to the future because we 'll be dead by then but looking back to the past the key to the importance of growth is that for the last years the us has on average had maybe 2 3 real growth per year i 'm pulling these numbers out of my head i think much better numbers are in that paper somewhere on average over that period of time this growth has meant that the quality of life that one has if one lives in a country experiencing this growth is enormous compared to countries that do not experience this average growth over that period   statistically speaking growth is also somewhat auto correlated roughly speaking if it was low the last few periods you can expect it to be low the next period same thing if it 's high    then the reason we care about growth right now if you have too many periods of low growth pretty soon the average over the long term growth will be pulled down and then quality of life ca n't be higher in the future which quickly becomes someone 's present the paper above makes this point with a very simple model of course none of this touches on issues which are another issue entirely with respect to the economy needs to grow to just keep up with its debt repayments i think the answer is along the lines of sometimes countries get into debt expecting that growth will increase their resources in the future and thus they can pay back their debt that strategy is of course the strategy that anyone borrowing taking out a loan should be employing you should expect that your future income will be enough to pay back your on a loan you took otherwise you 're irresponsible at the aggregate level production is the nation 's income it is what you have all that you have as a nation to pay back any debt you 've incurred at the national level

i 'm surprised by all the pro credit answers here debit has some definite advantages most importantly when you pay with a credit card the merchant pays around 3 of the transaction to the credit company in many states they are forced to charge you the same amount and this is frequently as consumer protection but consider what this means for the business they loose money for every credit transaction and they 're legally forbidden to do anything about it so you 're taking 3 from a business and handing it over to a massive cooperation   to make matters worse the buisness is inevitably going to have to raise their prices by a small amount so in the end the average consumer has gained nothing on the other hand the credit card company wins big and they use their profits to pay lobbyists and lawyers to keep these rules in place to put in the worst possible light it 's essentially legal extortion on corruption as for the fraud protection offered while it may be true that credit cards will offer a more hassle free reimbursement i.e. you just do n't have to pay the bill if your card is stolen consumer protection laws also extend to debit in many cases your bank is legally required to cut you a check for all the money you lost

we 've been in this situation for about 10 years now   we do n't have to send money back to canada very often but when we do we typically just write a us$ check cheque and send it to a relative back home to cash for us   we 've found that the canadian banks are much more familiar with us currency than vice versa and typically have better exchange rates than many of the other options   that said we have n't done an exhaustive search for the best deal if you have n't left canada yet you might consider opening up a us funds account at the same bank as your canadian funds account if the bank will allow you to transfer money between the accounts   i have n't priced out that option so i do n't know what the exchange rate would look like there also you did n't ask about this but if you have any rrsp accounts in canada make sure they 're with a broker that is licensed to accept trades from us based customers   otherwise you wo n't be able to move your money around to different investments within the rrsp once you 're resident in the us you will no longer be able to open any new accounts in canada but you will be able to maintain the ones you already have

the terms debit and credit come from double entry book keeping in this system every transaction is applied against two accounts it debits one and credits the other by equal amounts or more technically it affects two or more accounts and the total of the credits equals the total of the debits whether a debit or a credit adds or subtracts from the balance depends on the type of account the types of accounts were defined so that it is always possible to have these matching debits and credits assets like cash or property that you own are debit accounts that is a debit is an increase in the balance of the account liabilities like money you owe are credit accounts that is a credit is an increase to get into all the details would require giving a tutorial on double entry book keeping which i think is beyond the scope of a forum post by a quick bing search i find this one i have n't gone through it so i ca n't say if it 's a particularly good tutorial there are plenty of others on the web and in bookstores note that the terminology can be backwards when someone you 're doing business with is describing the account because their viewpoint may be the opposite of yours for example to me my credit card is a liability i owe the bank money so when i post a charge that 's a credit and when i pay it off that 's a debit but to the bank my account is an asset the customer me owes them money so to the bank a charge is a debit and a payment is a credit

having recently been given basically the same question it hinges on a few major factors what does your apartment provide e.g. heating internet etc my personal example with my numbers which includes taxes insurance estimates minor repairs to home as needed also ignoring all costs that are shared e.g. food internet car insurance etc i am only making a difference around $ 450 per month in 5 years i would save $ 450 12 5 $ 27,000 however i also have to pay costs for buying the house transfer deed fees home inspections etc which in my case cost around $ 3000 not to mention selling a home has some costs i think around $ 1500 + in my area as well as the taking a cut which i also think is around 2.5 = $ so we can probably estimate you would lose around $ 15000 at most buying and selling the home when all final costs come in which means in my case i would at most be saving around $ 12,000 probably less assuming i did not miss anything so basically 5 = $ 200 per month saved tldr i do n't think its worthwhile because there is a lot of risks involved and houses tend to require a lot of extra work money with apartments you have little no risk and can freely leave at the end

having been in exactly this position not in a debt hole built a budget to get a better view of what spending is i can say what the greatest gift it brings is it 's a decision tool when you are spending out of only one account you often make decisions based on the total money in the account should we go out for dinner can i make this impulse purchase this is terrible because many if not all of those dollars are already intended for certain future expenses like groceries bills etc you ca n't see how many of those dollars are discretionary a budget is like having many accounts instead of looking at your real account(s to make spending decisions you look at your budget lines you to want impulse buy a gadget do you have money remaining in a relevant budget line if yes the decision is yours if no the budget is telling you that you do n't have dollars for that similarly for more purchases you want to splurge on some non staple groceries to make a fancy dinner or try out a new recipe and the budget line for groceries will tell you if you can do that instead of looking at e.g. $ 6000 in a chequing account you 're looking at $ 600 assigned $ spend = $ available in a monthly groceries budget line just like you can now see where your money has been going by maintaining and using your budget lines and having every single dollar you spend go through the budget to show your totally assigned total spent and total remaining you can continue to see where your money is going in near real time you 're no longer looking at bills and statements to figure out what 's going on and plan you 're looking at money flows and future intentions as you should be this approach to budgeting has completely changed our finances so that 's what a budget is for real time spending decision making control over your money which for us has translated into a lovely mix of painless austerity in spending categories where austerity is smart and guilt free spending in more categories because we have already determined exactly how much we can afford and wish to spend a budget line with insufficient funds does n't actually take the decision entirely away from you though if a budget line does n't have funds to spare for a given purchase you can still make the purchase but now you 're also making the decision to go and revise your budget taking dollars away from other budget lines to adjust the line you 've overspent to keep the budget accurate

there is no rule of thumb although some may suggest there is everybody will have different goals investment preferences and risk tolerances you need to figure this out by yourself by either education yourself in the type of investments you are interested in or by engaging and paying for a financial advisor you should not be taking advice from others unless it is specifically geared for your goals investment dna and risk tolerance the only advice i would give you is to have a plan whether you develop it yourself or pay a financial advisor to develop one also do n't have all your savings sitting in cash as long term you will fall behind the eight ball in real returns allowing for inflation

gt;it 's sad when i hear young workers talk about their job application strategies more often than not they involve figuring out how to fool the hr bots   lol   it took me a second with your hr bots to realize you were talking about the software and not the hr personnel   because i have always even 30 years back viewed hr as basically operating on a lot of faulty fundamental assumptions the best way to get hired even back then before the software application screening process was to do an end run around hr   part of the reason is that hr or previously the personnel dept was really designed from the get go only to fill the generic factory worker positions jobs that had minimal base level skill requirements i.e. the checkbox type stuff where any relatively intelligent person should be able to determine with a pretty high accuracy whether the candidates could do the job in other words the open positions that were effectively commodities and where the turnover was high and/or the number of people employed fairly large   but then a combination of hr wanting to be more professional combined with the advent of the generic mba manager who believes he she can manage anything without specific domain knowledge or experience created an opening for hr to take over the hiring of virtually all positions   so what we ended up with was the generic mba manager lacking domain knowledge experience shifting the responsibility or at least most of it for candidate filtering amp hiring off to generic hr people processes who pretty much by definition lack domain knowledge experience and who then attempted to the whole thing     add in stuff like equal opportunity anti discrimination laws and lawsuits to drive the generic of the whole process and you have the perfect pre conditions for the storm that is the current fiasco   so we end up with generic and lets face it often ignorant managers taking job requirements and coming up with checklist style help wanted ads cs degree 5 10 years of ruby on rails work experience hr departments that are clueless about the validity availability of those requirements pretty much just the crap into the ads amp application filtering software in a rote fashion and like a badly constructed google search it should n't be surprising that they come up with minimal results   of course within the discarded applicants are probably several potentially excellent hires but they will simply never be found     so smart people will still again do their best not to game the bots but to do an end run around the whole thing   and that means using your network to get your name in the door and your resume in the hands of the person that matters within the company that may or just as often may not be the manager who makes the hiring decision it may very well be the most experienced person in his department who then pushes the manager to interview and hire you and you preferably do that before the damned ad is even written and before the hr department is even aware that there is a need for a hire keep in mind that there is often a span of several weeks if not several months between the real awareness of a need and the manager hr getting around to actually starting the help wanted fiasco ridden process   one key aspect of that is that via the in the door ahead of time even if the company requires the hr process to be followed the job spec can be constructed to match the pre qualified candidate and his her resume can go to the top of the stack already being in the manager 's hands with a recommendation endorsement from one of his critical team members i.e. hire this guy gal   unfortunately it seems that for all the emphasis on networking these days colleges and other how to get hired classes seldom if ever teach those techniques   but if you ask around look around within companies and identify the really good fit people a lot of them will have been hired by this method and emphatically were not found via hr listings amp processes

grants come in several flavors federal aid college aid and independent aid we 'll immediately ignore the last option independent aid usually in the forms of scholarships as these can come from all sorts of organizations for various reasons and are generally merit based   for federal and college aid you will need to file a fafsa since your parents are divorced you will need to use the financial information of whichever one of them you lived with more during the last 12 months once you submit the fafsa you will receive your efc which is the amount of money your family is estimated to be able to contribute to your education for the year   the efc is n't an obligation but the simplified formula to determine how much you are in need is tuition cost + room and board + overhead books transport etc efc = estimated need this need will then allow your school to give you an aid package which is comprised of federal loans grants work study programs and college grants scholarships a scholarship is based on some kind of merit be it academic or something else while a grant is either general or need based there is no good way to determine how much you will be given so apply and find out you may be able to talk with a financial aid officer at your school for an estimate but it would just be an educated guess if you have an efc lower than your estimated yearly cost you will generally be offered a pell grant by the government free money basically which currently has a yearly cap of $ though you may receive less than this there are also a few other federal grant programs if you have exceptional financial need but all of the grants are determined for you you ca n't apply for them your college may also assign grants based on its own internal programs and like federal funding you ca n't ask for them they are simply given as part of an aid package lastly you will probably be offered a combination of subsidized unsubsidized and parent loans to cover any difference in cost vs funding there are also work study programs you can opt in for which is just an on campus job in some capacity

hi accounting major here   a lot of people mentioned both tax advantages and cheap money money you can borrow at a low interest rate   another reason businesses do this is to reward investors generally people with stock in a company want to see some of its operations financed with debt instead of all of it financed from investors money or profit this way the company can grow more and still pay better dividends to its investors however you do n't want too much debt either it 's a balance and a way to see how much debt vs equity a company has is called a leverage ratio leverage = debt hope this helps

two principles in comparing different scenarios   1 keep the two scenarios as equal as possible in amount and timing of payments   and 2 find the financial comparison at one particular point so your car loan $ 10,000 for 35 months at 8 compounded monthly means you 're paying $ suppose you make the switch and keep on paying the same mortgage and $ for the 35 months see 1 above those extra payments continued for 35 months at your mortgage rate of will pay off a mortgage of $ which will more than pay off the $ 10,000 you added to the mortgage   in other words making the switch will benefit you to the tune of as of the day of the switch   you could ask the mortgage company to give you the $ 10,000 and the $ and all your payments and amortization would stay the same see 2 above of course this is pretty much what joe taxpayer said

you 're absolutely right   that is why i eat at local restaurants instead of fast food   i get better food at a lower price   the real problem with fast food is institutional   typically you have a large public corporation with shareholders   i do not like shareholders   they usually want maximum returns but they do n't care about the business   they do n't have to work there and they do not make choices about the food or anything else   they only care about money   further most fast food chains are run by franchisees   they care more about the product but there 's still a lot of profit motive and they do n't have much if any control over corporate   so you end up with competing interests driven by profits and with that many people demanding money the product suffers and prices go up   i think this is a terrible model for delivering a quality product   all the forces at play are trying to things and increase profit   a small family run restaurant does n't have these problems   they know they need to make a good product at a fair price or they go out of business   without all the grasping hands that 's an easier and less expensive thing to do   which is why the small local restaurants get my business   they give me a better product at a lower price   i do n't think a company like mcdonald 's is capable of that unless they go private throw out their shit food and focus on delivering quality at a fair price   that 's just not possible with a shareholder franchise business model   it is not efficient

inflation refers to the money supply think of all money being air in a balloon inflation is what happens when you blow more air in the balloon deflation is what happens when you let air escape inflation may cause prices to go up however there are many scenarios possible in which this does not happen for example at the same time of inflation there might be unemployment making consumers unable to pay higher prices or some important resource oil may go down in price due to political reasons war has ended etc compensating for the money having less value   similarly peoples wages will tend to rise over time they have to otherwise everyone would be earning less due to inflation however again there are many scenarios in which wages do not keep up with inflation or rise much faster in fact over the past 40 years or so us wages have not been able to keep up with inflation making the average worker poorer than 40 years ago at its core inflation refers to the value of the money itself as all values of other products services assets etc are expressed in terms of money which itself also changes value this can quickly become very complex most countries calculate inflation by averaging the price change of a basket of goods that are supposed to represent the average joe 's spending pattern however these methods are often criticized as they would be hiding inflation the hidden inflation may come back later to bite us

just ship using a reputable courier definitely not or that requires and obtains a and signature which you can view on their website parcel force to name a couple then remember to submit the tracking details when you mark the item as shipped on ebay if the buyer is still enough to claim the item never arrived paypal in my experience do n't even entertain their claim if however they claim the item arrived damaged not as described it could be trickier to defend i 'd recommend thoroughly documenting your item with photographs and recording the serial number just in case you need to provide the details to paypal again in my experience this has been enough to protect me from any fraudulent claims to answer your second question i do n't believe ebay permits you to specify no paypal but if they did then yes bank transfer is 100 safe short of someone using stolen money to pay for the item in which case you 'd be guilty of money laundering thanks to the uk 's wonderful laws on such things

ben miller 's answer is very thorough and i up voted it i believe that the ability to rebalance without tax implications is very import but there are two aspects of the question that were not covered the 401 k in many cases comes with a company match putting enough money into the fund each year to maximize the match give you free money that is not available in the non retirement accounts the presence of that match is to encourage employees to contribute even if they are tying up their funds until retirement age and they are into a plan with only a handful of investment options and they may have higher expenses in the 401k. the question also had a concern about the annual limits for the 401 k 18,000 and the ira 5,500 the use of a retirement account does n't in any way limit your ability to invest in non retirement accounts you can choose to invest from 0 to 23,500 in the retirement accounts and from 0 to unlimited into the non retirement accounts double those amounts if you are married

your first scenario involving shareholders in a private corp being limited by a contractual agreement is common in practice frequent clauses include methods of valuing the shares if someone wants to sell first right of refusal you have to attempt to sell to the other shareholders before you can sell to a 3rd party and many others these clauses are governed by contract law ie some clauses may be illegal in contract law and therefore could n't be applied here a universal shareholders agreement is just the same as the above but applied to more people you would never get an already public company to convert to a universal shareholders agreement because even 1 share voting no would block it due to corporate law limiting the power of a corporation from abusing minority shareholder value in practice these agreements universally exist at the start of incorporation or at least at the first moment shares become available an example is the canadian mega construction company which is employee owned when the original owner transferred the corporation to his employees there was a usa in place which still today governs how the corporation operates   in theory you could have a public company where most shares are already owned by the founders and 100 of remaining shares are owned by a specific group of individuals in which case you may be able to get a usa signed but it would n't really happen in practice   note that while is broadly owned by a large group of employees it is not a public company because any random schmuck ca n't simply buy a share on the toronto stock exchange i assume most exchanges would prevent corporations from being listed if they had ownership restrictions like this

my company did not have income of $ 1000 and have a $ 500 expense why not your company received $ 1000 from you and based on its agreement with the other company transferred out half of it how does it not translate to having $ 1000 income and $ 500 expense when i run a report i want to see that my business has $ 500 of income not $ 1000 with a $ 500 expense you can write in your reports whatever you want but if you want to see the real picture then that is exactly what you should be expecting that said transferring money from yourself to your company is generally not considered income you can have it booked as owner 's equity or a owner 's loan if the company is required to repay unless you 're paying to your company for some services provided or assets transferred that is

as a former consumer credit counselor who worked with struggling homeowners and first time homebuyers i would argue that it is a mistake for lenders to rely on gross income and assumptions on what an applicant spends their income on i think lenders do this because they believe it is efficient and may not understand the long term ramifications for the stakeholders e.g. the borrower the lender the servicer the investor the broker the taxpayer the marshall the foreclosure lawyers etc or lenders do know the impact of a superficial mortgage screening and intentionally want to enrich themselves in the short term while harming other stakeholders in the long term developing a budget that reflects what a person can realistically spend on their mortgage takes much longer than signing up for a rocket mortgage i would say an hour minimum for the first appointment to get a baseline and at least two follow up appointments to make soon after or whenever a borrower 's financial situation changes dramatically credit counselors factor in all of the factors mentioned above i.e. take home pay future pay vs current pay the ability to adjust deductions seasonal expenses multiple sources of income and their frequency debt load etc budgets are always fluctuating but when it is done right by a qualified professional the result is a much more accurate financial picture   the consequences for not doing this type of old school due diligence or for willfully choosing to skip it are varied first off mortgages will be given to homeowners who should never have qualified in the first place and likewise denied to homeowners who should qualify this will result in market distortion and this distortion was a primary contributor to the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis and the wave of foreclosures that came with it another consequence is the stripping of wealth from minority communities since they are often targeted by the most unscrupulous of lenders additionally the securitization of mortgages based on poor diligence at the loan officer level means loan portfolio ratings are questionable investors will lose money and small banks who are heavily invested will fail as they did in the past depending on the federal enforcement of dodd frank act the taxpayers may or may not have to pick up the bill from a bailout of a big mortgage bank that was too big to fail via higher taxes lost jobs lost homes and other negative externalities that were not accounted for by the loan officer or willfully ignored   lastly borrowers also have a responsibility to provide accurate financial information which they do n't always do unfortunately in a capitalistic society where property is commoditized instead of communal there is always mistrust competition the fear that you will be left behind or the desire to get ahead this could incentivize cheating by either the borrower the broker lender or both in this example e.g. no doc negative loans this is just one of many other negative externalities so the only true fix would be a switch to communal land ownership in the interim i would push for universal borrower access to low cost consumer credit counselors and a change in loan officer training and incentive structure

in general insurance payouts you receive in compensation for damage to your vehicle are not taxable income see for instance this nolo page however i do n't see how that is related to your three bullet points about how your sister should buy her car   you can transfer the money to her in any way that 's convenient to both of you   whether the dealership will accept cash is something you 'll have to ask them about but my impression is most dealers are eager to accept cash as long as the car you are getting from her is not worth substantially more than the $ 8500 you 're giving her i do n't see that you 'll be in trouble income tax wise   as mentioned in the question you linked to you can give each other up to $ 14k per year tax free   so if you give her a $ 8500 and she gives you a car worth roughly the same amount no problem   if you actually do it as a sale even better since then the only amount that will count as a gift to either of you is whatever one party gets above and beyond the fair value of the car   that is if the car is worth $ 10000 but she sells it to you for $ 8500 she effectively gave you a gift of $ 1500 in car value   if it 's worth $ 7000 but she sells it to you for $ 8500 you gave her a gift of $ 1500 in cash as rocky pointed out in a comment if you do a sale it may be subject to sales tax depending on what state you 're in   in practice it is very common for people to not deal with sales tax in informal transactions like this between family members but you do owe it if your state 's laws require it and the state could theoretically come after you for it another edit i see from your comment you are in michigan   according to this page from the michigan secretary of state no tax is due if you purchase a vehicle from an immediate family member   so you would not owe sales tax if you do it as a sale

there 's not usually a point to issuing new stock as a dividend because if you issue new stock it dilutes the existing shareholders by the exact same amount as the dividend so now they have a few more shares great but they 're worth the exact same amount this assumes that all stockholders are equal if there are multiple share classes or people whose rights to a stock are tied to the stock price in some manner options warrants or something then a properly structured stock dividend could serve to enrich one set of shareholders and other rights holders at the expense of another but this is usually illegal if this sort of dividends are popular in china i suspect it is due to some regulatory or tax related circumstances which are not present in the united states markets china is kind of notorious for having unusual capital controls limitations on the exchange of currency and markets which are not very transparent

they said the expected returns from the stock market are around 7   emphasis added the key word in your quote is expected   on average the market gains in the 7 9 range more if you reinvest dividends but there 's a great deal of risk too meaning that in any given year the market could be down 20 or be   up 30 your student loan on the other hand is risk free   you are guaranteed to pay lose 4 a year in interest   you ca n't directly compare the expected return of a risk free asset with the expected return of a risky asset   you can compare the risks of two assets with equal expected returns and the expected returns of assets with equal risks but you ca n't directly compare returns of assets with different risks   so in two years you might be better off if you had invested the money versus paying the loan or you might be much worse off   in ten years your chances of coming out ahead are better but still not guaranteed what 's confusing is i 've heard that if you 're investing you should be investing in both stocks and bonds since i 'm young i would n't want to put much in bonds though so how would that factor in   bonds have lower risk uncertainty than stocks but lower expected returns   if you invest in both your overall risk is lower since sometimes not always the gain in stocks are offset by losses in bonds   so there is value in diversifying since you can get better expected returns from a diversified portfolio than from a single asset with a comparable amount of risk   however there it no risk free asset that will have a better return than what you 're paying in student loan interest

your statement not practical   presumes that the primary goal of having the store is to allow the store to thrive but if you subscribe to the idea that stores and other companies are just organizations of people that presumption is false   we humans form social structures that benefit people who live within the social structures towns cities teams companies political parties    the success of the store   or the company or the team or the city is not the primary goal the success of the people ought to be the primary goal    example hospitals were n't originally conceived to make money and grow they were conceived to aid people who were sick these days hospitals make a lot of money despite being classified as nonprofit institutions in the usa as a result we have bad medical practice over prescription of opioids over use of surgeries over use of diagnostic tests etc all of which benefits the hospital but not the patients    it 's not always a clear line look at the real jobs vs environment issues in mining or fracking    but the balance we have struck now gives great profits to the companies profits are at record highs while income inequality is also at record highs how is that sensible or sustainable or moral    my key point here is that your statement that it 's not practical for the store is misguided the store 's well being can not be the primary goal of commerce we need to place a higher priority on benefiting people broadly framed not just owners of the store

to confirm you say you have credit card debt of $ 18,000 with min repayment of $ plus on top of this you are also paying off a car loan and another personal loan from my calculations if your monthly interest on your credit card is $ 237 the interest on your credit card should be about p.a is this correct balance transfer if you did a balance transfer of your $ 18,000 to a new credit card with 0 for 14 months and keep your repayments the same $ you would have saved yourself a bit over $ in interest over those 14 months your credit card balance after 14 months would be about $ instead of $ with your current situation if your interest after the 14 months went back to   you would be able to pay the remaining $ in 2.5 more years keeping repayments at $ saving 10 months off your repayments and a total of $ in interest over 3 years and 8 months the main emphasis here is that you are able to keep your repayments at least the same so you are able to pay off the debt quicker and that your interest rate on the new credit card after the 14 months interest free is not more than your current interest rate of things you should be careful about if you take this path debt consolidation in regards to a debt consolidation for your personal loan and credit card and possibly your car loan into a single lower interest rate loan can be a good idea but there are some pitfalls you should consider if you are taking out a loan with a lower interest rate but a longer term to pay it off you may end up paying less in monthly repayments but will end up paying more interest in the long run if you do take this course of action try to keep your term to no longer than your current debt 's terms and try to keep your repayments as high as possible to pay the debt off as soon as possible and reduce any interest you have to pay as you already have you credit card and personal loan with cba talk to them to see what kind of deal they can give you again be wary of the fine print and read the of any products you are thinking of getting refer to money smart website for more valuable information you should consider before taking out any debt consolidation other action you can take if you are finding that the repayments are really getting out of hand and no one will help you with any debt consolidation or reducing your interest rates on your debts as a last resort you can apply for a part 9 debt agreement but be very careful as this is an alternative to bankruptcy and like bankruptcy a debt agreement will appear on your credit file for seven years and your name will be listed on the national personal insolvency index forever further assistance and help if you have trouble reading any or want further information or help regarding any issues i have raised or any other part of your financial situation you can contact centrelink 's financial information service they provide a free and confidential service that provides education and information on financial and lifestyle issues to all australians

the just accounting is how money market works these days lets look at this simplified example the bank creates an asset loan in the amount of x secured by a house worth assuming 20 downpayment the bank also creates a liability in the amount of x to its depositors because the money lent was the money first deposited into the bank by someone else or borrowed by the bank from the federal reserve which is again a liability that liability is not secured now the person defaults on the loan in the amount of x but at that time the prices dropped and the house is now worth the bank forecloses sells the house recovers 80 of the loan and removes the asset of the loan creating an asset of cash in the value of but the liability in the amount of x did n't go anywhere bank still has to repay the x amount of money back to its depositors feds the difference 20 of x in our scenario that 's the bank 's loss federal reserve is the us equivalent of a central bank

i am going to clone an answer from another question that i wrote and refer you to an article in the wall street journal that i read this morning   what 's at stake in the greek vote summarizing the likely outcome of the situation if a euro exit looks likely after the election we will see a full fledged bank run greek banks would collapse the market exchange rate would likely be two or three drachmas to the euro which would double or triple the greek price of imported goods within a few days prices of assets including real estate assets would crumble those who moved their deposits abroad would be able to buy these assets cheaply leading to a significant regressive redistribution of greek wealth in short you 'd lose about two thirds of your savings unless you were storing them somewhere safe from the conversion the article also predicts difficulty importing goods other nations will demand to be paid in euro not drachma leading to disruption of trade and various supply shortages

your question is a complex one because knowledge of the investor 's beliefs about the market is required   for almost any quantitative portfolio one must have a good estimate of the expected return vector and covariance matrix of the assets in question   the expected return vector in particular is far from   no one agrees on it and there is no way to know who is right and who is wrong in a world satisfying the conditions of the capm you can bypass this problem because the main implication of the capm is that the market weights are optimal   in that case the answer to your question is that you should determine the market weights of the various assets and use those along with saving in a risk free account or borrowing depending on your risk tolerance   this portfolio has the added benefit that you do n't need to rebalance much the weights in your portfolio adjust at the same rate as the market weights any portfolio that has something besides this also includes some notion of expected return aside from capm fair pricing   the question for you then is whether you have such a notion   if you do you can mix your information with the market weights to come up with a portfolio   this is what the black method does for example get the expected return vector implied by market weights and the covariance matrix mix with your expected return vector then use mean variance optimization to come up with your final weights

usually that is the case that when fixed rates are lower than the variable rates it is an indication that the banks feel the next movement in rates could be down you also need to look at the fixed rates for different periods for example 1 year fixed compared to 3 year fixed and 5 year fixed rates if you find the 3 and 5 year fixed rates are higher than the 1 year fixed rates this could be an indication that the banks feel rates will fall in the short term but the falls wo n't last long and will continue to rise after a year or so if the 3 year fixed rates are also low in comparison then the banks may feel that the economy is heading for a longer term down trend the banks wo n't want to lose out so will change their fixed rates on their perception of where they feel the economy is headed since your post in may 2011 the standard variable rate has since dropped twice in november and december to be at you will also find that fixed rates have also been dropped further by the banks indicating additional future cuts in the variable rates regards victor

making a profit in trading is not a function of time it 's a function of information speed and consistency regardless of how much time you spend learning about trading there is no guarantee that you will ever become profitable because you will always be competing against a counter party who is either or more poorly informed than you are   since trading is a zero sum game someone is always a winner and someone else is always a loser so you need to be either better informed than your counter party or you need to be as well informed as them but beat them to the punch you also need to be able to be consistent or else eventually you will get wiped out when the unexpected happens or you make a mistake this is why resources such as full time professional analysts high speed trading terminals platforms and sophisticated algorithms can provide significant advantages personally i think that people with talent and those kinds of resources would take all my lunch money so i do n't trade and stick to passive investing one funny story i once knew a trader who was in the money on a particular trade and went out to have a drink to celebrate the next day she remembered that she had forgotten to exercise the options luckily they had expired while in the money and by rule had been exercised automatically as a result

invest because you are young and have lots of time i recommend opening an investment account and putting most 1000 £ or all in something like an s&p 500 index fund or etf start building   your savings now because compound growth over time will build significant wealth you can still invest the other in something a bit less volatile if you think you 'll need the money in < 5 years if you expect your income to continue to grow and you expect to have extra cash every month for the foreseeable future i 'd just put it all in an index fund you can weather any temporary market swings and in the worst case scenario you can always sell a few shares if you need the cash the advantage of an index fund is that it has very low fees and it 's an invest and forget approach you do n't have to watch the market every day because your money will simply match the market and in the long term the market does much better than most managed funds or etfs

with regard to your edit although i did n't downvote one way to reduce the security risk is to separate the payment from the ability to drain your account   a considerable part of the security risk is inherent in giving people a number which is directly linked to a bank account where you keep all your money   if you do n't want that risk do n't do that   instead of or in addition to trying to reduce the chance of fraud you can reduce the impact of fraud even if it occurs by not paying for things using the details of an account where you have all your money   trying to protect against fraud while keeping all your money in the account is sort of like carrying around thousands of dollars in cash in your wallet and then worrying about how to defend against robbery   yes you can carry a weapon or hire a but it 's probably simpler to just not carry that much money in the first place you already mentioned one solution with your option 1 which is to just keep a small amount of money in a separate account and use that for online payments   assuming you can easily transfer money in and out of this account via online banking this effectively is what you say you want in your edit you log in to your bank online but rather than informing it you 're about to make a payment you just transfer money in   you 'll probably have to keep a small amount of money in the account to keep it open but if this is an important issue for you that should n't be that big a deal another solution is a credit card   with a credit card you simply make the payment online   in the us if the merchant or someone else stealing the info makes fraudulent charges the credit card company assumes the liability and the consumer suffers only the inconvenience of having to get a new card issued   i do n't know what the uk laws are regarding credit vs. debit fraud but some sites i found seem to suggest that credit cards have fraud protection in the uk as well   this is probably worth looking into if you are concerned about fraud

gt women entered the work force en mass and with twice as many potential employees the cost of labor decreased   sorry i 'll have to disagree with this   yes between the 60s and 80s married women started staying in the paid workforce   but this only increased the employment to population ratio from to about in 2000 it has since dropped down to   also since work that had previously been unpaid such as child minding house cleaning nursing of elders and food preparation increasingly became part of the paid economy   much of that extra labor was occupied in these new positions and so would n't have increased the overall competition for jobs   the idea that extra bodies competing for jobs would drive down the price of labor also needs to be justified   in a theoretically ideal market the actual number of players in the market does n't influence the price   only by assuming that the increase in supply increased the job seeker 's desperation for a job do we lower the price at which they are willing to sell their labor   but why should we assume job seekers became more desperate between the 60s and the 90s when the unemployment rate was about the same in both those periods

term insurance is definitely expensive at 60 but so is permanent insurance   let 's think about why people buy each one term makes sense if you are worried about death during a certain period of time but not afterward   often this is young people trying to get out of debt have young dependents etc who expect to have more money later in life and less need for insurance permanent makes sense if you want to ensure that your dependents get paid tax free at your death even if you die at an age when you are basically uninsurable   these plans make sense if you hold them forever but if you get out of them early there are often large fees that will make it a pretty bad deal the fact that your uncle is already in a permanent plan makes me think it might make sense to continue   check the details to see how large the fees on getting your money out early would be    given that he has a disabled wife having a permanent plan may make sense especially if her disability is not one associated with dying younger having said that i can see an argument for term insurance if your uncle is primarily concerned with providing for his daughter and wo n't be concerned about it after she 's out of school    the answer really depends on

google is a poor example since it does n't pay a dividend and does n't expect to so let 's use another example with easy numbers company x has a stock price of $ 100 and it pays a quarterly dividend many companies do let 's assume x pays a dividend of $ 4 dividends are always quoted in annual terms as is dividend yield when a company says that they pay quarterly dividends it means that the company pays dividends every quarter or every 3 months   but if a company has a $ 4 dividend you will not receive $ 4 every quarter per share you will receive $ = $ 1 per share every quarter so over the course of a fiscal year or 4 quarters you 'll get $ 1 + $ 1 + $ 1 + $ 1 = $ 4 per share which is the annual dividend   the dividend yield = annual dividend stock price so in this case company x 's div yield will be $ 100 = 4 it 's important to note that this is the annual yield to get the quarterly yield you must divide by 4 it 's also important to note that the yield fluctuates based on stock price but the dividend payment stays constant unless the company states an announcement for a real world example consider intel corp. ticker intc the share price is currently $ and the dividend is $ this makes the annual yield = $ 100 = intel pays a quarterly dividend so you can expect to receive $ every quarter for every share of intel that you own hope that clears it up

an order is your command to the broker to say sell 100 shares of aapl an executed order or partially executed order is when all or some of that command is successfully completed a transaction is an actual exchange of shares for money and there may be one or more transactions per executed order   for example the broker might perform all of the following 5 transactions in order to do what you asked on the other hand if the broker can not execute your order then 0 transactions have taken place the fee schedule you quote is saying that no matter how many transactions the broker has to perform in order to fill your order and no matter what the share prices are they 're only going to charge you $ 0.005 per share $ 0.50 in this example of 100 shares subject to certain limits however as it says at the top of the page you linked our fixed pricing for stocks etfs exchange traded products or and warrants charges a fixed amount per share or a set percent of trade value and includes all ib commissions exchange and most regulatory fees with the exception of the transaction fees which are passed through on all stock sales certain transaction fees are passed through to the client   the transaction fee you included above is the sec fee on sales   many but not all transaction fees do depend on the prices of the shares involved as a result they can not be called fixed fees for example if you sell 100 shares of aapl at $ 150 each but if you sell 100 shares of amzn at $ each so the broker will charge you the same $ 0.50 on either of those orders but the sec will charge you more for the expensive amzn shares than for the cheaper aapl shares the reason this specific sec fee mentions aggregate sales rather than trade value is because this particular sec fee applies only to the seller and not to the buyer   so they could have written aggregate trade value but they probably wanted to highlight to the reader that the fee is only charged on sells

to avoid risk from rising interest rates get a fixed rate mortgage for the life of the mortgage your principal and interest payments will remain the same keep in mind that the taxes and insurance portion of your monthly payment may still go up because you own the property the costs to maintain the property are your responsibility if you rented this would be the responsibility of the owner of the property if the cost to repair and maintain goes up so does the rent because you are the owner your annual costs to repair and maintain may go up over time the way to eliminate risk of loss of value is to never move until the mortgage is paid off you will know exactly what principal and interest will cost you over the life of the loan when you sell that will be essentially return on your payments you do n't know if the loss of value is due to world national regional local or individual circumstances so hedging is tough if the fact that the mortgage is 95 is what makes you nervous your biggest risk is risk of being upside down that risk is greatly reduced by increasing the amount of the down payment that decreases the risk that the value will be below the mortgage amount if due to unforeseen circumstances you have to sell immediately the money will still be lost due to decrease in value but you are n't forced to bring cash to the settlement table if you need to sell

yes   i 've spoken to mortgage officers from various banks who will do conventional loans with anything as low as 3.5 down however there are many more restrictions e.g. normally you can borrow funds from a parent or relative for a down payment in this case that was prohibited if you are already pre approved then your approval letter should state the specifics you need to adhere to   if you would like to modify that e.g. put a smaller amount down then you could still get the loan but your pre approval wo n't be valid i would recommend speaking with your lender and perhaps with a few others as well about the new home you are looking at

generally value funds particularly large value funds will be the ones to pay dividends you do n't specifically need a high dividend yield fund in order to get a fund that pays dividends site likes can show you the dividends paid for mutual funds in the past to get an idea of what a fund would pay growth funds on the other hand do n't generally pay dividends or at least that 's not their purpose instead the company grows and become worth more you earn money here because the company or fund you invested in is now worth more   if you 're saying you want a fund that pays dividends but is also a growth fund i 'm sure there are some funds like that out there you just have to look around

this is mostly an addendum to answer which appears to list reasonable causes but ignores the technical cost aspect the other answer lists the technical cause but does n't explain it in detail look at the two graphs from wikipedia this is how difficult in terms of computing power meaning hardware costs and electricity costs it has been to mine bitcoins over years   this is how many total bitcoins have been made since the start of btc era   as you can see despite rising difficulty and costs the bitcoin mining is slowing down it should be noted that this is by design if you could use a home computer at start of bitcoin and mine 1 bitcoin a day on it nowadays you need to use specialized hardware costing thousands of dollars and pay huge sums in electricity costs in order to mine the same 1 bitcoin in a day and this happened on the large scale quite recently   add the fact that there is no visible way to significantly increase bitcoin mining speed regardless of hardware used the network self adapts   the more hardware anyone throws at it the harder it becomes for him and everyone else so extra hardware is used in order to drive out smaller players and keep the general ability to mine rather than to increase the mining speed last year a friend and i were considering buying a couple specialized rigs running on off the shelf powerful computers and using extra gaming graphics cards for number crunching as we did n't get on the train fast enough the graphic cards were bought up by bitcoin mining organizations en masse

the hsa tax deduction comes when you contribute money to the hsa not when you take money out so you can contribute up to the max and take your maximum deduction each year regardless of what medical expenses you have   if you have medical expenses but no money left in your hsa you will just have to pay for them out of pocket however in the future when your hsa has money in it again you can reimburse yourself for medical expenses you have now as long as you have an hsa in place even if there is no money in it currently there is no time limit to reimburse yourself for those medical expenses   reimburse yourself for what you can and keep track of whatever expenses you are unable to reimburse at this time hopefully in a future year your health will improve or your medical coverage will improve and you can catch up reimbursing yourself for these old expenses   regarding your question about tax benefit the hsa acts similar to a traditional ira when invested growing tax deferred so if you contribute and choose not to withdraw but instead invest there are tax advantages similar to an ira however if you are already investing a sufficient amount in retirement accounts there is nothing wrong with reimbursing yourself now for the expenses if you need the money you get the primary tax deduction either way

it appears very possible that google will not have to pay any class c holders the settlement amount given the structure of the settlement   this is precisely because of the arbitrage opportunity you 've highlighted   this idea was mentioned last summer in as explained in a dealbook article the settlement requires google to pay the following amounts if one year from the issuance of the class c shares the value according to the following formula if the c share price is equal to or more than 1 percent but less than 2 percent below the a share price 20 percent of the difference if the c share price is equal to or more than 2 percent but less than 3 percent below the a share price 40 percent of the difference if the c share price is equal to or more than 3 percent but less than 4 percent below the a share price 60 percent of the difference if the c share price is equal to or more than 4 percent but less than 5 percent below the a share price 80 percent of the difference if the c share price is equal to or more than 5 percent below the a share price 100 percent of the difference up to 5 percent if the class a shares trade around $ 450 after the split c issuance and the c shares trade at a 4.5 percent discount during the year or $ per share then investors expect a payment of 80 percent times $ 450 times 4.5 percent = $ the value of c shares would then be $ $ plus $ but if this is the new trading value during the year that ’s only a discount of less than 1 percent to the a shares so no payment would be made but if no payment is made we are back to the full discount and this continues ad infinitum in other words the value of a stock can be displayed as equity value + dividend value + voting value + settlement value = total share value if we ignore dividend and voting values and ignore premiums and discounts for risk and so forth then the value of a share is basic equity value plus anticipated settlement payoff   the google class c settlement is structured to reduce the payoff as the value   and the practice of arbitrage guarantees if you buy into at least semi strong emh that the price of c shares will be up by arbitrageurs that want the payoff the voting value of googl is effectively zero since the non traded class b shares control all company decisions   so the value of the class a googl voting is virtually zero for the time being   the only divergence between googl and goog price is dividends which i believe is supposed to be the same and the settlement payoff   somebody who places zero value on the vote and who expects dividend difference to be zero should always prefer to buy goog to googl until the price is equal disregarding the settlement so technically someone is better off owning goog if dividends are the same and market prices are equal just because the vote is worthless and the nonzero chance of a future settlement payoff is gravy the arbitrage itself is present because a share that costs as in the article $ is worth $ if the settlement pays out at that rate   the stable equilibrium is probably either just before or just after the threshold where the settlement pays off depending on how reliably arbitrageurs can predict the movement of goog and googl if i can buy a given stock for x but know that it 's worth x+1 then i 'm willing to pay up to x+1   in the google case the goog stock is worth where s is an uncertain settlement payment that could be zero or could be substantial   we have six tiers of s counting zero payoff so that the price is likely to follow a pattern from x to to x to x and climbing the tier ladder until it lands in the frontier between and   every time it jumps into people should be willing to pay that new amount for goog so the price moves out of payoff range and into where people will only pay x. i 'm actually simplifying here since technically this is all based on future expectations   so the actual price you 'd pay is expressed thus resale value of goog before settlement payoff = x + expectation that settlement payoff will pay 100 of difference = s5 expected nominal difference between goog and googl = d + s4 80 d + s3 60 d + s2 40 d + s1 20 d + 0 d   = price willing to pay for class c goog = p plus you 'd technically have to present value the whole thing for the time horizon since the payoff is in a year   note that i 've any voting dividend analysis into x.   it 's reasonable to thing that s5 s4 s3 and maybe s2 are nearly zero given the open arbitrage opportunity   and we know that times 0 of d is zero   so the real analysis again ignoring pv is thus p = x + which is a long way of saying what are the odds that goog will happen to be worth no more than 99 of googl on the payoff determination date

the safe harbor provision is based on the tax you or the prior year so in 2016 this helped you as your tax was substantially increased from 2015 however by the same token in 2017 your safe harbor amount is going to be very high therefore if 2017 is similar you will owe penalties the solution here is to make estimated tax payments in the quarters that you realize large gains this is exactly what the estimated tax payments are for your estimate tax payments do not have to be the same in fact if you have a sudden boost in earnings in quarter 3 then the irs expects that quarter 3 estimated tax payment to be boosted

the roth vs not debate is irrelevant to the question it does n't matter where your emergency fund is kept as long as it is liquid and safe i said it before in an answer to another question your emergency fund is not an investment it 's your safety net this answer also says it well an emergency fund is just that for emergencies not investment while it hurts not to have your emergency money making more money its more important to have quick access to it so at td ameritrade just park it in their fdic deposit account it will not earn any meaningful interest at least until rates rise but you 'll be able to have access to it when you need it note that i would caution against putting it in a money market mutual fund they 're safer than many other investments but they 're not fdic insured against loss and there is a potential for temporary loss of liquidity in late 2008 when the credit markets collapsed a lot of people suddenly became unemployed and needed access to their emergency funds when lehman brothers went bust in september the reserve primary fund with billions of dollars in their fund broke the buck they lowered the price of shares below $ 1 meaning investors lost principal the worst part is that investors were not as liquid as they wanted to be the fund froze and it was hard to get money out the lesson to take away from this is that one of the times you 're likely to need access to your emergency fund is during a macroeconomic crisis this is also the time when any investment that is n't guaranteed safe may potentially be at least temporarily unavailable or decline in value emergency funds should be 100 government insured when you have your roth funded to the point where there 's extra money beyond the emergency fund you can start investing in higher yielding vehicles stock or bond index etfs would be a good start but then that part of your roth starts to look like a retirement account and not an emergency fund if it were me i 'd open a roth at a stable local bank and just keep it in their fdic insured money market deposit account then if i wanted a slight boost i might put the upper half of my emergency fund into short term cds but even cds are n't worth much at the moment

sure   even milton friedman called hayek 's economic work   much of the austrian economic foundation rests without as solid of a   philosophical or mathematical foundation as most other schools of thought   i suppose the easiest way to understand this is to look at three foundational works   i recommend reading each of these anyways but skimming and paying attention to references should give you a good idea of the varying levels of rigor introduced into each school of thought   leaf through das = = = = = = = = false this is marx 's primary   it is far older than the following two that i will present   nevertheless it perhaps more than any other book played a pivotal role in the 20th century    leaf through a general theory of employment interest and = = = = = = = = = false this is the foundational work of the keynesians   there is much more here than simply the advice to increase government spending to stabilize demand during economic downswings   and it has been probably the most widely accepted work by the greatest number of economists over the 20th century      leaf through the theory of money and credit this is the austrian from von mises   it is the newest of the three   it is also likely the least rigorous   but please judge for yourself   von mises did do some more rigorous work in other areas     but all schools of economics ultimately rest on their theory of capital   so before you pick which church to belong to it 's worth reading their respective

first of all i am sorry for your loss at this time worrying about money is probably the least of your concerns it might be tempting to try to pay off all your debts at once and while that would be satisfying it would be a poor investment of your inheritance when you have debt you have to think about how much that debt is costing you to keep open since you have on your student loan it does not make sense to pay any more than the minimum payments you may want to look into getting a personal loan to pay off your other personal debts the interest rates for a loan will probably be much less than what you are paying currently this will allow you to put a payment plan together that is affordable you can also use your inheritance as collateral for the loan getting a loan will most likely give you a better credit rating as well you may also be tempted to get a brand new sports car but that would also not be a good idea at all you should shop for a vehicle based on your current income and not your savings i believe you can get the same rates for an auto loan for a car up to 3 years old as a brand new car it would be worth your while to shop for a quality used car from a reputable dealer if it is a certified used car you can usually carry the rest of the new car warranty the biggest return on investment you have now is your employer sponsored 401(k account find out how long it takes for you to become fully vested being vested means that you can leave your job and keep all of your employer contributions if possible max out or at least contribute as much as you can afford to that fund to get employee matching you should also stick with your job until you become fully vested the money you have in retirement accounts does you no good when you are young there is a significant penalty for early withdrawal and that age is currently 59 1/2 doing the math it would be around when you would be able to have access to that money you should hold onto a certain amount of your money and keep it in a higher interest rate savings account or a money market account you say that your living situation will change in the next year as well take full advantage of living as cheaply as you can do n't make any unnecessary purchases try to brown bag it to lunch instead of eating out etc save as much as you can and put it into a savings account you can use that money to put a down payment on a house or for the security and first month 's rent try not to spend any money from your savings and try to support yourself as best as you can from your income make a budget for yourself and figure out how much you can spend every month do n't factor in your savings into it your savings should be treated as an emergency fund since you have just completed school and this is your first big job out of college your income will most likely improve with time it might make sense to job hop a few times to find the right position you are much more likely to get a higher salary by changing jobs and employers than you are staying in the same one for your entire career this generally is true even if you are promoted at the by the same employer if you do leave your current job you would lose what your employer contributed if you are not vested even if that happened you would still keep the portion that you contributed

stock trading as opposed to ipo does n't directly benefit the company but it affects their ability to raise additional funds if they 're valued higher they do n't need to sell as many shares to raise a given amount of money   and the stockholders are part owners of the company their votes in annual corporate meetings and the like can add up to a substantial influence on the company 's policies so the company has an interest in keeping them reasonably happy dividends distributing part of the company 's profits to the stockholders are one way of doing so you 're still investing in the company the fact that you 're buying someone else 's share just means you 're doing so indirectly and they 're dis investing at the same time

the best strategy for rsu 's specifically is to sell them as they vest usually vesting is not all in one day but rather spread over a period of time which assures that you wo n't sell in one extremely unfortunate day when the stock dipped for regular investments there are two strategies i personally would follow sell when you need if you need to cash out cash out rebalance if you need to rebalance your portfolio i.e. not cash out but reallocate investments or move investment from one company to another do it periodically on schedule for example every 13 months in the us where the long term cap gains tax rates kick in after 1 year of holding rebalance you would n't care about specific price drops on that day because they also affect the new investments speculative strategies trying to sell high buy low usually bring to the opposite results you end up selling low and buying high but if you want to try and do that you 'll have to get way more technical than just dollar cost averaging or similar strategies most people do n't have neither time nor the knowledge for that and even those who do rarely can beat the market and never can in the long run

gdp being a measurement for an economy 's growth and with the stock market being driven mostly by company profits you would expect a tight correlation between gdp growth and stock market performance after all a growing economy should lead to a corresponding increase in profit right but the stock market is heavily influenced by investor mentality irrational buying and panic selling make the stock market far more volatile than gdp ever can be just look at the 2001 bubble and 2008 panic sell off for famous examples i feel emerging markets are particularly prone to overly optimistic buying to get in on the gdp growth followed by overly pessimistic selling when politics get unfavorable also keep in mind that gdp measurements are all done after the fact the growth that is reported has already happened the stock market might have already expected the reported growth and priced it in a final point governments and companies in emerging markets have a reputation sometimes deserved of poor governance think corruption nepotism etc so even if the economy grows substantially investors might not believe they can profit from the growth   p.s. what do you base the no great increase on emerging markets have had a rough decade but that index would have still returned 9 annually if you held it since 2001

i am sure that laws differ from state to state   my brother and i had to take over my dads finances due to his health   he had a vehicle that had a loan on it   we refinanced the vehicle and it was in our name   one of our family members needed a vehicle and offered to take over the payment   our attorney advised us to be on the insurance policy with them and make sure if was paid correctly we are in indiana   i know it is hard to discuss finances with family members   however if you co signed the loan i think it would be wise to either have your name added to the insurance policy or at least have your brother show proof it has been paid   if you are not comfortable with that it may be a good idea to make sure the bank has your correct address and ask if they would notify you if insurance has lapsed   if your on the loan and there is no insurance at the very least if the vehicle was damaged you would still be responsible to pay the loan

the way the question is worded it is slightly opinion based just to point out    tax benefits upto 50000 inr is tax free when invested here this is actually 200,000 inr under 80c. so if you invest max of 150,000 in other instruments in 80c you can still invest 50,000 into nps hopefully it will provide some money that i could probably use to buy a house kid 's education kid 's marriage there are very few withdrawal options generally in the current scenario by the time you retire you would already have house kid would have got married answers given the current data is it a worthwhile investment it is a good investment option available it is up to individual to select this or invest else where if yes would be better to fix choice at 50 in e and 25 in c and e or go for the auto choice as you are young it is better to have max 50 in equity and actively monitor this and change the percentage as you near the retirement age if you do n't have time or are not financial or one is plain simple lazy going with auto choice makes sense bad investment because if you put the same money into equity oriented mutual funds then you will get better returns this depends if you are currently investing everything into equity then yes at absolute level the returns are high however if you are investing into equity and debt to achieve a balance then nps is doing it automatically for you as the nps has very low costs there is substantial advantage in some years 2013 2014 the nps equity return has been excellent and exceeded leading mutual funds other aspect edits the annuities need to invest in guaranteed risk free instruments generally bonds as the rates are locked for life they need to factor things like average life expectancy demographics etc this is largely statistical similar to how the insurance premiums are decided this is adjusted periodically say they offer 6.5 for 100 people the investments into bonds is yielding only 6 then for next 100 people they would offer 5.5 however if the mortality increases i.e. 50 people die at age of 70 they just need to adjust it to 5.75 for next 100 so there are quite a few parameters that go in and models output what the rate should be offered at times the corpus manager may take a hedge to minimize downside this is a specialized subject and there no dummies that show how rates are determined it is also a trade secret

now technically she is supposed to pay rent but legally i am not sure her name is not there in the rental agreement so she is not eligible to pay the rent since she is already living in the same house there is some basic courtesy to pay the $ 200 now thing here is how are we going to divide it if she is paying $ 200 will that be deducted out of your room mate 's or yours fact of the matter is who is taking more space and who is paying for it since there is no change to your space you should continue paying the same amount because there is no change in your space as you mentioned before moreover the fact that she is paying the utilities is good enough because that is shared by all 3 so keep the arrangement like somewhat like this you pay half the rent + utilities and your friend and his girlfriend will pay their share of the rent which is equal to yours and they will share the utilities too hope this makes sense    thanks

gifts given and received between business partners or employers employees are treated as income if they are beyond minimal value if your boss gives you a gift s he should include it as part of your taxable wages for payroll purposes which means that some of your wages should be withheld to cover income social security and medicare taxes on it at the end of the year the value of the gift should be included in box 1 wages of your form w-2 assuming that 's the case you do n't need to do anything special a 1099-misc would not be appropriate because you are an employee of your boss so the two of you need to address the full of employment taxes not just income tax which would be the result if the payment were reported on 1099-misc if the employer wants to cover the cost to you of the taxes on the gift they 'll need to gross up your pay to cover it let 's say your employer gives you a gift worth $ 100 and you 're in a 25 tax bracket your employer has to give you $ 125 so that you end up with a gain of $ 100 but the extra $ 25 is taxable too so your employer will need to add on an extra $ 6.25 to cover the 25 tax on the $ 25 but wait now we 've got ta pay 25 tax on the $ 6.25 so they add an extra $ to cover that tax and now they 've got ta pay an extra $   the formula to calculate the gross up amount is where tax rate is the tax rate expressed as a percentage so to get the up amount for a $ 100 gift in a 25 bracket we 'd calculate or or multiply that by the target gift amount of $ 100 and end up with $   the equation is a little if you have to pay state income taxes that are deductible on the federal return but it 's a similar principle   the entire $ would then be reported as income but the net effect on the employee is that they 're $ 100 richer after taxes the gross up idea can be quite complicated if you dig into the details there are some circumstances where an additional few dollars of income can have an unexpected impact on a tax return in a fashion not obvious from looking at the tax table   if the employer does n't include the gift in box 1 on the w-2 but you want to pay taxes on it anyway include the amount in line 7 on the 1040 as if it had been on a w-2 and fill out form to calculate the fica taxes that should have been withheld

i would open a taxable account with the same custodian that manages your roth ira e.g. vanguard fidelity etc then within the taxable account i would invest the extra money in low cost broad market index funds that are tax efficient unlike in your 401(k and roth ira you will now have tax implications if your funds produce dividends or realize a capital gain that is why tax efficient funds are important to minimize this as much as possible   the portfolio is a popular choice for taxable accounts because of simplicity and the tax efficiency of broad market index funds that are part of the three fund portfolio the portfolio normally consists of depending on your tax bracket you may want to consider municipal bonds in your taxable instead of taxable bonds if your tax bracket is 25 or higher   another option is to forgo bonds altogether in the taxable account and just hold bonds in retirement accounts while keeping tax efficient domestic and international funds in your taxable account then adjust the bond portion upward in your retirement accounts to account for the additional stocks in your taxable accounts this will maintain the asset allocation that you 've already chosen that is appropriate for your age and goals

with new cars it 's usually the other way around finance at a low apr or get cash back when you buy it outright with used cars you usually do n't know how much they have invested in the car so it 's more difficult to know how low they 're willing to go regardless i do think it 's odd that they would knock 2 k off the price if you finance with them but not if you pay cash the only reason they would do that is if they intend to make at least 2 k in interest over the life of the loan but they have no way of guaranteeing you wo n't refi therefore i suspect they are and would probably close the deal if you wrote them a check or put the cash on the table for 2 k less however if they wo n't budge and will only knock off 2 k if you finance you could finance and pay it off in full a week later just make sure they do n't have any hidden origination fees or pay off early fees

it is unlikely that buying 100 shares will have any effect on a stock 's price unless the stock 's average trading volume is incredibly low   that being said no matter how many share you buy there 's no way to know what the impact on the price will be because that 's only one factor in how shares are priced   if anyone could figure out the answer to your question then they 'd be extremely rich because they 'd simply watch for big share trades and then buy those stocks on the way up the market makers who actually execute the trades are the ones who set the prices and most stocks have multiple market makers trading the stock so the bid ask you see is the highest bid and lowest ask   the market makers set the price based on what the trend of the stock is   if for instance there 's a large number of sell orders against a stock the market makers will start dropping the bid prices as they fill execution orders and as they see buy orders increase they 'll raise ask prices as they fill execution orders   the market makers earn the difference between what they paid to buy someone 's stock who was selling and what they get from someone else who buys it this is a simplified explanation so pro traders do n't beat me up grin so basically it takes quite a bit of share volume in one direction or another to affect a stock 's price   i can guarantee a trade would n't even be noticed by market makers i hope this helps good luck

it depends on how much diversification you think you need and what your mutual fund options are for instance picking an index fund already provides a fair amount of diversification especially if you select a total market type of index readily available from fidelity and vanguard and many other fund families are you looking to balance domestic vs. international investments you may want to add an international index fund to the mix feel that a particular sector has tremendous potential add a sector fund this investment mix is up to you or your investment advisor however depending on your roth ira mutual fund choices some of these funds may have minimum investment requirement $ 3k to open a fund 's account for instance in that case you 'd have no choice but to put your entire investment into one fund and wait for subsequent years where you 'd be able to invest in other funds after providing additional contributions and/or any growth from your initial investment one thing to look at is whether you have an option of putting some of your contributions into a money market account within the roth ira you can then reallocate funds from that account into another fund after you can meet the minimum investment requirement however in my opinion if you start out by investing in a solid low cost index fund from a reputable mutual fund company you 've already picked up most of the diversification you need a single fund is enough

it is a decent time to purchase real estate despite 's opinion   i feel is falling for the old economic psychology of what ever direction its going it will continuing in that direction which is a bad mentality for any investing up or down      this may not be the bottom and there is some sign that another dip is coming with in a year or two   but if you purchase now and focus on a few key factors you may end up on the upside of the swing   first and foremost location matters more then value of the property   when the up demand is eventually released after we get employment moving in the right direction you will see a land grab   the first and highest valued places are those with nice neighborhoods and good schools as the young families economically start making homes     second pay attention to valuation in so much as your burden   this means consider taxes and mortgage and terms of mortgage stay away from variable or balloon rates   when thing go up the interest rates will lead the way   in this time of uncertainty you should make sure you can cover your mortgage payment with ease   put plenty down 20 being the recommended to avoid mortgage insurance and long term costs and shoot low on   price   if you 're handy you may even consider buying something that needs minor work outdated kitchen or the like    if you shoot lower then your limit then you 'll be comfortable even if things turn sour for you   ultimately all this hinges on what you want to do with the property   its a wise time to buy homes today where you will be able to rent them out tomorrow   but the important thing is aim in the middle instead of at your limit 450 is definitely your limit   remember banks will always tell you that you 're able to afford twice as much as you actually should   and keep in mind no matter how new or nice the home it will need work at some point and that costs   so you should have that in mind when you consider savings   based on your information i would nt shoot higher then 250 300k   i have friends who make your salary in dividends plus two incomes and they are comfortable in their home at its 250 price   they are able to afford repairs and upgrade regularly and are nt threatened by potential tax hikes though they gripe of course    the one good piece of advice from imho is that you should be ready for the environment to change   higher interests rates will weigh on your comfort as much as cpi and increased taxes will so plan for them to be much higher and you 'll be ahead of the game

start as early as possible and you will want to kiss your younger self when you get to retirement age i know you and everyone else at that age thinks that they do n't make enough to start saving and leans towards waiting until you get established in your career and start making better money do n't put it off save some money out of each paycheck even if it is only $ 50   trust me as little as you make now you probably have more disposable income than you will when you make twice as much your lifestyle always seems to keep up with your income and you will likely always feel like you do n't have money left over to save the longer you wait the more you are going to have to stuff away to make up for that lost time you could have been compounding your returns as shown in this table assuming percent average gain annually which has been the average return on the stock market from 1926 2010   i also suggest reading this article when explains it in more detail who wants to be a millionaire

if bank b has a transfer limit set you bet that there is a nice reason for that either risk of fraud liability client preferences credit scoring etc etc for a bank the cost of denying something 1 is way lower than the potential damages and liabilities of allowing something to go through   regarding your concerns for the ach here is the summarized transaction source an whether that ’s an individual a corporation or another initiates either a direct deposit or direct payment transaction using the ach network ach transactions can be either debit or credit payments and commonly include direct deposit of payroll government and social security benefits mortgage and bill payments online banking payments person to person p2p and business to business b2b payments to name a few instead of using paper checks ach entries are entered and transmitted electronically making transactions quicker safer and easier   the originating depository financial institution odfi enters the ach entry at the request of the originator   the odfi aggregates payments from customers and them in batches at regular predetermined intervals to an ach operator   ach operators two central clearing facilities the federal reserve or the clearing house receive batches of ach entries from the odfi   the ach transactions are sorted and made available by the ach operator to the receiving depository financial institution rdfi   the receiver ’s account is debited or credited by the rdfi according to the type of ach entry individuals businesses and other entities can all be receivers   each ach credit transaction settles in one to two business days and each debit transaction settles in just one business day as per the rules   take heed of this like   the originator initiates a direct deposit payment transaction in your scenario the originator would be b. but since the transaction amount is higher than the limit b would not even initiate the ach transaction the request would be denied so the transaction would look like this 1 usually this cost comes down to just the processing costs of the denied transaction and it is rather fail fast like for the other parties involved it may have additional costs missed deadlines penalties for not fulfilling an obligation fines etc but for the bank that is irrelevant

as far as i know it 's not barred by the primary anti discrimination statute title vii of the civil rights act of 1964   there are some state and local protections against being fired or discriminated against based on this but the long and short of it is that it 's pretty few and far between   if the ceo in question fired people who were all affiliated with the democratic party and did n't fire people who were n't affiliated with said party those who were terminated may have a case at that point   this is from a linkedin answers law legal employment labor law   gt for private situations there is also a federal statute 42 usc that prohibits to deprive persons of equal rights and privileges that has been raised in various contexts the statute which is a era law is broadly drafted to correct some of the abuses that arose after the civil war for blacks trying to exercise their rights however it addresses any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws which could include party affiliation or a particular political viewpoint the class must be one that is sufficiently defined so it is more likely to apply to party affiliation such as democrat rather than an amorphous group such as liberal there are a number of nuances to this statute so if you have a belief that it may apply to your situation seek competent legal advice

a lot of investors prefer to start jumping into tools and figuring out from there but i 've always said that you should learn the theory before you go around applying it so you can understand its shortcomings   a great starting point is investopedia 's introduction to technical analysis there you can read about the idea of technical analysis how it compares to other strategies what some of the big ideas are and quite a bit about various chart patterns cup and handle flags head shoulders etc you 'll also cover ideas like moving averages and after that charting and technical analysis by fred should be your next stop the material in the book overlaps with what you 've read on investopedia but 's book is great for learning from examples and seeing the concepts applied in action the book is for new and does a good job explaining how to utilize all these charts and patterns and after finishing it you should be ready to invest on your own   if you make it this far feel free to jump into fidelity 's tools now and start applying what you 've learned you always want to make the connection between theory and practice so start   figuring out how you can use your new knowledge to generate good returns   eventually you should read the excellent reference text technical analysis of the financial markets by john murphy this book is like a murphy covers almost all the major techniques of technical analysts and helps you intuitively understand the reasoning behind them i 'd like to quote a part of a review here to show my point   what i    like about mr. murphy is his way of showing and proving a point let    me digress here to show you what i mean say you had a daughter and    wanted to show her how to figure out the area of an    well you could tell her to memorize that it is    or if you really wanted her to learn it thoroughly you    can show her how to draw a parallel line to the height then join the    ends to make a nice rectangle then to compute the area of a rectangle    just multiply the two sides one being the height the other being    half the base she will then derive this and    understand how they got the formula you see then she can    compute the area under a or a or any complex    object well mr. murphy will show us the same way and    derive for us concepts such as how a resistance line later    becomes a support line the for this is so amusing that after    one reads about it we just go wow now i understand why    this occurs murphy 's book is not about strategy or which tools to use he takes an objective approach to describing the basics about various tools and techniques and leaves it up to the reader to decide which tools to apply and when that 's why it 's pages and a great reference whenever you 're working   if you make it through and understand murphy then you 'll be golden again understand the theory first but make sure to see how it 's applied as well otherwise you 're just reading without any practical knowledge to quote richard feynman it does n't matter how beautiful your theory is it does n't matter how smart you are if it does n't agree with experiment it 's wrong   personally i think technical analysis is all bs and a waste of time and most of the top investors would agree but at the end of the day ignore everyone and stick to what works for you best of luck

in a traditional ira or 401k or equivalent income tax is not taken on the money when it is deposited or when dividends are reinvested but money you take out after you can do do without penalty is taxed as if it were ordinary income i believe that 's true i do n't think you get to take the long term investment rate note that roth is the opposite you pay income tax up front before putting money into the retirement account but you will eventually withdraw without paying any additional   tax at that time unlike normal investments neither of these requires tracking the details to know how much tax to pay there are no taxes due on the reinvested dividends and you do n't need to track cost basis

this depends on here in the us where i am interest rates were around 3.9 when i fixed my mortgage this underperforms the market e.g. a total market etf like $ vti or an sp500 etf like $ voo have expected returns of the current market growth rate so in theory i am better off paying into the market and making returns greater than my interest rate rather than paying into the equity   however past market returns do not guarantee future market returns the market could reset it could crash are you willing to accept this risk you have to analyze what happens if the market suffers say a 30 correction and you lose a lot of money quickly   i would certainly not invest in individual non etf stocks or you are really exposing yourself to risk

let 's face it most people pay more in insurance premiums than they get back in claims   i put get back in quotes because with very few exceptions the money paid out in claims does not go to the insured but to others such as doctors and hospitals   but even if you ignore the question who does the money actually go to it 's a losing proposition for most people the exceptions are those who have a major loss greater than what they put in over the years   but never forget these are exceptions   the return on your money on the average is only a little better than playing the lottery the usual counter argument to the above is but what if you are one of the exceptions   i for one refuse to let my life be dictated by worries of unlikely events that might happen   if you 're the sort who on what could but probably wo n't happen then maybe you should have insurance   just do n't tell me i need to do the same when i lived in california they had a program where you could deposit $ 25,000 with the state and then you could drive legally without insurance   i did this for a while did n't have any accidents and exited the system when i moved out of state a few years later with more money interest than i put in   you do n't accomplish that with insurance but let 's get back to rich people   unless you get into an accident with you at fault and the other guy needing a head transplant as a result joke you could probably absorb the cost of an accident without an eye   those in the upper middle class might do well with high deductible insurance that only pays out if there 's an extreme accident then again if you have to borrow to buy something expensive making monthly payments they will usually demand you buy insurance with it   this is a way for the lender to protect himself at your expense and if you refuse good luck getting a loan somewhere else i hate the idea of insurance so much i would make an act of insurance punishable by law

someone has to hand out cash to the seller even if no physical money changes hands and i 've bought a house i can tell you a lot of money changes hands at closing in at least the form of a personal check and regardless of exactly how the bank accounts for the actual disbursement of the loan the net result is that the buyer has cash that they give the seller and are now in debt to the bank for least that amount but they now have a house now the bank probably did n't have that money just sitting in its vault money sitting in a vault is money that is not making more money for the bank therefore most banks keep only fractionally more than the percentage of deposit balances that they are required to keep by the feds there are also restrictions on what depositors money can be spent on and loans are not one of them the model of taking in money in savings accounts and then loaning it out is what caused the savings and loan collapse in the 80s so to get the money it turns to investors the bank sells bonds putting itself in debt to bond holders then takes that money and loans it out at a higher rate covering the interest on the bond and making itself a tidy profit for its own shareholders banks lose money on defaults in two ways first they lose all future interest payments that would have been made on the loan technically this is n't revenue until the interest is calculated for each month and accrues on the loan therefore it does n't show on the balance sheet one way or the other however the holders of those bonds will expect a return and the banks no longer have the mortgage payment to cover the coupon payments that they themselves have to pay bondholders creating cash flow problems the second and far more real and damaging way that banks lose money on a foreclosure is the loss of collateral value a bank virtually never offers an unsecured signature loan for a house certainly not at the advertised 3 4 interest rates they want something to back up the loan so if you disappear off the face of the earth they have a clear claim to something that can help them recover their money usually that 's the house itself if you default they get the house from you and sell it to recover their money now a major cause of foreclosure is economic downturn like the one we had in 2009 and are still recovering from when the economy goes in the crapper a lot of things we generally consider stores of value lose that value because the value of the any really is based on what someone else would pay to have it when fewer people are looking to buy that demand drops bringing prices with it homes and real estate are one of the real big ticket items subject to this loss of value when the average joe does n't know whether he 'll have a job tomorrow he does n't go house hunting this average joe may even be looking to sell an extra parcel of land or an income property for cash increasing supply further decreasing prices economic downturn can often increase crime and decrease local government spending on upkeep of public lands as well as homeowners upkeep of their own property by the broken window effect this makes the neighborhood even less desirable in a vicious cycle what made this current recession a double whammy for mortgage lenders is that it was caused in large part by a housing bubble cheap money for houses made housing prices balloon rapidly and then when the money became more expensive such as in sub prime arms a lot of those loans which should never have been signed off on by either side went belly up between the loss of home value a lot of which will likely turn out to be permanent that 's the problem with a bubble things never recover to their peak and the adjustment of interest rates on mortgages to terms that will actually pay off the loan many homeowners found themselves so far underwater and sinking fast that the best financial move for them was to walk away from the whole thing and try again in seven years now the bank 's in a they have this loan they 'll never see repaid in cash and they have this home that 's worth maybe 75 of the mortgage 's outstanding balance if they 're lucky some homes in extremely distressed areas like detroit are currently trading for 30 40 of what they sold for just before the bubble burst multiply that by say 100,000 distressed homes with similar declines in value and you 're talking about tens of billions of dollars in losses on top of that the guarantor basically the bank 's insurance company against these types of losses is now in financial trouble themselves because they took on so many contracts for debt that turned out to be bad aig fannie freddie they may very well declare bankruptcy and leave the bank holding the bag even if the guarantor remains solvent as they did thanks to generous taxpayer bailouts the bank 's swap contract with the guarantor usually requires them to sell the house thus realizing the loss between what they paid and what they finally got back before the guarantor will pay out but nobody 's buying houses anymore because prices are on their way down the only people who 'd buy a house now versus a year from now or two or three years are the people who have no choice and if you have no choice you 're probably in a financial situation that would mean you 'd never be approved for the loan anyway in order to get rid of them the bank has to sell them at auction for pennies on the dollar that further increases the supply of cheap homes and further drives down prices making even the nicer homes the bank 's willing to keep on the books worth less there 's a reason these homes were called toxic assets they 're poisonous to the banks whether they keep or sell them meanwhile all this price depression is now affecting the people who did everything right even people who bought their homes years before the bubble even formed are watching years of equity building go down the crapper that 's to say nothing of the people with prime credit who bought at just the wrong time when the bubble was at its peak even without an adjusting arm to contend with these guys are still facing the fact that they paid top dollar for a house that likely will not be worth its purchase price again in their lifetime even with a fixed mortgage rate they 'll be underwater effectively losing their entire payment to the bank as if it were rent for much longer than it would take to have this entire mess completely behind them if they just walked away from the whole thing moved back into an apartment and waited it out so these guys decide on a strategic default give the bank the house which does n't cover the outstanding balance of course and if they sue file bankruptcy that really makes the banks nervous if people who did everything right are considering the hell of foreclosure and bankruptcy to be preferable to their current state of affairs the bank 's main threat keeping people in their homes is hollow that makes them very reluctant to sign new mortgages because the risk of default is now much less certain now people who do want houses in this market ca n't buy them further reducing demand further decreasing prices you get the idea that 's the housing collapse in a nutshell and what banks and our free market have been working through for the past five years with only the of a turnaround picking up home sales

buying the underlying asset will not completely hedge you only what lies above 155 dollars strike + price of option you still have the risk of losing everything but 5 you have a maximum earnings potential of 55 dollars strike of 150 investment of 100 + option of 5 but you have a risk of losing 95 $ investment of 100 option of 5 say chance of winning everything or losing everything is 50 50 your expected outcome is 0.5 x + 0.5 x 55 = is this a great investment sure you do n't know your odds otherwise it would be a sure thing you should n't sell the call option if you do not expect prices to go up but in that case why not just buy the underlying alone speculating in options is a dangerous game with infinite earnings potential but also infinite loss potential consider selling a call option and not buying the underlying and the price goes from 100 to

i 'm not sure that op was asking if he she personally should have more available credit so i will answer the other interpretation should that particular card have a higher limit the answer is no   the range varies vastly by issuer   starting limits vary widely from issuer to issuer even with identical credit histories   some issuers never automatically increase the limit some periodically conduct account reviews to determine if an increase is warranted   some like to see higher spending habits each month   personally my cards range from $ 500 to $ 25000 and the high and low extremes are the same age you can search for tips on how often to request increases for your particular card or what kind of spending habits the issuer prefers   an important note you do not need to carry a balance to make the issuer happy   you never need to pay a cent in credit card interest

you can use long term options called leaps to increase dividend yield here 's how it works let 's say you buy a dividend yielding stock for $ 38 that pays an annual dividend of $ 2 for a 5.3 yield next you sell a deep in the money leaps options in this hypothetical we 'll sell the $ 25 call option for $ 13 that now reduces our cost basis from $ 38 to $ 25 since the dividend remains $ 2 our yield is now $ = 8 now there are issues that may need to be dealt with like early assignment of the option where rolling the option may be necessary   more details of this strategy can be found on my website

those are valid but i think you will see banks move into fintech as they already have and they are also moving into blockchain one thing that banks have is money and that allows them to move into new spaces in the economy even if they are late to the party when you have institutions that have been around for more than a century they do n’t just go away    i think you start to see trading revenue comeback eventually the passive versus active investing is a cycle as more and more people jump into passive investments it will inevitably change the market because suddenly everything becomes more correlated once there is enough volatility to scare people out of their passive investments then the indices are going to fall then you ’ll start seeing how active investing is better and people start to move back passive investing is good when everything is up but on the downside active investing if you have the right managers will outperform once this occurs you will start to see more volatility in the markets again and a return to active management until inevitably people start to move back to passive again

this sounds to me like a very nice little job for a computer this assumes that you have some experience of programming a computer which i believe you do a program like this does not require a lot of programming experience a beginner in any simple scripting language could implement it which is why i think it is a fairly general answer you can set up a small simulation with either your real loans or the examples you have given then have the computer work through the situation at a monthly time step until the debt is paid and have it output all the interesting information per month then you set it up with your different payment scenarios each paying proportionally each paying their own debt separately paying them in different orders etc when you have these graphs it should be possible to answer your main questions the more information you add to this simulation the more effective it gets for example i 'm sure there are various tax deductions that you can make depending on how much each of you pay that depends on all sorts of things location income age

learn something new every day i found this interesting and thought i 'd throw my 2c in good description i hope from short selling what is short selling first let 's describe what short selling means when you purchase shares of stock in purchasing stocks you buy a piece of ownership in the company you buy sell stock to gain sell ownership of a company when an investor goes long on an investment it means that he or she has bought a stock believing its price will rise in the future conversely when an investor goes short he or she is anticipating a decrease in share price short selling is the selling of a stock that the seller does n't own more specifically a short sale is the sale of a security that is n't owned by the seller but that is promised to be delivered   still with us here 's the skinny when you short sell a stock your broker will lend it to you the stock will come from the brokerage 's own inventory from another one of the firm 's customers or from another brokerage firm the shares are sold and the proceeds are credited to your account sooner or later you must close the short by buying back the same number of shares called covering and returning them to your broker if the price drops you can buy back the stock at the lower price and make a profit on the difference if the price of the stock rises you have to buy it back at the higher price and you lose money so what happened the plan the reality lesson i never understood what shorting a stock meant until today seems a bit risky for my blood but i would assume this is an extreme example of what can go wrong this guy literally chose the wrong time to short a stock that was in all visible aspects on the decline   how often does a large company or individual buy stock on the decline and send that stock soaring how often does a stock go up 100 in 24 hours 600   another example is recently when bought 10 of weight watchers and caused the stock to soar 105 in 24 hours you would have the day you shorted that stock on that particular day if you believed enough to gamble on it going down in price

this depends on your definitions of assets and liabilities the word asset has a fairly straight forward definition   generally speaking an asset in finance is something that you own control that has economic value   the asset has value because it is generating income for you or because you expect that it will be worth something to someone in the future liability is tougher to define and depends on context   in accounting a liability is a debt or obligation that is owed   it is essentially the opposite of an asset where an asset represents something of value that you own increasing your balance sheet a liability is a value that you owe decreasing your balance sheet in that sense a website or domain name that you own is an asset not a liability because it is something you own that has some value   it is not a debt many people use the word liability informally to refer to a bad asset something that is losing value or is causing more in expenses than it is generating in income   see definition 5 on   with this definition you might consider a website or a domain name a liability if it is losing money alternatively depending on your business you might not consider it an asset or a liability but an expense instead   an expense is a cost of doing business   for example if your business is selling something you might need a website to make that happen   the website is n't purchased as an investment and it might not have any value apart from your business   it is simply a necessary expense for your business

essentially your question is lump sum vs dca and your tags reflect that in the long run lump sum say a jan 2 deposit each year will beat dca by about 1/2 the average annual market return $ 12,000 will see a 10 return vs $ 1,000/month over the year seeing 6 what hurts is when the market tanks in the first half of the year and you think dca would have helped this is a feeling issue not a math problem   but by the time you have $ 100 k invested the difference of dca vs lump sum with new money fades as new deposits are small compared to the funds invested   by then you need to know your target allocation and deposit to keep that allocation with new money

there is no one answer to this question but there are some generalities most exchanges make a distinction between the passive and the aggressive sides of a trade   the passive participant is the order that was resting on the market at the time of the trade   it is an order that based on its price was not at the time and therefore goes into the order book   for example i 'm willing to sell 100 shares of a stock at $ 9.98 but nobody wants to buy that right now so it remains as an open order on the exchange then somebody comes along and is willing to meet my price i am glossing over lots of details here   so they aggressively take out my order by either posting a market buy or specifically that they want to buy 100 shares at either $ 9.98 or at some higher price most exchanges will actually give me as the passive i.e. liquidity making investor a small rebate while the other person is charged a few fractions of a cent   google found details and most other exchanges make their fees public as well   as of this writing the generic price charged credited but they provide volume discounts and many of the larger deals do fall into another tier of volume which provides a different price structure

i have an indirect answer for you it is not a numeric answer but it is a procedure the challenge with paying taxes for an employee besides their share of social security and medicare is that you have no idea what their state and federal taxes are   are they married single head of household is this their entire families income or is it   extra money to make ends meet what about state taxes   it looks like you will need a w-4 from them   as you know the irs tax topic has all the info you need federal income tax withholding you are not required to withhold federal income tax from wages you pay    to a household employee however if your employee asks you to    withhold federal income tax and you agree you will need a completed    form w-4 pdf employee 's withholding allowance certificate from your    employee see publication 15 circular e employer 's tax guide    which has tax withholding tables that are updated each year   form w-2 wage and tax statement if you must withhold and pay social security and medicare taxes or if    you withhold federal income tax you will need to complete form w-2    pdf wage and tax statement for each employee you will also need a    form w-3 pdf of wage and tax statement see what forms    must you file in publication pdf for information on when and    where to furnish and file these forms to complete form w-2 you will    need an employer identification number ein and your employees    social security numbers if you do not already have an ein you can    apply for one using the online ein application available on irs.gov    this service is available monday through friday 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.    eastern time you can also apply for an ein by mailing or a    completed form pdf application for employer identification    number international applicants may apply by calling 941 1099    not a toll free number monday through friday 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.    eastern time to obtain their ein refer to topics and for    further information do n't forget federal unemployment tax pub 15 will have tables so you can determine how much you should have been withholding if you had gone that route it will be easiest to use a spreadsheet to do the calculations so that what you gave them in their checks is their net pay not their gross the tables are constructed under the assumption you know their gross pay

any time a large order it placed for buy the sell side starts increasing as the demand of buy has gone up vice versa is also true once this orders gets fulfilled the demand drops and hence the sell price should also lower depending on how much was the demand supply without your order the price fluctuation would vary for if before your order for this particular share the normal volume is around 100 's of shares then you order would spike things up quite a bit however if for other share the normal volume is around 100000 's then your order would not have much impact

before doing anything else you want a lawyer involved right from the beginning to make sure that something reasonable happens with the house if one of you dies or leaves seriously you 'll both be safer and happier if it 's all explicit how much you should put on the house is not the right question houses do n't sell instantly and while you can access some of their stored value by borrowing against them that too can take some time to arrange you need to have enough operating capital for normal finances plus an emergency reserve to cover unexpectedly being out of work or sudden medical expenses there are suggestions for how much that should be in answers to other questions after that the question is whether you should really be buying a house at all it is n't always a better option than renting and again as discussed in answers to other questions there are ongoing costs in time and upkeep and taxes and insurance if you 're just thinking about the financials it may be better to continue to rent and to invest the savings in the market the time to buy a house is when you have the money and a reliable income plan not to move for at least five years really want the advantages of more elbow room and the freedom to alter the place to suit your needs which will absorb more money   as far as how much to put down vs. finance you really want a down payment of at least 20 anything less than that and the bank will insist you pay for mortgage insurance which is a significant expense whether you want to pay more than that out of your savings depends on how low an interest rate you can get this is a good time in that regard versus how much return you are getting on your investments combined with how long you want the mortgage to run and how large a mortgage payment you 're comfortable committing to if you 've got a good investment plan in progress and can get a mortgage which charges a lower interest rate than your investments can reasonably be expected to pay you putting less down and taking a larger mortgage is one of the safer forms of leveraged investing if you 're comfortable with that if the larger mortgage hanging over you is going to make you uncomfortable   this might not be a good answer for you it 's a judgement call i waited until i 'd been in out of school about 25 years before i was ready to buy a house since i 'd been careful with my money over that time   i had enough in investments that i could have bought the house for cash or i could have gone the other way and financed 80 of it for maximum leverage i decided that what i was comfortable with was financing 50 you 'll have to work thru the numbers and decide what you are comfortable with but i say again if buying shared property you need a lawyer involved it may be absolutely the right thing to do but you want to make sure everything is fully spelled out and you 'll also want appropriate terms written into your wills being married would carry some automatic assumptions about joint ownership and survivor rights but even then it 's safer to make it all explicit edit yes making a larger down payment may let you negotiate a lower interest rate on the loan you 'll have to find out what each bank is willing to offer you or work with a mortgage broker who can explore those options for you

you may withdraw penalty free from a 401(k if you separate from service at 55 or later this may make the rolling to any ira not a good idea you can withdraw penalty free if you are disabled you can withdraw penalty free if you take the withdrawal using a process called section 72 t which basically means a steady withdrawal for either 5 years or until age 59 1/2 whichever is second   aside from these exceptions the concept is to be allowed to take withdrawals after 59 1/2 but you must start to take withdrawals starting at 70 1/2 these are called rmds required minimum distributions and represent a small fraction of the account at 70 at 80 at 90   each year you take a minimum of this fraction of the account value and pay the tax if you had a million dollars your first withdrawal would be $ you 'd be in the 15 marginal rate with this income   in general it 's always a good idea to be aware of your marginal tax rate for example a married filing joint couple would be in the 15 bracket up to a taxable $ in 2015 at withdrawal time and as the year moves along if they are on track to have a taxable $ for example it would be wise to take the extra $ 10,000 either as a withdrawal to put aside for the next year or as a roth conversion this way as the rmds increase they have a reduced chance to push the couple to the next tax bracket

ira is a tax deferred account i.e. you 're not paying any taxes on the income within the account as long as you do n't withdraw it and you can deduct the investment with certain limitation on how much depending on your total agi it is taxed when you withdraw it at ordinary rates for the traditional ira and with 0 rate for roth as long as the withdrawal is qualified if not qualified you pay ordinary rate tax for roth and additional 10 tax for both on the taxable amounts the details are a bit complicated there 's deductible ira non deductible ira roll overs etc etc but that 's the basic regular investment accounts are taxed currently on any income but you get the better capital gains rates on many things so which one is better depends how long your investment is going to be what is your tax situation now and what you anticipate it to be later when you retire

the specific state pension plan you have linked to is provided by the government of the u.k. to workers resident there more generally speaking many countries provide some kind of basic worker 's pension or social security to residents   in the united states it is called surprise social security and in canada most of us call ours canada pension plan   such pensions are typically funded by payroll deductions distinct separate from income tax deducted at source   you can learn about the variety of social security programs around the world courtesy of the u.s. social security administration 's own survey what those and many other government or state pensions have in common and the term or concept that i think you are looking for is that they are typically defined benefit type of plans   a defined benefit or db plan is where there is a promised or defined benefit i.e. a set lump sum amount such as with a cash balance type of db plan or income per year in retirement more typical note defined benefit plans are not restricted to be offered by governments only many companies also offer db plans to their employees but db plans in the private sector are becoming more rare due to the funding risk inherent in making such a long term promise to employees whereas a defined contribution or dc plan is one where employee and/or employer put money into a retirement account the balance of which is invested in a selection of funds then at retirement the resulting lump sum amount or annual income amounts if the resulting balance is are based on the performance of the investments selected that is with a dc plan there is no promise of you getting either a set lump sum amount or a set amount of annual income at retirement   the promise was up front on how much money they would contribute   so the contributions are defined often according to a matching contribution scheme yet the resulting benefit itself is not defined i.e. promised summary db plans promise you the money the benefit you 'll get at retirement dc plans only promise you the money the contributions you get now

this is a good idea but it will barely affect your credit score at all   credit cards while a good tool to use for giving a minor boost to your credit score and for purchasing things while also building up rewards with those purchases are n't very good for building credit    this is because when banks calculate your credit report they look at your long term credit history and weigh larger longer term debt much higher than short term debt that you pay off right away   while having your credit card is better than nothing it 's a relatively small drop in the pond when it comes to credit    i would still recommend getting a credit card though it will if you have n't already started paying off a debt like a student or car loan give you a credit identity and rewards depending on the credit card you choose   but if you do do not ever let yourself fall into delinquency   failing to pay off loans will damage your credit score   so if you do plan to get a credit card it is much better to do as you 've said and pay it all off as soon as possible    edit   in addition to the above using a credit card has the added benefit of having greater security over debit cards and ensures that your own money wo n't be stolen though you will still have to report a fraudulent charge

as has been stated you do n't need to actively bank with a credit union to apply for one of their credit cards that said one benefit to having account activity and significant capital with a cu is to increase the likelihood of having a larger credit line granted to you when you do apply if you are going to use the card sparingly however then this is a non issue that said if you really want to maximize card benefits then you want to look for cards with large sign up bonuses e.g. chase or ink bold if you have a business and sign up exclusively for those bonuses these cards offer rewards in excessive value of $ 1000 in travel services hotels plane tickets or $ 500 cash back if you prefer straight cash back redemptions if you prefer to keep it really simple you can sign up for a cash back card like the amex fidelity which offers 2 cash back everywhere with no annual fee albeit the cash back is through their investment account which you do n't actually have to invest with personally i have the card and use it exclusively for gas 5 cash back i also have a charles schwab bank account which i keep funded exclusively for atm withdrawals free atm usage worldwide 100 fee reimbursement i use the accounts exclusively for the benefit they provide me and no more and have never had an issue i also have 3 dozen other credit cards which i signed up for exclusively for the sign up bonus but that 's outside the scope of this question i only mention it because you seem to believe it is difficult to get approved for a new credit line if your credit is good however you wo n't have a problem   for a small idea of how to maximize credit card bonus categories i would advise you read this as mentioned in the article its possible to get rewards almost everywhere you shop in short anytime you use cash you are missing out on a multitude of benefits a credit card offers you e.g. see the benefits of a visa signature card in addition to points cash back

much of this is incorrect aetna owns for starters and it 's your employer who decides which banks and brokers to offer not an hsa is a checking account with an investment account option after a minimum balance is met a majority of u.s. employers only offer an hsa option but do n't contribute a penny so you 're lucky you get anything   the easy solution is just keep the money that is sent to your hsa checking account in your checking account and once a year roll it over into a different bank 's hsa the vast majority of banks offer hsas that have no ties to a particular broker i.e. citibank pnc chase i have all my hsa funds in hsa bank which is online but services lots of employers not true that most payroll deductions or employer contributions go to a single hsa custodian bank   they might offer a single bank that either contracts with an investment provider or lets you invest anywhere but most employers making contributions are large or mid market employers offering multiple banks and that trend is growing fast because of defined contribution private exchanges and vendor product basically nobody likes having a second bank account for their hsa when their home bank offers one

in some cases we when we see an opportunity to save our clients money without risking valuable coverage or diminishing benefits we make certain recommendations for more affordable life insurance one of these strategies is laddering or term lengths or term maturities the strategy is simple while most people who are considering longer terms such as 20 or 30 year term purchase a single policy to fit their needs the laddering strategy has you purchase two policies totaling the same amount of coverage you currently need but with a shorter length term mixed with the longer term for example instead of purchasing a 30 year term for $ 1 million dollars you might purchase two policies for $ 500,000 each one with a 15 year term and the other with a 30 year term the result is typically a savings of on your term life insurance just be aware that the plan going in is to let the first policy go the one with the shorter term length when its level term has expired for example in a 15 year term the premiums will be guaranteed to stay level the first 15 years and then increase every year thereafter there is typically a sizable jump in rates in that 16th year clients often see rates increase 8 10 times or more therefore it ’s important you understand that going in and realize you will most likely let that first policy go when the premiums increase leaving you with the second policy through the end of its longer level term you can crunch some numbers with our laddering calculator

yes theoretically you can flip the shares you agreed to buy and make a profit but you 're banking on the market behaving in some very precise and potentially unlikely ways   in practice it 's very tricky for you to successfully navigate paying arbitrarily more for a stock than it 's currently listed for and selling it back again for enough to cover the difference   yes the price could drop to $ 28 but it could just as easily drop to $ or further and now you 're hurting before even taking into account the potentially hefty commissions involved another way to think about it is to recognize that an option transaction is a bet the buyer is betting a small amount of money that a stock will move in the direction they expect the seller is betting a large amount of money that the same stock will not   one of you has to lose   and unless you 've some reason to be solidly confident in your predictive powers the loser long term is quite likely to be you now that said it is possible particularly when selling puts to create win win scenarios for yourself where you 're betting one direction but you 'd be perfectly happy with the    here 's an example   suppose unrelated to the option chain you 've come to the conclusion that you 'd be happy paying $ 28 for bby   it 's currently june 2011 at so you ca n't buy it on the open market for a price you 'd be happy with   but you could sell a $ 28 put promising to buy it at that price should someone want to sell it presumably because the price is now below $ 28 either the put expires worthless and you pocket a few bucks and you 're basically no worse off because the stock is still overpriced by your estimates or the option is executed and you receive 100 shares of bby at a price you previously decided you were willing to pay   even if the list price is now lower long term you expect the stock to be worth more than $ 28   conceptually this makes selling a put very similar to being paid to place a limit order to buy the stock itself of course you could be wrong in your estimate too low and you now have a position that might not become profitable too high and you never get in and instead just watch the stock gain in value but that is not unique to options if you 're bad at estimating value which is not to be confused with predicting price movement you 're doomed just about whatever you do
