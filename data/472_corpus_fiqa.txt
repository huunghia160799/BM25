is there anything i need to ask or consider during my negotiation    process based on the fact that they probably will soon be own by    another company very tricky situation you are being hired by one company and one hiring manager but you already know that there are big changes ahead what you do n't know is how all those changes will actually play out you will at least end up working for a different company   i 've worked for several companies in the past that were acquired and some that acquired other companies after each acquisition the nature of the company changed significantly some teams were let go completely often overhead departments like accounting marketing etc that were handled at the corporate level some teams were moved to a different location others stayed the same sometimes management changed in one case i was working for a new boss who worked out of the home office in another state the time frame for these changes ranged from immediately to several years after the acquisition for me at least some of the things that made the job appealing earlier typically were gone   try as best you can to ask questions about the acquisition and about the nature of the acquiring company if they are allowed to tell you the name of the company that is acquiring them do some searching see if you can find out how the company typically deals with acquisitions do they immediately let almost everyone go keeping only the essential few or do they run new acquisitions as separate divisions and leave them alone for at least a while try to find out from your hiring manager what their expectations are for your specific team post acquisition try to find out if anything within your offer is subject to change post acquisition are you being hired under the old pre acquisition rules or under the new post acquisition rules the fact that you even know the company is being acquired is good often companies can not even divulge that fact until very near the end on the other hand your use of the phrase probably will soon makes me wonder how much is definite here here 's something you might wish to read

one explanation is that movie patrons are considering their total willingness to pay for the movie experience so that if the ticket price plus the market price of popcorn is less than their willingness to pay the theater has an opportunity to extract more consumer surplus by charging higher than market prices for the popcorn that is price discrimination there is a working paper on the subject by and 2008 the abstract of which reads prices for goods such as blades for razors ink for printers and concessions at movies are often     set well above cost   theory has shown that this could yield   a profitable price discrimination     strategy often termed metering   the idea is that a customer ’s intensity of demand for     aftermarket goods e.g. the concessions provides a meter of how much the customer is willing to     pay for the primary good e.g. admission   if this correlation in tastes for the two goods is     positive a high price on the aftermarket good allows firms to extract a greater total price     admissions plus concessions from higher type   customers   this paper develops a simple     aggregate model of discrete continuous demand to motivate how this correlation can be tested     using simple regression techniques and readily available firm data   model simulations illustrate     that the can be used to predict whether aftermarket prices should be above below or     equal to their marginal cost   we then apply the approach to box office and concession data from     a chain of spanish theaters and find that high priced concessions do extract more surplus from     customers with a greater willingness to pay for the admission ticket   and 1992 make a similar argument in a article   they essentially argue that purchases of things like movie tickets are made by groups once individuals are constrained by the group 's choice the firm has additional market power we present models in which price discrimination in the context of   a    two part price can occur in some competitive markets purchases   take    place in groups which choose which firms to patronize while   firms    are perfectly competitive with respect to   groups they have   some    market power over individual consumers who are constrained   by their    groups choices we find that firms will charge an entry fee   that is     below marginal cost   and   the   second part of   the   price is   marked    up   above marginal cost the   markup not only is positive   but    increases with the quality of the product the quote you are looking for is similar and again attributes the discrepancy to price discrimination   from the armchair economist p. the purpose of expensive popcorn is not to extract a lot of money from    customers that purpose would be better served by cheap popcorn and    expensive movie tickets instead the purpose of expensive popcorn is    to extract different sums from   different customers popcorn lovers    who have more fun at the movies pay more for their additional    pleasure that is some people like popcorn more than others   the latter idea is that the movie experience for popcorn lovers is worth more than the sum of its parts that a movie ticket + popcorn is worth more than either of them separately for some people

the thing is that you only need one entry not two that 's the beauty of double entry since you have double entry system every transaction will create two entries so you do n't need to create two transactions you only need one so you got a $ 30 gift you credit income gifts and on the other side assets checking your general ledger entry ledger will look like this you end up with balances which represent your total income and your current balance similarly with expense for food gl will look like this balances and you keep track of totals properly

generally yes   rather than ask why are these guys so cheap you should be asking why the big names are so expensive marketing spend plays a big role there getting babies to shill for your company during the super bowl requires a heck of a lot of commissions due to the difficulties involved in setting up a brokerage it 's unlikely that you 'll see a scam a brokerage might go bankrupt for random reasons but that 's what investor insurance is for is mostly the likelihood that you 'll be able to get access to your funds on deposit with the broker investment funds are insured by sipc for up to $ 500,000 with a lower limit on cash the specific limits vary by broker with some offering greater protection paid for on their own dime check with the broker it 's usually on their web pages under security funds in cash might be swept into an interest earning investment vehicle for which insurance is different and that depends on the broker too a few forex brokers went bankrupt last year although that 's a new market with fewer regulatory protections for traders i heard that one bankruptcy in the space resulted in a 7 loss for traders with accounts there and that there was a ponzi ish scam company as well luckily the more stringent regulation of stock brokerages makes that space much safer for investors if you want to assess the reliability of an online broker i suggest the following it 's tempting to look at when the brokerage was founded fly by night scams by definition wo n't be around very long and usually that means under a few months any company with a significant online interface will have to have been around long enough to develop that client interface their backend databases and the interface with the markets and their clearing house the two brokerages you mentioned have been around for 7 + years so that lends strength to the supposition of a strong business model that said there could well be a new company that offers services or prices that fit your investment need and in that case definitely look into their registrations and third party reviews finally note that the smaller independent brokerages will probably have margin rules if you 're playing a complex novel and/or high risk strategy that ca n't handle the volatility of a market crash even a short excursion such as the 2010 flash crash stiff margin rules might have consequences that a novice investor would rather pretend did n't exist

i would expect that your position will be liquidated when the option expires but not before there 's probably still some time value so it does n't make sense for the buyer to exercise the option early and take your stock instead they could sell the option to someone else and collect the remaining time value occasionally there 's a weird situation for whatever reason where an option has near zero or negative time value and then you might get an early exercise but in general if there 's time value someone would want to sell rather than exercise if the option has n't expired maybe the stock will even fall again and you 'll keep it if the option just expired maybe the exercise just has n't been processed yet it may take overnight or so

the benefit as other answers have mentioned is higher interest rates than are available compared to other comparable options   my bank keeps spamming me with offers for a sub 1 apr savings account that only requires a $ 10,000 balance for example   while cds and similar safe investments do n't seem like they offer much value now or in the recent past that 's because they strongly correlate to the federal funds rate which is near historic lows   see the graph of cd rates and the federal funds rate here you may have felt differently in july of 1984 when you could get a 5 year cd with an apr above 12   as you can see in this graph of historical cd yields it has n't always been the case that cds offered such small returns   that being said cds are safe investments being fdic insured up to the fdic insurance limits so you 're not going to get great rates from one because there 's basically no risk in this particular type of investment   if you want better rates you get those by investing in riskier instruments that have the possibility of losing value

that 's easy keep making the payments and go on with life the number that matters more than loan market value is loan equity as long as you can sell it for enough to pay the balance on your loan you should be okay not saying it does n't suck but financially you are fine if you owe more than the house is worth i 'd suggest paying it down as quickly as possible to fix that ratio to reduce your financial risk in case you lose your source of income personally i think it is pretty slimy for people to walk away from house notes or try to short sell them when they can afford to continue payments just because the market value of the house fell   how would you feel if when house prices were skyrocketing the bank canceled your loan and repossessed your house because they could resell it for more money not that they could realistically just speaking hypothetically

gt;well put and honestly seemingly unavoidable   yes there is an aspect of it that i think is the equivalent to ocean there are winds and waves of fortune which are often mistaken as entirely due to merit when in fact the merit may have been only a minor factor   gt;as i see it re is a crap investment for the foreseeable future as oversupply and are not absorbed people have to live so rentals will be key but they have already quite a bit    i 'd agree   i 've looked into and decided to pass on the whole buy up a bunch of homes amp rent them out line   there was definitely an opportunity with foreclosure distressed sale properties in the area but after and seeking advice from several experienced landlords i have concluded that it is not the risk free passive income mechanism that a lot of think it is and there is substantial risk effort involved both in the form of capital investment repairs maintenance requiring both time amp money as well as the probability of an interrupted revenue steam bad renters are difficult expensive to deal with as well as other costs significantly increased property taxes especially on rentals etc   the truly big gains to my understanding anyway of being a landlord are the windfall cash out phase where having had renters paying the mortgage interest you get the benefit of the capital gain on the sale of the property but due to what i think and sincerely believe based on the of boomer die off i am fairly certain that said payoff will not be anywhere near as large in the coming decades as it has been in the past if the payoff even exists at all and is n't a net loss especially in light of the work effort investment involved   will likely trade sideways for awhile before likely tanking as the forced willing withdrawals start happening from the boomers so keeping it in stocks does n't sound overly positive unless a fairly aggressive put strategy is enforced    depends on what you mean by stocks the overall market is one thing specific stocks can be quite a different story while it is an extreme example note the dramatic difference between aapl vs the dow during the past = = = = nasdaq etc   basically the whole idea of passive mindless set it and forget it gains from investments being the path to wealth has to go bye bye it was never really real to begin with unless you timed the market just right and the vast majority of the gains were nominal anyway   gt;for me personally and selfishly i have 20 years minimum for retirement so i 'm fine the market trending sideways or down it means that i 'm getting more bang for my dca buck and 20 + years from now i will be well positioned when the market eventually cycles back up    i guess i take the long term historical view that the very concept of some guaranteed retirement was simply an a lucky generation or two got away with it by accident in the timing of their birth something they really had no input into   instead i think one will always need to be working in some manner or another actively overseeing ones investments and remaining agile in response   and of course there is risk involved in that as if there is really any reason we should expect there not to be anyone who thinks that way imo is simply ignorant of the vast scope of human history   the best i think one can do is to truly diversify and that does not mean mutual funds to separate your eggs into various baskets holding some major part in solid as solid as can be form even with the possibility of zero return and/or some loss i.e. owning primary housing clear of debt some pm 's in physical form etc having other assets in what are fairly solid bets based on demographic trends company quality etc and then some things several small bets that are long shots but potentially high return things where just one win can not only offset a dozen non performers losers but gain you a substantial real profit   basically i think one has to use their mind and available information which must be actively sought out and seriously analyzed considered and then even with all of that realize that there is a certain crap shoot aspect to everything and that big winners are just as often either scam artists who often get their think enron or who are just lucky shits who were in the right place at the right time were dealt the right cards and subsequently made the right bets due to wiki and other biases we just do n't often hear about the ones who hit 4 out of 5 of those things and who might have still been winners but just not large prominent enough to gain fame amp recognition much less the 3 out of 5 whose gains were minimal or a wash

you say it 's expensive   i 'm going to interpret this as the monthly payments are too high basically you need to get your old loan paid off presumably by selling the car you have now   this is the tough part   if you sold the car now how much would you get for it   you can use blue book to figure out what the car is roughly worth   that 's not a guarantee that it will actually sell for that much   look in your local to see what similar cars are selling for   keep in mind that you will usually get less for your old car if you trade it in versus sell it yourself now if you owe more than your car is worth you 're in a really tight spot   if you do n't get enough money when you sell it you are still stuck with the remainder of the loan   in that case it is usually best to just stick with the car you have and be more cautious about payments and loan length the next time you finance a car penalties   most car loans do n't have any kind of early repayment penalty   however you should check your loan paperwork just to make sure

the legal system can be unfair sometimes but honestly these people brought this on themselves the author glosses over the most important part of the post they sent a letter threatening a dilution claim before the insurance company sued which is probably what prompted the suit in the first place these idiots were pissed about phone calls so they responded by threatening a dilution suit which if successful could be very expensive for the insurance company the insurance company reacted very rationally by filing a claim preemptively in order to establish jurisdiction in florida so that they would n't have to go to new hampshire to defend themselves that 's the advantage of filing first    every other problem the sole proprietor has been having has from not retaining counsel after being sued navigating the technicalities of a trademark suit is not for the which is why you do n't threaten a suit before retaining counsel or being prepared to file suit first these made a very serious legal threat against a legally sophisticated company and are now being hung by their own    edit excuse my silly hung confusion i was typing quickly late at night after a few glasses of wine but i wanted to point out a few other holes in this person 's story this case is in federal court in the southern district of florida the electronic filing system that the article refers to is cm which is used by most if not all us federal district courts any lawyer admitted to the federal bar in nh should be able to handle it even if the case is in florida as procedural rules are uniform across jurisdictions see the federal rules of civil procedure even without an attorney it is easy to get case access accounts to the system so a non lawyer can track and motions in their case it is also quite easy to get a qualified patent attorney from outside the admitted pro which means for this particular case only it would be a very simple matter for an attorney in nh to get admitted pro merely for the purposes of filing a forum non defense or change of venue motion given the disparity in sophistication and resources between the parties a hardship defense would likely be successful in challenging the venue and then there 's the matter of personal jurisdiction unless the defendant has conducted business in florida the court 's jurisdiction can be challenged all of this explains why you need a lawyer

no free lunch you can not receive risk free interest on more money than you actually put down the construct you are proposing is called carry trade and will yield you the interest difference in exchange for assuming currency risk negative expectation in the long run one would expect the higher yielding currency to devalue faster at a rate that exactly negates the difference in interest net profit is therefore zero in the long run now factor in the premium that a forex broker charges and now you may expect losses the size of which depends on the leverage chosen if there was any way that this could reliably produce a profit even without friction i.e. roll over transaction costs spread quants would have already arbitraged it away in my experience true long term roll over costs in relation to interest are a lot harder to compute than for example the cost of a stock transaction this makes the whole deal very as to the idea of artificially constructing a usd usd pair i regret to tell you that such a construct is not possible for further info see this question on carry trade why does currency carry trade work

yes there is it is called a one cancels the other order oco investopedia defines a oco order as definition of one cancels the other order oco a pair of orders stipulating that if one order is executed then the    other order is automatically canceled a one cancels the other order    oco combines a stop order with a limit order on an automated trading    platform when either the stop or limit level is reached and the order    executed the other order will be automatically canceled seasoned    traders use oco orders to mitigate risk i use cmc markets in australia and they allow free conditional and oco orders either when initially placing a buy order or after already buying a stock see the place new order box below   once you have selected a stock to buy the number of shares you want to buy and at what price you can place up to 3 conditional orders the first condition is a place order if conditional order here you can place a condition that your buy order will only be placed onto the market if that condition is met first   say the stock last traded at $ and you only want to place your order the next day if the stock price moves above the current resistance at $ 10.00 so you would place order if price is at or above $ 10.00 so if the next day the price moves up to $ 10 or above your order will be placed onto the market the next two conditional orders form part of the oco orders the second condition is a stop loss conditional order here you place the price you want to sell at if the price drops to or past your stop loss price it will only be placed on to the market if your buy order gets traded so if you wanted to place your stop loss at $ 9.00 you would type in 9.00 in the box after if at or below and select if you want a limit or market order the third condition is a take profit conditional order this allows you to take profits if the stock reaches a certain price say you wanted to take profits at 30 that is if the price reached $ so you would type in in the box after if at or above and again select if you want a limit or market order once you have bought the stock if the stop order gets triggered then the take profit order gets cancelled automatically if on the other hand the take profit order gets triggered then the stop loss order gets cancelled automatically these oco conditional orders can be placed either at the time you enter your buy order or after you have already bought the stock and they can be edited or deleted at any time the broker you use may have a different process for entering conditional and oco orders such as these

i think the rise of low quality merchandise in things other than consumer electronics where obsolescence is natural due to moore 's law and the very fast rate of improvement is due to socialist redistribution that has put $ trillions into the hands of people merely for being poor rather than producing for others these people typically still shop based on price rather than quality which creates increased demand and therefore encourages higher production of lower quality items such as plastic versions of things that are actually cheaper if made as metal lower long term cost of use

actually the rate of change could be more or less constant but you might have a minimum price that represents your fixed costs   so you might sell a for $ 1 which is ridiculous in terms of per unit pricing to cover fixed costs and add $ for each step in size to cover variable costs cost of raw materials and packaging so a 2 lb bag would be $ 2 a 5 lb bag would be $ 3.50 a ton would be $ etc   at the end of the day you want the marginal revenue the price that you charge for each additional pound to be more than the marginal cost the price per pound it takes to produce the bag   any amount over that goes towards your fixed costs the cost you 'd incur if you sold zero product rent utilities overhead etc it 's not an exact science and there are many variables that go into pricing

what could a small guy with $ 100 do to make himself not poor the first priority is an emergency fund one of the largest expenses of poor people are short term loans for emergencies being able to avoid those will likely be more lucrative than an s&p investment remember just like a loan if you use your emergency fund you 'll need to refill it be smart and pay yourself 10 interest when you do it 's still less than you 'd pay for a payday loan and yet it means that after every emergency you 're better prepared for the next event to get an idea for how much you 'd need you probably own a car how much would you spend if you suddenly had to replace it that should be money you have available if you think must buy a new car better have that much available if you can live with a you 're still going to need a few k.   having said that the next goal after the emergency fund should be savings for the infrequent large purchases the emergency fund if for the case where your car unexpectedly gets totaled the saving is for the regular replacement again the point here is to avoid an expensive loan   paying down a mortgage is not that important mortgage loans are cheaper than   car loans and much cheaper than payday loans still it would be nice if your house is paid when you retire but here chances are that stocks are a better investment than real estate even if it 's the real estate you live in

couple things i will admit i was wrong about the total graduates at each of those programs however numbers taper out the lower the program is down to about 250 300 a class also cut each of those numbers down to about 1/2 1/3 and you get the group that 's actually focused on finance many mbas do consulting marketing product development etc nowadays   also i 'm a bit offended by you saying i do n't understand the cfa could n't be more mistaken boss i 'm for l3 in june like you the requirement is only 2 years in an investment decision role this also means a lot of back office risk guys qualify that 's a pretty fungible qualification you do n't have to be a pm to qualify i have a buddy who qualified having done 2 years in fund accounting not exactly sell side er   i 'm also going to guess you 're a trader brokerage cap markets guy if you wanna throw titles around i 'm in a front office role at a bb too and worked at worked on buy side research at a value shop cfa is definitely more desired in sell side markets focused as opposed to ibd where an mba is more useful more strategy focused    the cfa is vital for up on quantitative skills an mba wo n't cover i 'll absolutely give you that but a lot of people fall into the trap of assuming a cfa is their ticket to bigger and better things if you 're working in back office risk management getting a cfa does n't immediately qualify you to do er which is a very common pitfall i see like an mba it teaches everyone how to do the same type of analysis too another reason   the title means less and less    last weekend i had a conversation with a friend of a friend about this very thing he 's sitting for l3 cfa works back office at a very notable hf and expects to be moved up without any indication that he will to research when he 's done i asked his opinions about things like the european situation fiscal cliff and a hard landing in china not only was he not familiar these concepts he did n't even know what hft was the cfa gives you the tools to analyze the impacts of pension liabilities on eps but it still takes a passion about the markets as well as creative analytical judgement to make it to er    my only point is an mba and cfa are very similar in many ways both tend to hold their noses way to high too it 's about what you chose to get out of it and too often people care more about the title than the process which is why they are still stuck in mediocrity after completing the designations    go through a list of the biggest pms in the business most do n't have either mbas or they achieved alpha by not following standard quantitative models but exploring creative and strategic avenues others undervalue while maintaining strict discipline a model is a tool to better describe behavior and understanding of markets it 's not a solution

technically anyone who advises how you should spend or proportion your money is a financial adviser   a person that does it for money is a financial advisor difference in spelling financial advisors are people that basically build manage or advise on your portfolio   they have a little more institutional knowledge on how where to invest given your goals since they do it on a daily basis they may know a little more than you since they deal with many different assets stocks etfs mutual funds bonds insurances home health life reits options futures leaps etc there is risk in everything you do which is why what they propose is generally according to the risk level you want to assume   since you 're younger your risk level could be a little higher as you approach retirement your risk level will be lower   risk level should be associated with how likely you 're able to your assets if you lose it all as well as your likelihood to enjoy the fruits from your investments financial advisors are great however be careful about them   some are payed on commissions which are given money for investing in packages that they support   basically they could get paid $ $ for putting you in a losing situation   also be careful because some announce that they are fee based these advisers often receive fees as well as commissions   basically associate the term commission with conflict of interest so you want a fee only advisor which is n't persuaded to steer you wrong another thing worth noting is that some trading companies like e*trade has financial services that may be free depending how much money you have with them   generally $ 50 k is on the lower end to get a financial advisors   there has been corruption in the past where financial advisors are only given a limited number of accounts to manage that means they took the lower valued ones and basically ran them into the ground so they could get newer ones from the lot that were hopefully worth more the larger their portfolio the more $ $ they could make higher fees or more commissions and less work less accounts to have to deal with that 's subjective since the spread of the wealth was accross many markets

i 'm a series 24 securities principle and have explained and trained people on questions like these more times than i can count although my first recommendation is to speak to a qualified tax professional for the appropriate answer for each individual scenario   disclosure aside the source of truth for these questions is always the irs publications in this case it 's irs pub 590b when must you withdraw assets required minimum distributions   ira stands for individual retirement arrangement basically it 's an arrangement between you a the government to encourage retirement savings tax to a define taxable income amount agree to receive a deduction during your working years lowering your taxable income in the present your taxable income should drop in retirement because you 're not working anymore and any withdraws would most likely be taxed at a lower rate to be clear the require minimum distribution is based on a life expectancy factor and the ending balance of your pre tax retirement accounts from the prior ex 2016 ending balance for a 2017 rmd the rmd works out to be somewhere around 3 4 of your total balance   most retirement account not all have established several conveniences to automate the withdraw process i 've believe that moving funds directly to bank deposits or moving the funds to another taxable investment account are most common   retirement account providers are required by law to give you notifications about rmds some big firms allow you to setup an auto distribution a year before you turn 70.5 to start when they need to because of the 50 penalty you 're given so many notifications about an rmd that it 's hard to forget about it

the answer likely depends a bit on which state you are in but this should be true for most states   i do n't know anything about pennsylvania specifically unfortunately the affordable care act created the shop marketplace which allows small businesses to effectively form larger groups for group coverage purposes   shop stands for small business health options program and requires only one common law employee on payroll this would effectively allow you to offer group coverage without having a group   talk to your tax accountant for more details as this is still very new and not necessarily well understood there are some other options all of which i would highly suggest talking to a tax accountant about as well   health reimbursement accounts allow the employer to set aside pre tax funds for the employee to use for approved medical expenses they 're often managed by a benefits company say wageworks etc   that would allow your employee to potentially pick a higher deductible health plan which offers poorer coverage on the individual marketplace with after tax dollars and then supplement with your there are also the concept of employer payment plans where the employer reimburses the employee for their insurance premiums but those are not compatible with the aca for the most part although there seems to be a lot of disagreement as to whether it 's possible to have something effectively the same work see for example this page versus this for example

of course but that 's not relevant to my example let me clarify say you hold a highly appreciated $ 10 m position in aapl and you have good reason to believe the next iphone is going to be a flop causing the stock to decline 20 you can sell now to avoid the probable decline but by doing so you will be left with let 's say $ m after paying $ 3.33 m of state and federal ltcg taxes on the appreciation $ 9 m of the $ 10 m because you bought a long time ago   however by simply doing nothing and eating the 20 decline you 'll end up with $ 8 m instead of $   many economists would criticize the tax in this example as it has led to the investor rationally suffering a $ 2 m loss instead of reallocating all $ 10 m of his her capital to a more promising enterprise furthermore if when many investors act that way they can create inefficiency in the equity markets prices not declining by as much as they should to reflect a firm 's reduced prospects

in my opinion every person regardless of his or her situation should be keeping track of their personal finances   in addition i believe that everyone regardless of their situation should have some sort of budget spending plan for many people it is tempting to ignore the details of their finances and not worry about it   after all the bank knows how much money i have right   i get a statement from them each month that shows what i have spent and i can always go to the bank 's website and find out how much money i have right   unfortunately this type of thinking can lead to several different problems overspending   in olden days it was difficult to spend more money than you had   most purchases were made in cash so if your wallet had cash in it you could spend it and when your wallet was empty you were required to stop spending   in this age of credit and electronic transactions this is no longer the case   it is extremely easy to spend money that you do n't yet have and find yourself in debt   debt of course leads to interest charges and future burdens for the future   without a plan it is difficult to know if you have saved up enough for large future expenses   will you have enough money to pay the water bill that only shows up once every three months or the property tax bill that only shows up once a year   will you have enough money to pay to fix your car when it breaks   will you have enough money to replace your car when it is time   how about helping out your kids with college tuition or funding your retirement   without a plan all of these are very difficult to manage without proper accounting    anxiety   not having a clear picture of your finances can lead to anxiety   this can happen whether or not you are actually overspending and whether or not you have enough saved up to cover future expenses because you simply do n't know if you have adequately covered your situation or not   making a plan and doing the accounting necessary to ensure you are following your plan can take the worry out of your finances fear of spending   there was an interesting question from a user last year who was not at all in trouble with his finances yet was always afraid to spend any money because he did n't have a budget spending plan in place   if you spend money on a vacation are you putting your property tax bill in jeopardy   with a good budget in place you can know for sure whether or not you will have enough money to pay your future expenses and can spend on something else today this can all be done with or without the aid of software but like many things a computer makes the job easier   a good personal finance program will do two things keeps track of your spending and balances apart from your bank   the bank can only show you things that have cleared the bank   if you set up future payments outside of the bank or you write a check that has not been cashed yet or you spend money on a credit card and have not paid the bill yet these will not be reflected in your bank balance online   however if you manually enter these things into your own personal finance program you can see how much money you actually have available to spend lets you plan for future spending   the spending plan or budget lets you assign a job to every dollar that you own   by doing this you wo n't spend rent money at the bar and you wo n't spend the car insurance money on a vacation i 've written before about the details on how some of these software packages work   to answer your question about double entry accounting some software packages do use true double entry accounting gnucash ledger and some do not ynab everydollar mvelopes   in my opinion double entry accounting is an unnecessary complication for personal finances   if you do n't already know what double entry accounting is stick with one of the simpler solutions

if you 're getting the same total amount of money every year then the main issue is psychological i mean you may find it easier to manage your money if you get it on one schedule rather than another it 's generally better to get money sooner rather than later if you can deposit it into an account that pays interest or invest it between now and when you need it then you 'll come out ahead but realistically if we 're talking about getting money a few days or a week or two sooner that 's not going to make much difference if you get a paycheck just before the end of the year versus just after the end of the year there will be tax implications if the paycheck is delayed until january then you do n't have to pay taxes on it this year of course you 'll have to pay the taxes next year so that could be another case of sooner vs later but it can also change your total taxes because in the us and i think many other countries taxes are not a flat percentage but the more you make the higher the tax rate so if you can move income to a year when you have less total income that can lower your total taxes but really the main issue would be how it affects your budgeting others have discussed this so i wo n't repeat

as for the letting the wise people only make the decisions i guess that would be a bit odd in the long run especially when you get more experienced or when you do n't agree with their decision what you could do is make an agreement that always 3/4 + of the partners must agree with an investment this promotes your involvement in the investments and it will also make the debate about where to invest more alive fun and educational as for the taxes i ca n't give you any good advice as i do n't know how tax business stuff works in the us here in the netherlands we have several business forms that each have their own tax savings the savings mostly depend on the amount of money that is involved some forms are better for small earnings 80k or less other forms only get interesting with large amounts of money 100k or more apart from the tax savings there could also be some legal technical reasons to choose a specific form again i do n't know the situation in your country so maybe some other folks can help a final tip if your also doing this for fun try to use this investment company to learn from this might come in handy later

if you have a huge disparity in incomes maybe    if you make roughly in the same ballpark    the ability to file separately and have one partner the higher earner itemize and claim all the home related deductions while the other takes the standard deduction is one of the greatest middle class loopholes in modern tax law   when married even if filing separately you have to both itemize or both take the standard deduction    you just need to take care that the person itemizing has provably contributed at least the amount they claim toward the house   so have one of you write the checks for the mortgage and property tax and the other pay for everything else and it 'll probably come out roughly even over time   going back to my first line the us tax code seems to be designed around the reed 1950s household with a single earner   the closer you are to equal the bigger the marriage tax penalty gets

you most definitely can invest such an amount profitably but it makes it even more important to avoid fees um at all costs because fees tend to have a fixed component that will be much worse for you than for someone investing € 200k so   edit the above assumes that you actually want to invest in the long run for modest but relatively certain gains maybe 5 above inflation while accepting temporary downswings of up to 30 if those € 2000 are funny money that you do n't mind losing but would be really excited about maybe getting 100 return in less than 5 years well feel free to put them into an individual stock of an obscure small company but be aware that you 'd be gambling not investing and you can probably get better quotes playing roulette

if your counterparty sent money to a correspondent account at another bank then it is completely up to the other bank what to do with the money if the wire transfer completed then the account is not closed if i were your business partner i would immediately contact the bank to which the transfer was made and explain the situation and hopefully they will transfer the money back whenever a wire transfer is made the recipients name address and account number are included if that name address and account do not belong to you then you have a problem because you have no legal right to the money in a court of law for this reason you should be avoid any situation where you are wiring money to anyone except the intended recipient

emv cards use an offline transaction counter to increase security this counter is maintained inside the card and every time a transaction is confirmed by the card for online contact transactions the card will usually receive feedback from its issuer which among other actions will reset that counter to zero for offline transactions the card will increment the counter by one each time it is used for contactless transactions things are a bit different since contactless transactions usually do not maintain a connection between the card and the terminal long enough to transmit issuer feedback to the card the counter can not be reset that way the counter will therefore even be for online transactions the implications of this are dependent on what your issuer is actually doing with the contents of the offline counter some issuers use this as a safety measure for contactless cards and allow only a limited number of contactless transactions since those usually do not require any cardholder verification method below a certain threshold e.g. 25 € in many european countries and the total risk in case of physical card theft can therefore be limited to < number of offline contactless transaction usually you would have to use your card in a contact based transaction to reset the counter and the terminal would display an according notice it is indeed strange that the terminal instead requested your pin if this happens again you could try to use your card once via the contact interface and see if this resets your offline counters and allows you to pay without pin entry for the next few transactions

by your own logic this may not work tax cuts which are matched by government spending cuts will have an immediate negative effect on the economy as government spending contributes a very sizeable chunk of the gdp and employs a not at all insignificant workforce   thus for the net total economic growth to compensate at the very least that entire tax cuts has to be spent in the economy preferably in sectors where the income velocity of money is the highest income velocity has often been proven to be the highest among the low income sections while the lowest among the high income sections for example if the corporate tax cuts is just invested as share buybacks the net velocity is tiny even though share prices will increase   what proof do you really have that this will not be case let alone 35 years even recent data has shown that increasing the monetary supply to corporate america does not really translate to sustained gdp growth as the money velocity remains abysmal this has been demonstrated both on a state level in kansas and in a slightly different way at the federal level through our experience with quantitative easing

why will they find financing when they leave the euro why would their currencies not simply due to excessive issuance in an attempt to devalue which is worse for unemployment austerity or hyperinflation   be expelled by germany   this is a union correct why do you assume germany holds all the cards i 've read that lira essay and have read mish about everyday since 2009 yet still do not think it is so obvious that the euro will collapse   i gained quite a bit of skepticism from barry 's paper on the breakup of the euro papers   what i see right now is that so far the ecb has only acted in such a way as to prevent outright deflation and meet its 2 inflation target but not to continuously outright fund the profligate governments they let the bond markets force those governments into contraction or into default whereas the fed with its dual mandate will always buy the us bonds and eventually will inflate the currency as opposed to having a sovereign default   so i think we will see the ecb continue to print as much is needed to meet its mandate but at the same time there will be defaults bank and failures and a continued lack of growth in the euro area until eventually the austerity measures bring revenue and spending in line at which point the countries under heavy debt would be stupid not to default because they can self finance   whereas in the us we are so dependent on deficit financing that as foreigners move further away from holding treasuries we become more susceptible to bond taking the reigns which will force the feds hand into outright monetization then i think we will see our own government exacerbate inflation by bidding on the same goods that those dollars which no longer are going into treasuries are bidding on then i think we 'll finally see bad inflation in the us   of course as long as there is of money fleeing europe for the us safe haven the lack of foreign treasury investment is pretty moot    spelling

wealth is not distributed equally in any economy   and even if it were differentiation between people would lead to different interests being expressed in different ways as people either attempt to earn more to improve their situation or different people express those interests in different ways saving money to go on a holiday or to put a downpayment on a house people invite new products and services to be created to satisfy those demands in addition there is the problem of uncertainty   people save money today to cope with uncertainty tomorrow healthcare pensions education etc those savings do n't remain idle but are lent to others who believe that they can make a return through investing in new businesses or ideas the point being that any dynamic economy will experience change in the amount of goods available to the people within that economy from an economic perspective growth is just another   from a political perspective growth implies that people are getting wealthier   if that growth is distributed e.g. the poor do n't experience it and the middle classes do n't feel they get enough of it then that is a problem for politicians the emerging markets of the world are trying to raise millions of people out of poverty   growth is a way of measuring how quickly they are achieving that end growth in and of itself is meaningless   there are some people who believe that we as some proxy of society have enough stuff and growth is unnecessary but that implies that everyone is satisfied   for as long as some people wish to have more wealth stuff and have the means to achieve this there will be growth and for as long as there is uncertainty growth will vary

i started a company that 's in the process of trying to become an sec approved funding portal as defined by this act   that being said i obviously think it was a good thing overall it 's going to be much easier for companies to raise money however i think it 's also going to be much more difficult find good investments there 's a chance that it might fuel a bubble similar to the dotcom bubble in the late early 00 's that 's if it takes off i have some doubts that it will really change the landscape a whole lot even though it 's now legal you still do n't see startups hedge funds etc soliciting investments at least i do n't   some of the relaxing of sox requirements is interesting but i do n't think that really does anything but just defer the inevitable there are quite a few private companies that are already sox compliant simply because if they go public or get purchased by a public company that can be a big advantage   the increasing of shareholders of record from 500 to 2,000 is irrelevant really one shareholder of record can sell portions of their interest to as many people as they want see goldman sachs and facebook   making equity investments in startups available to regular joe 's is a good thing overall it allows the possibility that someone making $ 50k per year to invest in a company that could in the long run boost them up a tax bracket or two the flipside of that is that i still believe most of the us to be financially illiterate there 's a possibility of abuse the sec is currently writing rules to try and stem that but there will still be people who do it hopefully it 's not too bad   lifting the ban on general solicitation is in general a good thing for startups i think this might be advantageous but wo n't be used very much part of the reason startups choose the investors they do if they 're smart is for what value that person or people bring to the table besides cash if i 'm a startup and i need some money i 'm giving up a portion of my baby to someone i want to make sure that person is smart and on the same page with me i 'm not going to settle for just anyone it 's important to remember that even if that person has one share they still get a vote and a say in how i run my company   tl;dr overall i think it 's going to be good it 's not going to be quite as radical as most people think there will be some abuses of the new laws and regs but that comes with the territory

hsa 's are one of the few accounts where the money is both tax free going in and coming out for long term savings the only account that might beat that is a 401(k with an employer match unlike an fsa the money can stay in the account indefinitely you can also use the money to pay medical insurance premiums once you separate from the employer an hsa combines the best features of a fsa roth account and account as such i think there is rarely a reason not to max one out and in fact i think it is worth it to go out of your way to get access to one there are some drawbacks of course if you do n't use the money for medical expenses it may be taxed and perhaps penalized getting access to one can be tricky you have to be covered by an hdhp but not by a non hdhp nor by an fsa the low contribution limits make it hard to build up a large balance many providers charge a monthly fee of $ 1 to $ 4 if you want to invest the balance small but it adds up especially given the low balance per previous sentence

when you hear advice to buy index funds that usually comes with two additional pieces of investment discipline advice that are important these two elements are important to give you relative predictability in your outcome 20 years from now   in this old blog post of mine i linked to warren buffett talking about this also   mentioned it in a comment on another answer it 's perfectly plausible to do poorly over 20 years if you buy 100 stocks at once without dollar cost averaging or rebalancing it 's very very very plausible to do poorly over 10 years such as the last 10 in fact can you really say you know your financial situation in 20 30 years and for sure wo n't need that money because predictability is important i like buying a balanced fund and not pure stocks http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ feel a little bad linking to my blog but all that into this answer seems dumb here 's another tip you can go one step past dollar cost averaging and try value averaging however chances are you are n't even going to be good about rebalancing if it 's done by hand so personally i would not do value averaging unless you can find either a fund or a financial advisor to do it for you automatically finance buff blog makes a case for a financial advisor in case you like that more than my balanced fund suggestion like rebalancing value averaging makes you buy more when you 're depressed about the market and less when it 's exciting it 's hard   dollar cost averaging is easily done by setting up automatic investment of course so you do n't have to do it manually in the way you would with value averaging if you read the usual books on index funds and efficient markets it 's easy to remember the takeaway that nobody knows whether the market will go up or down and yes you wo n't successfully time the market but what you can do successfully is use an investment discipline with risk control assume that the market will fluctuate that both up and down are likely and possible and optimize for predictability in light of that most importantly optimize to take your emotions and behavior out of the picture some disciplines for example are there are dozens out there many of them snake oil i think these i mentioned are valid anyway you need some form of risk control and putting all your money in stocks at once does n't give you a lot of risk control there 's no real need to get creative a balanced fund that uses index funds for equity and bond portions is a great choice

direct roll overs trustee to trustee transfers are typically initiated by the receiving institution therefore you need to work with vanguard they will have a form in which you provide them with your fidelity account info and they will then contact fidelity and initiate the transfer   do not take the option of being sent a check made out to you by fidelity an indirect rollover there are too many ways to up and get hit with penalties if you are the middleman in the process i believe in most if not all cases the irs now requires a 20 withholding on indirect 401k rollovers this is because too many times people would initiate a roll over but not complete it either at all or within the allowed 60 day window and then come tax time be unable to pay the tax and penalty on the distribution the tricky part of that withholding is that you still have to deposit that amount into the new account otherwise it becomes a distribution subject to tax and penalties and that means coming up with the money from other accounts so in summary talk to vanguard and set up an institution to institution transfer they souls make this very easy as they want your money and do not do any kind of rollover where you come into personal possession of the money   if the check is made out to vanguard but sent to you to to vanguard that should not be an issue as that is still a trustee to trustee transfer   fidelity may have a minor account closer fee that will be deducted from the value of the account before it is sent

in financial markets the gains you can expect to make whether in the form of dividends or capital gains correspond to the risks you are bearing   there are a variety of reits but you can expect to make only as much money in them as you bear risk meaning you can also lose a lot of money in the ones that earn a lot   in that sense they are just like other financial assets like stocks if you are generically trying to increase your wealth by bearing risk you can get a better risk reward ratio in a fully diversified portfolio including stocks and bonds as well and reits   passive income means making money by bearing risk   reits alone without diversifying into other financial assets do a poor job of generating income for the amount of risk you bear so why are reits not very comparable to buying a house and renting it out   because in the latter case you are being paid not only for bearing the risk of the house depreciating but also you are being compensated for the work you do as a landlord   moreover because the house does n't trade in a liquid market like reits do it is possible to actually get a good deal as opposed to the fair deal you will get on a reit tl;dr the passive income generated by reit investment is more similar to generic equity bond investment than it is to an investment in a physical home that you rent out   if what you want is to make money without doing anything besides bear risk you should invest in a fully diversified portfolio of financial assets equity and bonds being the primary constituents but reits potentially being a part as well

if you pay off a debt through a collections agency it will damage your credit   here 's an alternative approach   settling a $ 10 k loan for $ 2 k shows the lender is keen to settle    instead of paying the collections agency negotiate with the lender and agree to pay 2 k to settle provided that they agree to this could be a win win for both   the lender gets to keep full 2 k without having to pay the collection agency a fat commission and your credit is n't damaged not saying this will always work but worth a try    pro tip get everything in writing before you pay anything

regarding some major holes in the atlantic article   one mining became the norm underground rather than advance retreat mining it massively advanced the productive output of the industry and required far less workforce this was the central cause of the drop to the coal industry workforce before the 1990s thereafter a of prices competition attacks on the working class unions of new energy sources etc and other factors were the mixture which reduced the workforce    two strip mining and type coal lower workforce necessary in the western coal region also played a role rather than the demands of underground mining mostly but also type coal concentrated in the east higher workforce necessary key to remember that this move from eastern to western coal production while reducing the workforce was a major drive by the coal bosses in the 90s through the 2000s a major aspect was that this was a campaign by the owners bosses seeking to side step the and unions labor costs health dental the eastern mines were union but out west the union movement in the coal industry unfortunately never had broad modern success moments of greatness occurred in the western organizing battles some great nation some good locals in colorado too a few ut battles one in particular which was lead by miners who were originally from mexico but no where near like east of the mississippi    anyone who worked or even lived near the industry lived in or western coal could have told the young atlantic author or the stanford institute fellow just about all of this driving around rural west virginia pa or kentucky you can occasionally see the old advance retreat joy miner machinery the old timers often times are glad to share heaps of the proud labor history of the region and this industry much easier to make a buck via the atlantic by reading a couple academic reports check department of energy and bls statistical websites

it has little to do with money or finance   it 's basic neuroscience   when we get money our brains release read your money and your brain and receiving dividends is getting money   it feels good so we 're more likely to do it again what you often see are because the above explanation sounds irrational so many people want to make their behavior look more rational   ceteris paribus a solid growth stock is as good as a solid company that pays dividends in value investing terms dividend paying stocks may appear to give you an advantage in that you can keep the dividends in cash and buy when the price of the security is low underpriced   however as you realize you could just sell the growth stock at certain prices and the effect would be the same assuming you 're using a free brokerage like robin hood you can easily sell just a portion of the shares periodically to get a    stream of cash like dividends that presents no problem whatsoever    so this can not be the explanation to why some people think it is    smart to be a dividend investor yes if you 're using a brokerage like robin hood there may be others but i think this is the only one right now then you are right on

there are lots of things to consider in addition to your questions   the rules changed in the us recently i think you mean you will save more money your interest rate is n't likely to go up but your principle will so you will earn more interest income than before    i would wager it wo n't be a significant amount however you can certainly earn a reward either cash back points miles or something else but the sticking point with earning things with your card is harder than before   due to rules changes merchants can now recuperate the fees they pay for accepting your credit card   rewards cards have a higher fee than non rewards cards because banks are n't in charities   so now depending on the merchant 's choice you could see a higher cost paying with a credit card or a debit card and that cost could wipe out your reward and if your card has a fee it has always been true that you need to evaluate the annual fee to confirm the benefit is more than paying for the fee additional advantages to credit cards

offset against taxable gains means that the amount $ 25 million in this case can be used to reduce another sum that the company would otherwise have to pay tax on suppose the company had made a profit of $ 100 million on some other investments at some point they are likely to have to pay corporation tax on that amount before being able to distribute it as a cash dividend to shareholders however if they can offset the $ 25 million then they will only have to pay tax on $ 75 million this is quite normal as you usually only pay tax on the aggregate of your gains and losses if corporation tax is about 32 that would explain the claimed saving of approximately $ 8 million it sounds like the plaintiffs want the stock to be sold on the market to get that tax saving presumably they believe that distributing it directly would not have the same effect because of the way the tax rules work i do n't know if the plaintiffs are right or not but if they are the difference would probably come about due to the stock being treated as a realized loss in the case where they sell it but not in the case where they distribute it it 's also possible though this is all very speculative that if the loss is n't realised when they distribute it directly then the cost basis of the shareholders would be the price the company originally paid for the stock rather than the value at the time they receive it that in turn could mean a tax advantage for the shareholders

i think the simple answer to your question is yes when you sell that drives down the price but it 's not like you sell and then the price goes down the price goes down when you sell you get the lower price   others have discussed the mechanics of this but i think the relevant point for your question is that when you offer shares for sale buyers now have more choices of where to buy from if without you there were 10 people willing to sell for $ 100 and 10 people willing to buy for $ 100 then there will be 10 sales at $ 100 but if you now offer to sell there are 11 people selling for $ 100 and 10 people buying for $ 100 the buyers have a choice and for a seller to get them to pick him he has to drop his price a little in real life the market is stable when one of those sellers drops his price enough that an 11th buyer decides that he now wants to buy at the lower price or until one of the other 10 buyers decides that the price has gone too low and he 's no longer interested in selling if the next day you bought the stock back you are now returning the market to where it was before you sold assuming that everything else in the market was unchanged you would have to pay the same price to buy the stock back that you got when you sold it your net profit would be zero actually you 'd have a loss because you 'd have to pay the broker 's commission on both transactions of course in real life the chances that everything else in the market is unchanged are very small so if you 're a typical small fry kind of person like me someone who might be buying and selling a few hundred or a few thousand dollars worth of a company that is worth hundreds of millions other factors in the market will totally swamp the effect of your little transaction so when you went to buy back the next day you might find that the price had gone down you can buy your shares back for less than you sold them and pocket the difference or the price might have gone up and you take a loss

short answer is to put the max 15 contribution into your espp long answer is that since you want to be saving as much as you can anyway this is a great way to force you to do it and pick up at least a 15 return every six months or however often your plan makes a purchase i say at least because sometimes an espp will give you the lower of the beginning or end period stock price and then a 15 discount off of that but check the details of your plan if you feel like your company 's stock is a good long term investment then hold onto the shares when purchased otherwise sell as soon as you get them and bank that 15 return

i 'm assuming you are buying bond mutual funds or bond etfs here not the actual bonds directly there are a significant variety of different types of bond funds reflecting the sort of bonds they invest in for example you can invest in risky non commercial grade bonds also known as junk bonds or you can invest in short term bonds which are much safer but return much less there 's no such thing as the average bond so let 's go for somewhere in the middle let 's go for 3 return after fees now it 's fairly simple math you want $ 3,000 a month or $ 36,000 a year to generate that sort of return you 'd need to invest $ if we are more optimistic we could go for a 4 return after fees that reduces your investment to $ 900,000 note that it would almost certainly not make sense to invest all that money in bonds instead you 'd want to invest in a mix of stocks and bonds this could likely reduce your risk while increasing your expected return

competition or actually lack of competition mostly due to a demand curve that has minimal change due to price you would buy the equivalent cheaper option if it was available but the store has little interest in offering multiple competing options that would drive their same store revenue down and the competing stores grocery department drug card have similar overhead costs floor space lights personnel most carry the cards for incremental revenue and observe little advantage to lower price for a card customers seldom buy more cards due to a lower price thus they mark the price to what most customers are willing to pay you may choose to shop the various stores and find the one that has a slightly better pricing for cards and then stop at that store when you want to buy a card but many cards are sold as an incremental purchase as part of a larger shopping trip convenience as the customer combines trips reduce the time spent shopping albeit not reducing the money spent

summary the phrase short sale circuit breaker rule normally refers to the sec 's recent adoption of a new version of the uptick rule the new uptick rule triggers a ban on short selling when the stock drops a certain amount the sec defines the process like this the circuit breaker is triggered for a security any day the price declines by 10 or more from the prior day 's closing price the alternative uptick rule which permits short selling only if the price of the security is above the current national best the rule applies to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day as well as the following day in general the rule applies to all equities 1 the national best bid is usually the bid price that you see in level 1 data    example if a stock closed at $ 100/share on monday the circuit breaker would be triggered if the stock traded at or below $ during tuesday 's session short selling would be disallowed until the start of trading on thursday unless the short sell price is above the national best bid i.e. on an uptick purpose the stated purpose of this rule is promote market stability and preserve investor confidence by restricting potentially abusive short selling from driving prices farther downward during periods of increased volatility and downward price pressure whether or not such rules succeed is a matter of some debate and the sec removed similar uptick rules in 2006 because they modestly reduce liquidity and do not appear necessary to prevent manipulation exceptions there are a few exceptions to the uptick rule that mainly revolve around when the short sell order was placed or when the securities will be delivered

my experience is in economics so it may differ from an accounting or personal finance perspective somewhat that being said i find it perfectly acceptable to use a term like cagr when the rate is positive or negative economists talk about negative growth rates all the time and it 's universally assumed that growth rates can be positive or ideally the actual magnitude and sign of the value should be specified by the value itself the term whether it 's growth rate some modified version of it like cagr or any label in a table or on a graph should describe the calculation or source used obtain the value i should n't need the name to indicate the sign of the number if the number is present the name is only there to help me understand the value unfortunately i do n't know of any specific term that represents the geometric averaging nature of cagr and also eliminates the minor potential for semantic confusion however i think the minor problem of semantics needs to be balanced against the tradeoff of using a different term that is n't as common if one were to exist cagr is a standard well known term that a allows someone who is familiar with the term to instantly understand the procedure you 're using and b allow someone who is n't familiar with it to quickly search and find an explanation since searching for cagr will numerous simple explanations of how it 's calculated 1 this is different from the concept of economic growth which is usually assumed to be positive in informal discussions in economic modeling many of the first steps in creating a model are symbolic anyway so growth rate change in output and economic growth are used interchangeably to describe changes in gdp because the values either are n't known irrelevant until later in the project or pulled from data that describes it using one or several of the previously stated terms

thanks for the writeup it was a really informative read i 've been aware for a while now that reagan and were in a large way the start of most of the current problems in the economic and political landscape but you filled in a few gaps that were really useful for me   so i guess ultimately a lot of conservatives see it as a kind of necessary evil in order to bring about the success story that the current economy needs right now unfortunately their strategy is totally wrong that kind of makes sense with my observation that rather than supporting the cronyism and corruption they turn a blind eye to it because they think it 's necessary   my view is not so much that labour and finance capital returns need to be balanced although that is probably a great thing to aim for but that creation of wealth capital needs to be intrinsically linked with the creation of real value the modern banking crisis was a great example of the ability to generate wealth while in fact destroying real value

you may be missing how countries like canada may have oil be more of the gdp than countries like the us in canada the lower oil prices may mean more of an economic slowdown with oil companies laying off staff canceling projects and some companies probably going under as some provinces like alberta are highly dependent on oil prices to drive most of the economy in contrast the us is n't quite as rich in energy sources and thus may not have the same issues would be my guess context matters here if the rate change helps everybody does n't that include the oil producing companies i 'd like to think so using basic logic what if the main reason for lowering rates was the economic fallout of the decrease in oil prices consider that the there would be the question of why do this now that has to be answered and the only main change is lower oil prices on a macroeconomic level

etiquette or not it is hurting the seller the transaction fees have usually minimums so if the actual transaction is below the minimum they 'll pay larger fee on the transaction relatively as an example assume minimum fee for a debit card swipe is 20 cents or 2 of the transaction for a transaction of $ 10 and above the fee will be 2 of the transaction but for $ the fee becomes 12 of the transaction 6 times more expensive for the seller basically the sale was most likely at a loss for them they usually have very low margins especially for a dollar store so take that into account as well

having been in exactly this position not in a debt hole built a budget to get a better view of what spending is i can say what the greatest gift it brings is it 's a decision tool when you are spending out of only one account you often make decisions based on the total money in the account should we go out for dinner can i make this impulse purchase this is terrible because many if not all of those dollars are already intended for certain future expenses like groceries bills etc you ca n't see how many of those dollars are discretionary a budget is like having many accounts instead of looking at your real account(s to make spending decisions you look at your budget lines you to want impulse buy a gadget do you have money remaining in a relevant budget line if yes the decision is yours if no the budget is telling you that you do n't have dollars for that similarly for more purchases you want to splurge on some non staple groceries to make a fancy dinner or try out a new recipe and the budget line for groceries will tell you if you can do that instead of looking at e.g. $ 6000 in a chequing account you 're looking at $ 600 assigned $ spend = $ available in a monthly groceries budget line just like you can now see where your money has been going by maintaining and using your budget lines and having every single dollar you spend go through the budget to show your totally assigned total spent and total remaining you can continue to see where your money is going in near real time you 're no longer looking at bills and statements to figure out what 's going on and plan you 're looking at money flows and future intentions as you should be this approach to budgeting has completely changed our finances so that 's what a budget is for real time spending decision making control over your money which for us has translated into a lovely mix of painless austerity in spending categories where austerity is smart and guilt free spending in more categories because we have already determined exactly how much we can afford and wish to spend a budget line with insufficient funds does n't actually take the decision entirely away from you though if a budget line does n't have funds to spare for a given purchase you can still make the purchase but now you 're also making the decision to go and revise your budget taking dollars away from other budget lines to adjust the line you 've overspent to keep the budget accurate

i believe this argument is most often used when considering which debts to pay back first or when there are other options available such as investment options building up an emergency fund or saving for a large purchase   in that case it 's simply justifying making minimum payments and paying more over the life of the loan in exchange for larger liquidity in the present unfortunately when it comes to choosing between which debts to pay e.g. my mom pays more than the minimum on her car because she ca n't deduct auto loan interest despite her mortgage carrying a higher interest rate it 's only beneficial if the tax savings offsets the interest savings difference the formula for that is tax bracket > 1 target loan interest rate mortgage interest rate that said most people do n't think in the long term either by natural or by necessity need to have an emergency fund

i could be wrong but i doubt you 're going to be able to roll the current mortgage into a new one the problem is that the bank is going to require that the new loan is fully collateralized by the new house   so the only way that you can ensure that is if you can construct the house cheaply enough that the difference between the construction cost and the end market value is enough to cover the current loan and keep the loan to value ltv low enough that the bank is secured so say you currently owe $ 40k on your mortgage and you want to build a house that will be worth $ 200k in order to avoid pmi you 're going to have to have an ltv of 80 or less which means that you can spend no more than $ 160k to build the house   if you want to roll the existing loan in now you have to build for less than $ 120k and there 's no way that you can build a $ 200k house for $ 120k unless you live in an area with very high land value and hire the builders directly and even then it may not be possible otherwise you 're going to have to make up the difference in cash when you tear down a house you are essentially throwing away the value of the house when you have a mortgage on the house you throw away that value plus you still owe the money which is a difficult hole to climb out of a better solution might be to try and sell the house as is perhaps to someone else who can tear down the house and rebuild with cash if that is not a viable option or you do n't want to move then you might consider a home equity loan to renovate parts of the house provided that they increase the market value enough to justify the cost e.g. modernize the kitchen add on a room remodel bathrooms etc so it all depends on what the house is worth today as is how much it will cost you to rebuild and what the value of the new house will be

i thought the line is much than that though say you have a company with divisions an overseas division makes an item sells it to another division overseas for final packaging then it 's sold domestically the domestic division should only pay taxes on the profits they earn and overseas on the profits from what they ship    but the company only wants to pay minimal taxes so they set the foreign price high so that a majority of profits are made overseas who will argue that this is n't correct is n't that it it 's not foreign sales but markup

yes but note that some credit card companies let you create virtual cards you can define how much money is on them and how long they last   if you 're worried about a site you can use such a card to make the payment then get rid of the virtual number so nobody can do dirty deeds with it in practice however companies that do this are going to get on hard by the credit card companies other than outright scams it basically does not happen   hacking is another matter just pick up the newspaper   it 's not exactly unusual to read of hackers getting access to credit card information that they were n't supposed to have access to in the first place so long as you deal with a company that 's been around for a while the risk is trivial

that something you are signing means you are liable for the mortgage payments yes all of them if he ca n't or wo n't pay at any point   the limit on what the bank will lend him based on his salary is there for a reason they do n't expect him to be able to keep up repayments if they lend him more or more precisely there 's a big risk that he wo n't do n't forget that even if he up and down to you that he can afford them interest rates can rise this is a 25 or 30 year commitment you would be making interest rates are at a historic low and the only way from here is up in my living memory rates have been 12 or even 15 as a very rough rule of thumb for every £ 100k borrowed every additional 1 on the interest rates costs an additional £ 100 on your monthly payment   also the transitional arrangement is not without its own fees and the bank wo n't let him simply take you off the mortgage unless they are convinced he can keep up the repayments on his own which they clearly are n't also thanks to for the additional good point that being on the hook for your friend 's mortgage will prevent you from being able to get a mortgage yourself while the liability still exists or at least severely limit your options no matter how many times you protest but i 'm not paying any money for that it wo n't help   another point there are various schemes available to help first time buyers by signing up for this you would exclude yourself from any of those schemes in the future

i see a couple of ways of getting at this   one would be to switch to a vat   that would capture a good amount of revenue on anything that 's made here   second i want ip to be taxed   we pay property taxes so i think that trademarks and copyrighted works should be taxed just like how real property is taxed   you want to register the burger king logo in the us   sure thing   you will pay a percentage of its value every year and you get to use it exclusively with the full protection of the us courts your taxes help fund   i also see this as a good way out of the ip we 're currently in   copyright has become unreasonably long mostly because disney does n't want to lose the rights to mickey mouse   look i am sympathetic to disney 's argument   mickey genuinely is important to them   but mickey is fucking things up for everyone else   so i think disney should pay a percentage of mickey 's value every year   in exchange they keep their copyright forever as long as they keep paying   now if the copyright tax is n't paid then the property becomes public domain forever   this would let disney have what they want while non profitable copyrights become public domain as they should   anyhow the one thing all the big tax avoiding companies have in common is ip   if you tax their ip in exchange for protection in us courts there 's really no way around that   they will either have to pay or let their ip go public domain

ponder this suppose that a reputable company or government were to come out and say hey we are going to issue some 10 year bonds at 6.4 anyone interested in buying some assume that the company or government is financially solid and there is zero chance that they will go bankrupt think those bonds would sell would you be interested in buying such a bond well i would wager that these bonds would sell like despite the fact that the long term stock market return beats it by a half percent heck vanguard 's junk bond fund is hot right now it only yields 4.9 and those are junk bonds not rock solid companies see vanguard high yield corporate bond fund every time you make an extra principal payment on your student loan you are effectively purchasing a investment with a rock solid guaranteed 6.4 return for 10 years or whatever time you have left on the loan if make no extra payments on top of that paying off a loan early builds your credit reputation improves your monthly cash flow once the loan is paid may increase your purchasing power for a house or car and if nothing else it frees you from being a slave to that debt payment every month   edit improved wording based on ross 's comment

its called a grace period and you are not paying interest on the 0 bt you are paying interest on the amount you spent in purchases if you do not pay your balance in full by the due date your grace period ends this means that you have to pay interest on the purchased amount from the day it is made this is why when you do a balance transfer the card should be put in the sock drawer until the bt is paid off in order to restore the grace period you must pay the balance in full and the grace period will start during the next payment cycle lets assume statement cuts on the 1st and due date is the 20th you make the minimum payment of $ 10 balance now is $ 100 since you have a balance of $ 100 from the previous statement and a new purchase of $ 50.00 when the next statement cuts you will have to pay interest according to the terms on the $ 50.00 portion in order to get the grace period back you will have to pay in full and wait for the next cycle in case i did not explain it well here is a quote from dot com website the cost of carrying a balance    this is because carrying a balance of    any size into the next billing cycle means there is no grace period on    your purchases during that cycle the card company will begin charging    interest on your purchases the day you make them so leaving even $ 1    in unpaid balance on your card will cost you considerably more than    the measly finance charges on that dollar to see how this works let 's consider an imaginary card user named    sally she 's so happy she got a new credit card that she charges    $ 1,500 in purchases on the first day of her monthly billing cycle    after the cycle ends sally pays off the entire $ 1,500 by the due    date wiping her balance to zero as a result her purchases during    the second month are also free of interest she has used her grace    period wisely to avoid finance charges what happens if sally leaves just $ 1 of her balance from the first    month unpaid that $ 1 begins to accrue interest starting the first day    of the billing cycle it 's just $ 1 so the interest is not a big deal    but because she used up her grace period without paying off her entire debt her new purchases during the second month also start to    get hit with interest charges immediately starting the day of the    transaction assuming she makes another $ 1,500 in purchases at the    average annual interest rate of about 13 percent that means $ 16 in    finance charges for the month if sally repeats this pattern the    interest costs add up to $ 190 over the course of a year

your question has a built in faulty premise   assuming a person knows how to use and invest their money wisely i 'd ask if you were wise enough to beat the investments offered in your 401(k after expenses and with respect to the potential tax savings   then since i 'm a proponent of deposit to the match even if you have to eat rice and beans to find the cash to do i 'll extend the question to ask if you can beat the choices taking the match into account   401(k your $ 1000 starts as $ 1500 and has a tax due on withdrawal years later you start with $ 750 after the tax and might spend a decade before hitting $ 1500   start your own company that might be another story but to invest in the market and still beat the matched 401(k takes a bit more wisdom than i 'd claim to have

if you were certain you would probably do best by short selling an etf that tracked the index for the market you think was about to tank you 'd certainly make a lot more money on that strategy than precious metals if you were feeling super confident and want to make your money earn even more you could also buy a bunch of put options on those same etf funds obligatory warning short selling and options can be extremely risky while most investments cap your potential losses to your total investment a short sale has no theoretical limit to the amount of money you can lose

the credit and debit terms here is talking from bank 's point of view should n't be a surprise banks are never known to look at things from the customers pov   in accounting a liability loans owners capital etc is a credit balance and asset cash buildings and such is a debit balance   your account is a liability to the bank in accounting parlance that is because they owe you every single penny that is there in your account btw in literal parlance too if you really make their life harder   so when the bank accepts money from you they need to increase their asset cash which they will debit higher debit balance for asset means more assets and at the same time they also have to account for the added liability by crediting the deposited money into your account so when bank says they have credited your account it means you have more money in your account now if you transfer money from your account to another or make a payment through your account your account will be debited and the beneficiary account will be 's liability towards you reduces more or less what everyone else said here but hey i could also take a swipe at banks

there are two reasons why most options are n't exercised   the first is obvious and the second less so the obvious an option that 's practically worthless does n't get exercised options that reach expiry and remain unexercised are almost always worthless bets that simply did n't pay off this includes calls with strikes above the current underlying price and puts with strikes below it a heck of a lot of options if an option with value was somehow left to expire it was probably a mistake or else the transaction costs outweighed the value remaining not quite worthless but not worth it either the less obvious an option with value can be cancelled any time before expiration a trader that buys an option may at some point show a gain sooner than anticipated or a loss in excess of his tolerance if a gain he may want to sell before expiry to realize the gain sooner similarly if a loss he may want to take the loss sooner in both cases his capital is freed up and he can take another position and this is the key part the other end matched up with that option sale is often a buyer that had created written exactly such an option contract in the first place the option writer and who is looking to get out of his position option writers are the traders responsible in the first place for creating options and increasing the open interest   anybody with the right kind and level of options trading account can do this a trader that writes an option does so by instructing his broker to sell to open a new instance of the option the trader then has a short position negative quantity in that option and all the while may be subject to the obligations that match the option 's exercise rights the only way for the option writer to get out of that short position and its obligations are these not by choice   to get assigned that is to say a buyer exercised the option the writer has to fulfill his obligation by delivering the underlying if a call to the option holder or buying the underlying if a put from the option holder not by choice the option expires worthless this is the ideal scenario for a writer because 100 of the premium received less transaction costs is profit by choice the writer is free to buy back exactly the same kind of option before expiry using a buy to close order with their broker once the option has been purchased with a buy to close it eliminates the short position and obligation   the option is cancelled   the open interest declines options thus cancelled just do n't live long enough to either expire or be exercised

the key word you forgot to include from slide 29 is free riding investopedia defines free riding as in the context of a brokerage firm a free rider problem refers to a situation where a client has been allowed to purchase shares without actually paying for them and then subsequently sells the shares ideally for profit the problem with this scenario is that the client if allowed to free ride can profit from a stock trade without actually using any of his or her own capital this is illegal i have not heard of any issues with this type of action being a problem with trading accounts in australia nor have i been able to find any such rules on the asx website or any of by brokers websites so i think this may be an issue in the usa but not australia you should check the rules in any other countries you wish to trade in

remember that in most news outlets journalists do not get to pick the titles of their articles   that 's up to the editor   so even though the article was primarily about etfs the reporter made the mistake of including some tangential references to mutual funds   the editor then saw that the article talked about etfs and mutual funds and knowing even less about the subject matter than the reporter but recognizing that more readers eyeballs would be attracted to a headline about mutual funds than to a headline about etfs went with the shocking headline about the former in any case as you already pointed out etfs need to know their value throughout the day as do the investors in that etf   even momentary outages of price sources can be disastrous although mutual funds do not generally make transactions throughout the day and fund investors are not typically interested in the fund 's nav more than once per day the fund managers do n't just sit around all day doing nothing and then press a couple buttons before the market closes   they do watch their nav very closely during the day and think very carefully about which buttons to press at the end of the day   if their source of stock price data goes offline then they 're impacted almost as severely as if less visibly than an etf asking yahoo for prices seems straightforward but 1 you get what you pay for and 2 these fund companies are built on massive automated that expect to receive their data from a certain source in a certain way at a certain time   and they pay a lot of money in order to be able to expect that   it would be quite difficult to just feed in manual data although in the end i suspect some of these companies did just that   either they fell back to a secondary data supplier or they manually constructed datasets for their programs to consume

insiders are prevented from buying or selling shares except at certain periods right after information is disclosed publicly but people have bills to pay and kids to put through college and whatnot so an insider can set up a plan where shares are sold on a specific schedule and they have no control over number of shares or timing these plans covered under rule 1 allow insiders to generate cash flow without benefiting from their inside information sales under these plans can mostly be ignored when trying to figure out the fortunes of a company from insider trades

yup   it 's important to note that modern soft contact lenses let through 10 times as much oxygen as the original hard contacts that were in use 20 years ago   the company you referenced that 's actually owned run by the original inventor of soft contact daily lenses   he started it up because he was outraged at the prices being charged by the big name vendors who had licensed his patent   his story is here     two important things about re using dailies   1 do n't leave dailies in overnight buy solution and take them out and wash them each night   it really makes a difference in terms of complication rates   you do n't have to fill the contact holders up to the top not even to the internal line but make sure the contacts are covered   the latter will save you half on solution   when i 'm on a wilderness trip i will wear my contacts through every other night because trying to wash my hands completely and the sanitary conditions well it 's just less risk and trouble imho than handling my contacts with potentially not quite perfectly clean hands   2 do n't use a single pair more than 2 or 3 weeks   the risk of infections and complications gets too high using a single pair of general soft contacts around the one month mark   this is my recollection of what a medical doctor at an er near a university posted online 10 years ago   you see university kids are far more likely prone to over use a pair and he found that all the kids coming to his nearby er with eye infections had worn soft contacts for one month or more   also if you 're taking them out at night and using solution as i strongly recommend you do at the two week part the cost of daily contacts matches the cost of the solution you are using   so wearing a pair any longer than 2 weeks does n't actually save you much more money

i 'm not 100 certain on boats since they are n't typically sold for a gain but the tax base of an asset is typically the cost of the asset plus the cost of any improvements so your $ 15,000 gain looks right check with a cpa to be certain though if you can   your cost basis would be $ 50,000 + $ 25,000 = $ 75,000 and your net gain would be $ 90,000 $ 75,000 = $ 15,000   the result is the same but the arithmetic is organized a little differently i am fairly confident you can not include your time in the cost of improvements   if you incorporated and paid yourself for the time then the payment would be considered income and taxed if it was even allowed depending on your tax bracket that may be a worse option for you you can look at it this way you only pay the tax on the $ 15k gain versus paying someone else $ 15k to do the labor

i 'm a little confused on the use of the property today   is this place going to be a personal residence for you for now and become a rental later after the mortgage is paid off   it does make a difference if you can buy the house and a 100 ltv loan would cost less than 125 of comparable rent then buy the house put as little of your own cash into it as possible and stretch the terms as long as possible   scott w is correct on a number of counts   the cost of the mortgage is the after tax cost of the payments and when that money is put to work in a well managed portfolio it should do better over the long haul   do n't try for big gains because doing so adds to the risk that you 'll end up worse off if you borrow money at an after tax cost of 4 and make 6 after taxes you end up ahead and build wealth a vast majority of the wealthiest people use this arbitrage to continue to build wealth   they have plenty of money to pay off mortgages but choose not to   $ 200,000 at 2 is an extra $ 4000 per year   compounded at a 7 rate it adds up to $ 180k after 20 years not exactly chump change money in an investment account is accessible when you need it   money in home equity is not has a zero rate of return before inflation and is not accessible except through another loan at the bank 's whim   if you lose your job and your home is close to paid off but is n't yet you could have a serious liquidity issue now if a 100 mortgage would cost more than 125 of comparable rent then there should be no deal   you are looking at a crappy investment   it is cheaper and better just to rent   i do n't care if prices are going up right now   prices move around   just because canada has n't seen the value drops like in the us so far does n't mean it ca n't happen in the future   if comparable rents do n't validate the price with a good margin for profit for an investor then prices are and can not be trusted and you should lower your monthly costs by renting rather than buying   that $ 350 per month you could save in rent adds up just as much as the $ 4000 per year in arbitrage for rentals you should only pull the trigger when you can do the purchase without leverage and still get a 10 cap rate or higher rate of return after taxes insurance and other fixed costs   that way if the rental rates drop and again that is quite possible you would lose some of your profit but not all of it   if you leverage the property there is a high probability that you could wind up losing money as rents fall and you have to cover the mortgage out of nonexistent cash flow i know somebody is going to say but john 10 cap on rental real estate   that 's just not possible around here   that may be the case   it is possible somewhere   i have clients buying property in arizona new mexico alberta michigan and even california who are finding 10 cap rate properties   they do exist   they just are n't everywhere if you want to add leverage to the rental picture to improve the return then do so understanding the risks   he who lives by the leverage sword dies by the leverage sword   down here in the us the real estate market is littered with of people who thought they could handle that leverage sword   it is a gory ugly mess

a central bank typically introduces new money into the system by printing new money to purchase items from member banks   the central bank can purchase whatever it chooses   it typically purchases government bonds but the federal reserve purchased mortgage backed securities mbs during the 2008 panic since the fed was the only one willing to pay full price for mbs after the crash of 2008 the bank upon receipt of the new money can loan the money out   a minimum reserve ratio specifies how much money the bank has to keep on hand   a reserve ratio of 10 means the bank must have $ 10 for every $ 100 in loans as an example let 's say the fed prints up some new money to purchase some office desks from a member bank   it prints $ 10,000 to purchase some desks   the bank receives $ 10,000   it can create up to $ 100,000 in loans without exceeding the 10 minimum reserve ratio requirement    how would it do so   a customer would come to the bank asking for a $ 100,000 loan   the bank would create an account for the customer and credit $ 100,000 to the customer 's account   there is a problem however   the customer borrowed the money to buy a boat so the customer writes a check for $ 100,000 to the boat company   the boat company attempts to deposit the $ 100,000 check into the boat company 's bank   the boat company 's bank will ask the originating bank for $ 100,000 in cash   the originating bank only has $ 10,000 in cash on hand so this demand will immediately bankrupt the originating bank so what actually happens   the originating bank actually only loans out reserves 1 minimum reserve ratio so it can meet demands for the loans it originates    in our example the bank that received the initial $ 10,000 from the fed will only loan out $ 10,000 1 0.1 = $ 9,000   this allows the bank to cover checks written by the person who borrowed the $ 9,000   the reserve ratio for the bank is now $ which is 11 and is over the minimum reserve requirement   the borrower makes a purchase with the borrowed $ 9,000 and the seller deposits the $ 9,000 in his bank   the bank that receives that $ 9,000 now has an additional $ 9,000 in reserves which it will use to create loans of $ 9,000 1 0.1 = $    this continual fractional reserve money creation process will continue across the entire banking system resulting in $ 100,000 of new money created from $ 10,000 this process is explained very well here

as michael pryor answered a bond fund is a mutual fund that invests in bonds i 'd also consider an etf based on bonds to be a bond fund but i 'm not sure that all investors would consider these as bond funds not all bond funds are the same just like stock funds you can classify bond funds based on the issuer of the bonds you can also classify funds based on the time to maturity in general bond funds have lower risk and lower expected return than stock funds sometimes bond funds have price movements that are not tightly correlated to the price movements in the equity markets this can make them a decent hedge against declines in your equity investments see pryor 's answer for some info on how you can get tax free treatment for your bond fund investments

but do you know about a us state risking to go default now or in the past ultimately a us state could go into default   however i doubt that such a scenario would be allowed to this seems to happen to california with some   that is risking default   what would happen is not quite well known there is no provision for a state to go bankrupt said i do n't think anyone really knows what will happen or even if the state will go into if it does default i can tell you this officials are looking at all the current laws source i believe that the answer to your question is that it could happen but likely would not be allowed to occur   the nature of the eu and us are quite different   the individual states forming the us are not separate nations   for better or for worse the us is a stronger federation than the eu something that is at times when the feds mess with the of the locals

the best answer to this question will depend on you and your wife what is fair for some may not be fair for others some couples split expenses 50:50 some split proportionately based on income some pool everything together what works best for you will depend on your relative incomes your financial goals living standards and most importantly your personal beliefs here is a great question with various viewpoints how to organize bank accounts with wife it does n't touch heavily on home ownership pre agreements but might be a good starting point to getting you to think about your options consider providing another loan to your wife for additional investments in the home it seems you are both comfortable with the realities of the pre agreement one of those realities seems to be that in the event of divorce you would lose access to the house loaning money has the benefit of allowing for the improvements to be done immediately while clearly what you have spent on the home from what she has spent on the home however this may not be fair depending on how you both define the term have you discussed how expenses and savings would be split between you since there is no mortgage on the house she has effectively contributed her pre marital assets towards paying substantially all of your housing costs it may be fair for you to contribute to housing costs by at least splitting maintenance 50:50 or it may not be hopefully you talked about finances before you got married and if not now would be the best time to start i personally would hate to have an uneasy feeling about a relationship because i failed to openly communicate about finances

yes you incur income tax on the rsu on they date they vest at this point you own the actual shares and you can decide to sell them or to hold them if you hold them for the required period and sell them later the difference between your price at vesting and the sales price would be taxed as long term capital gains caution if you decide to hold you are still liable to pay income tax in the year they vest you have to pay taxes on income that you have n't made yet this is fairly dangerous if the stock goes down you may lose a lot of this tax payment technically you could recover some of this through claiming capital losses but that this is severely restricted the irs makes it much easier to increase taxes through gains than reducing taxes through losses

this is a tricky question because the financial aid system can create odd incentives good schools tend to price themselves above and beyond any reasonable middle class ability to save and then offer financial aid much of it in the form of internal grants or loans   if you think about it the internal grant is more of a discount than a grant since no money need have ever existed to fund the grant   the actual price to the parents is based on financial aid paperwork and related rules perhaps forming a college price setting cartel   it is these rules that need to be considered when creating a savings plan suppose it is $ 50k year to send your kids to the best school admitting them   that s $ 200k for the 4 years   suppose you had $ 50k now to save instead of $ 10 k and are wondering whether to put it in your son 's college savings whether or not you can do so in a tax advantaged way or to pay down the mortgage   if you put it in your kids savings and the $ 50k becomes $ 75k over time that $ 75k will be used up in a year and a half as the financial aid system will suck it dry first before offering you much help   on the other hand if you put the $ 50k on paying down the mortgage provided the mortgage is healthy not upside down your house payment will still be the same when your kids go to college   the financial aid calculations will consider that the kid has no savings and allocate a grant and some loans the first year and a parental portion that you might be able to tap with a home equity loan or work overtime      generally you should also be encouraging your kids to excel and perhaps obtain academic scholarships or at least obtain some great opportunities   a large college savings fund might be as counterproductive as a zero fund   they should n't be expecting to breeze through some party school with a nice pad and car homework assistance and beer money   unless they are good at a sport like maybe football in which case you wo n't need to be the provider it is not obvious how much the optimal esa amount is   it might not be $ 0   saving like crazy in there probably is n't the best thing to do either

auto insurance is a highly personalized item so depending on your driving record and other factors $ 600 a month for full coverage may be as good as you can get look at the premium for each category and consider raising the deductible if you have some savings that could be used in the event that you have a claim also you 're not only buying insurance to cover the other person 's damage and medical expenses you 're paying for insurance for your car   brand new cars are more expensive to replace and thus insure than used cars leasing is effectively renting a car for a long period of time while the payments are less when the lease expires you 're going to have to decide whether to give up the car or buying it usually at a price much higher than market value    i 'm glad you discovered that the insurance would break your budget before it 's too late   my suggestion would be to look for a 1 2 year old car that 's less expensive to buy and to insure

several options are available she may ask the us bank to issue a debit card visa most probably to her account and mail this card to russia i think this can be done without much problems though sending anything by mail may be unreliable after this she just withdraws the money from local atm some withdrawal fee may apply which may be rather big if the sum of money is big in big banks bank citibank russia etc are atms that allow you to withdraw dollars and it is better to use one of them to avoid unfavorable exchange rate she may ask the us bank to transfer the money to her russian account i assume the currency on the us bank account is us dollars she needs an us dollar account in any russian bank this is no problem at all   she should find out from that bank the transfer parameters for transfering us dollars to her account this should include among other info a bank correspondent and a swift code or may be two swift codes after this she should contact her us bank and find out how can she request the money to be transferred to her russian bank providing these transfer parameters i can think of two problems that may be here first the bank may refuse to transfer money without her herself coming to the bank to confirm her identity how do they know that a person writing or calling them is she indeed however i guess there should be some workaround for this second with current us sanctions against russia the bank may just refuse the transfer or will have do some additional investigations however i have heard that bank transfers from us to private persons to russia are not blocked probably it is good to find this out in advance in addition the us bank will most probably charge some standard fee for foreign transfer after this she should wait for a couple of days maybe up to week for the money to appear on russian account i have done this once some four years ago and had no problems though at that time i was in the us so i just came to the bank myself the bank employee to whom i talked obviously was unsure whether the transfer parameters were enough obviously this was a very unusual situation for her but she took the information from me and i guess just passed it on to someone more knowledgable the fee was something about $ 40 another option that i might think of is her us bank issuing and mailing her a check for the whole sum and she trying to cash it here in russia this is possible but very few banks do cash checks here citibank russia is among those that do the bank will also charge a fee and it will be comparable to transfer fee plus mailing anything is not quite reliable here she would also have to consider whether she need to pay russian taxes on this sum if the sum is big and passes through a bank i guess russian tax police may find this out through and question her if it is withdrawn from a visa card i think it will not be noticed but even in this case she might be required to file a tax herself

house as investment is not a good idea besides the obvious calculations do n't forget the property tax home maintenance costs and time insurance costs etc there are a lot of hidden drains on the investment value of the house most especially the time that you have to invest in maintaining it on the other hand if you plan on staying in the area having children pets or like do home improvements landscaping gardening auto repair wood metal shopping then a house might be useful to you also consider the housing market where you are this gets a bit more difficult to calculate but if you have a high demand rental market then the house might make sense as an investment if you can rent it out for more than your monthly cost including all of those factors above but being a landlord is not for everyone again more of your time invested into the house you have to be prepared to go months without renting it you may have to deal with crazy people that will totally trash your house and threaten you if you complain and you may need to part with some of the rent to a management company if you need their skills or time it sounds like you are just not that interested right now that 's fine do n't rush invest your money some other way i.e. the stock market more than likely when you are ready for a house or to bail your family out of trouble if that 's what you choose to do you 'll have even more assets to do either with

without knowing the details of your financial situation i can only offer general advice   it might be worth having a financial counselor look at your finances and offer some custom advice   you might be able to find someone that will do this for free by asking at your local church i would advise you not to try to get another loan and certainly not to start charging things to a credit card   you are correct when you called it a nightmare   you are currently struggling with your finances and getting further into debt will not help   it would only be a very short term fix and have long lasting consequences    what you need to do is look at the income that you have and prioritize your spending   for example your list of basic needs includes if you have other things that you are spending money on such as medical debt or other old debt that you are trying to pay off those are not as important as funding your basic needs above if there is anything you can do to reduce the cost of the basic needs do it   for example finding a cheaper place to live or a place closer to your job might save you money   perhaps accepting nutrition assistance from a local food bank or the salvation army is an option for you now about your car your transportation to your job is very much one of your basic needs as it will enable you to pay for your other needs   if you can use public transportation until you can get a working car again or you can find someone that will give you a ride that will solve this problem   if not you 'll need to get a working car you definitely do n't want to take out another loan for a car as you are already having trouble paying the first loan   i 'm guessing that it will be less expensive to get the engine repaired than it will be to buy a new car at this point   but that is just a guess   you 'll need to find out how much it will cost to fix the car and see if you can swing it by perhaps eliminating expenses that are n't necessary even for a short time   for example if you are paying installments on medical debt you might have to skip a payment to fix your car   it 's not ideal but if you are short on cash it is a better option than losing your job or taking out even more debt for your car alternatively buying another functional car if it costs less than fixing your current car is an option   if you do n't have the money to pay your current car loan payments you 'll lose your current car just to be clear many of these options will mess up your credit score   however borrowing more in an attempt to save your credit score will probably only put off the inevitable as it will make paying everything off that much harder   if you do n't have enough income to pay your debts you might be better off to just take the credit score ding get back on your feet and then work to eliminate the debt once you 've got your basic needs covered sorry to hear about your situation   again this advice is just general and might not all apply to your financial details   i recommend talking to the pastor of a local church and see if they have someone that can sit down with you and discuss your options

first off you have done very well to be in your financial position at your age congratulations   i first started investing seriously about 10 years ago and when i started i had a similar attitude to you learning how to invest is a journey and it will take you a while to learn both the intellectual and emotional sides of investing first off there is nothing wrong with having a chunk of cash that you are n't investing effectively it is far better to be losing earning power wrt inflation that it is to make a bad investment where you can lose all your money quite quickly i have perhaps 15 of my capital just sitting around right now because i do n't have any place where i 'm excited to put it for your ira i would look at the options you have and choose one that is reasonably well diversified and has low costs in most cases an index fund is a reasonable choice my 401 k goes into an s&p 500 index fund and i do n't have to worry about it beyond that i suggest spending some time learning about investing and then making some small and conservative investments i 've learned a lot from the motley fool web site

the broker that is issuing the moneys after vesting is more than likely deducting a notional amount of tax and ni based on uk income tax laws if you are not a uk resident then you should pay income tax on those stock options based on your own tax residency best thing to do is speak directly with the broker to explain the situation ask them to not deduct anything from your stock options but keep in mind that you will need to declare these earnings yourself and pay the correct rate of tax from my own personal experience the uk employer more than likely receives the net value after the notional tax and ni have been deducted and in usual circumstances create a tax liability on your payslip if you were working and had earnings if of course this deduction is being made by the employer then you can simply ask them to correct this most uk payroll software will automatically deduct tax and ni for payments after leaving unless manually so they probably are n't aware if it is them doing so

the short answer is the annualised volatility over twenty years should be pretty much the same as the annualised volatility over five years for independent identically distributed returns the volatility scales proportionally so for any number of monthly returns t setting the factor m = 12 the volatility   it should be the same for all time scales   however note the discussion here scaling volatility like this only is mathematically correct when the    underlying price model is driven by geometric brownian motion which    implies that prices are log normally distributed and returns are    normally distributed particularly the comment its a well known fact that volatility is overestimated when scaled over long periods of time without a change of model to estimate such long term volatility now a demonstration   i have modelled 12,000 monthly returns with mean = 3 and standard deviation = 2 so the annualised volatility should be 2 =    calculating annualised volatility for return of various lengths 3 6 12 60 months etc reveals an for shorter   the five year sequence average got closest to the theoretically expected figure and as the commenter noted volatility is slightly overestimated when scaled over long periods of time annualised volatility for varying return sequence lengths   edit re comment reinvesting returns does not affect the volatility much   for instance comparing some data i have handy the dow jones industrial average capital returns cr versus net returns nr   the return differences are somewhat 0.1 each month 0.25 every third month   more erratic dividend reinvestment would increase the volatility

first things first its always good to set the records straight when you are trying to clear your debt do them one by one and ask the collection agent that you would pay in full only if the records would be deleted from your credit history and most of the collection agencies are happy to take it off your credit report as they are getting the money this would work generally only when you pay the full amount i can guarantee you this because i have tried it myself after hearing about it from my friends   if you have already paid whole amount already then records of your payments generally will not be available after 2 years with any banks even the big ones like bank of america or wells fargo that means if they do n't have the records no body else would because its a burden as your payment is written off you can file a dispute to credit bureaus for your payment history and if they could n't provide you the history they have to take your record off your history even they know that you have delinquent history because they do n't have enough proof to confirm that and when you file a dispute its always good to file it by paper as they have to write back and you can ask hard copies of the proofs which are very difficult to get one more thing if you want to dispute it might take couple of months atleast and you need to have patience because you already might have known how important credit history is

mathematically it 's arbitrary you could just as easily use the bid or the midpoint as the denominator so long as you 're consistent when comparing securities   so there 's not a fundamental reason to use the ask   the best argument i can come up with is that most analysis is done from the buy side so looking at liquidity costs meaning how much does the value drop instantaneously purely because of the bid ask spread when you buy a security would be more relevant by using the ask purchase price as the basis meaning if a stock has a bid ask range of $ if you buy the stock at $ 100 the ask you immediately lose 5 of its value since you can only sell it for $ 95

there are a couple reasons for having a traditional or roth ira in addition to a 401(k program in general starting with the traditional ira with regards to the roth ira also both the traditional and roth ira allow you to make a $ 10,000 withdraw as a first time home buyer for the purposes of buying a home this is much more difficult with the 401(k and generally you end up having to take a loan against the 401(k instead so even if you ca n't take advantage of the tax deductions from contributions to a traditional ira there are still good reasons to have one around unless you plan on staying with the same company for your entire career and even if you do they may have other plans the traditional ira tends to be a much better place to park the funds from the 401(k than just rolling them over to a new employer   also do n't forget that just because you ca n't take deductions for the income does n't mean that you might not need the income that savings now will bring you in retirement if you use a retirement savings calculator is it saying that you need to be saving more than your current monthly 401(k contributions then odds are pretty good that you also need to be adding additional savings and an ira is a good location to put those assets because of the other benefits that they confer also some people do n't have the fiscal discipline to not use the money when it is n't hard to get to i.e. regular savings or investment account and as such it also helps to ensure you are n't going to go and spend the money unless you really need it

gt;you are starting from false premises built on politically driven economic theories the reality does not square with anything that you just wrote    i like to see the historical evidence statistical not anecdotal for that    i 'll provide a good starting point for you list of recessions in the united wiki a quote the national bureau of economic research dates recessions on a monthly basis back to according to their from to there were 16 cycles the average recession lasted 22 months and the average expansion 27 from to 1945 there were six cycles recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35 from 1945 to 2001 and 10 cycles recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months this has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe factors that may have contributed to this moderation include the creation of a central bank and lender of last resort like the federal reserve system in 1913 the establishment of deposit insurance in the form of the federal deposit insurance corporation in 1933 increased regulation of the banking sector the adoption of keynesian economics and the increase in automatic in the form of government programs unemployment insurance social security and later medicare and medicaid   in fact the us at the time wanted to get away from the destructive boom and bust cycles that were destroying the economy so went to europe to find out how come they had significantly less disruptive cycles and learned that the notion of a central bank was very useful to smooth out cycles   also read about the great wiki one of the causes is listed as greater central bank independence in which the fed balanced money supply more closely with demand how do you propose that the money supply in an economy should be matched with economic growth and contractions letting be independent is a proven recipe for more harm than trying to match them    all sourced with ample data   now you can try and argue that the fed is not necessary but then you 'll have to explain the vast difference in boom bust cycles seen in virtually every economy that has adopted an independent central bank that has followed monetary policy that means covering hundreds of examples good luck   this is not driven by economic theories this is historical fact ignoring it and similar evidence from hundreds of years over dozens of countries and economies is ignorant   money and fractional reserve banking guarantee monetary collapse   more non fiat economies crashed than fiat economies like pretty much every historical economy up to modern times the majority of economies that have not crashed are fiat so it seems you have not actually tried listing all the various economies and counted them   gt;the idea that economics is hard science is ridiculous   no one claimed that you 're arguing against a strawman and repeating whatever phrases you think go here   gt;in a smallish closed or partially closed system formulas and equations can determine probable outcomes in the infinitely complex economy of the modern world the very idea that you can predict anything beyond general directions is absurd   no one claimed that either however the entire universe is a pretty complex system and plenty of long term predictions are probably very accurate   gt;and the general directions are not understandable without considering the human motivations that drive each of the billions of sentient actors involved    also irrelevant since no one is claiming we need that

you 've laid out a strategy for deciding that the top of the market has passed and then realizing some gains before the market drops too far   regardless of whether this strategy is good at accomplishing its goal it can not by itself maximize your long term profits unless you have a similar strategy for deciding that the bottom of the market has passed   even if you sell at the perfect time at the top of the market you can still lose lots of money by buying at the wrong time at the bottom people have been trying to time the market like this for centuries and on average it does n't work out all that much better than just some money into the market each week and letting it sit there for 40 years so the real question is what is your investment time horizon   if you need your money a year from now well then you should n't be in the stock market in the first place   but if you have to have it in the market then your plan sounds like a good one to protect yourself from losses if you do n't need your money until 20 years from now though then every time you get in and out of the market you 're risking sacrificing all your previous smart gains with one trade   sure just leaving your money in the market can be psychologically taxing cf 2008 2009 but i guarantee that a you 'll eventually make it all back cf 2010 2014 and b you wo n't miss the top or miss the bottom since you 're not doing any trading

as littleadv suggested you are mixing issues if you have earned income and are able to deduct an ira deposit where those actual dollars came from is irrelevant   the fact that you are taking proceeds from one transaction to deposit to the ira is a booking entry on your side but the irs does n't care by the way when you get that $ 1000 gain the broker does n't withhold tax so if you take the entire $ 1000 and put it in the ira you owe $ 150 on one line but save $ 250 elsewhere and are still $ 100 to the positive on your tax return

business can also decide to go for short term maximum profit at the expense of long term and shareholders can decide to look long term   see my above though many still choose profit public companies are much less likely to avoid the pressures   you are quite correct that both public and private companies can have long term vision short term vision or a mixture of both at the same time   but the corporate structures of each change the internal pressures in a way which in my experience do not lead to an equal split between which types of companies trend in one direction or the other   gt;just go to shareholder meetings and you will see everything   i do and you are correct   i 've also seen an increasing trend in short term thinking over the past decade and a half at those meetings   the next quarter 's profits and market share drive them much more clearly than they used to particularly in anything tech and finance related   gt;in general anti laws only help create   this is a concern though oligopolies existed before anti = monopoly laws   there are cases when attempts to break up monopolies result in a small group of colluding and this needs to be watched     gt; only help create   in what manner have anti trust laws created monopolies   i do n't doubt the possibility but an example would be helpful to visualize your critique

i was being a bit facetious but in general the public accounting profession   should be dedicated to the public good any scope restrictions placed on the auditors while performing the engagement should immediately be reported by the staff to accounting management basically any shady acts of the client should be noted in the work papers and reported there 's a whole bunch of rules to tell an audit staff accountant when to go above their own seniors management if there is collusion or fraud    scope restrictions ie hey you ca n't go in the warehouse to count inventory depending on the severity could qualify the audit report disclaimer of an opinion or withdrawal from the engagement therefore it 's the auditors responsibility to refuse to provide a false audit report to the public or otherwise users of the financial statements they should never act in the manner most profitable for the firm when faced with an ethical dilemma    then there 's practicality and most audit partners will do anything it takes to keep their largest clients on the same coin those clients want a clean bill of reference for their creditors long standing relationships are most vulnerable to letting things slide in favor of the client    there are thousands of companies and even ones publicly traded the government would have to grow exponentially to actually audit all of these companies that 'll never happen they have no idea where their own money goes as long as the revenues cover the expenditures

if they had told me that i owe them $ 10,000 from 3 years ago i    would n't have anything to fight back why first thing you have to do is ask for a proof have you received treatment have you signed the bill when you were done this should include all the information about what you got and how much you agreed to pay do they have that to show to you with your signature on it if they do n't you owe nothing if they do you can match your bank credit card insurance records those are kept for 7 years at least and see what has been paid already can a doctor 's office do that they can do whatever they want the right question is whether a doctor 's office is allowed to do that check your local laws states regulate the medical profession is there a statute of limitation i 'm just guessing that forces them    to notify me in a certain time frame statute of limitations limits their ability to sue you successfully they can always sue you but if the statute of limitations has passed the court will throw the suite away provided you bring this defense up on time of course without a judgement they can not force you to pay them they can only ask nicely as the law quoted by mrchrister mandates they can trash your credit report and send the bill to collections though but if the statute of limitations has passed i doubt they 'd do that especially if its their fault i 'm not a lawyer and you should consult with a lawyer licensed in your jurisdiction for definitive answers and legal advice

i wo n't answer in a detailed manner because most people at this site like answers with certain bias on these questions like pool resources always relative to which partner is asking   if you follow the above advice you are hoping things work out   great   what if they do n't   it will be very messy   unlike most of my peers i did not follow the above advice and had a very clean exit with both of us feeling very good and no lawyers got involved either win win for both of us with all the money we saved one assumption people make is the person with the lowest income has the strictest limits   this is not always true i grew up in poverty but have a very high income and financial waste   i can live on about € 12,000 a year and even though my partner made a little less my partner liked to spend    counter intuitive right   i was supposed to be the spender because i had a large income but i was n't   also think about an example with food sharing expenses   is it fair for one partner to split protein if one partner consumes it but the other does n't answer in my view no my advice based on your questions balance the frugal vs. mentality rather than income ratios   if you 're both frugal then focus on income ratios but one may be more frugal than the other and the thought of spending € 300 a month on housing is just insane to a person like me whereas to most it 's too little   are you both exactly the same with this mentality and be honest common costs that you both agree on can be easily split 50 50 and you can often benefit from economies of scale like internet cell phone both of us feel very strongly about being financially independent and if possible we both do n't want to take money from each other this is so healthy for a relationship   my partner and i split and we both still really love each other   we 're headed in different directions but we did not want to end   what you wrote is part of why we ended so well we both were very independent financially    kids are going to be a challenge because they come with expenses that partners do n't always agree on   what do you and her think of childcare for instance   you really want to know all this upfront again a frugal vs. mindset could cause some big tensions

for some ideas on investing priority guidelines see oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing congratulations on being debt free   my advice to you is to do what you can to remain debt free you could certainly invest the money it will earn much more over the long term in a stock mutual fund than it would left in a savings account   however if you need any of this money in the next few years it would be a shame if it lost money in the short term how much do you need to finish grad school   do n't invest that money in the stock market because you will need it over the next few years likewise think about other expenses that are coming up   will your car need to be replaced in the next couple of years   will you have enough income to meet your living expenses while you are in grad school or will you need some of this to money to help with that    finally it would be good to keep some extra as an emergency fund so you can easily pay for any unexpected expenses that come up if you can make it through grad school debt free you will be much better off than if you invest all the money but take out student loans in the process after you 've accounted for all of that whatever is left of the money could definitely be invested   if your goal is to start a retirement fund an index mutual fund invested inside a roth ira is a great place to start

you are right in insisting upon a proper b2b contract in any business relationship you wish to reduce your risk and be compensated fairly in addition to the cost and complexity of international wire transfers the us companies may also be considering the fact that as an international contractor in a relatively hard to reach jurisdiction payments to you place the company at higher risk than payments to a domestic contractor by insisting upon paypal or similar they are reducing their internal complexity and reducing their financial exposure to disputed contract terms therefore wire payments are hard in an internal business sense as well as in a remittance transfer reporting sense the internal business procedure will likely be the hardest to overcome changing risk management is harder than filling out forms

the main point to consider is that your payments toward your own home replace your rent any house or apartment you buy will have changes in value the value is generally going slowly up but there is a lot of noise and you may be in a low phase at any time and for a long time so seeing it as an investment is not any better than buying share or funds and it has a much worse liquidity (= you can not as easily make it to cash when you want to and not in parts either however if you buy for example a one room apartment for with a 2 mortgage and pay 2 interest = 1600 plus 1 principal = 800 for a total of 2400 per year = 200 per month you are paying less than your current rent plus you own it after 30 years even if it would be worth nothing after 30 years you made a lot of money by paying half only every month and it probably is not worthless you need to be careful not to compare apples with oranges if you buy a house for instead your payments would be higher than your rent was but you would be living in your house not in a room for most people that is worth a lot you need to put your own value to that if you do n't care to have a lot more space and freedom the extra value is zero if you like it put a price to it with current interest rates it is probably a good idea for most people to buy a house that they can easily afford instead of paying rent the usual rules should be considered do n't yourself leave some security etc generally it is rather difficult to buy an affordable house instead of renting today and not saving a lot of money in the process so i would say go for it

no virtually ever item in the cpi is adjusted using hedonics which by definition can only be used to lower inflation not adjust it up   hedonics is not necessarily bad but it does n't actually reflect inflation it reflects standard of living vs. purchasing power which is not useful for a purely monetary measure   it also does not correctly reflect that despite the fact that a 1970 's 20 tv can not from an economic standpoint be directly compared to a 2012 20 tv if the price is the same adjusted for inflation inflation represents how the value of the dollar has accrued vs the value of a 20 tv which is what the definition of inflation is   so no i do n't think you 're correct on this this is also kind of glossing over the fact that the cpi essentially makes the bold argument that energy and transportation prices never affect inflation

i had a similar situation when i was in college the difference was that the dealer agreed to finance and the bank they used wanted a higher interest rate from me because of my limited credit history the dealer asked for a rate 5 percentage points higher than what they put on the paperwork i told them that i would not pay that and i dropped the car off at the lot with a letter the sale they were n't happy about that and eventually offered me financing at my original rate with a $ 1000 discount from the previously agreed upon purchase price what i learned through that experience is that i did n't do a good enough job of negotiating the original price i would suggest that your son stop answering phone calls from the dealership for at least 1 week and drive the car as much as possible in that time if the dealer has cashed the check then that will be the end of it he owes nothing further if the dealer has not cashed the check he should ask whether they prefer to keep the check or if they want the car with 1000 miles on the odometer this only works if your son keeps his nerve and is willing to walk away from the car

their problem is that the overwhelming majority of their stock is owned by pension funds hedge funds and other funds who have no interest in long term financing they are only interested in quarterly profits    once a company goes public the only way to get it out of the stock market zoo is for a single investor to acquire over 50 of the stock the companies that you mentioned are way too big for that to happen

you can not get your investment out and leave only the capital gains until they become taxable at the long term rate when you sell some shares after holding them for less than a year you have capital gains on which you will have to pay taxes at the short term capital gains rate that is at the same rate as ordinary income   as an example if you bought 100 shares at $ 70 for a net investment of $ 7000 and sell 70 of them at $ 100 after five months to get your initial investment back you will have short term capital gains of $ 30 per share on the 70 shares that you sold and so you have to pay tax on that $ the other $ 4900 = $ is tax free since it is just your purchase price of the 70 shares being returned to you   so after paying the tax on your short term capital gains you really do n't have your   initial investment back you have something less the capital gains on   the 30 shares that you continue to hold will become long term capital gains income to you only when you sell the shares after having held them for a full year or more the gains on the shares sold after five months are taxable income in the year of sale

imagine the following scenario you have a credit limit of $ 1000 and you want to by a tablet from a store it costs $ 600 you then walk next door and buy a tv for $ 600 you would expect that you would go over your limit and the second transaction will be rejected as long as that hold is in place you do n't have access to those blocked funds that makes sure that you ca n't promise to pay more than you have funds on the card holds can get in the way if you are close to your credit limit people run into this problem if they reserve a hotel room rent a car or purchase gasoline the hold is set at a specific level to make sure you have enough funds for the typical transaction this distance between vendors is not relevant the bank is blocking funds based on a request from a vendor they have to block the funds because you might use the multiple times in the same store it is possible that the card company might release the hold based on the request by the vendor but they generally do n't   if this is a debit card linked to a bank account the bank can have access to the overdraft system or a linked savings account if is is a credit card they can decide to to increase your credit limit and offer you what is essentially a loan plus they can hit you with fees but if the card is a prepaid debit card or gift card they do n't want to allow you to go beyond your limit   if this is a card that you plan on recharging you could put extra funds on the card to allow both the old hold and the new hold to co exist

yes an investment can be made in a company before ipo the valuation process is similar as that done for arriving at ipo or for a normal listed company the difference may be the premium perceived for the idea in question this would differ from one investor to other for example whether facebook will be able to grow at the rate and generate enough revenues and win against competition is all a mathematical model based on projections there are quite a few times the projection would go wrong and quite a few times it would go correct an individual investor can not generally borrow from banks to invest into a company listed or otherwise or for any other purpose if he does not have any collateral that can be kept as security by the bank an individual can get a loan only if he has sufficient collateral the exceptions being small personal loans depending on one 's credit history the private equity placement arm of banks or firms in the business of private equity invest in start up and most of the time make an educated guess based on their experience more than half of their investments into start ups end up as wiped out an occasional one or two companies are ones that they make a windfall gain on

it would help if we had numbers to walk you through the analysis current balance rate remaining term and the new mortgage details   to echo and elaborate on part of ben 's response the most important thing is to not confuse cash flow with savings if you have 15 years to go and refinance to 30 years at the rate rate your payment drops by 1/3 yet your rate is identical in this example   the correct method is to take the new rate plug it into a mortgage calculator or spreadsheet using the remaining months on the current mortgage and see the change in payment this savings is what you should divide into closing costs to calculate the breakeven it 's up to you whether to adjust your payments to keep the term the same after you close   with respect to keshlam rules of thumb often fail there are mortgages that build the closing costs into the rate not the amount loaned the rate this means that as rates dropped moving from 5.25 to 5 made sense even though with closing costs there were 4.5 mortgages out there because rates were still falling and i finally moved to a 3.5 loan at the time i was serial refinancing the bank said i could return to them after a year if rates were still lower in my opinion we are at a bottom and the biggest question you need to answer is whether you 'll remain in the house past your own breakeven time last with personal finance focusing on personal the analysis should n't ignore the rest of your balance sheet say you are paying $ with 15 years to go your budget is tight enough that you 've chosen not to deposit to your 401(k assuming you are in the us or country with pretax retirement account options in this case holding rates constant a shift to 30 years frees up about $ 500/mo in a matched 401(k your $ is doubled to $ 12k year   of course if the money would just go in the market unmatched members here would correctly me for suggesting a dangerous game in effect borrowing via mortgage to invest in the market the matched funds however are tough to argue against

as the option approaches expiry the delta will approach zero or one depending on whether you 're in or out of the money this might be easiest to if you look at the option value as a function of the stock price and then realise that the delta is the slope of that curve now as we get closer to expiry time value fades away and we get closer and closer to the intrinsic value which looks like this hockey stick as you see close to expiry if you 're out of the money you have nothing with delta zero while if you 're in the money you have a forward with delta one

i 'm not going to recommend a specific card   new card offers pop up all the time   my answer would be out of date in a month as a general rule if you pay off your balance every month you should be looking at a cash back or a rewards card cash back cards will give you some money say 1 of every dollar you spend   some will give you larger amounts of cash back for certain types of spending e.g. groceries with a rewards card you usually get points or airline miles which can be redeemed for merchandise flights around the wold concert tickets etc with these types of cards it makes sense to do as much of your spending as possible with the cards so you can maximize the benefits which specific card is best will depend on your shopping habits and which bank is offering the best deal that week   i recommend you start at to compare card offerings   for cash back cards you can also go to enter some details of your spending and see which one will give you the most cash back

this is almost certainly a scam or a mistake   this is not good spendable money it is not yours to keep very simple to handle   tell the bank in writing that you were not expecting to receive this money and are a bit surprised to receive it preferably in a way that creates a paper trail    and then stop talking   why   because you honestly do n't know    this puts you at arm 's length to the money it but not refusing it dreams nobody wants it back ever     as for the person bugging you for the cash tell them nothing except work with their own bank   then ignore them completely   he probably hacked someone else diverted their money into your account and he 's you into transferring it to a third location him   leaving you holding the bag when the reversals hit months later   he does nt want you reversing that would return the money to the rightful owner   he works this scam on dozens of people and he wins if some cooperate now here 's the hard part   wait   this is not drama or gossip you do not need to keep people updated   you are not a bank fraud officer who deals with the latest scams everyday you do n't know what the heck you are doing in this area of practice   in fact playing amateur will make you suspicious   there is nothing for you to do   that urge to do something is how scammers work on you and these things take time   not everyone banks in real time on smartphone apps of course scammers target those who 'd be slow to notice this game is all about velocity    eventually months one of two things is likely to happen    the transfer is found to be fraudulent and the bank reverses it and they slap you with penalties and/or the cops come   you refer them to the letter you sent explaining your surprise at receiving it   that letter is your get out of jail free card    the other person works with their bank and back the money   one day it just disappears   not that this is your problem but they 'd file a dispute with their bank their bank talks to your bank your bank finds your letter oh ok   if a year goes by and neither of these things happens you 're probably in the clear   do n't get greedy and try to manipulate circumstances so you are more likely to keep the money   scammers prey on this too   i think the above is your best shot

to answer your question as far as what 's available in addition to your 401(k at work most financial types will say to contribute up to the match first you may qualify for a roth ira qualification is based on income if not then you may have to go with a traditional ira   you and your husband can each have one and contribute up to the limit each year   after that you could get just a straight up mutual fund and/or contribute up to limit on your 401(k my two cents this may sound counter intuitive and i 'm sure some folks will disagree but instead of contributing to your 401(k now take whatever that amount is and use it to pay extra on the car loan   also take the extra being paid on the mortgage and pay it on the car loan too   once the car loan is paid off then set aside 15 of your gross income and use that amount to start your retirement investing    any additional money beyond this can then go into the mortgage   once it 's paid off then you can take the extra you were paying plus the mortgage and invest that amount into mutual funds you may want to check out chris 's retire inspired book or podcast as well

there are two kinds of engagements in an ipo the traditional kind where the banks assume the risks of unsold shares money coming out of their pockets to hold shares no one wants that is the main risk no one buying the stock that the bank is holding   secondly there is a best efforts engagement this means that bank will put forth its best effort to sell the shares but will not be on the hook if any do n't sell this is used for small cap risky companies   source author investment banker

ultimately the bank will have first call on the house and you will be the only one on the hook directly to the bank if you do n't make the mortgage payments there 's nothing you can do to avoid that if you ca n't get a joint mortgage what you could do is make a side agreement that your girlfriend would be entitled to half the equity in the house and would be required to make half the payments via you you could perhaps also add that she would be part responsible for helping you clear any arrears but in the end it 'd just be a deal between you and her she would n't have any direct rights over the house and she would n't be at risk of the bank pursuing her if you do n't pay the mortgage you 'd probably also need legal advice to make it but you could also not worry about that too much and just write it all down as formally as possible it really depends if you 're just trying to improve your feelings about the process or whether you really want something that you could both rely on in the event of a later split i do n't think getting married would make any make any real difference day to day in law with rare exceptions the finances of spouses are independent from each other however in the longer term being married would mean your now wife would have a stronger legal claim on half the equity in the house in the event of you splitting up

your actual question has nothing to do with the technical issue of linking a paypal account to a bank account it is all about the accounting of the money that is what you claim as income and what you can prove to the taxman yes you will need to separate the money linking to a business account is probably the way to go from there it is about how you keep track of the money and account for it   how you do the accounting is a different question so no it does not automatically become business income just because it goes into a business bank account you still have to keep track of said income and claim it somewhere on some tax the point of the separate business account is to avoid the commingling of the the money which may lead to you losing the liability protection of an incorporation the bank does n't file your taxes for you

insurance is a funny product   as you said it is a little like gambling   when i buy term life insurance i 'm essentially betting that i 'm going to die within the next 20 years and the insurance company is betting that i 'm not   i 'm hoping to lose that bet besides all of the reasons that other answers mentioned i think part of the reason is psychological   as in my example i 'm setting up a kind of a win win situation for myself here   let 's go with car insurance a less morbid example than my first example   if i do n't get into a car accident great   if i do get into a car accident then the traumatic event is at least offset by the fact that the financial impact to me is minimal   win win

gt would n't a competitor just offer a similar cream at a cheaper price   in addition to patents the fda is a barrier to entry because of its long approval process which can take several drugs consumers   this can give a drug manufacturer years of an artificial monopoly and disincentive other companies to make a competing product since the market could look very different in a couple of years   so if you want the free market to provide cheaper drugs you are required to eliminate the fda from the process and accept that it is okay to sell untested drugs to people

i mean it does n't really apply to a lease buy decision in a home   the variability due to the variables i discussed makes it not worth the analysis when you 're talking about return differences of maybe 1 2   even if your house costs $ 1 million that 's only a difference of $ 10,000 maybe if there 's no difference in the other variables but there will be   my point is that it 's not worth doing   dcf models are used for valuation of large projects not simple home buying problems   there are way better ways to evaluate such a simple problem

do you think that publishers have n't thought this through pretty carefully already you ca n't easily make a thousand copies of a dead tree book and give it to all your friends or make it available to millions on the internet possible sure but not without a ton of work and hassle publishers rely on customers buying paper books for their personal consumption and figure that they might loan the book out once or twice big deal they still get paid   without drm publishers would basically be inviting the public at large to steal their e book product marginal costs to copying a book file are nothing unlike in the paper comparison so everyone would do it if they could sure the drm is easy to hack but the vast majority of the public is n't going to do that or know how just like for video games the publishers know some folks will do it but enough do n't that it makes the product profitable drm is what creates the whole business model for e books in the first place   by the way amazon 's drm does n't lock you into using the kindle the official kindle app for the ipad works just fine and i read many books with it

tl;dr call them i 'd be very surprised if you have a problem i used to have have a policy with geico and would pay for my car insurance 6 months at a time about 2 months into my last period i purchased a house unfortunately geico did n't offer homeowners insurance in my state so i ended switching to another company that offered a better combined policy   since i had already paid for 6 months of coverage i figured i 'd just be stuck being double covered for 4 months so i did n't bother doing anything until the end of the 6 months and called them to cancel the auto renewal thinking what i 've already paid was a sunk cost the asked me why i was canceling and i explained the situation and they the cancellation to when i got my policy with the other company and geico issued me a refund for the time there was overlap   considering that they did that for a leaving customer i 'd expect them to be able to cancel the policy on a new car of a current paying customer with no issues

yes this is exactly what it means   no losses negative earnings    with today 's accounting methods you might want to determine whether you view earnings including or excluding extraordinary items    for example a company might take a once off charge to its earnings when the value of a major asset   this would show in the including but not in the excluding figure    the book actually has a nice discussion in chapter 12 things to consider about per share earnings which considers several additional variables to consider here too note that this earnings metric is different from stock selection for the defensive investor which requires 10 years ps my edition 4th edition does n't have pages so your reference is n't correct for that edition   i found it on page in chapter 15 stock selection for the enterprising investor

look into the asset allocations of lifecycle funds offered by a company like vanguard this page allows you to select your current age and find a fund based on that you could pick a fund like the target retirement fund ages 21 25 and examine its allocation in the portfolio management tab for this fund the breakdown is then look at the allocation of the underlying funds that comprise the lifecycle fund in the same tab   look at each of those funds and see what asset allocation they use and that should give you a rough idea for an age based allocation for example the total stock market index fund page has a sector breakdown so if you wanted to get very fine grained with your allocation you could you 're probably much better off investing in the index fund low cost etfs or the lifecycle fund itself however it 'll be much cheaper   doing this for several lifecycle funds should be a good start keep in mind however that these funds are rebalanced as the target date approaches so if you 're following the allocation of some particular funds you 'll have to rebalance as well if you really want an age based allocation that you do n't have to think about invest in a lifecycle fund directly you 'll probably pay a lower expense ratio than if you invested in a whole slew of funds directory and it 's less work for someone who is n't comfortable managing their portfolio themselves furthermore with vanguard the expense ratios are already fairly low   this is only one example of an allocation however your tolerance of risk age etc may affect what allocation you 're willing to accept   full disclosure part of my roth ira is invested in the target fund i used as an example above and another part uses a similar rebalancing strategy to the one i used above but with admiral share funds which have higher minimum investments but lower expense ratios

gt;this is directly the result of about 50 years of carefully applying the value investing philosophy   ha nobody can prove that berkshire hathaway could just be lucky you ca n't even come close to making a solid argument that points in either direction the factors involved are far too complicated in fact that leads me to my response to this thread   nobody actually knows what the hell is going on in the stock market and if they do they are n't telling you if they do tell you then it 's no longer relevant

note i am not a lawyer this is my personal opinion and interpretation first your source is european law which obviously does n't apply outside of the eu the eu can not make laws that bind entities in other countries so you can not claim that the vat was needed to be mentioned second if you owe something you owe it it does n't matter if it was forgotten to be mentioned at best you can say that under those circumstances you do n't want the software anymore and i would assume you can send it back and get your money back minus a fee for having it used for a while this gets quite difficult to calculate clearly so it 's probably not a good avenue to follow for you as the company has to send the vat to your country they will not be allowed to keep a dime of it and have to bear the complete cost for the handling it is a debt you have to your government they are just the entity responsible for collecting it still if you just ignore them they will probably suck it up and your government will also not do a thing to you if they only have your email address they have no way of knowing if you even still have use this address for all they know it could be you never got it they also can not simply charge your card as they probably do n't have the card data any more they are not supposed to keep it after the transaction is complete and they thought it was complete at the time all in all you should be safe to ignore it it 's between you and your god consciousness if you feel obliged to pay it as technically you owe it

75k is short of the highly compensated category   most us citizens in that pay range would consider paying someone to do their taxes as an unnecessary expense   tax shelters usually do n't come into play for this level of income   however there are certain things which provide deductions some things that make it better to pay someone    use the free online tax forms to sandbox your returns   if all you 're concerned about is ensuring you pay your taxes correctly this is the most cost efficient route if you want to minimize your tax burden consult with a cpa   be sure to get one who is familiar with resident aliens from your country and the relevant tax treaties the estimate you 're looking at may be the withholding of which you may be eligible for a refund for some part of that withholding    tax treaties likely make sure that you get credit on each side for the money paid in the other   for example as a us citizen if i go to europe and work and pay taxes there i can deduct the taxes paid in europe from my tax burden in the us   if i 've already paid more to the eu than i would have paid on the same amount earned in the us then my tax burden in the us is zero   by the same token if i have not paid up to my us burden then i owe the balance to the us   but this is way better than paying taxes to your home country and to the host country where you earned the money

are you sure these farmers sell straight to wall mart    there are always companies involved between big farms and grocery stores they deliver the produce to the higher end grocery stores first because they will pay more for it    if a particular batch is going bad or does n't pass inspection the only companies that take it are walmart and juice companies speaking from experience family business    once a batch has gone bad you lose all value and you do n't get paid no insurance even

there is more than a single reason why loses value over time futures curve vix is always expected to trend up when under this could change in the future this means 1 month away futures contracts are bought at a premium closer to 20 if the stayed flat at 15 by the end of the month that contract is only worth about 15 meaning you lost 25 this affects all vix etfs and makes inverse vix etfs attractive to you do n't mind your account blowing up periodically leverage decay if vix goes down 25 two consecutive days your goes down 75 even if it doubled back to yesterday 's value next day you 'd still be 25 down etf funding costs the fund managers take some money from the pot every day
