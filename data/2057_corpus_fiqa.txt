transfers of money to the uk for any purpose are not generally taxed so you can just transfer it here and invest once the money is here you 'll be taxed on the business activity like anyone else the company will have to pay corporation tax and depending on your own residency you might have to pay income tax on any distributions from the company

i think it 's wise to account for those inevitable but unpredictable expenses like car house repairs and abnormal medical bills when deciding on your emergency fund amount   so if you average $ 100/month for car repairs and you have a 6-month emergency fund then part of that fund is $ 600 for car repairs if your total annual out of pocket for health insurance is $ then emergency fund gets $ 2,500 and so on this way you add cushion to your emergency fund to handle those unpredictable but inevitable expenses without setting up a bunch of separate accounts it does n't have to be inflexible either i know my furnace and air conditioner are way past their expected life so i 'm keeping a larger than normal emergency fund ultimately it 's personal preference to me cash is all the same no matter what account it 's in but other people do best by keeping some logical physical separation of funds intended for different purposes

yes orders like this are very possible   there are nearly endless possibilities for structuring a trade   it all comes down to whether you have the money to make the trade at the find you find a counterparty   if you do n't the order is cancelled trades like this happen all day long at goldman ubs etc   and on ebay

edit new ideas based on the full story i would n't worry about the price history   while it is certainly true that some buyers might try to leverage that information against you the bottom line is the price is the price   both the buyer and the seller have to agree    if the initial listing was too high then lower the price   if that is n't low enough then readjust down   i see no harm in moving the price down over time repeatedly   in fact i thin that is a good tactic to getting the most for the house   if you happen to have the luxury of time then keep lowering that price until it sells   do n't fret how that behavior appears you can lower the price as often as you like until it sells   i am not a real estate agent and i am a terrible negotiator but i would lower the price every quarter until it sells   you ca n't go down to fast a buyer might wait you out and you ca n't wait to long as you stated   also if you house is priced inline with the neighborhood you can at least get offers and negotiate buy asking for such a premium 25 folks might not even make an offer you simply need to decide what is more important the selling price or the time frame in getting it sold if you house does n't sell because the market does n't support your price then consider keeping it as a rental   you can do it yourself or if you are not interested in that large amount of work then hire a rental management company to do it for a fee renting a home is hard work and requires attention to detail a good amount of your time and much labor   if you just need to wait a couple of years before selling renting it can be a good option to cover your costs while you wait for the market to reach you you should get advice on how to handle the money how to rent it how to deal with renters and the the laws are in your jurisdiction rent it out to a trusted friend or family member for a steal of a deal   they save money and you get the luxury of time waiting for the sale with a real estate lawyer you hire get a contract for a lease option or owner finance deal on the house   sometimes you can expand the market of people looking to buy your house   if you have a willing purchaser will bad credit you can be doing them a favor and solving your own issue   it costs money and you will make less on the sale but it could be better than nothing take heed there is a reason some people can not get a traditional loan on their own   before you extend your good name or credit think about it   it is another hassle for sure this wo n't help if you have to pay off a mortgage but you could donate it   this is another tricky deal that you really need to speak with a lawyer who specialize in charitable giving   there are tax benefits but i would make any kind of a deal where tax deductions are the only benefit this is common enough these days   if you are unable to pay for the mortgage it benefits you and the bank to get into a short sale arrangement   they bank gets probably more money than if they have to foreclose and they save money on legal fees and you can get rid of the obligation you will do a deed in lieu or the short sale depending on how the market it and what the house can be sold for   you and the bank will have to work it out this will ruin for a credit for a while and you will not likely qualify to get a new mortgage for at least a few years you can stop paying your mortgage tell the bank and they will foreclose   this is going to ruin your credit for a long time as well as disqualify you from mortgages in the near future   do n't do this   if you are planning a foreclosure take the time to contact your bank and arrange a short sale or a deed in lieu   there is n't really any excuse to go into foreclosure if you are having problems   talk to the bank and work out a deal

no gnucash does n't specifically provide a partner cash basis report function however gnucash reports are fairly easy to write if the data was readily available in your accounts it should n't be too hard to create a cash basis report the account setup is so flexible you might actually be able to create accounts for each partner and using standard dual entry accounting always debit and credit these accounts so the actual cash basis of each partner is shown and updated with every transaction i used gnucash for many years to manage my personal finances and those of my business sole proprietorship it really for data integrity i never lost data customer management decent ui for managing multiple clients and business partners and customer invoice generation they look pretty i found the user interface ugly and cumbersome gnucash does n't integrate cleanly with banks in the us it 's possible to import data but the process is very clunky and error prone apparently you can make bank transactions right from gnucash if you live in europe another very important limitation of gnucash to be aware of only one user at a time period if this is important to you do n't use gnucash to really use gnucash effectively you probably have to be an actual accountant i studied dual entry accounting a bit while using gnucash dual entry accounting in gnucash is a pain in the butt accurately recording certain types of transactions like stock buys sells requires fiddling with complicated split transactions i agree with hire a pro

in the united states if the person insures an article and then claims a loss of that article the insurance replaces the missing destroyed article if later on the item is found the original is owned by the insurance company the person who purchased the policy does n't get to keep both   of course if the item was so valuable to be priceless the insurance company would be open to an exchange of items or money   but if they suspect fraud then it becomes a legal matter even when a life is n't involved it can be a source of dispute insured v. insurer when stolen art is recovered who owns it kenneth s. levine   this essay is about the word which frequently appears    in insurance policies an insured painting is stolen and the insurance    company pays the owner ’s claim for the value of the painting many    years later when the painting is recovered its value is many times    what it was when the insurance claim was paid the insurance company    takes the position that it owns the painting while the owner says i    own the painting less the value of the insurance proceeds received    the resolution of this dispute depends on the meaning of the word    in the insurance policy when life insurance is involved the item being replace is the lost stream of income the question of returning money and how much would be a legal issue they would also want to know if there was fraud and who was involved

i have a loan that was picked up by bofa too   they required escrow but there was a problem with one of their checks to my insurance company where it evidently got lost in the mail   my insurance company contacted me and i called bofa who said it had been paid and may just be taking the insurance company a while to credit all the individual accounts they send a check for a lot of customers at a time   well since the check was n't received my insurance company contacted me again and i finally straightened it out with everyone   after that i complained that it would have been much easier for me if i paid it myself instead of being a middle man so they canceled my escrow refunded the money to me and now i pay the taxes and insurance myself   i prefer it that way as it simplifies things   i 've been a little surprised that bofa has been really nice whenever i contact them and always seems willing to make me happy   maybe it 's just because i pay on time and have paid a lot of extra on the principal so that there 's no danger that i 'll default

's answer is fundamentally correct and deserves the but i 'd like to give an economic explanation for how this economically functions the key point from 's answer 's that the interest rate is for one company while this may be much higher than the equilibrium rate the true market interest rate it is not completely unreasonable because of the risk for credit to be continually produced default risk must be compensated because this is a cost to the lender   most are not in business to lose money so making loans to borrowers that default 40 of the time would make this interest rate reasonable for uk citizens this would not be such a problem because the lender can usually pursue the borrower for the balance but if the borrower can the loan and leave the legal reach of the uk creditors the collection rate is 0 the guarantee by the foreign persons not present in the uk is incidental and probably more of a regulatory requirement since the inability to collect from them is just as unlikely one should always look for the lowest price with at least minimum quality when shopping for anything but you are right to be apprehensive legally   read every line and be sure that you yourself understand every clause before signing if alternative cheaper financing is available it is probably superior

the technical term of a recession is 2 successive quarters of negative gdp growth as is the natural cycle the curve will at some point in the future maybe it 's tomorrow or 5 years from now but nobody knows for certain one also should n't take any single indicator as the end all be all of indicators for example there are other spreads that indicate the health of credit in the global economy such as the ted spread and the libor spread if you take a peek at the ted spread it tells a much different story the ted spread measures the health of the global banking system by tracking the rate at which banks lend to each other a lower ted rate equals more trust and perceived creditworthiness of the borrower which would be another bank   lastly you really ca n't rely on a single article or single indicator to come to the conclusion that the sky is falling even if we are on the of a recession here in the us nobody can tell the impact and depth of the recession in my opinion we are nearing the top of the credit cycle and should be expecting a bit of a cooling off in the near term 1 3 years outside of that your guess is as good as mine

your question has already been answered you divide the amount of shares you own 100 by the total amount of shares however i feel it is somewhat misleading to talk about owning a percentage of the company by owning shares strictly speaking shares do not entitle you to a part of the company but instead give you a proportional amount of votes at shareholder meetings assuming no funky share classes what this means is that someone who owns 30 of a company 's shares ca n't just grab 30 of the company 's assets factories offices and whatever and say that they are entitled to own this what they actually own is 30 of the voting rights in this company this means that they control 30 of all available votes when the company calls a vote on corporate actions choosing a new director etc which is how shareholders exert their influence on a company

the coupon should save you $ 10 either way assuming that you meet the criteria for using the coupon you 're figuring out the discount based on the cost of the food alone   you should be including the tip in your calculations yes they 're tacking on something that is otherwise optional but that 's because enough people forget that the server works just as hard regardless of whether there 's a coupon involved or not   so restaurants build the tip in to keep employee morale up which in turn encourages them to keep a good level of service up i guess it gets down to how much you tip   if you typically do n't tip which would be rather then yes you do lose money with a $ 60 meal   if you tip 18 then you save exactly $ 10 $ $ 10.00 = $   if you normally tip 10 15 a customary range then it 's somewhere in between edit following littleadv 's discussion on this question i am assuming that the 18 goes directly to the and is more or less expected if it does n't in which case one might choose not to tip at all because it would just line the pockets of the restaurant owner then you 're absolutely correct in figuring out the value of the coupon by treating the 18 as a tax

it totally depends on when your expenses hit and whether you might have a larger stock than necessary if you run your projections against the monthly save and the intervals of when you 'll need the money you might be able to extract some stock from the account   i recommend making this a bit simpler i operate this with an account which is a complete aggregate of expenses that i know i have several times per year or once every two years but are not monthly or part of a weekly non fixed expense budget cap instead of tracking each expense individually and saving for it create a spreadsheet that lists out all of these expenses sum them and then divide by 12 when i first opened this account i added a one time deposit to to make sure i would never need to pull money from another source for these expenses as new expenses come into existence that i should plan for annually i simply add them to this list and adjust the monthly auto deposit to the account this also adjusts my single number weekly budget   to make it easy whenever i see an expense on my list on my amex or debit i simply initiate a withdrawal from the savings and it will balance out my weekly or monthly budget expenses   the goal of my account is to simply avoid anti windfalls that are known quantities insurance annual eye exam flush amazon prime etc that would throw a wrench in weekly monthly budget and expense planning the more variables you can remove from your weekly monthly the more regular it becomes and the more likely you will be able to stick to a budget

after a bit of rooting around the hmrc sites i found this page which says this one key difference is that products are classed as electronically supplied services for vat and customs duties these services are for vat purposes the place of supply of these services is the country in which the customer lives if you supply electronic services to a business customer in another european union eu country the customer accounts for any vat due in that country you should not charge uk vat if you supply electronic services to a consumer charity or government body in another eu country you have to account for uk vat if you supply electronic services to anyone in a country outside the eu you do n't pay any vat if as a uk business you buy electronic services from a company outside the uk you have to account for vat if i read this correctly i as the supplier of the website need to account for vat only if the sponsor is a consumer charity or government body in another eu country it is not covered in this site but i assume i must also account for vat for a customer based in the uk   so in answer to the original question a customer from canada which is currently outside the eu would account for the vat themselves and i would simply charge the gross amount

the ex dividend date is the first date on which you may sell without losing your dividend   in this case that date is august 5th thanks victor   the price opens on the ex dividend date lower than it closed on the previous day by the amount of the dividend therefore you may sell any time on august 5th including during pre market trading and still get the dividend you must be the owner of the stock as of the end of after hours trading on the 4th and therefore overnight in order to get the dividend intel 's dividend dates the record date is n't important to your trading decision

wrong assuming each account has the same investment option the rate of return is not dependent on the initial amount of money in the account but rather the allocation amongst said investment suppose based on your investment allocation in either account you gain 10 interest over the year   in the first scenario your ending balance will be 30000 + = $   in the second scenario your first account will be worth 30000 1.10 = $ and the second account will be worth 4800 1.10 = for a total of + = $

here 's another answer on the topic saving for retirement how much is enough an angle on it this question made me think of a good approach here is to focus on savings rate which you can control rather than the final number which you ca n't plus it will fluctuate with the markets and make you nervous for example focus on saving at least 10 of your income annually 15 is much safer   if you focus on the final number the way it works in the real world is that you save as much as you can but there are lots of random factors and unknowns some people end up having to work a lot longer than they hoped to others end up able to retire early others retire on time but have to spend less than they hoped but the one thing you can often control as long as you have an income and no catastrophes anyway is that you spend less than you make

in the second example you are giving up future   free cash flows in exchange for a capital gain on the original investment with that respect   the money you will not gain will be the difference of the future cash flows net of related costs minus the net gain on the panel you have sold the financial result can be considered as the opposite of a sunk cost that is a cost you have already incurred and can not be recovered   vs net future gains you are giving up   in more sophisticated financial terms we are talking about the   benefit cost ratio   from investopedia

wow very by some of the answers i will comment on those later to directly answer your question here is a link to a brochure that explains the three basic and is written in straightforward language link text that is step one step 2 is a question cheapest when initially or for long term without a doubt term initially is the cheapest however every 10 years or 20 years it increases in price as the name term implies it is temporary coverage will end at some point 75 or 80 depending upon plan design chosen it is possible that if you choose term you can outlive your coverage and all you have are a bunch of cancelled cheques young people with a mortgage children and other debts should buy a lot of term as the mortgage will be paid off the kids will no longer be dependent these needs are temporary however some needs are permanent what about leaving a legacy at death to a charity insurance is a good solution and can provide a tax deduction too term is n't a good fit or a business owner wishing to transfer his her business at death to their children taxes will be due and permanent insurance such as whole life and universal life can be arranged to provide cash to pay tax whenever this happens   let me ask you who received 10 in the last ten years on their equity portfolio almost zero people did however a whole plan would have generated a guaranteed return of 3.0 plus a non guaranteed return via dividends that the combined internal rate of return   on a combined basis would be about 5.6 after taxes life a bond portfolio yield internal rate of return is dependent on age at buying years of investing all insurance software can show you the internal rate of return irr is what is the return after tax that you must get to equal the equity or death benefit from a permanent insurance plan someone mentioned by term and invest the difference that is what universal life is term and invest the difference except the difference is growing tax sheltered outside investments with comparable risk are taxable there is no easy answer for what type is right often a combination is the key question you should ask is how much is enough then consider types based upon your needs and budget here is a link where you can calculate how much you need i hope this helps a bit

why is nobody providing a service that is basically give me your money i will invest it as i see fit a year later i will return the capital to you plus half of any profits or losses this means that if your capital under my management ends up turning a profit i will keep half of those profits but if i lose you money i will cover half those losses because they can already make lots of money by just charging people an fee and not having to cover their losses   why take on the risk of having to cover your losses when they can just take a percentage of your assets and stick you with any losses in addition as charles e. grant mentioned in a comment on another answer if a person has both sufficient capital to cover your losses and sufficient confidence in their investing acumen that they do n't think they will have to do so they have little need for your money   rather than take half the gains on your money they will invest their own money they must have some or else they ca n't guarantee your losses and take all the gains your scheme would only be plausible as a partnership between a person with investing skills but little capital and another person with ample capital and less skill   in that case the investment could genuinely benefit from access to the 's capital   as quid noted in chat this does exist in the form of ad hoc private equity arrangements between individuals   however such a setup is unlikely to exist as an off the shelf product marketed at retail investors because financial institutions have more capital than any individual retail investor and more generally anyone with sufficient skill to pull this off will at least in theory quickly accumulate enough capital that they can negotiate a less risky payment plan

i can see the point of it but you also have to remember what kind of people are working here to begin with they are often people with a high school education or equivalent with no additional training or education that does n't leave a lot of jobs open and pretty much regardless of where they work the market wage is going to be low because they are extremely interchangeable that is to say this is the working poor the people that the government targets quite a bit so they 'll have a negative external impact on the rest of the economy as a whole    so while it does cost you money per year really the more important question is if these people were employed elsewhere or not employed what would the cost be and if there is any difference to where the government is paying more then they should be taxed by that amount to pay for the externality

this is really an extended comment on the last paragraph of 's answer when the manager of a mutual fund sells securities that the fund holds for a profit or receives dividends stock dividends bond interest etc the fund has the option of paying taxes on that money at corporate rates and distributing the rest to shareholders in the fund or passing on the entire amount categorized as dividends qualified dividends net short term capital gains and net long term capital gains to the shareholders who then pay taxes on the money that they receive at their own respective tax rates if the net gains are negative i.e. losses they are not passed on to the shareholders see the last paragraph below   a shareholder does n't have to reinvest the distribution amount into the mutual fund the option of receiving the money as cash always exists as does the option of investing the distribution into a different mutual fund in the same family e.g. invest the distributions from vanguard 's s&p 500 index fund into vanguard 's total bond index fund and/or vice versa this last can be done without needing a brokerage account but doing it across fund families will require the money to transit through a brokerage account or a personal account such cross transfers can be helpful in reducing the amounts of money being transferred in re balancing asset allocations as is recommended be done once or twice a year those investing in load funds instead of no load funds should keep in mind that several load funds waive the load for re investment of distributions but some funds do n't the sales charge for the reinvestment is pure profit for the fund if the fund was purchased directly or passed on to the brokerage if the fund was purchased through a brokerage account as ben points out a shareholder in a mutual fund must pay taxes in the appropriate categories on the distributions   from the fund even though no actual cash has been received because the entire distribution has been reinvested it is worth keeping in mind that when the mutual fund declares a distribution say $ a share the net asset value per share drops by the same amount assuming no change in the prices of the securities that the fund holds and the new shares issued are at this lower price that is there is no change in the value of the investment if you had $ 10,000 in the fund the day before the distribution was declared you still have $ 10,000 after the distribution is declared but you own more shares in the fund than you had previously in actuality the new shares appear in your account a couple of days later not immediately when the distribution is declared   in short a distribution   from a mutual fund that is re invested leads to no change in your net assets but does increase your tax liability ditto for a distribution that is taken as cash or re invested elsewhere as a final remark net capital losses inside a mutual fund are not distributed to shareholders but are retained within the fund to be written off against future capital gains see also this previous answer   or this one

options granted by an employer to an employee are generally different that the standardized options that are traded on public stock option exchanges   they may or may not have somewhat comparable terms but generally the terms are fairly different as a holder of an expiring employee option you can only choose to exercise it by paying the specified price and receiving the shares or not   it is common that the exercise system will allow you to exercise all the shares and simultaneously sell enough of the acquired shares to cover the option cost of all the shares thus leaving you owning some of the stock without having to spend any cash   you will owe taxes on the gain on exercise regardless of what you do with the stock if you want to buy publicly traded options you should consider that completely separately from your employer options other than thinking about how much exposure you have to your company situation   it is very common for employees to be to their company 's stock through direct ownership or options

no there are additional factors involved note that the shares on issue of a company can change for various reasons such as conversion redemption of convertible securities vesting of restricted employee shares conversion of employee options employee stock purchase programs share placements buybacks mergers rights issues etc so it is always worthwhile checking sec announcements for the company if you want an exact figure   there may also be multiple classes of shares and preferred securities that have different levels of dividends present for they filed a 10q on 22 april 2015 and noted they had shares outstanding of their common stock   they also noted for the three months ended march 31 2014 that dividends were paid to both common stockholders and preferred stockholders and that there were series a preferred stock 3 million and series b preferred stock 10 million plus a statement in february 2015 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $ million of our outstanding common stock shares repurchased under these programs are accounted for as treasury stock carried at cost and reflected as a reduction to equity therefore the exact amount of dividend paid out will not be known until the next quarterly report which will state the exact amount of dividend paid out to common and preferred shareholders for the quarter

the way the wash sale works is your loss is added to your cost basis of the buy   so suppose your original cost basis is $ 10,000   you then sell the stock for $ 9,000 which accounts for your $ 1,000 loss   you then buy the stock again say for $   and sell it for $ 9,000   since your loss of $ 1,000 is added to your cost basis you actually still have a net loss of $ 500 you then buy the stock again for say $ 10,500   then sell it for $ 9,500   your $ 500 loss is added to your cost basis   and you have a net loss of $ 1,500 since you never had a net gain you will not owe any tax for these transactions

by living in sweden and having a swedish personal identification number you are required to declare your entire worldwide income for tax purposes with the swedish tax authorities it would seem to not make any difference if some of that income is kept outside of sweden a company that has no permanent base of operations within sweden should not deduct any preliminary taxes for an employee that lives in sweden rather the employee should apply for special a tax sa tax status and pay the taxes that had the company had a permanent base of operations in sweden the company would have paid the information available on the tax authority 's web site in english seems limited but the relevant page in swedish in your situation is very likely fast i there is a summary at paying taxes for individuals particularly do note the summary section when staying for at least six months you are considered as resident in sweden for tax purposes and are liable for taxation in sweden on all of your worldwide income you must also file a swedish income tax return your tax return must be filed no later than may 2nd of the year after the fiscal year as well as that if you stay in sweden for a continuous period of at least six months you are considered to be resident in sweden as a resident you are liable for taxation in sweden on all of your worldwide income in some cases a tax treaty with with your ordinary country of residence   may limit the swedish taxation for a more detailed answer including which exact forms you need to fill out and what data is needed i strongly recommend that you either contact they are usually quite nice to deal with and they tend to realize that everyone benefits from getting the tax paperwork and payments right from the beginning or find an attorney specializing in swedish tax law they even point out themselves that my emphasis the practical applications of these rules are relatively complicated and for more information you can contact the tax information at

that all depends   when you fire someone did you actually make the department operate more efficiently is the department just increasing their backlog of work delivering worse service are they having to authorize more overtime hours for the remaining employees or are they hiring contract labor to make up the difference   are you going to have to pay out severance packages or defend wrongful termination lawsuits   generally unless the layoffs are done via a long and slow workforce reduction process the savings ca n't be booked in any sort of a meaningful manner

i do n't do corporate tax exclusively but i do n't think you 're correct the idea of pre tax and post tax earnings is significantly different from corporations than individuals since individuals see their taxes come out when they earn it and corporations pay taxes quarterly   at the very least it 's certainly not equivalent to a charitable contribution

like all financial investments the value of a bond is the present value of expected future cash flows   the yield to maturity is the annualized return you get on your initial investment which is equivalent to the discount rate you 'd use to discount future cash flows so if you discount all future cashflows at 6 annually you can calculate the price of the bond so the price of a $ 1,000 bond which is how bond prices are typically quoted would be $ the current yield is just the current coupon payment divided by the current price which is or question 3 makes no sense since the yield to maturity would be the same if you bought the bond at market price question 4 talks about a sale date which makes me think that it assumes you sold the bond on the coupon date but you 'd have to know the sale price to calculate the rate of return

the etf is likely better in this case the etf will generally generate less capital gains taxes along the way   in order to pay off investors who leave a mutual fund the manager will have to sell the fund 's assets   this creates a capital gain which must be distributed to shareholders at the end of the year   the mutual fund holder is essentially taxed on this turnover   the etf does not have to sell any stock when an investor sells his shares because the investor sells the shares himself on the open market   this will result in a capital gain for the specific person exiting his position but it does not create a taxable event for anyone else holding the etf shares

you 're certainly still responsible to pay what you owe the company given that 1 for whatever reason the recipient never received the checks and 2 the money was credited back to you albeit in a less than timely manner however if you take the time to explain the situation to the business and show them proof that you sent the payments i would guess they would probably be willing to work with you on removing any late fees you have been assessed or possibly setting up a payment plan also if you have been charged any overdraft or minimum balance fees by your bank while they held your money for the payments that was eventually credited back to your account you might be able to get them to refund those if you explain what has happened this is really a perfect example though of why balancing your checking account is as important today as it ever was

if you pay 20 tax now and none later or if you pay no tax now and 20 later it does n't make a difference   mathematically it 's the same you have to guess about which tax rate now vs later will be higher for you in order for you to make the best choice   predicting tax rates 40 years in advance is hard   everybody pretends like they can do this accurately i would suggest going half and half if you have 20k and put half in pre tax 10k in and half in post tax only 8k in you end up with 18k total in which is right in the middle of where you would be if you went with the whole 20k in either extreme   it would also leave you owing 2k in tax rather than the possible 4k in tax if you had gone with all pre tax when you split down the middle you are guaranteed to have 50 in the right side the side with the best outcome being guaranteed to be 50 on the right side is pretty good compared to maybe being 100 on the wrong side

your question is n't great but i will attempt to answer this piece as it seems really the root of your personal finance question i want to convince my wife to make this move because it will save us    at least 800 month but she fails to see how buying a second home is    financially sound because we have to lose our savings and we have to    pay interest on our second home and her logic is it will take almost 5 years to get back our down payment    and we have to pay interest as well so how can this move help our    family financially in the long run is she right she is mostly wrong first consider that there is no roi really on your down payment assuming you are paying what your home would sell for the next day then your rio is already yours minus realtor fees she is talking about cash on hand not roi i will use an example without taking into account risk of home markets going down or other risks to ownership example let 's say you pay $ 2800 a month in mortgage at 5.5 apr and $ 200 a month in on a $ loan $ 400k house in this example let 's say the same house if you were to rent it is $ 3800 a month understand the opportunity cost of renting the marginal amount it costs you to not buy so far your opportunity cost is $ 800 a month the principle of your house will be increasing with each payment in our example it 's about $ 400 for the first payment and will increase with each payment made while decreasing the interest payment suggest you look at an amortization table for your specific mortgage example so you 're real number is now $ 1200 a month opportunity cost consider also the fact that the $ 400 a month is sitting in a savings account of sorts while most savings accounts give you less than 1 in returns and then charge taxes on that gain your home may or may not be much higher than that and wo n't charge you taxes on the gains when you sell it if you live in it for a period of time as defined by the irs let 's assume a conservative long term appreciation rate of 3 that 's $ 12k a year on a $ 400k house so now you 're at $ 2200 a month opportunity cost in this example i did n't touch on your tax savings of ownership i also did n't touch on the maintenance cost of ownership or the maintenance cost of renting your deposit + other fees which all should be considered you may have other costs involved in renting for instance the cost of not being able to fully utilize your rental as your own house this may be an even simpler and more convincing way to explain it on the $ 2800 mortgage example you will be paying around $ 19k in interest and $ 2400 on taxes insurance = $ 23k per year number could be way different in your example that is basically throw away money you 're never getting back on the rental 100 of your rent at $ 3800 a month is throw away money you 're never getting back that 's $ a year

this depends on a lot actually with the overall being your goals and how much you like risk    question what are your fees commissions for selling $ will wipe out some gains on those trades if all are sold with $ commission not including the commission payed when purchased that should be factored into the cost basis also i would recommend doing commission free etfs   you can get the same affect as a mutual fund without the fees associated with paying someone to invest in etfs and stocks on another note your portfolio looks rather risky   although everyone has their own risk preference so this might be yours but if you are thinking about a mutual fund instead of individual stocks you probably are risk averse i would suggest consulting with an adviser on how to set up for the future   financial advice is free flowing from your local barber dentist and of course stackexchange but i would look towards a professional disclaimer these are my thoughts and opinions only feel free to add comments below

mrchrister makes some good points but i saw his invitation to offer a counter opinion first there is a normal annual deposit limit of $ 13,000 per parent or donee this is the gift limit due to rise to $ 14,000 in 2013   if your goal is strictly to fund college and this limit is n't an issue for you the one account may be fine unless both kids are in school at the same time in that case you 're going to need to change beneficiaries every year to assign withdrawals properly   but as you mention there 's gift money that your considering depositing to the account in this case there 's really a legal issue the normal 529 allows changes in beneficiary and gifts to your child need to be held for that child in an irrevocable arrangement such as a utma account there is a 529 flavor that provides for no change of beneficiary a utma 529 clearly in that case you need separate accounts   in conclusion i think the single account creates more issues than it potentially solves if the true gift money from others is minimal maybe you should just keep it in a regular account edit on further reflection i strongly suggest you keep the relatives gifts in a separate account and when the kids are old enough to have legitimate earned income use this money to open and deposit to roth iras they can deposit the lesser of their earned income or $ 5000 in 2012 $ 5500 in 2013   this serves two goals avoiding the risk of gift money being stolen from one child for benefit of the other and putting it into an account that can help your children long term but not impact college aid as would a simple savings or brokerage account

new car loans used car loans and refinances have different rates because they have different risks associated with them different levels of ability to recoup losses if there is a default and different customer profiles   i 'm assuming third party lender for all of these questions not financing the dealer arranges as that has other considerations built into it a new car loan is both safer to some extent as the car is a known risk having no risk of damage etc prior to purchase but also harder to recoup losses because new cars immediately devalue significantly while used cars keep more of their value   thus the aprs are a little different in general for the same amount a new car will be a bit lower apr but of course used car loans are typically lower amounts refinance is also different customer profile wise the customer who is refinancing in these times is likely someone who is a higher risk as why are they asking for a loan when they 're mostly paid off their car   otherwise it 's fairly similar to a used car though probably a bit newer than the average used car

the simplest way to consolidate the funds your old 401(k plans is by doing what 's called a direct rollover whereby the funds go directly into the new plan and skips you completely from each of the old plans into either an ira that you establish with a provider of your choice or even into your current employer 's 401(k plan if that is available that way the funds are in one central account and available to invest plus it eliminates the mandatory 20 withholding if the rollover is indirect and is sent to you first before the deposit into the new plan it is important to bear in mind that you have 60 calendar days from the date of distribution to get the full amount into the new plan and a rollover is considered a tax reportable but not necessarily a taxable event provided you deposit the funds within the time frame allotted

the income tax was put into effect during the civil war but was later revoked because it was deemed unconstitutional   it was re in 1913 just one year before world war 1 this is largely the reason why people think it was created for the war when it actually pre dated world war 1 edit i do n't have any sources per se this is just what little information i remember from grade 10 history class   i remember this because i had a real ethical problem with how the government instituted the income tax since it is effectively a tax on productivity i find this absurd since it motivates people to do less in an effort to be taxed less this in turn promotes workers doing cash jobs and other such things to get around it i personally have refused a raise because it would put me into a higher tax bracket and i would n't see the new money in exchange i asked for other non monetary perks instead i personally think this situation should not exist however i do n't have a better solution so i suppose i ca n't really pass judgment

as a general proposition no you do not need to report money transfers into the us   if a transaction exceeds $ 10,000 then the bank must report it anyway   note that structuring your transactions to avoid a $ 10,000 deposit is illegal so be careful if you are moving lots of money as a general rule no transferring your own individual money from a foreign account to a us account does not incur taxes only lawyers are authorized to practice law in the us   they should generally be bar licensed in the state of practice   certified public accountants can assist you with tax preparation and return positions though tax lawyers may be necessary for some situations or for formal tax opinions   be sure to use an experienced advisor to file your tax returns and information reporting

it seems ideal to have the employment be all about both income and ethics but the problem is that for most people in the industry more often at one point or another they will have to choose between their income or their ethics    ethics should always hold supremacy over personal gain because ethics maintain the relationships formal and informal between entities involved in the markets without those long term relationships there is no room for trust and therefore no reason to be willingness for entities to exchange with one another   if you do n't have a overall fair financial markets on the long term it will hurt the overall economy why because people will have no trust in buying equity prices there will be no trust in prospects   people will save most of their money in cash and outright avoid anything or everything about investing   if there are less clients there is less capital for the entire industry   the trust of the aggregate non active investing clients with the capital range between million matters and to make it common knowledge to hold personal gain above them is not a good way to have them keep their money in the markets

yes there are a lot of places you can research stocks online google finance yahoo finance reuters etc it 's important to understand that the price of the stock does n't actually mean anything   share price is just a function of the market capitalization divided by the number of shares outstanding   as an example take two companies that are both worth $ 1 million but company a has issued 10,000 shares and company b has issued 100,000 shares   company a has a share price of $ 100 while company b has a share price of just $ 10   comparing share price does nothing to indicate the relative value or health of company a versus company b.    i know there are supposed to be no product recommendations but the dictionary area of investopedia.com is a good source of beginner investing information   and as joe points out below the questions here with the stock tag would also be a good place to start   and while i 'm on a roll the book a random walk down wall street is a good starting point in investing in the stock market

the time value decay is theoretically constant   in reality it is driven by supply and demand just like everything else in the market    for instance if a big earnings announcement is coming out after the close for the day you may see little or no time decay in the price of the options during the day before also while in theory options have a set value as related to the trading price of the underlying security that does not mean there will always be a buyer willing to pay a premium as they come close to expiration in the last few minutes you ca n't forget to account for the transaction fees associated with buying the options or the risk factor involved    it is rare but there are times i 've actually had to sell in the money calls at a penny or two less than they 're actually worth at the time just to unload them in the last few minutes before the market closed on expiration day

no   the wsj prime rate is 4.25 even the fed prime rate is 1.75 way above the 1.20 you 'll be making from your savings account if you are high worth individual with great credit history the bank might give you a personal loan at 4.25 they wo n't care what you do with it as long as they get their payments if you are not that creditworthy they 'll ask for a collateral you can mortgage your house for example it ends up being the thing you get your money and do what you want with it if you can make more than the interest rate the bank gave you great you made profit the bank however wo n't agree to lend you money at 0.6 1/2 of the 1.2 apy your savings account will bring why would they when they can loan that at prime rate of 4.25 the closest you can get to something like this is if you are a hot shot wall street money manager with track record of making big profits in that case the bank might put some money in your fund for you to manage but that 's not something a regular person can do

as one can see here the world population is growing assuming worldwide demand for gold is a function of population the question you have to ask is whether gold mining outpaces population growth just it i 'd say they 're about even although annual production is far keep in mind that gold extraction is not an easy process though at the end of the day gold is only worth what you can trade it for just like any other store of value

one thing you did n't mention is whether the 401(k offers a match if it does this is a slam dunk the $ $ right is $ that will be doubled on deposit it 's typical for the first 5 of one 's salary to capture the match so this is right there   in 15 years you 'll still owe $ but 15 $ is $ in your 401(k even without taking any growth into account the likely value of that 401(k is closer to $ 210 k using 8 over that 15 years at 6 it drops to only $ k but as i stated the value of the match is so great that i 'd jump right on that if you do n't get a match of any kind i need to edit completely rip my answer it into whether you feel that 15 years really 30 the market will exceed the 4 cost of that money odds are it will the worst 15 year period this past century 2000 2014 still had a cagr of 4.2

all things being equal a $ job with 25 benefit load is about $ that 's a little more than $ your rate really depends on the nature of the work if it 's strictly a part time job where you are an employee you 're probably looking at a $ 28 range if you 're an independent contractor the rate should be higher as you 're paying the taxes doing other administrative stuff how much higher depends on the industry software it rates are usually 1.5 2x construction is driven by the union scale in many places etc note that you need to meet criteria defined by the irs to successfully maintain independent contractor status from a tax pov

a fair number of micro finance organisations have been listing recently and appear to be offering good yields   so you could simply buy their stock rather than investing directly is an indian micro financier that went public just a few weeks ago the interest rates charged can be extremely high to match the low yield per lender   as has been mentioned kiva does n't return interest to the lender   however kiva does n't lend directly either   they on lend to local who will lend at whatever interest rate the local market will bear the range of interest rates applied to micro credit loans can be   45 to 85 in africa 30 in india and a jaw dropping 155 in mexico however these high rates of return have attracted an absolute of investors in mexico more than 300 micro credit banks compete for business chuck the founder of transparency is concerned that there is an bubble lenders are starting to take out more loans than they can afford and banks are doing little to curb that appetite for debt   sound familiar so you may not want to lend directly but definitely consider looking at listed in places like brazil and india   as usual though study the company carefully

so basically the bar has been lowered due to the fact that so many people do n't qualify for credit the medical debt issue is one thing but the fact that only 28 of home purchases these days are first time home buyers instead of 40 says more about our unaffordable higher educational system labor market and people 's ability to earn decent income than it does about credit being too tight   if anything this is a of standards since the banks have no alternative in order to drum up new sales they 're 12 off the mark and they 're finding ways to close the gap wages probably wo n't get better so they 're better off accepting lower quality customers and rolling the dice on their ability to pay off debts over the life of the loans they issue   sounding familiar

assuming my math is correct and that i 'm not missing something about roth investments it appears to me that either option will work out exactly the same if you will be in the same tax bracket in retirement this is true only if your average tax rate in retirement is the same as your current marginal rate i 'm surprised none of the answers mention this since it is the crux of your question   if you can deduct an ira against your income taxes it is almost always better option than the roth equivalent marginal rates should not be compared to average rates or you will form all sorts of inaccurate conclusions if you are in a lower tax rate in retirement traditional is better really means if your average tax rate in retirement is lower than your current marginal rate traditional is better which for the overwhelming majority of americans is the case consider the following let 's say your intend to contribute $ 1000 in one year making $ 2k and withdraw it the next that is your only income in that year your tax brackets look like this is quite simplified but for this purpose will illustrate precisely why comparisons like you are making are very misleading in this case you can put $ 1000 in and pay no income tax at all because you deduct it you then withdraw $ 1000 the next year the first $ 500 you withdraw you pay no taxes on and the next $ 500 has a tax rate of 15 for a total tax of of $ 75 however this is a tax against your entire withdrawal of $ 1000 so your average tax rate this is important average is different than marginal is only 7.5 and you are left with $ in this case you can only contribute $ 850 to the ira because you are taxed against the money at your marginal rate 15 when you withdraw it you do n't pay any taxes and are left with the entire $ 850 $ 850 this is less than the above because you are taxed the whole amount at your previous marginal rate if however your tax rate in retirement was 30 for everything above $ 500 only then are the two scenarios equal your marginal tax rate in retirement has to be very high relative to your current tax rate for the roth to ever catch up and be better if you are able to deduct an ira contribution it will almost always be the best option the average federal income tax rate on middle class families has not changed dramatically enough over the past 50 years to be above normal marginal tax rates even at the 15 federal tax bracket your marginal rate is still higher than the highest average tax rate for the past 50 years by at least 3 and normally significantly so the reason i make this point about middle class marginal rates is that the majority of taxes might be higher in retirement is very unlikely to be the case in a meaningful way given the past 50 years however if you are in the top tax rate you are paying historic low tax rates by a factor of nearly 3 but also observe you ca n't do either ira since you must make $ 400k year the difference for middle class is no where near as noticeable keep in mind if you ca n't deduct there is no reason to not contribute to the roth there are other factors contributing to the traditional roth decision this answer only addresses the specifics in your question

i am not a lawyer nor a tax accountant so if such in here i 'll gladly defer but my understanding is   if you 're involved and living together you 're considered a household and thus your finances are deemed shared for tax purposes any money your partner gives you toward paying the bills is not considered rent but her contribution to household expenses i do n't know the but i 'll call your partner her for convenience this is not income and is not taxed on the off chance that the irs actually investigated your arrangement do n't call any money she gives you rent call it her contribution to living expenses if you were two or more random people sharing a condo purely for economic reasons i.e. you are not a family in any sense but each of you would have trouble affording a place on your own it 's common for all the room mates to share the rent or mortgage utilities etc but for one person to collect all the money and write one check to the landlord etc tax law does not see this as the person who writes the check collecting rent from the others it 's just a book keeping convenience and so there is no taxable transaction of course the landlord owes taxes on the rental income but that 's not your problem in that case it likely would be different if one person outright owned the place and really was charging the others rent but then he could claim deductions for all the expenses of maintaining it including depreciation so if it really was a case of room mates sharing expenses the taxable income would likely be just about zero anyway so short answer if you really are a couple there are no taxable transactions here if the irs should actually question it do n't refer to it as collecting rent or any other words that imply this is a business arrangement describe it as a couple sharing expenses people sometimes have created tax problems for themselves by their choice of words in an audit but the chance that you would ever be audited over something like this is probably remote i suppose that if at some point you break up but you continue to live together for financial reasons or whatever reasons that could transform this into a business relationship and that would change my answer

strictly speaking the terms arise from double entry book keeping terminology and do n't exactly relate to their common english usage which is part of the confusion all double entry book keeping operations consist of a debit credit performed on two different books ledgers   the actual arithmetic operation performed by a debit or a credit depends on the book keeping classification of the ledger it is performed on liability accounts behave the way you would expect a debit is subtraction and a credit is addition asset accounts are the other way around a debit is an addition and a credit is a subtraction   the confusion when dealing with banks partly comes from this classification since while your deposit account is your asset it is the bank 's liability so when you deposit 100 cash at the bank it will perform the operation debit cash account an asset credit deposit account each ledger account will have 100 added to it similarly when you withdraw cash the operation is credit cash debit deposit however the operation that your accountant will perform on your own books is the opposite since the cash was your asset and now the deposit account is for those studying math it may also help to know that double entry book keeping is one of the earliest known examples of a single error detection correction algorithm

let me paint you a picture to show you why this does not make sense     it is never fair to ask a business to pay a living wage it is always fair to ask a worker to chose their jobs based on their needs   here 's why   i ran a business when i was a teenager doing web development i did not make very good money but it pushed me to learn and to teach myself to meet the needs of the few clients that i did manage to find   over the course of the business the thought had crossed my mind to maybe get help from my peers maybe talk to classmates and see if any of them might have wanted to go into business with me help me drum up more work or help me do design or development     as soon as the thought crossed my mind i realized right away that i would never be able to do it because the regulation was just way too big for little old sole proprietorship me to deal with   not only was it confusing but it was dangerous to me if i did it wrong i knew i   could be sued and lose more than my tiny little business made     on top of the regs involved i personally was not making minimum wage   what i was making though was experience   this was more valuable than all the money i made combined because i worked this way by myself for three years learning more about my craft all the while   i have that experience into a ten year long career that currently supports my family working for someone else   now imagine if i could pay anyone whatever we both agreed on   imagine if i could talk to a in highschool and say hey i m not making much but i can pay you x to start with and i will certainly teach you what i know   it always struck me as selfish unearned moral superiority to sit here and mandate a minimum wage you price teenagers and entry level workers out of the market because people ca n't afford an army of $ 20 per hour workers   its so ignorant of the narrow margins that these business have to face   it is also really short sighted and money obsessed to boil a job down to it 's wages alone   minimum wage destroys an ancient method of generating skilled workers the apprentice system   also there is a really ugly moral side to this   person a offers person b x amount to do y why does the government have the right to say no you ca n't pay them x because it is not x enough   our economy and work is far more complex than minimum wage it is an old idea that is nothing but a drain on our economy   tl;dr i would have added three or more skilled workers to our economy in high school if i did not have to pay them minimum wage   i personally was priced out of hiring people because of it so i hate it     millennials need not wonder why no one can find a job

i think india and africa are going to center of the economic growth market in the next two decades probably more india since they have the means to develop and a culture that wants it i think the growth rates are all relative but you obviously know the standard growth rate of the sp500 i just ca n't see it falling because we are still in the middle of a complete globalization and i really think it wo n't be over before i retire it will probably africa 50 years before they reach a first world living standards we enjoy now god only knows what we will have as the definition of first world by then    the medical industry alone will drive a large portion of growth cyber security is going to be the next frontier in tech as the internet of things explode into our daily life    i am not as weary about long term growth we are always innovating and creating new markets the beauty of the sp500 is that it does n't even have to be in the us to make money off it

you do not need to inform your employer of your additional activity but it is your responsibility not to work for more than 48 hours per week as long as you are an employee so if you are working 38 hours for your employer you may not work for yourself for more than 10 hours it is however not so easy in practice to draw the line between work and a hobby as long as you are not being paid by the hour the main reason to present your employer with an addition to your work contract is to make it legally very clear that he holds no intentions to claim copyright to your work he may attempt to do something funky like claim your home computer is in fact a work computer because you used it once a month to work from home and your work contract may contain a paragraph that all work performed on a work computer results in copyright ownership for your employer i have no idea how likely this is in practice but this is the reason i know is commonly given as legal advice to have a contract so the normal contract you present your employer with says in order to earn user contribution money from a website you need to register as a sole proprietor and pay trade tax and sales tax alternatively you claim small trade exception which also makes a tax return mandatory i would guess however and this is not legal advice in any way just my guess that a couple of contributions towards server cost in a strictly non profit endeavor is not commercial at all but private in the same way that you may write an invoice to someone you sold your old bike to or a kid may get paid to mow someone 's lawn based on that guess my non legal advice recommendation is to take the contributions and do nothing else as long as the amount is nowhere near breaking even if you count your work input

i think that if the price does not go very far up then your order will open on 101 because you are setting a limit order if suddenly the price goes up very quickly or with a even then you may not be given a position but this is with a limit order and it is better to check with the broker there are also warrants in which you can adjust the price range for example from 101 to 103 and at a sharp price jump it is possible for you and would not give a position at a price of 101 but perhaps 103 would get

you should start by calling the clinic and asking them to tell you how the visit was coded some clinics have different billing codes based on the complexity of the visit if you have one thing you are seeing the doctor about that could be coded differently than if you have 4 things you are seeing the doctor about in fact even if you are there just for one but while you are there you happen to ask a few quick questions about other possible ailments the doctor could decide to use the billing code for the higher complexity if when speaking to the billing department it is determined that the visit is using a higher complexity billing code and a higher charge as a result you could then request that it be re coded with the lower complexity visit realize if you request that they will probably have to first get approval from the doctor that saw you note i am basing this answer on first hand experience about 6 months ago in illinois where the situation i described happened to me because i asked some unrelated questions about other possible ailments at the end of a visit to an after hours clinic the billing department explained that my visit was coded for 4 issues 3 of them were quick questions i asked about at the end of the visit one of which she referred me to another doctor my additional questions probably extended the visit by 3 4 minutes in my case i never got the bill reduced mainly due to my own laziness and my knowing that i would hit my deductible anyway this year of course i ca n't say for sure if this is what happened in your case or even if this practice is widespread this was the first and only time in my life that i encountered it as a side note your primary doctor would likely rarely ever bill you for a more complex visit as it likely would n't lead to much repeat business as for your last question regarding your credit if the provider decides to lower the price and you pay the lower price this in no way can affect your credit surprising update when i called the billing office months ago i had asked if they could confirm the code with the doctor and i was told they would look into it i never heard back never followed up and assumed that was the end of it well today i got a call back months later and was informed that they had re coded the visit which will result in a lower charge it 's still pending the insurance adjustment but at some point in the future i expect to receive either a credit on my next statement or a check in the mail the price difference pre insurance in my case has gone from $ to $ 235 update i did receive a check for the difference the check was dated july 20 2016 which is just over 2 months after the phone call informing me i would receive it

the answer seems to depend on where you live   perhaps you already found this but the summary from the irs is the insurance laws in some states do not allow a corporation to purchase group health insurance when the corporation only has one employee therefore if the shareholder was the sole corporate employee the shareholder had to purchase his health insurance in his own name the irs issued notice 2008 1 which ruled that under certain situations the shareholder would be allowed an above the line deduction even if the health insurance policy was purchased in the name of the shareholder notice 2008 1 provided four examples including three examples in which the shareholder purchased the health insurance and one in which the s corporation purchased the health insurance notice 2008 1 states that if the shareholder purchased the health insurance in his own name and paid for it with his own funds the shareholder would not be allowed an above the line deduction on the other hand if the shareholder purchased the health insurance in his own name but the s corporation either directly paid for the health insurance or reimbursed the shareholder for the health insurance and also included the premium payment in the shareholder ’s w-2 the shareholder would be allowed an above the line deduction the bottom line is that in order for a shareholder to claim an above the line deduction the health insurance premiums must ultimately be paid by the s corporation and must be reported as taxable compensation in the shareholder ’s w-2 i understand this to mean that you can only get the deduction in your case having purchased it in your own name if your state does not allow your s corp to purchase a group health plan because you only have one employee i do n't know specifically if illinois fits that description or not   in addition there are rules about reporting health insurance premiums for taxes for s corp share members that you should also check   personally i think that it 's complicated enough that advice from a cpa or other tax advisor specific to your situation would be worth the cost

the dividend tax credit is not applicable to foreign dividend income so you would be taxed fully on every dollar of that income when you sell a stock there will be a capital gain or capital loss depending on if it gained or lost value after accounting for the adjusted cost base you only pay income tax on half of the amount earned through capital gains and if you have losses you can use them to offset other investments that had capital gains or carry forward to offset gains in the future   the dividends from us stocks are subject to a 15 withholding tax that gets paid to the irs automatically when the dividends are issued if the stocks are held in an rrsp they are exempt from the withholding tax if held in a non registered account you can be reimbursed for the tax by claiming the foreign tax credit that you linked to if held in a tfsa or resp the withholding tax can not be recovered also if you are not directly holding the stocks and instead buy a mutual fund or etf that directly holds the stocks then the rrsp exemption no longer applies but the foreign tax credit is still for a non registered account if the mutual fund or etf does not directly hold stocks and instead holds one or more etfs there is no way to recover the withholding tax in any type of account

whether or not you choose to buy is a complicated question   i will answer as what you should consider think about as i do n't think what should i do is on topic first off renting tends to look expensive compared to mortgages until you factor in the other costs that are included in your rent property taxes   these are a few grand a year even in the worst areas and tend to be more   find out what the taxes are ahead of time   even though you can often deduct them and your interest you 're giving up your standard deduction to do so and with the low interest regime currently unless your taxes are high you may not end up being better off deducting them home insurance this depends on home and area but is at least hundreds of dollars per year and could easily run a thousand   so another hundred a month on your bill and it 's more than renter 's insurance by quite a lot upkeep costs for the property   you 've got a lot of up front costs buy a etc types of things plus a lot of ongoing costs general repair plumbing breaks electrical breaks whatnot    sales commission as scott notes in comments   when you sell you 're paying about 6 commission so you wo n't be above water if housing prices stay flat until you 've paid off 6 of your loan value plus closing costs another couple of percent   you hit the 90 point on a 15 year about year 2 but on a 30 year you do n't hit it until about year 5 so you might not be above water when you want to sell risk of decrease in value whenever you buy property you take on the risk of losing value as well as the potential of gaining value   do n't assume that because prices are going up they will continue to remember that a lot of investors are well aware of possible profits from rising prices and will be buying and driving prices up themselves   2008 was a shock to a lot of people even in areas where it seemed like prices should 've still gone up you never know what 's going to happen   if you buy a house for 20 or so down you have a bit of a safety net if it drops 10 20 in value you 're still above water though you do of course lose money while if you buy it for 0 down and it drops 20 in value you wo n't be able to sell at all for years all that together means you should really take a hard look at the costs and benefits make a realistic calculation including all actual costs and then make a decision i would not buy simply because it seems like a good idea to not pay rent   if you 're unable to make any down payment then you 're also unable to deal with the risks in home ownership not just decrease in value but when your pipe bursts and ruins your basement or when the roof needs a replacement because a tree falls on it   yes home insurance helps but not always and the deductible will still get you just to have some numbers for my area we pay about $ 8000 a year in property taxes on a $ 280k house $ 200k mortgage $ 1k a year in home insurance so our escrow payment is about $ 750 a month   a 15 year for $ 200k is about $ 1400 a month so $ 2200 or so total cost   we do live in a high property tax area so someone in lower tax regimes would pay less say 1800 1900 but not that cheap   a 30 year would save you 500 or so a month but you 're still not all that much lower than rent

i have had pension programs with two companies   the first told you what your benefit would be if you retired at age x with y years of service each year of service got you a percentage of your final years salary there was a different formula for early retirement and there was an offset for social security they were responsible for putting enough money away each year to meet their obligations just before i left they did add a new feature you could get the funds in the account in a lump sum when you left if you left early you got the money in the account if you left at retirement age you got the money that was needed to produce the benefit you were promised which was based on current interest rates the second company had a plan where they published the funding formula you knew with every quarterly statement how much was in your account and what interest it had earned and what benefit they estimated you would receive if you stayed until retirement age this fund felt almost like a defined contribution because the formula was published if most people took the lump sum that was the only part that mattered both pension plans had a different set of formulas based on marriage status and survivor rules the interest rates are important because they are used to determine how much money is needed to produce the promised monthly benefit they are also used to determine how much they need to allocate each year to cover their obligations   if you ca n't make the math work you need to keep contacting hr you need to understand how much should be flowing into the account each month

thanks for quoting the meat of the article i agree with the gp i did n't have the patience to make it to page 2 but this meat is still textured flavored soy protein   gt well one of the reasons there 's no place to invest the cash is that wages as a percentage of gdp have fallen by so much that workers ca n't afford to buy anything any more   what   this manages to be both circular and wrong on multiple levels   our workers ca n't afford our product so we ca n't spend all this cash rolling in on them   gt we kept profits to a minimum because if we had high profits we would have to pay high taxes so at every opportunity we bought another machine or we opened another plant or we hired more people to try to build long term value through expansion because that was the way you avoided tax   ah daddy had the luxury of operating in a non saturated market   meanwhile google apple and microsoft piss away money as fast as they can on all sorts of basic research and yet still have massive stockpiles   but then i think that touches on the real problem with hanauer 's point it 's just plain   we live in a world where the governments have become so dysfunctional that private industry is now funding things like space exploration energy policy education transportation

when you place a bid between the bid ask spread that means you are raising the bid or lowering the ask if you are selling the nbbo national best bid and offer is now changed because of your action and yes certain kinds of orders may be set to react to that a higher bid or lower ask triggering them also many algorithms that have n't already an order simply waiting for a trigger like in a stop limit read the bid and ask and are programmed to then place an order at that point

people worked a long time before business existed but i believe what works best for the greatest number of people is regulated capitalism mixed with a limited socialism and a strong social safety net aka social democracy but i believe that when a few people gain too much power control too many of a country 's resources that they distort or destroy it they make almost everyone 's life worse just to make their own better historically i see that again and again    past a certain point money ceases to be money and becomes power people with great wealth have power over the american people power they hold without being elected by the people power that does not end with their term of office power that can not be stripped from them for bad behavior no one should be allowed to have that much unelected power we should use progressive income taxes and estate taxes to strip power a.k.a money from such individuals and families this should be done to keep the from using unelected power for greedy or evil purposes

if i were you i would pay off my student loans today or tomorrow   would n't it be nice to be completely debt free and not owe anyone anything   it does n't matter what the interest rate of the loan is there is no need to spend anymore time trying to worry about whether or not the market will allow you to make a tiny bit extra over what you are spending in interest on the loan   just get rid of the debt and you will get to keep every bit of the growth of your investments from here on out after the student loans are paid off that leaves you with $ 15k   i would take $ 10k and put it in a savings account for an emergency fund and put $ 5k as a start toward your retirement savings in a roth ira at this point with a fully funded emergency fund a start on your retirement savings and no debts you have really set yourself up for success   learn how to budget your income so that you spend less than you make and can save up toward goals like a car paid for in cash and a down payment on a house

if you receive a loan from your parents it is treated legally just as a loan a bank or from any private person with spare money you do n't pay tax on a loan that you get from your bank or your parents and the bank or your parents do n't pay tax when you repay the loan if you pay interest the parents will have to pay tax on the interest just like they would have to pay tax if the money was in their own bank account   i would advice both you and your parents to make sure that a contract is signed saying that this is a loan and how it is repaid and that you follow the contract otherwise if you or your parents treat the loan as an actual present then you might have to pay tax because there is tax due on gifts and you might get a penalty for trying to avoid tax by declaring the gift as a loan so pay the money back only up to £ 3,000 in cash gifts that a person gives each year is tax free but the parents can use any unused money from last year so they can give a gift of £ 6,000 if they gave nothing in the previous year and it is per parent so both the mother and father can make a gift

a diversified portfolio such as a 60 stocks 40 bonds balanced fund is much more predictable and reliable than an all stocks portfolio and the returns are perfectly adequate the extra returns on 100 stocks vs. 60 are 1.2 per year historically according to to get those average higher stock returns you need to be thinking 20 30 years even 10 years is too short term over the 20 30 years you must never panic and go to cash or you will destroy the higher returns you must never get discouraged and stop saving or you will destroy the higher returns you have to avoid the panic and despite the likelihood that some 10-year period in your 20 30 years the stock market will go nowhere you also must never have an emergency or other reason to withdraw money early if you look at dry periods in stocks like 2000 to 2011 a 60/40 portfolio made significant money and stocks went nowhere a diversified portfolio means that price volatility makes you money due to rebalancing while a 100 stocks portfolio means that price volatility is just a lot of stress with no benefit it 's somewhat possible probably to predict dry periods in stocks if i remember the statistics about 50 of the variability in the market price 10 years out can be explained by normalized market valuation normalized = adjusted for business cycle and abnormal profit margins some funds such as are completely based on this though a lot of money managers consider it with a balanced portfolio and rebalancing though you do n't have to worry about it very much in my view the proper goal is not to beat the market nor match the market nor is it to earn the absolute highest possible returns instead the goal is to have the highest chance of financing your non financial goals such as retirement or buying a house to maximize your chances of supporting your life goals with your financial decisions predictability is more important than maximized returns your results are primarily determined by your savings rate which realistic investment returns will never compensate for if it 's too low you can certainly make a projection in which 1.2 difference in returns makes a big difference but you have to remember that a projection in which value steadily and predictably compounds is not the same as real life where you could have emergency or emotional factors where the market will move and might have a big plunge at just the wrong time end of the 40 years and so on if your plan relies on the extra 1.2 returns then it 's not a reasonable plan anyhow in my opinion since you ca n't count on them so why suffer the stress and extra risk created by an all stocks portfolio

as others have pointed out it 's all about a fixed small cost versus the potential of a large cost if you have insurance you know you will pay a fixed amount per month there is a 100 probability that you will have to pay this premium if you do n't have insurance there is a large chance that you will have no cost in any given month and a small chance that you will have a large cost like my home owners insurance costs me about $ 50 per month if i did n't have insurance and my house burned down i would be out something like $ 100,000 what 's the chance that my house will burn down this month very small but i 'd rather pay $ 50 and not have to worry about it on the other hand i just bought a filing cabinet for $ 160 and the store offered me an extended warranty for something like $ 20 a year what 's the probability that some accident will happen that damages my filing cabinet pretty small even if it did i think i could handle shelling out $ 160 i can imagine my stomach in knots and lying awake at nights worrying about the possibility of losing $ 100,000 or finding myself homeless i ca n't imagine lying awake at nights worrying about losing $ 160 or being force to stuff my files under the bed i 'll take my chances when i was young and had even less money than i have now i bought cars that cost me a thousand dollars or even poor as i was i knew that if the car was totaled i could dig up the cash to buy another it was n't worth paying the insurance premium these days i 'm driving a car that cost me $ 6,000 i have collision and comprehensive insurance but i think it 's debatable i bought the car with cash to begin with and if i had to i could scrape up the cash to replace it especially considering that my last payment for my daughter 's college tuition is due next month and then that expense is gone

gt;why not give extra tax breaks for the sale of stock purchased during a public offering since that goes to helping the company but not for secondhand less necessary trading   because secondary trading determines how easy it is for companies to raise additional money and it also allows the company to manipulate private vs publicly held stakes in their company   we give big tax breaks to people who lend businesses money   there 's a difference between lending money and investing in a corporation furthermore the income tax code when it comes to lending money via bonds is a complete mess corporate bond coupons are taxed like regular income although the principal return is of course tax free federal and are taxed differently there is also the advantage that you do get a tax break in the event of default so any additional risk you take on has some marginal tax benefits

my answer is similar to ben miller 's but let me make some slightly different points there is one excellent reason to get a consolidation loan you can often get a lower interest rate if you are presently paying 19 on a credit card and you can roll that into a personal loan at you 'll be saving over 5 which can add up i would definitely not consolidate a loan at into a loan at then you 're just adding 1 to your interest rate what 's the benefit in this another good reasons for a consolidation loan is psychological a consolidation loan with fixed payments forces you to pay that amount every month you say you have trouble with credit cards it 's very easy to say to yourself oh just this month i 'm going to pay just the minimum so i can use my cash for this other very important thing that i need to buy and then next month you find something else that you just absolutely have to buy and again the next month and the next and your determination to seriously pay down your debt keeps getting pushed off if you have a fixed monthly payment you ca n't you 're committed also if you have many credit cards juggling payments on all of them can get complex and confusing it 's easy to lose track of how much you owe and to budget for payments at worst when there are many bills to pay you may forget one personally i now have 3 bank cards an airline card and 2 store cards and managing them is getting out of hand i have good reasons for having so many cards the airline card and the store cards give me special discounts but it 's confusing to keep track of as to adding $ 3,000 to the consolidation loan very very bad idea you are basically saying i have to start seriously paying down my debt tomorrow today i need a some extra cash so i 'm going to borrow just a little bit more but i 'm going to get started paying it off next month this is a trap and the sort of trap that leads people into spiraling debt start paying off debt now not at some vague time in the future that never seems to come

typically the higher interest rates in local currency cover about the potential gain from the currency exchange rate change if not people would make money out of it however you only know this after the fact so either way you are taking a risk depending on where the local economy goes it is more secure to go with us$ or more risky your guess is as good as anyone if you see a chance for a serious meltdown of the local economy with inflation ratios and possibly new money you are probably better off with us$ on the other hand if the economy develops better than expected you might have lost some percentage of gain generally investing in a more stable currency gets you slightly less but for less risk

there may well be several such graphs i expect googling will turn them up but the definition of risk is actually quite important here my definition of risk might not be quite the same as yours so the relative risk factors would be different for example in general stocks are more risky than bonds   but owning common shares in a blue chip company might well be less risky than owning bonds from a company on the edge of bankruptcy and no single risk number can really capture that another example while i can put all my money in short term deposits and it is pretty safe if it grows at 1 so that my investment portfolio can not fund my retirement then i have a risk that i will run out of money before i shuffle off this mortal   how to capture that risk in a single number so you will need to better define your parameters before you can prepare a visual aid good luck

you 're not being over taxed the withholding is just aggressive   employer 's do n't know your whole tax situation all they can go on is the amount they pay you minus deductions then extrapolate that to an annual number and withhold according to your w4 you could ratchet up your w4 exemptions and this will help your current withholding   when you do your taxes next april this will all shake out and you will likely receive a large refund    it 's also worth noting that your federal withholding given the numbers above is just about 19 not 27 which does match the federal tax table if your annual income was $ 72,000 as your semi monthly paycheck indicates   that should be closer to 14 at an annual income of $ 36,000   the medicare related taxes are flat amounts   so really you 're talking about an approximately 5 discrepancy on the $ 18,000 you 'll earn during this internship or about $ 900 if you feel like you 're being welcome to paying taxes

this is colloquially referred to as a pump and dump scheme you basically buy up some stock and then try to pump up the demand through false and misleading positive statements and market activity you then close your position once market interest is sufficiently high if your firm has access to high frequency trading mechanisms you may even be able to front run other market participants attracted by your buying activities   gt;i am wondering what is the best route to go down   definitely micro cap stocks things listed on the otc markets especially penny stocks have this tendency to attract retail buyers just begging to be scammed emerging biotech firms also have a lot of potential due to investors hopes of successful clinical trials   i should warn you though this is very illegal and falls under market manipulation according to the fast answers and can lead to up to 25 years in prison so make sure you stay small enough to avoid the regulatory radar   but seriously this belongs in r personalfinance or elsewhere r finance is n't the sub you want

if you repair your phone when your current balance is paid off could you get the same coverage for less money or would your monthly payment remain the same regardless that would be the easiest comparison to make   ie pay an extra $ 49 to have the phone replaced ie the cost of using the insurance program for $ vs the cost of buying out your plan for $ 100 get a slightly worse phone instead of upgrading but save $ 15 month for the next 2 years this would pay off economically within 3 4 months but the phone would be older not sure if you care about that

everyone is perfectly free to instantaneously decide that a dollar is worth only of an orange and oranges would instantly cost a billion dollars oranges cost less than that not because the government sets the price of oranges but purely because that 's what the market agrees to    this shows a profound misunderstanding of how fiat currencies work   the demand for fiat currencies comes from the fact they are necessary to pay taxes and debts   other currencies commodities will not be recognized as settlement of debts in court disputes so they would first need to be sold onto the market in exchange for the fiat currency   individuals ca n't simply decide what the relative value of certain goods and services are   the market does that collectively via voluntary trade   gt;i'm explaining internal combustion for a 5-year old and you 're calling it inaccurate and misleading because it does n't address the sociological implications of american car culture    hahah you 're confusing the oil for the gasoline

its pretty much always a positive to have large institutional investors here 's a few cases where i can see an argument against large institutional investors in recent years we 've seen corporate raiders and institutional investors that tend to influence management in ways that are focused on short term gain they 'll often go for board seats and disrupt the existing management team it can serve as a distraction and really hurt morale institutional investors also have rules in their prospectus that they are required to abide by for example some institutional investors will not hold on to stock below $ 5 this really affected major banking stocks some of which ended up doing reverse stock splits to keep their share price high institutional investors will also setup specific funds that require a stock to be listed as part of an index i.e. the spy djia etc when a stock is removed from an index big investors leave quickly and the share price suffers   in recent months companies like apple have made their share price more affordable to attract retail investors it gives an opportunity for retail to feel even more connected to the company i 'm not sure how much this affects overall sales generally a good stock should be able to attract both retail and institutional investors if there 's not a good mix then its usually a sign that somethings

let me start by hedging a little bit our industry finance i mean is cyclical and disciplines tend to surge to fall then to rise from the fixed income was dead then fixed income was the place to be then everyone got laid off then there was a huge rally etc etc   but if you get into the wrong area at the wrong time well it does n't really matter if it recovers in 20 years does it as the great man wrote in the long run we 're all dead   regarding equity research and here i especially mean sell side equity research the super volatile markets have made it harder for traditional equity funds to out a living much less to meet investor expectations so margins have gotten thinner the increased correlations and increased volatility has just made stock picking less productive as a strategy   as a result traditional equity funds have cut back on their trading activity have consolidated their business to one or two brokers and have stopped explicitly paying for research this means fewer soft and hard dollars flowing to less research furthermore sell side research is less productive these days it was just easier in the old bull market there was more room to find value and pick stocks    all of these factors are contributing to a decline in the research business as evidenced by the layoffs we can all find by searching google news   all that having been said buy side research is a different story but the strategies are more complex and you really have to deliver value to your pm in a timely manner

you can expect about a 7 return when investing in the general market if your horizon is ten years or more the market fluctuates which means that you should be absolutely fine with losing 10 or more of your invested money during this period you say yourself that i have been setting aside money into a savings account earmarked for that purpose repairs maintenance so that i do n't have to take out loans it 's obvious from your question that the purpose of this money is not savings this is money that you are already investing not in stocks or bonds but in your house while this money sits around of course you could put it into the market and hope that it grows it all depends on your horizon which in your case sounds like about 1 year is that long enough to be fairly sure you will make a profit from what i 've written so far hopefully you can gather that the answer is no if you choose to invest $ 6,000 but you need that money back in one year you need to be aware of the risk that you 'll instead end up with $ or even less your options are then to if you 're asking for personal advice my opinion would be this you 're already investing in your house the housing market like most markets fluctuate whether you like it or not you 're already a victim or of this value fluctuation the difference is that a house is something you 'll live in for a long time probably that will give you daily joy in a way stocks and bonds wo n't of course saving up money and investing them is always a good idea anyway you should still save a small amount every month and put it into low medium risk bonds in my opinion

many of my friends said i should invest my money on stocks or something else instead of put them in the bank forever i do not know anything about finance so my questions are first let me say that your friends may have the best intentions but do n't trust them it has been my experience that friends tell you what they would do if they had your money and not what they would actually do with their money now i do n't mean that they would be malicious or that they are out to get you   what i do mean is why would you take advise from someone about what they would do with 100k when they do n't have 100k i am in your financial situation more or less and i have friends that make more then i do and have no savings or that will tell you to get an ira and so but do n't have the means discipline to do so do not listen to your friends on matters of money that 's just good all around advise is my financial status ok if not how can i improve it any financial situation with no or really low debt is ok i would say 5 of annual income in unsecured debt or 2 3 years in annual income in secured debt is a good place to be that is a really hard mark to hit it seems you have hit it so your good right now you may want to plan for the future immediate goals that i always tell people are 6 months of income stuck in a liquid savings account then start building a solid investment situation and a decent retirement plan this protects you from short term situations like loss of job while doing something for the future    is now a right time for me to see a financial advisor is it worthy how would she he help me rather it 's worth it or not to use a financial adviser is going to be totally opinion based personally i think they are worth it others do not i see it like this unless you want to spend all your time looking up money stuff the adviser is going to have a better grasp of money stuff then you because they do spend all their time doing it that being said there is one really important thing to consider that is going to be how you pay the adviser the following are my observations you will need to make up your own mind   free avoid like the plague these advisers are usually provided by the bank and make their money off commission or kickbacks that means they will advise you of the product that makes them the most money not you   flat rate these are not a bad option but they do n't have any real incentive to make you money usually they do a decent job of making you money but again it 's usually better for them to advise you on products that make them money per hour these are my favorite they charge per hour usually they are a small shop and will walk you through all the advise they advise what 's best for you because they have to sit there and explain their choices they can be hard to find but are generally the best option in my opinion    of money these are like the flat rate advisers to me they get a percentage of the money you give them to manage because they already have your money they are more likely to recommend products that are in their interest that said there not all bad or profit these are the best see notes later they get a percentage of the money they make for you they have the most interest in making you money they only get part of what you get so there going to make sure you get the biggest pie so they can get a bigger slice notes in the real world all advisers are likely to get kickbacks on products they recommend make sure to keep an eye for that also most advisers will use 2 3 of the methods listed above for billing something like of profit + $ x per hour is what i like to see you will have to look around and see what is available   just remember that you are paying someone to make you money or to advise you on how to make money so long as what they take leaves you with some profit your in a better situation then your are now and that 's the real goal

you are missing something very significant the money in a traditional ira specifically a deductible traditional ira there is not really any reason to keep a nondeductible traditional ira anymore is pre tax that means when you pay tax on it when you take it out you are paying tax on it for the first time if you take ordinary money to invest it in stocks and then pay capital gains tax on it when you take it out that is post tax money to begin with meaning that you have already paid income tax on it once then you have to pay tax again on the time value growth of that money i.e. that growth is earned from money that is already taxed that means you are effectively paying tax twice on part of that money if that does n't make sense to you and you think that interest capital gains etc is the first time you 're paying tax on the money because it 's growth then you have a very simplistic view of money there 's something called time value of money which means that a certain amount of money is equivalent to a greater amount of money in the future if you invest $ 100 now and end up with $ 150 in the future that $ 150 in the future is effectively the same money as the $ 100 now let 's consider a few examples let 's say you have $ 1000 of pre tax income you want to invest and withdraw a certain period of time later in retirement let 's say you have an investment that grows 100 over this period of time and let 's say that your tax rate now and in the future is 25 and for simplicity assume that all income is taxed at that rate instead of the tax bracket system and capital gains tax is 15 you see a few things traditional ira and roth ira are equivalent if the tax rates are the same this is because in both cases you pay tax one time on the money the only difference between paying tax now and later is the tax rate it does n't matter that you 're paying tax only on the principal for the roth and on the principal plus earnings for traditional because the principal now is equivalent to the principal plus earnings in the future and you also see that investing money outside fares worse than both of them that is because you are paying tax on the money once plus some more when you compare it against the roth ira the disadvantage is obvious in both cases you pay income tax on the principal but for roth ira you pay nothing on the earnings whereas for the outside stock you pay some tax on the earnings what may be less obvious is it is equally compared to a traditional ira traditional and roth ira are equivalent in this comparison 401(k)s and iras have a fundamental tax benefit compared to normal money investment because they allow money to be taxed only one time no matter how low the capital gains tax rate it it is still worse because it is a tax on time value growth from money that is already taxed

one wonders where the author thinks the monies for the generous boomer pension payouts will come from   and of course they utterly ignore the fact that things like 401k 's and ira 's require that a person begin at a progressive rate after one hits age 70 1/2   yes post retirement fund sales minus the taxes on the proceeds of course which taxes are not to be ignored these people could turn the entire remainder of those monies back around and then re invest them back into the stock market as non tax deferred retail stock purchasers but that is pretty unlikely to happen   in addition the boomers as a generation have become accustomed to a far higher lifestyle newer cars larger amp fancier homes more vacations etc than the previous and so just as with many other things where boomers broke the mold relying the the data from those generations as an economic model of how much wealth retirees tend to cash in and how they spend versus what they sit on and hoard for their heirs may be rather foolish somewhat akin to building an economic model on 20 years of data that americans do n't default on their mortgages yeah that turned out to not be very wise   and then finally i wonder if this author really the meaning of the phrase at the margin after all everyone in a neighborhood does n't have to default on their mortgage to drive house prices down in fact all it takes is a lack of buyers and prices can not be sustained   so the problem with the boomer en masse retirement is not just the possibility that they will all sell everything at the same time but rather that the demographic bulge will at a certain tipping point change from buyer hoarders to sellers and that inevitably will have a major affect on the float and thus the prices of stocks and just as inevitably at some stage of that change herd behavior even panicked herd behavior will take over   it really does n't take much to drive a stock down nor even an entire stock market if the authors wisdom were true would we ever have had any stock market crashes in the first place

typically this is n't a random having a small volume just means it 's not showing on the chart but it is a price point same thing would've happened if it would've been a very large order that shows on the chart consider also that this could have been the first one of many transactions that go far below your stop point would you not have wanted it to be executed then at this time as it did would you expect the system to look into future and decide that this is a one time dip and not sell versus it is a crash and sell either way the system can not look in the future so it has no way to know if a crash is coming or if it was a short dip therefore the are executed as given sell if any transfer happens below the limit to avoid that or at least reduce the chance for it you can either leave more distance and risk a higher loss when it crashes or trade higher volumes so the short small dip wo n't execute your order also very liquid stocks will not show such small transaction dips

why would it not make more sense to invest in a handful of these    instead of also having to carry the weight of the other    450 some of which are mostly just baggage first a cap weighted index fund will invest more heavily in larger cap companies so the baggage you speak of does take up a smaller percentage of the portfolio 's value not that cap always equates to better performance there are also equal weighted index funds where each company in the index is given equal weight in the portfolio if you could accurately pick winners and losers then of course you could beat index funds but on average they 've performed well enough that there 's little incentive for the average investor to look elsewhere   a handful of stocks opens you up to more risk an enron in your handful would be pretty devastating if it comprised a large percentage of your portfolio additionally since you pay a fee on each transaction $ 5 in your example you have to out perform a low fee index fund significantly or be investing a very large amount of money to come out ahead you get diversification and low fees with an index fund

this is an unfortunate situation for you   you have zero chance at your question number 1 if someone was going to bend this rule for you it would have happened already   the answer to question number 2 is pursue solution number 3 the overriding issue is that the irs makes these rules not the employer plan sponsor or the administrator   you ca n't talk the plan administrator in to reimbursing you their system likely does n't even have a function to do so fsa timing issues can be complex and i think that 's the root of your issue because when an expense can be incurred date of service versus date of payment and when a claim must be filed are different things it 's really common to bend the rules on when a claim is submitted but not when it was incurred    it 's really common for an exiting employee to have 30 days to submit expenses for reimbursement   fsa expenses must always be incurred within the specified plan year or within your dates of employment if you were n't employed for the entire plan year this is specified by the irs   it seems like some wires were crossed when you asked this question   you were asking can i still incur claims and they were hearing how long do i have to submit an expense that has already been incurred some plans allow cobra continuation on fsa which generally does not make sense   your contributions to the plan would use after tax dollars but for folks who know they have an eligible expense coming it can make sense to continue via cobra in retain your eligibility under the plan so you can incur a claim after your employment termination regarding number 3   this sort of reimbursement would be outside the plan no precedent is necessary   you 've gotten them to claim it was their mistake they 're going to reimburse you for their mistake it has nothing to do with the fsa good luck

the short answer is banks are less concerned about the interest earned on any single mortgage than they are for the interest earned over time from a collection of mortgages let 's look at a repayment schedule for a 30-year mortgage at 4 for $ 100,000 source any mortgage calculator should produce a similar schedule however a few things to note the interest due in the last 6 years is less than the interest due in the first year alone banks are getting a disproportionate amount of the expected interest up front banks can make multiple loans the money collected from existing borrowers can be aggregated to make new loans before the old ones are paid off and those new loans start of course at the interest heavy end of the repayment schedule suppose the bank lends out $ 1,000,000 to 10 borrowers in the first two years they will collect a total of $ from the 10 borrowers in principal and interest that 's enough to make an additional loan to an 11th borrower while keeping $ as profit the new borrower is making payments at the year one rate a bank may lose a little interest on a single loan that gets repaid early but that is generally made up by the fact that a new loan can be issued that much sooner as a result

these policies are usually called dread disease policies or critical illness insurance and they normally are n't a good deal furthermore with the passage of the affordable care act such policies may become less common or disappear entirely these policies are n't a great deal because of the effects of adverse selection and asymmetric information two closely related concepts in the economics of insurance when you purchase an insurance policy the insurance company charges you a premium based on your average risk level or the average risk level of your risk pool e.g. you and your fellow employees if you get insurance through your employer for health insurance this average risk level is the average probability that you 'll incur healthcare costs the insurer 's actuaries calculate this probability from numerous factors like your age sex current health socioeconomic status etc asymmetric information exists when you know more about this probability than the insurance company does for example you may look like a relatively low risk individual on paper but little does the insurance company know base jumping is one of your hobbies because you know about your hobby and the insurance company does n't you secretly know that your risk of incurring healthcare expenses is much higher than the insurance company expects if the insurance company knew this they would like to charge you a much higher premium if they could however they ca n't because a they do n't know about your hobby and b the premium may be decided for the entire group risk pool so they ca n't increase it simply because a few individuals in the group have higher risk levels adverse selection occurs when individuals with higher risk levels are more likely to buy insurance you may decide that because of your dangerous hobby you do want to take advantage of your employer 's healthcare plan unfortunately for the insurance company they ca n't adjust their price accordingly adverse selection is a major factor in insurance markets so i did n't go into much detail here too much detail is probably off topic anyway i can point you towards more resources on the topic if you 're interested   however the situation is different when you purchase a dread disease policy   by expressing interest in such a specific policy e.g. a cancer insurance policy you signal to the insurance company that you feel you have a higher risk of facing that disease in your case you 're signaling to the insurance company that your family probably has a history of cancer or that you have habits that make you more susceptible to it and your premiums will be higher to compensate the insurance company for bearing this additional risk since the insurance company already has a rough estimate of your chances of developing that illness they may already know that you have a higher chance of facing it however when you express interest in a disease specific policy this signals the existence of asymmetric information your family history or other habits and the insurer assumes you know something they do n't that your risk level of that specific disease since these policies are optional policies often sold as riders to existing policies the insurance company has more flexibility in pricing them they can charge you a higher premium because you 've signaled to the insurer that you have a significantly above average risk of contracting a specific also the insurer can do a much better job of estimating the expected costs of insuring you since they need only focus on data surrounding one disease the policy will be priced accordingly i.e. in such a way that is n't necessarily beneficial to you furthermore most dread disease policies are n't guaranteed renewable which means that even if you are willing to keep paying the premiums the insurance company does n't have to keep insuring you as your risk of developing the specific disease grows e.g. with age it may pass the point where insuring you is no longer an acceptable risk the company expects you to develop the illness with the next few renewal cycles so they decide not to renew your policy the end result the insurance company has the premiums you 've paid previously but you no longer have coverage for that illness and ex post you 've suffered a net loss with no reduction of risk for the foreseeable future   dread disease policies are changing under the affordable care act according to starting in 2014 all new health insurance plans sold to individuals and small businesses and plans purchased in the new affordable insurance exchanges must include a range of essential health benefits the essential health benefits include quite a few areas of coverage since this applies to policies offered on the state insurance exchanges and those offered outside of it dread disease policies would n't seem to qualify for more information you can read the linked page on or see section subsection b titled essential health benefits requirements in the law itself i imagine more details will be available on a state by state basis through 2014 and into 2015   one legal source see the discussion on states that whatever else the aca does with benefit policies including specific disease and fixed dollar indemnity policies it does explicitly provide that such policies do not count as minimum essential coverage for purposes of the aca this seems pretty straightforward a dread disease or specific disease policy as it 's referred to in the article wo n't count towards the minimum essential requirements this may not be an issue for you but for others it 's important to understand that you 'll still need to pay the penalty if you only purchase one of these policies the aca spells this out in section see which states that benefit policies are excluded and defines them using the definition in the public health service act the specifically includes coverage only for a specified disease or illness in their definition of benefit policies see section paragraph on so it 's probably a safe bet that such policies wo n't count towards the minimum also as rick pointed out in the comments the affordable care act also forbids lifetime limits on most insurance plans so assuming you find an insurance policy with adequate coverage for the specific disease you 're worried about such a plan should cover the related expenses without a lifetime limit deductibles annual limits and other factors may complicate this somewhat   in the section about lifetime limits sec the affordable care act states that a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may not establish lifetime limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary   however the law states in the next paragraph that the preceding statement should not be construed to prevent a group health plan or health insurance coverage from placing annual or lifetime per beneficiary limits on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits under section of the patient protection and affordable care act to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under federal or state law the section also contains similarly vague caveats about annual limits so the actual details and limits may vary once individual states finalize their policies the law is intentionally vague because the vast majority of the law 's implementation is left up to individual states furthermore certain parts of the law specify actions involving the secretary of health and human services so these may require further in the future too you should still read the fine print of any insurance policy you buy and evaluate it as you would any contract see the next section   since a dread disease policy probably is n't a good idea you 'll probably want to evaluate the healthcare plans offered by your employer or individual plans offered in your area if your employer does n't offer coverage i 've tried to include the basic points offered in these articles to give you or future visitors some idea of where to start these points may change once the affordable care act is implemented so i 'll try to keep them as general as possible   services above and beyond the minimum essential requirements what services does the plan offer are these services a good match for you and/or your family or do they add unnecessary cost to the premium with little or no benefit for example my health insurance plan offers basic dental coverage with a small co pay so i do n't need a separate dental plan even though my employer offers one   choice what doctors clinics hospitals etc are preferred providers under your plan do you need a referral from your primary care doctor to see a specialist or can you find one on your own are the preferred providers convenient for you in my first year of college about five years ago my student health insurance only covered a few hospitals that were in the suburbs and somewhat difficult for me to reach this is something to keep in mind depending on where you live   costs this is a major one obviously deductibles copays maximum cost limits over a year or your lifetime out of network costs etc are all variables to consider   there are other factors but since i do n't have a family other members of the site can provide more detailed information about what to look for in family policies   in place of a dread disease policy you 're likely better off purchasing a comprehensive health insurance policy perhaps a catastrophic coverage policy with a high deductible that will kick in once you 've exhausted your standard insurance policy however this may be a moot point since the passage of the affordable care act may significantly reduce the availability of such policies anyway

total capital this is a very old fashioned term that really is mostly only used in the finance industry today like when everyone was obsessed with bank capital total capital = preferred equity + common equity + liabilities true blue preferred shares are almost only used by financial companies banks specifically   the more modern ones that convert to common are used by all other companies notes payable this is another old fashioned term that now carries a different meaning in generally accepted account principles gaap the oldest definition of a note or a promissory note is a promise to pay a fixed amount of money on a specific date    this has been modified to resemble more a bond and evolved into the zero coupon bond a bond that makes no cash interest payments but makes one final payment that includes principal interest    a bank note like a one dollar bill is a note that pays something in this case one dollar never technically the repayment date is simply not specified in the contract   while it pays one dollar it never pays it back so it has a constant value of one dollar   the constant nature inflation notwithstanding is what makes bank notes the preferred medium of exchange gaap has taken its own definition to mean any debt payable within 12 months as it is a current < 12 months liability

co signing is not the same as owning if your elderly lady did n't make any payments on the loan and is n't on the ownership of the car and there was no agreement that you would pay her anything then you do not owe either her or her daughter any money also the loan is not affecting the daughter 's credit and the mother 's credit is irrelevant since she is dead however you should be aware that the finance company will want to know about the demise of the mother since they can no longer make a claim against her if you default i would start by approaching the loan company telling them about the mother 's death and asking to refinance in your name only if you 've really been keeping up the payments well this could be ok with them if not i would find someone else who is prepared to co sign a new loan with you and still refinance then just tell the daughter that the loan her mother co signed for has been discharged and there is nothing for her to worry about

it depends what rate mortgage you can get for any extra loans   if you remortgage you are likely to get a rate of 3.5 4 depending who you go with with deposit accounts in the uk around 1 yes you can get more by tying it up for longer but not a huge amount more clearly you 're better off not having a mortgage rather than money in the bank does your 8k income allow for tax if it does you are getting 6 return on the money tied up in the flat if you are getting 6 after tax on the invested money that 's way better than you would get on any left over cash paid into an investment borrowing money on a mortgage would cost you less than 6 so you are better off borrowing rather than selling the flat if you are getting 6 before tax depending on your tax rate it probably makes very little difference you 'd need to work out how much an extra 80k mortgage would cost you how much the 50k on deposit would earn you and how much you make after tax there is a different route set up a mortgage on the rental flat you can claim the interest payment off the flat 's income reduce your tax bill so the effective mortgage rate on the flat would be less than what you could get with a mortgage on the new house use the money from the flat 's mortgage to finance the difference in house price in fact from a tax view you may be better off having a mortgage free house and maxing out the mortgage on the flat so you can write off as much as possible against your tax bill all of the above assume that the flat is rented all the time the odd dry spell on the flat could influence the sums a lot all of the above assume that   your cash flow works whichever route you choose as no one on stack exchange has all of the numbers for your specific circumstances it may be worth talking to a tax accountant they could advise you properly knowing the numbers which makes the best sense for you in terms of overall cost cash flow risk and so on

firstly i think you need to separate your question into two parts if you are chinese live in china and intend to stay in china for most of your life then the default answer to question 1 should be   question 2 is not as important you can hold usd in almost any country in the world any investment you hold has risk which may include market risk credit risk liquidity risk inflation risk etc holding usd will expose you to exchange rate fluctuations as well   if the rises in value against the dollar your returns in usd will be reduced by the same amount remember that for currency fluctuations you have to multiply the percentages see here for a good explanation the first thing you probably want to do is find out exactly what the assets are in the you have invested in   the fact that there is a risk level even if it is only 2 would suggest to me that the fund is investing in some combination of bonds and stocks which means that your returns are not guaranteed and could make a loss interest rates on deposit accounts are mandated by the government in china and the current 12 month deposit rate on rmb is 3   to earn over 3 must be investing your assets in something else i 'm guessing bonds   bear in mind that 1.5 years is a very short amount of time in investments so do n't assume this return will continue   i 'm afraid i 've only been studying chinese for a year so i ca n't really help you much with the link you 've sent through you may want to check if there is any guaranteed minimum return which can be the case in more complex structured products ultimately you will need to pick an investment which you feel gives you the best combination of risk and return for your situation there are a huge amount of options to choose between   the 4 5 you are earning right now is not a huge risk premium on the 3 you could earn in china from a time deposit but in the current environment you may struggle to beat it without taking on more risk   before considering that though understand how much risk you already have with

my understanding of muslim finance is that you may not lend money at interest including investing in in things that pay interest however you may still make investments it just has to be in places where you get a share of profit rather than a fixed rate of return you would be better asking the muslim community specifically for more details the benefits of compound interest apply more or less to other non fixed interest investments if you invest $ 1000 in a business and get a 10 rate of return you have $ 1100 to invest in your next venture which means it will be more profitable and so on that 's why the growth happens not specifically because it is interest stocks do not pay interest and the magic applies to them too the fact that you might lose as well as win complicates things but does n't change the principle

there 's currently not much reason to keep around a long term non deductible traditional ira in my opinion a roth ira is almost strictly better think about it a non deductible traditional ira vs. a roth ira of the same amount in both cases contributions are after tax so no tax deduction but when you withdraw for the roth ira you do n't have to pay tax and for the non deductible traditional ira you have to pay tax on the earnings a roth ira can be contributed to at pretty much any income level thanks to the backdoor roth ira process which uses a temporary non deductible traditional ira in the process so there is not much reason for a long term non deductible traditional ira as for your question a non deductible traditional ira vs. a taxable account well a non deductible traditional ira is contributed to with after tax money and taxed on the earnings only on withdrawal so the taxation is almost identical to things like stocks and homes where the gain is not realized until the thing is sold however compared to things like savings accounts and bonds where you get taxed on the interest yearly it is much better every time you get taxed on gains like this it is taxing gains earned from after tax money so if you think of an amount of money as being equivalent to the amount of money it grows to over time time value of money then it is taxing money that is or grown from money that is already taxed so it is better to have this only happen at the end at withdrawal than every year

while salary is usually a large expense it 's often not the one with the most waste   cutting salary almost always ends poorly if you need any sort of specialized skills    the city should be looking at it 's budget but at services that are n't necessary or are far too expensive to operate in a crisis   closing a community center or canceling some public events not only saves a huge amount off cash in the form of overtime for police and support services it also makes the problem public and tend to make people open to paying more fees of taxes solving the problem for

i 'm not talking about giving money to the gov't to have them help with it i agree our gov't should care only about us but doing it yourself or maybe flying over there to help yourself with your own money my point is a direct approach is nt best in the long run the best help is having a booming economy the poor are much better in a booming economy than in a shitty one and govt redistribution will make a shitty economy of course a bigger problem is the gov't manipulation of interest rates and over regulation but a better economy pulls people out of poverty that 's why everyone was financially equal yet extremely poor in the ussr nice and moral are always a good thing but not by force libertarians do believe their policies are best for the poor despite a lack of redistribution of money

the indication is based on the average buy hold sell rating of a group of fundamental analysts the individual analysts provide a buy hold or sell recommendation based on where the current price of the stock is compared to the perceived value of the stock by the analyst   note that this perceived value is based on many assumptions by the analyst and their biased view of the stock that is why different fundamental analysts provide different values and different recommendations on the same stock so basically if the stock 's price is below the analyst 's perceived value it will be given a buy recommendation if the price is equal with the perceived value it will be given a hold recommendation and if the price is more than the perceived value it will be given a sell recommendation as the others have said this information imho is useless

a distribution is typically a return of capital in other words you 're getting money back that you 've contributed previously and thus would have been taxed upon in previous years when those funds were first to you distributions are nontaxable so they do not represent income from capital gains but do effect your cost basis when determining the capital gain loss once that capital gain loss is realized as an example publicly traded real estate investment trusts reits generally distribute a return of capital back to shareholders throughout the year as a distribution this is a return of a portion of the shareholder 's original capital investment not a share of the reits profits so it is simply getting a portion of your original investment back and thus is not income being received i like to refer to it as new income to differentiate however the return of capital does change the cost basis of the original investment so if one were to then sell the shares of the reit in this example the basis of the original investment has to be adjusted by the distributions received over the course of ownership in other words the cost basis will be reduced when the shares are sold i 'm wondering if the op could give us some additional information about his her s corp what type of business is it in the course of its business and trade activity does it buy and sell securities stocks etc does it sell assets or business property does it own interests in other corporations or partnerships sales of those interests are one form of capital gain long term capital gains are taxed at rates lower than ordinary income but the irs has very specific rules as to what constitutes a capital gain loss i hate to answer a question with a question but we need a little more information before we can weigh in on whether you have actual capital gains or losses in the course of your s corporation trade

a reit is a real estate investment trust it is a company that derives most of its gross income from and holds most of its assets in real estate investments which in this case include either real property mortgages or both   they provide a way for investors to get broad exposure in a real estate market without going to buy a bunch of properties themselves   it also provides diversification within the real estate segment since reits will often but not necessarily have either way more properties than an individual could get or have very large properties like a few resorts that would be too expensive for any one investor   by law they must pay at least 90 of their taxable income as dividends to investors so they typically have a good dividend rate possibly but not necessarily at the expense of growth of the stock price   some of those dividends may be tax advantaged and some will not an mlp is a master limited partnership   these trade on the exchange like corporations but they are not corporations although often used in common language as synonyms corporation and company are not the same thing   corporation is one way to organize a company under the law   they are partnerships and when you buy a share you become a partner in the company   this is an alternative form of ownership to being a shareholding   in this case you are a limited partner which means that you have limited liability as with stock   the shares may appreciate or not just like a stock and you can generally sell them back to the market for a capital gain or loss under the same rules as a stock   the main difference here from a practical point of view is taxes   partnerships of any type do no pay tax instead their income and costs are passed to the individual partners who must then include it on their personal returns form 1040 schedule e   the partnership will send each shareholder a schedule k-1 form at tax time   this means you may have phantom income that is taxable even though cash never flowed through your hands since you 'll have to account for the income of the partnership   many partnerships mitigate this by making cash distributions during the year so that the partners do actually see the cash but this is not required   on the other hand if it does happen it 's often characterized as a return of capital which is not taxable in the year that you receive it   a return of capital reduces your cost basis in the partnership and will eventually result in a larger capital gain when you sell your shares as with any investment there are pros and cons to each investment type   of the two the mlp is probably less like a regular stock since getting the schedule k-1 may require some extra work at tax time especially if you 've never seen one before   on the other hand that may be worth it to you if you can find one that 's appreciating in value and still returning capital at a good rate since this could be a best of everything situation where you defer tax and when you eventually do pay you pay at favorable capital gains rates but still manage to get your cash back in hand before you sell in case not clear my comments about tax are specific to the us   no idea how this is treated elsewhere by real world example i guess you meant a few tickers in each category   you can find whole lists online   i just did a quick search list of mlp and list of reit found a list and have provided the top few off of the first list that i found   the lists were by company name so there 's no explicit or implicit endorsement of these particular investments examples of reit examples of mlp

you should definately have a stop loss in place to manage your risk for a time frame of 5 to 10 years i would be looking at a trailing stop loss of 20 to 25 off the recent high   another type of stop you could use is a volatility stop here the more volatile the stock the larger the stop whilst the less volatile the stock the smaller the stop you could use 3 or 4 x weekly average true range to achieve this the reason you should always use a stop loss is because of what can happen and what did happen in 2008 some stock markets have yet to fully recover from their peaks at the end of 2007 almost 9 years later what would you do if you were planning to hold your positions for 5 years and then withdrawal your funds at the end of june 2021 for a particular purpose and suddenly in february 2021 the market starts to fall by the time june comes the market has fallen by over 50 and you do n't have enough funds available for the purpose you planned for instead if you were using a trailing stop loss you would manage to keep at least 75 of the peak of your portfolio you could even spend 10 minutes each week to monitor your portfolio for warning signs that a downtrend may be around the corner and adjust your trailing stop to maybe 10 in these situations protecting 90 of the peak of your portfolio if the downtrend does not you can adjust your trailing back to a higher percentage if you do get stopped out and shortly after the market recovers then you can always buy back in or look for other stocks and etfs to replace them sure you might lose a bit of profits if this happens but it should always be part of your investment plan and risk management how you will handle these situation if you are not using stop losses risk management and money management you are essentially gambling if you say i am going to buy these stocks and etfs hold them for 10 years and then sell them then you are just hoping to make gains which is essentially gambling

stock splits are typically done to increase the liquidity of stock merely by converting every stock of the company into multiple stocks of lower face value for example if the initial face value of the stock was $ 10 and the stock got split 10:1 the new face value of the stock would be $ 1 each this has a proportional effect on the market value of the stock also if the stock was trading at $ 50 after the split the stock should ideally adjust to $ 5 this is to ensure that despite the stock split the market capitalization of the company should remain the same number of shares stock price = market capitalization = constant

it 's a good point to make with bot presence for the most part twitter is made of people even if there are a lot of false or bot accounts that being said i do n't find it as strong a marketing channel because of the nature of twitter at its core    if you follow 1000 people you 're likely to have nearly 10,000 tweets going through your feed it 's hard to really fight for attention but you can still get decent response and views when done right    as for instagram   i think in the long term just as any other social network the lifespan of it depends on the content as long as people are having new experiences and taking photos of them there will always be more content    that being said there are tons of accounts that pretty much post the same content it things like the explore feature because they 're using less than kosher tactics to get likes    ultimately i think policing of instagram as they have been is the best strategy for keeping it going    even though i 'm a marketer i 'm also a millennial with pretty typical values blatant advertising is annoying and intrusive when it comes to user experience and many young people today feel that way    by policing things like auto engaging false locations you used to be able to just type locations like follow me and being very keen on following through with reports of spam accounts is a good way to keep younger people on it    unless you 're paying for ads marketing on instagram typically consists of native content that looks good on feeds and needs engagement to rise up this is a good way to curb marketing while still maintaining a good user experience    as a side note part of why i use snapchat less is how they shove ads down your throat which gets old pretty fast ads on snapchat pretty much ruined the platform for me personally aside from using it for communication    as long as instagram maintains this balance based around the user and not the advertisers i think it will be going for quite some time

as a sole proprietor the tax liability of your business is calculated based on combining your business income with your personal income together   it is good advice to keep all personal and business financial matters separate this makes it easier to prove to the irs that all your business expenses are actually business related in this case however the two items tax payment for personal income vs tax payment for business income are what you can do however for your own personal records is calculate how much of your tax payment relates to your business i would n't get complicated about this i would simply take the net income of your business as a of your taxable income and multiply that against your tax payment ie if your business net income is $ 10,000 and your total taxable income is $ 50,000 and you paid $ 6,000 in taxes i would record that 20 of the $ 6k was related to business income if you have a separate bank account for your sole proprietorship you could make a transfer to your personal account of $ 1,200 and then make the $ 6k payment from your personal account remember that tax payments for either your sole proprietorship and your personal income will be treated the same federal tax payments are not tax deductible and state tax payments are tax deductible whether they were paid for your sole proprietorship or the rest of your personal income so even though this method is simplistic for example it does n't factor in that different investment income types earned personally will have a lower rate than your sole proprietorship income any difference would n't have an impact on any future tax liability this would only be for your own personal record keeping

usually when a stock is up trending or down trending the price does not go up or down in a straight line in an uptrend the price may go up over a couple of days then it could go down the next day or two but the general direction would be up over the medium term the opposite for a downtrend so if the stock has been generally going up over the last few weeks it may take a for a week or two before prices continue up again this is called a retracement in the uptrend the fibonacci levels are possible amounts by which the price might retract before it continues on its way up again by the way 50 is not actually a fibonacci retracement level but it is a common retracement level which is usually used in combination with the fibonacci retracement levels

some of the items required as part of the home buying and mortgage process are traditionally paid prior to closing these are usually the items that the buyer purchases as part of the process home inspection credit check these expenses take place early in the process and if the deal falls through due to the inspection or credit history problems the seller does n't want to get stuck paying for the buyer will frequently have to write a check for these as they occur other items occur later in the process or even at the very end of the process determining which side pays for each item is a combination negotiation and local tradition even for the items that the buyer has to pay for there can be a negotiation between the   buyer and the lender sometimes the lender allows the buyer to roll the closing costs into the loan this does mean that they will be paying interest on the closing costs for years but not rolling in the closing costs mean that you need more cash on hand this is in addition to the down payment and the costs of moving    the closing costs covered by the seller reduce the size of the check they will receive at the end of the process their willingness to kick in this cash is a function of will they still make money on the deal how many other bidders there were and do they need the cash to buy their next house at settlement the forms identify each item involved and who agreed to pay for it then each side is credited for the items they paid for already then each side either writes a check for the balance due or receives a check for their reimbursement keep in mind there are also money exchanges that take place at the closing that are not covered by the buyer real estate commissions there are also items such as interest for the current month and property tax credit that depend on the day of the month and month of the year   sit down with your agent or your lender to get an idea of what you need to pay before closing   though telling everybody that you will have zero cash to pay for these things may make the lender very nervous about approving a loan

other things equal is sometimes referred to as ceteris paribus the scenario where you compare two currencies or things under the assumption that all other factors that could effect those currencies earthquakes revolutions currency crises ect are not its like using a control group in a lab real interest rates means the rate of that countries interest rate accounting for inflation proportional to the strength of its home currency is referring to how countries with higher rates of interest tend to have stronger currencies relative to other currencies because foreign investment capital will flood into the country seeking those higher rates of return excess demand for the currency will cause it to appreciate so this is also true in reverse as capital will tend to leave a country will ultra low interest rates

the idea with passive investing in etfs is to eliminate the all important firm specific risk i agree with him that it surely creates a herd mentality and might over understate the fundamental prices for individual stocks if fund managers could consistently maintain alpha lower their and not shutdown when they ca n't reach their high water mark then maybe investors might come back to them as it stands now the money goes where it can get the best return with only market risk to worry about

at the end of each calendar year the mutual fund company will send you a 1099 form it will tell you and the irs what your account earned you will see boxes for you will end up paying taxes on these unless the fund is part of a 401 k or ira these taxes will be due even if you never sold any shares they are due even if it was a bad year and the value of your account went down most if not all states will levy an income tax your dividends and capital gains each year when you sell your shares you may also owe income taxes if you made a profit the actual taxes due is a more complex calculation due to long term vs short term and what other gains or losses you have partial sales also take into account which shares are sold

i have a couple other important considerations regarding external hsa accounts vs employer sponsored hsa accounts depending on your personal financial situation and goals some people like to use hsa accounts as an extra retirement account since the money can be withdrawn penalty free in retirement for non medical expenses and completely tax penalty free at any time for medical expenses if your intended use for the hsa account is an investment vehicle for retirement then you may find more use benefit out of an external provider that may provide more or better investment options than your employers hsa investment options there can be a lot of additional value in those extra investment options over greater periods of time another very important consideration for fica taxes fica includes social security medicare that i do n't believe was mentioned before for those earners who are under the maximum social security wage limit you are paying 6.2 of each paycheck into social security taxes as others have mentioned you can save this tax through your employer ’s plan if you set up the account to be funded pre tax from your paychecks however in doing so you are lowering your overall contributions into social security which may lower your social security benefits in your retirement years   if this is ultimately going to lower your ssa benefits in retirement then that is a big future cost that may steer you against the pre tax employer contributions think of social security as part of your retirement plan not as a tax but instead as an additional check you put away for yourself for retirement every month of course this is only an important consideration if ssa is still going to be around when you retire but let 's assume that it will be this is not an issue for higher earners earning well above the max ssa taxable wages there is no wage limit on the 1.45 medicare tax withholding 's and there is certainly no harm in saving medicare taxes because it will not affect future medicare benefits so for taxpayers earning well over the max ssa wages they will just save the 1.45 medicare taxes without affecting their ssa contributions and resulting retirement benefits   so again it all comes down to personal situations depending on your earnings and goals employer plan may or may not be the way to go   personally for my lower earning clients friends and family i tend to recommend that they do whatever they can to maximize their social security benefits in retirement so i would advise them to either use the external provider account or the employer plan but with post tax contributions so you do n't lower the ssa withholding 's but can still claim the income tax deduction on your tax return ymmv

yes you 're still exposed to currency risk when you purchase the stock on company b 's exchange i 'm assuming you 're buying the shares on b 's stock exchange through an adr gdr or similar instrument the risk occurs as a result of the process through which the adr is created in its simplest form the process works like this i 'll illustrate this with an example i 've separated the conversion rate into the exchange rate and a generic adr conversion rate which includes all other factors the bank takes into account when deciding how many adr shares to sell the fact that the units line up is a nice check to make sure the calculation is logically correct my example starts with these assumptions i made up the generic adr conversion rate it will remain constant throughout this example this is the simplified version of the calculation of the adr share price from the european share price   let 's assume that the euro appreciates against the us dollar and is now worth 1.4 usd this is a major appreciation but it makes a good example   the currency appreciation alone raised the share price of the adr even though the price of the share on the european exchange was unchanged now let 's look at what happens if the euro appreciates further to 1.5 usd eur but the company 's share price on the european exchange falls   even though the euro appreciated the decline in the share price on the european exchange offset the currency risk in this case leaving the adr 's share price on the us exchange unchanged finally what happens if the euro experiences a major depreciation and the company 's share price decreases significantly in the european market this is a realistic situation that has occurred several times during the european sovereign debt crisis    assuming this occurred immediately after the first example european shareholders in the company experienced a 50 50 = return but american holders of the adr experienced a = return the currency shock was the primary cause of this magnified loss   another point to keep in mind is that the foreign company itself may be exposed to currency risk if it conducts a lot of business in market with different currencies ideally the company has hedged against this but if you invest in a foreign company through an adr or a gdr or another similar instrument you may take on whatever risk the company has n't hedged in addition to the currency risk that 's present in the adr gdr conversion process here are a few articles that discuss currency risk specifically in the context of adr 's 1 2 nestle a swiss company that is traded on us exchanges through an adr even addresses this issue in their faq for investors there are other risks associated with instruments like adr 's and cross listed companies but normally arbitrageurs will remove these quickly especially for cross listed companies this should keep the prices of highly liquid securities relatively

1 what 's the point of paying a dividend if the stock price    automatically decreases do n't the shareholders just break even when the company earns cash beyond what is needed for expenses the value of the firm increases as a shareholder you own a piece of that increased value as soon as the company earns it when the dividend is paid the value of the firm decreases but you break even on the dividend transaction the benefit to you in holding the company 's shares is the continually increasing value whether paid out to you or retained be careful not to confuse the value of the firm with the stock price the stock price is ever changing in the short term driven mostly by investor emotion over the long term by far the largest effect on stock price is earnings take an extreme and simplistic example the company never grows or shrinks earnings are always the same there is no inflation and they pay everything out in dividends by the reasoning above the firm value never changes so over the long term the stock price will never change but you still get your quarterly dividends

for starters like some other people have said just talk to someone in ib and get some advice on how to break in and what it 's really like i 've spoken to people in ib and learned that it 's really just not going to be for me in response to your four questions   1   get your degree at depaul and wait a few years to get your masters you do n't need an mba for ib and it 'll be a lot harder to go to a prestigious grad school without significant work experience and a solid network   1 it definitely would n't hurt for you to double major in cs but if you do you 're going to have to keep your grades up and still stay sharp in both majors you do n't want to have a 3.0 and have both it 'll kill your chances you 're going to need at least a 3.8 if you 're under that it 's gon na be a lot harder to get anywhere    1 if there are other industries you want to turn to then sure i used to be interested in ib but now i 'm leaning more towards private equity and working with reg d. clients 1031 exchanges etc    1 network if you are n't already seriously get out there and network like hell but do n't just cold call random people you really need to make meaningful connections with people and continue to stay in contact with them you can also learn a lot from wso and various ib books guides etc i have a bunch of that stuff on my google drive from a friend if you want it    and some general   do n't stress about the school you go going to a prestigious school really does help but if you work hard enough make the right connections and are good at what you do you can land a role in ib i know several people that have gone into ib from my school and i would consider us maybe a grade c state school it 's possible   i 'd also recommend looking more at a boutique and middle mark companies rather than your bulge bracket banks it 'll have less competition and could be easier to break into and like some other people are said you really need to get that junior year internship if you want to make it into ib but if you ca n't get into ib right after school do n't fret go somewhere get some experience get your certifications series 7 series 63 etc and try again   know your technicals you need to be able to walk through a dcf an lbo and all of the financial statements in an interview there are billions of guides on how to do this but you need to know this   stay on top of current events just be well versed in how the market is doing which industries are hot right now and what 's not and why   know your story believe it or not but your story and how that aligns with a companies culture is really important i have a friend that did n't make it into a certain firm solely because they just did n't think he was a good enough fit for their culture i want to make a lot of money wo n't work instead think more along the lines of i want to challenge myself   good luck man

correct by putting expenses on to a credit card which does not charge interest during the grace period and paying that balance every month in effect you earn interest on money you 've already spent however first savings account interest is something like .05 right now depending on your bank yeah it 's money but seriously that 's 4 cents per month on $ 1000   second two things can make this very wrong if you carry a balance you 'll pay much more in interest than you 'd get from practically any investment you could make with the cash in the meantime second a debit card can be used to get cash you already have from an atm not everyone takes credit you know and it 'll cost you little or nothing use a credit card for the same purpose and you 're paying 40 from the second the money comes out of the machine also correct rewards cards earn you more the more they 're used that 's because the card issuer makes money based on usage they get 3 of each transaction they 're happy to turn 1 of that up to a limit or subject to a spending floor back around to you again check the terms and conditions most cards have a limit on total rewards many of them also have fees either while you hold the card or when you try to redeem the rewards look for a card with high limits or no limits on rewards from spending and with no annual fee or reward redemption fee in addition to the above you build good credit history with good spending patterns however your credit score can fluctuate wildly because on one day you have very low leverage percent of credit limit used and on the next you 've bought $ 200 in groceries and so your leverage went up 20 on a card with a $ 1000 limit leverage under 10 is good leverage under 40 is ok and leverage over that starts looking bad with a $ 1000 limit with you maxing it out and then paying it off your credit score can fluctuate by 30 points on any given day

first off great job on your finances so far you are off on the right foot and have some sense of planning for the future   also it is a great question    first i agree with @littleadv take advantage of your employer match do not drop your 401(k contributions below that also good job on putting your contributions into the roth account second i would ask are you out of debt   if not put all your extra income towards paying off debt and then you can work your plan third time to do some math   what will your business look like   how much capital would you need to get started   are there things you can do now on a part time basis to start this business or prepare you to start the business come up with a figure find some mutual funds that have a low beta and back out how much money you need to save per month so you have around that total   then you have a figure e.g. assume you need $ 20,000 and you find a fund that has done 8 over the past 20 years   then you would need to save about $ to be ready to go in 10 years or $ to go in about 5 years   it 's a time value of money calculation the house is really a long way off but you could do the same kind of calculation   i feel that you think your income and possibly locale will change dramatically over the next few years   it might not be bad to double what you are saving for the business and designate one half for the house

the other answers assumed student loan debt and for that it 's rarely worth it unless your company only offers managed plans w/ really bad returns or the economy recovers to the point where banks are paying 5 again on money market accounts but if it 's high rate debt such as carrying a credit card debt and the current rate of returns on the 401k are n't that great at the time it would be worth doing the calculations to see if it 's better to pay them down instead if you 're carrying extremely high interest debt such as payday loans or similar it 's almost always going to be worth paying down that debt as quickly as possible even if it means forgoing matching 401k payments the other possible reason for not taking the matching funds are if the required contributions would put you in a significant bind if you 're barely scraping by and you ca n't squeeze enough savings out of your budget that you 'd risk default on a loan eg car or house or might take penalties for late fees on your utilities it might be preferable to save up for a bit before starting the contributions especially if you 've maxed your available credit so you ca n't just push stuff to credit cards as a last resort

as joetaxpayer has commented the markets are littered with the of those who buy into the idea that markets submit readily to formal analysis    financial markets are amongst the most complex systems we know of   to borrow a concept from mathematics that of a chaotic system one might say that financial markets are a chaotic system comprised of a structure of chaotic for example the unpredictable behaviour of a single big market participant can have dramatic effects on overall market behaviour in my experience becoming a successful investor requires a considerable amount of time and commitment and has a steep learning curve   your actions in abandoning your graduate studies hint that you are perhaps lacking in commitment most people believe that they are special and that investing will be easy money   if you are currently entertaining such thoughts then you would be well advised to forget them immediately and prepare to show some humility tl dr it is currently considered that behavioural psychology is a valuable tool in understanding investors behaviour as well as overall market trends   also in the area of psychology confirmation bias is another aspect of trading that it is important to keep in mind   quantitative analysis is a mathematical tool that is currently used by hedge funds and the big investment banks however these methods require considerable resources and given the   performance of hedge funds in the last few years it does not appear to be worth the investment if you are serious in wanting to make the necessary commitments then here are a few ideas on where to start there are certain technical details that you will need to understand in order to quantify the risks you are taking beyond simple buying and holding financial instruments   for example how option strategies can be used limit your risk how margin requirements may force your hand in volatile markets how different markets impact on one another e.g. the relationship between bond markets and equity markets and a host of other issues   also to repeat it is important to understand how your own psychology can impact on your investment decisions

victor yes the drop in price does completely cancel the dividend at first however as others have noted there are other forces working on the price as well if dividends were pointless then the following scenario would be true let 's assume hypothetically two identical stocks only one of which pays a 2 annual dividend quarterly at the end of the year we would expect the share price of the dividend stock to be 2 lower than the non dividend stock   and an equal investment in both stocks would yield exactly the same amount of money so that is a hypothetical and here is real market example i compared i.e. took the ratio of vanguard 's s&p 500 etf voo closing price to the s&p 500 index closing price from sep 9 2010 2014 after accounting for the voo 2013 split the voo pays a quarterly the s&p is an index hence no dividend the voo share price reduced each quarter by the dividend still grew more than the s&p each year except 2012 to 2013 but looking at the entire period the voo share price grew while s&p grew 1/3 of 1 more for voo voo does drop about 1/2 relative to s&p on every ex date but obviously it makes it up there are other forces working on voo voo is trade able therefore subject to supply demand pressures while the s&p 500 is not so for the voo etf the data does not indicate pointless dividends but instead implies dividends are free money supports this   s&p500 for last days shows 90 growth while voo for last days shows 105 growth

if you 're toward stocks because you have a long time horizon you 're looking at them for the right reasons i 'm twice your age   i have a mortgage two of them actually a wife and a six year old   i ca n't really justify being terribly risky with my money because i have others depending on my income you 're   unless you 've gotten a really early start on life and already have a family you can take on a lot more risk than stocks   you have time to try things income things that i wish i would have tried at that age like starting a business   the only thing that would push me to do that now would be losing my job and that would n't be the rush i 'd like that 's not to say that you ca n't make a lot of money with stocks but if that 's what you 're looking to do really dig in and research them   you have the time   whether the tide makes all boats rise or sink is a matter of timing the economy but some of the companies will ride the waves   it takes time to find those more often than not which blue chips are likely to ride the waves   i have no clue   but i 'm not invested in them at the moment so it does n't matter

create an account called say paycheck   when you get paid create an entry with your gross income as a deposit   for each deduction in your paycheck create a minus or expense entry   after doing that what will be left in the paycheck account will be your net income   simply transfer this amount to the real account your paycheck goes into your checking account probably almost all the time the value of your paycheck account will be 0   it will be nonzero only for a moment every two weeks or however often you get paid i do n't know if this is the standard way of doing it in the professional accounting world   it 's a way i developed on my own and it works well i think   i think it 's better than just adding a deposit entry in your checking account for your net income as it lets you keep track of all your deductions i use quicken for the mac   before they added a paycheck feature i used this method   then they removed the paycheck feature from the latest version of quicken for the mac and i now use this method again

when you pay cash for a car you do n't always necessarily need to pay cash you just are n't using credit or a loan is all a few options you have are obviously no dealer expects anyone to just have the cash laying around for a car worth a few thousand dollars nor would you bother going to your bank or credit union for the cash you can simply get a cashier 's check made out for the amount note that dealers may not accept personal checks as they may bounce   after negotiations at the dealer you would explain you 're paying cash likely pay a deposit depending on the price of the car but $ 500 would probably be enough again the deposit can be a check or bank deposit and then come back later on with a cashier 's check or deposit into a bank account you would be able to do this later that day or within a few days but since you 've purchased a new car you would probably want to return asap

if it were my money i would n't put it in a 401(k for this purpose if you were working at a company that provided 401(k matching then it might be worth it to put the money in your employer 's 401(k because the employer chips in based on what you put in but you 're self employed so there 's no matching unless you match it yourself   correct so given that there 's no matching a 401(k arrangement would have more restrictions than a non tax advantaged account like a bank account or a taxable money market account   this would be taxable in the year you earn the money but then that 's it if you 're expecting to pull out the money pre retirement i would n't put it in in the first place

rather than question the source question the event two north korean icbms flew over japan in spite of neither was intercepted   what were they waiting for as a missile from a hostile country flew thorough their air space a obviously it was a threat and should have been intercepted   it certainly begs an answer because it seems they were quite helpless and this article makes some very valid points

have the stock certificate in with a letter from the previous owner of the company from what i can tell in the letter these stocks were distributed from the owner himself stating after evaluation we have determined that your investment in this company is worth 10,000 shares at $ 1.00 a piece as well as i believe these shares were also acquired when the company was going through name changes or their company was bought

if you are looking for an advisor to just build a portfolio and then manage it a robo advisor can be beneficial especially if the alternative is doing it your self assuming that you are not well versed in the markets the primary risk with one is that it does not build a portfolio that accurately represents your needs and risk tolerance some firms base the number of questions they ask you on sign up based not on what is needed to get a good profile but on how many before people decide that it is too much hassle and bail that usually results in poorer profiles also a live advisor may be better at really getting at your risk tolerance many of day our risk tolerance is one thing but in reality we are not so risk tolerant   once the profile is built the algorithms maintain your portfolio on a day by day basis if rebalancing opportunities occur they take advantage of it   the primary benefit of a robo advisor is lower fees or smaller minimum account balances the downside is the lack of human interaction and financial advise outside of putting together a portfolio

no   the solution is to simply not force people to use a specific money ie abolish legal tender laws   this way people would save in currencies that have the best reputation for maintaining their value over time and no central bank can print their buddies out of bankruptcy at the expense of hardworking savers

what are the incentives to that person to actually pay off his her debt as opposed to just walking away from it and relying on the cash s)he has for the future spending needs as opposed to borrowing well you ca n't just walk away from debt you still owe it eventually your creditors would end up suing you in court for the money plus interest owed   i suppose you could try to continually duck the authorities but you 'd still owe the money legally

22 june 2016 would have been the time to do this nobody on here can tell you what gbp eur will do in the next few months and years now brexit is going to happen which implies lower uk growth and consequently a lower path for gbp interest rates but this is all already priced in   if you believe the uk economy will underperform current forecasts and/or the euro area economy will outperform current forecasts that may imply there 's scope for further gbp depreciation if you believe the probability of a further political shock from a no deal brexit is materially higher than the market thinks the same is true but the opposite of these things could happen also   i would worry less about playing the currency markets as a retail investor and more about what currency your outgoings are denominated in you live in spain do you have significant gbp expenses or liabilities or do you expect to have them in the future if not why are you taking currency risk by holding gbp balances whereas if you do e.g. if you plan to move back to the uk in the near future then it makes more sense

financial advisors are a client facing role and their utilization of math is relatively limited as far as i am aware most of the bigger groups do the analytical work at a head office and the fa 's in the field are basically account men their entire livelihood is based around relationship management with their clients
