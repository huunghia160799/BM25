like i said i absolutely believe and admit that there are people using icos as a vehicle for schemes    that said there are also individuals like brendan wiki who are accomplished and trusted individuals participating in the market as well brendan is the creator of javascript and a cofounder of he also created the brave web and through that launched an ico for his cryptocurrency basic attention whose ico gathered $ in under 30 token sale internet browser brave i want you to read that again $ in 30 seconds given to a proven and renowned who has been an important figure in shaping the web as we know it for him to cut out the middle men banks vcs and everyone else and have the capital needed to focus on building and launching a new project     is everyone brendan absolutely not but it is important that a market like this exists so that the brendan 's of the world can venture down these paths to accomplish great things even if that means suffering through scams   finally on the subject of icos themselves are icos a bubble maybe but if and when it pops it will simply clear the way for the value added projects it is important to note that the majority of icos that take place are outside of the us and bar us citizens from participating additionally the majority of project teams within the us that seek to issue an ico through the proper legal channels are seeking legal counsel to help structure the deals usually costing anywhere between $ 100    to answer your question regarding subs i would suggest following   /r cryptocurrency    /r ethereum    /r btc    /r bitcoin    these are good basic starting points that can help you learn branch out from there another great resource for news is   hope this helps and i am happy to discuss further if needed

if your debit card has no fraud protection then you need to find a different bank many debit cards include it even with fraud protection i do n't like to keep excess money in the checking account so i have checking and savings accounts with an online bank   i can transfer money from savings to checking instantly 6 times per month which allows me to keep only what is needed in the checking account many online banks have a better overdraft policy as well where you simply pay a small amount of interest on the over drawn amount rather than a set overdraft fee or a $ 20 fee for them to automatically transfer money from your savings account i 've heard of but not made use of threshold based fraud alerts or two factor approval which you can set up so that any purchase in excess of $ n triggers the need for additional approval via your phone

two parties will agree to pay each other 's interest obligations this is generally for one of two reasons    one party wishes to swap a fixed interest rate eg coupons on a bond for a floating interest rate eg payments on a loan if their counterparty wishes the opposite and the rates are acceptable to both they will agree to swap their obligations   there are two firms based in countries a and b. each firm has a branch in the other 's country and these branches each have a loan denominated in that other countries currency to reduce each firm 's exposure to fx risk they can swap their obligations so a will pay interest on b 's loan which is in a 's currency and b on a 's loan which is in b 's currency   edit removed bracket

a while back i sold cars for a living   over the course of 4 years i worked for 3 different dealerships   i sold new cars at 2 and used at the last one when selling new cars i found that the majority of people buying the higher end cars honestly should n't have been 80%+   they almost always came in owing more on their trades then they were worth put down very little cash and were close to being financially strapped    from a financial perspective these deals were hard to close not because the buyer was picky but rather because their finances were a mess   fully half and probably more we had to switch from the car they initially wanted down to a much cheaper version or try to convert to a lease because it was the only way the bank would loan the money   we called them $ 30,000 millionaires because they did n't make a whole lot but tried to look like they did   as a salesman you knew you were in serious trouble when they did n't even try to negotiate around 2 of the deals i did were actual cash deals meaning honest cash not those who came in with a pre approved loan from a bank   these were invariably for used cars about 3 to 4 years old and they never had a trade in   the people doing this always looked comfortable but never dressed up you would n't even look at them twice   the negotiations were hard because they knew exactly how much that car should go for and would n't even pay that    it was obvious they knew the value of money that said i 've been in the top 3 of wage earners for about 20 years and at no point have i considered myself in a position to afford a new luxury car   imho there are far more important things you can do with that kind of money

say your bank gives you a loan at a fix interest rate   they can loan money themselves for a floating interest rate   so they try to find someone who will pay or take the difference between the fix and the floating interest rate on your loan     that 's an interest rate swap and there is nothing evil about it per se   derivatives are like knives you can use them for live saving heart surgery or just a kid in a back alley     the inherent danger lies in the fact that it is easier to create than to understand complex derivatives   this can lead to both sides believing they made on the derivative transaction a logically impossible situation   therefore it is always good when derivatives are traded in a transparent well regulated market where current market price is determined   but then the expected profit margins are small so investment bankers will always try to find more exotic derivatives think of a kid using for brain surgery     we need standard derivatives or we have to re think the whole finance world from grounds up without any guarantee we 'll find anything working any better   we do n't need exotic derivatives they 're almost exclusively there because people shoot for bonuses

i 've used ofx quite a lot for international transfers they are much faster than a normal international transfer from your bank instead it ends up being a local transfer on either end which just works a heck of a lot quicker they also claim lower exchange rates in the past we have compared and sometimes found them lower and sometimes found them a little higher their fees certainly are lower though only thing is i think there was a lag setting up the account initially they need to contact you by phone so if you 're in a hurry this may be problematic and yes you will need internet banking to do this since the question is specifically about how to do this in the cheapest way possible i think the answer is to use internet banking

1- wells fargo does not own our current mortgage   they have bundled it and sold it as an investment 2- they make their money from servicing the loan   even if they only get $ 50 per month to service it 3 of our monthly payment that adds up to $ per month if they have a million homes under management   that is $ 600 million per year for each million homes being serviced 3- managing the escrow gets them additional profit because they can invest it and earn 2 3   if 1,000,000 homes have an average balance of $ 2,000 in their escrow accounts they can earn up to $ 60 per year or $ annually they make $ 1,000 every time they refinance the home   this is the approximate profit after paying real closing costs   refinance those million homes and you make a cool billion in profit 5- they also want to be sure that they keep us as a customer   by lowering our payment they decrease the likelyhood that we will refinance with someone else and we are less likely to default   not that they lose if we default because they do n't own the loan they make additional profit by paying off the old loan they do n't own it remember then packaging and selling the new mortgage   since they are selling it as a security they sell for future value meaning they sell our $ 200,000 loan for a valuation of $   this means that they sell for $ 200,000 plus some fraction of the additional $ 160,000   let 's say they only want a 10 premium of the $ valuation   that means they sell our $ 200,000 loan for $   they pocket $ 36,000   if they make a million of these transactions every year that is $ 36 billion dollars in profit so wells fargo refinances one million homes every year and they make $ initial profit for selling the loan with absolutely no risk plus $ for doing the loan $ annually to service the loan very little risk since it is being paid by the owner of the loan as a service fee if they can retain the loans for their entire life keep us from refinancing with someone else they can make $ that is billion dollars in servicing fees the profit they make in a refinance is much greater than the money then can make by holding the loan for 30 years

i 'm a not an accountant   but my feeling has been that the distinction between asset and liability is mainly a sign convention and comes from a wish to avoid negative numbers suppose you take out a loan for $ 1000 and deposit the proceeds in your bank account   under normal accounting conventions your bank account is an asset and the loan is a liability   after the loan bank has a balance of 1000 and loan has a balance of 1000   you can compute your net worth by adding all assets and subtracting all liabilities so in this case your net worth remains 0 if you treat loan as an asset account then after taking out the loan you should give it a balance of   under this convention you have lots of negative numbers to deal with everywhere which i suspect early accountants would have found inconvenient   the asset liability convention means you only need to deal with negative numbers in unusual situations overdrawn bank account overpaid loan etc likewise in theory you could treat expense accounts as negative income but i 'm not sure why you feel the need to reinvent the wheel by simplifying double entry accounting like this   the standard conventions are not that complicated and their major advantage is that they 're standard other people will be able to understand your books if they ever need to   say you want to hire somebody to do your taxes at some point if your books are kept in your own idiosyncratic system their job will be at best error prone and at worst impossible    it 's a bit like a proposal to simplify english spelling a this mit bee in sum but if can reed it it

disclaimer i am not a tax specialist you probably need a sales tax permit if you 're going to sell goods since just about every state taxes goods though some states have exemptions for various types of goods   for services it gets there is a database here that lists what services are taxed in what states in wyoming for example cellphone services and diaper services are taxed while insurance services and barber services are not   for selling over the internet it gets even there 's a guide on that claims to be comprehensive it states that the default rule of thumb is that if you have a physical presence in a state such as a warehouse or a retail shop or an office you must collect tax on sales in that state given your situation you probably only need to collect sales tax on customers in wyoming probably   in any event i 'd advice having a chat with an accountant in wyoming who can help walk you through what permits may or may not be needed

stock markets are supposed to be about investment and providing capital to companies for operations and research   high frequency trading is only about gaming the market and nothing else   arguments that this provides more capital or liquidity do n't make any sense because the speed of trading is such that listed companies can not take advantage and only high frequency traders are served

the bottom line is you broke the law   while this is pretty much it is none the less a violation of the law and should be avoided in the future   i would have not agreed to this as a parent and it sets a bad precedent   as such i would avoid trading and move the money into cash until you turn 18    once you turn 18 you should transfer the money into an account of your own   from there you may proceed as you wish as far as paying taxes of course you need to pay them   your mother did this as a favor to you and by doing such you caused her tax bill to rise   as a gesture of goodwill you should at least provide her with half of the profits not the 15 you propose   fifteen percent would be the i am an son minimum and i would seriously consider giving all of the profits to her

the price of the last trade is the price of the last trade it indicates what one particular buyer and seller agreed upon there is absolutely no requirement that one of them did n't offer too much or demand too little so this is nearly meaningless as an indication of what anyone else will be willing to offer or demand an average of trades across a sufficiently large number of transactions might indicate a rough consensus about the value of a stock but transactions will be clustered around that average and the average itself moves over time either you offer to sell or buy at a particular price wait for that price and risk the transaction not taking place at all if nobody agrees or you do a spot transaction and get the best price at that which may not be the best in the next or you tell the broker what the limits are that you consider acceptable trading these risks off against each other pick the one which comes closest to your intent and ignore the fact that others may be getting a slightly different price that 's just the way the market works if his price is lower why did n't you buy it there he 's out of stock well come back when i 'm out of stock and i 'll be unable to sell it to you for an even better price

this is price setting algorithms running from the page you link follow the 2 new from $ link and you will see that at the time of writing there are two vendors offering this item for $ plus $ shipping and $ these are clearly not real prices and yet they are close to each other this blog post examines this phenomenon in some detail basically at most one of these vendors actually has this item in stock but to drive traffic and sales they both offer it for sale anyway if someone actually ordered it from the one who does n't have it they would have to buy it first from someone else offering it for sale who is setting their prices based on wider market pricing you can say how a crazy price spiral might develop

which of these categories are emergency funds meant to cover emergency funds are for emergencies which to me means expenses that are unanticipated and ca n't be covered out of normal cash flow   oil changes are not an emergency and should be part of your normal budget   car house repairs and doctor visits might be an emergency depending on the severity and the urgency e.g. do i need to fix this now or can i save up and fix it for known predictable expenses that are infrequent christmas birthdays car insurance home insurance taxes if it 's not part of your mortgage payment i use an escrow account   i calculate how much i 'll need for all of those things put together over the year and set aside a fixed amount each paycheck to ensure that i have enough to cover each item   you could do something similar for minor doctor visits car repairs etc   estimate how much you might spend and set aside some money each month if you find you 're spending more than you thought just increase the amount   you can use envelopes for each type of expense have a separate checking account for those whatever   the point is to set it aside and make sure you have enough left over to cover your known expenses the whole point of an emergency fund is to be able to pay cash for emergencies rather than borrowing to pay them and dealing with interest late fees etc

short term to intermediate term corporate bond funds are available the bond fund vehicle helps manage the credit risk while the short terms help manage inflation and interest rate risk corporate bond funds will have fewer treasuries bonds than a general purpose short term bond fund it sounds like you 're interested in things further out along the risk curve than a return on a 5-year bond and thus do n't care for the treasuries corporate bonds are generally safer than stocks because in bankruptcy all your bondholders have to be paid in full before any equity holders get a penny stocks are much more volatile since they 're essentially worth the value of their profits after paying all their debt taxes and other expenses   as far as stocks are concerned they 're not very good for the short term at all one of the stock funds would be something like the vanguard equity income fund and it this fund is designed to provide investors with an above average level    of current income while offering exposure to the stock market since    the fund typically invests in companies that are dedicated to    consistently paying dividends it may have a higher yield than other    vanguard stock mutual funds the fund ’s emphasis on slower growing    higher yielding companies can also mean that its total return may not    be as strong in a significant bull market this income focused fund    may be appropriate for investors who have a long term investment goal    and a tolerance for stock market volatility even the large cap stable companies can have their value fall dramatically in the short term look at its price chart 2008 was brutal avoid stocks if you need to spend your money within a couple of years whatever you choose read the prospectus to understand the risks

the standard is actually 30 hours a week over a given period of time 3 12 months of the previous taxable year    the interesting problem for the employer who wants to offer benefits to as few employees as possible is erisa sec 510 according to the above poster companies want to avoid hiring full time positions however based on employer needs only hiring part time workers will not be feasible for many businesses furthermore if employers restrict hours for the purpose of denying access to benefits they may be violating erisa sec 510 which would lead to a major lawsuit for that business as erisa is an opt in class action statute as well as a generous attorney fee statute it 's easier for plaintiff 's lawyers to make the defense pay their legal fees see erisa v. it would be unwise for employers to simply refuse to hire any more full time employees   of course companies will be looking to avoid overpaying for benefits in any way they can but simplistic conclusions such as gave that they will not hire full time workers fails to grasp both the complexity of ppaca and the consequences of a given employer 's actions

this is probably the best most concise and yet detailed answer to this oft posed question i 've seen on this sub have an upvote only thing i 'd add is that hfs comparatively more active approach creates a moat vs. mutual funds which are seen as more long term passive investments this means they can charge fees and have higher expense ratios though obviously anyone in finance who has been conscious in the last five years knows that this is changing

it looks like there 's some confusion about the purchase price and vat you should pay your supplier the total amount £ 10 + vat in this scenario so £ 12 look for this figure on the invoice or receipt the supplier does n't normally expect you to work this out for yourself so i 'd be a little surprised if it 's not on there as dumbcoder 's said you 'd then be able to claim the vat back from hmrc if you were vat registered but seeing as you 're not then you do n't need to worry about claiming it and as for selling the product without vat you can and probably should increase the unit price to cover the extra cost otherwise you 'll be operating at a loss hope this helps

if the investments are in a non retirement taxable account there 's not much you can do to avoid short term capital gains if you sell now ways to limit short term capital gains taxes donate you can donate some of the stock to charity before selling it transfer you can give some of the stock to say a family member in a lower tax bracket but there are tons of rules gift limits and wo n't work for little kids or full time students they would still pay taxes at their own rate protect your gains by buying puts wait it out until the long term capital gains rate kicks in this allows you to lock in your gains now but you wo n't benefit from potential future appreciation buying puts also costs $ so do the roi calculation you could also sell a call and buy a put at the same time and lock in your gains for certain but the irs often looks at that as locking in the short term capital gain so be careful and talk to a tax professional if you are considering that method die there 's a step up basis on capital gains for estates source

investopedia states while early exercise is generally not advisable because the time    value inherent in the option premium is lost upon doing so there are    certain circumstances under which early exercise may be advantageous    for example an investor may choose to exercise a call option that is    deeply in the money such an option will have negligible time value    just before the ex dividend date of the underlying stock this will    enable the investor to capture the dividend paid by the underlying    stock which should more than offset the marginal time value lost due    to early exercise so the question is how well do you see the time value factor here

perhaps where we are losing touch is in how income inequality is being measured what i 'm saying is how much more wealthy the top 10 is than the bottom 10 in real numbers not by ratio the united states and other modern democracies with free markets absolutely these smaller less free nations although places like south africa and have gigantic inequality by ratio that primarily because the poor are so poor in those nations   for instance if one man makes $ 100 a year and another makes $ 100,000 the difference is $ in real numbers but 1000 times as much however if a man makes $ 10,000 a year where another makes $ 1,000,000 it is only 100 times as much but the real number difference is $ although by ratio the poorer nation has greater income inequality the wealthier nation has a far greater real gap between the upper and lower class measuring income inequalities both ways has it 's purpose but to judge by only the ratio often gives false impressions often the false impressions given are intentional as in the case of the un which has a markedly anti capitalism lean in its bureaucratic membership   try my original statement with how i am measuring income inequality in mind

historically the advice was to buy the best policy possible not cheapest at the lowest price with the highest benefit   the cost relative to the benefit is very cheap and your much more likely to use disability than life insurance for instance   it is usually cheaper to pay for it with after tax dollars than to buy more insurance in theory you want to buy enough disability to replace 100 of your after tax income or more since there is no inflation protection built into most policies   insurance companies often will not sell this due to moral hazard although you may be able to combine policies to reach 80 or so    keep in mind that you will need to continue to save invest if you are on long term disability since most policies cease payment at 65 or when your eligible for social security   in addition your expenses often rise due to the increased medical expenditures possibly needing cobra private health insurance etc

short answer is yes all the firms are required to keep enough resources on hand to pay claims that may arise from even extreme events like the recent hurricanes   insurance firms are rated based on their claims paying ability and it is absolutely critical for them to maintain enough cushion to pay claims   if lose confidence they wo n't be able to write any more business and they are done   in addition to manage tail risks primary insurers like allstate will often purchase reinsurance   so for example allstate might go to swiss re and buy a policy that kicks in once allstate 's liability exceeds $ for a given event

in double entry bookkeeping no transaction is ever negative you only deal in positive numbers we simulate negative numbers by calling numbers debits and credits where one is the negative of the other only a balance can be negative in this case income is a credit account that means that things that increase your balance are credits and things that reduce your balance are debits so a gift from grandma is a credit it 's a positive number and you write it in the credit column you pretty much never subtract from income except to correct a mistake assets like a checking account are debit accounts increases are debits and decreases are credits you routinely have both debits and credits on a checking account i.e. you put money in and you take money out every transaction affects at least two accounts one with a debit and one with a credit so in this case the gift from grandma credits income and debits checking buying food credits checking and debits expenses

this bbc article says that nuclear power notes came about when the french energy company edf purchased british energy in 2008 the note changes in value with wholesale energy prices and power output levels from british energy 's existing nuclear stations edf energy 's website describes these notes under the section titled nuclear power notes when edf acquired british energy in january 2009 nuclear power notes were issued to british energy shareholders who chose to take them in lieu of 74 pence of cash per british energy share held the nuclear power notes are ten year financial instruments 2009 2019 which give ex british energy shareholders a continuing interest in the edf energy nuclear generation fleet they are traded on the securities derivatives exchange formerly known as the plus quoted exchange    each year a pre defined calculation is performed to determine whether any cash will be paid to nuclear power note holders the calculation is dependent on the nuclear output of the edf energy nuclear generation fleet eligible nuclear output and market power prices power prices this calculation may or may not result in a cash payment each year to nuclear power note holders the are figures you see are measures of watt hours i.e. energy output the value of nuclear power notes is tied to this output looking at the most recent statement june 2013 you can see a line that looks like this month ahead price in respect of july 2013 gbp which is an energy spot price for the output of the nuclear plants i 'm not entirely sure of the relationship between this and the payment to shareholders but if you look at the 2012 yearly payment calculation notice on the same page you 'll see this in the first section a the yearly payment for the period 1 january 2012 to 31 december 2012 the    relevant year payable in respect of each on 31 january 2013 shall be zero the payments were also zero for 2010 and 2011 the 2009 calculation notice however states that a the yearly payment for the period 1 january 2009 to 31 december 2009 the relevant year payable in respect of each on 31 january 2010 shall be pence stated to 6 decimal places i presume that payment would have appeared in whatever account holds these notes e.g. your brokerage account technically the financial statements above refer to a contingent value rights instrument which is a derivative linked to the nuclear power notes this site sums it up better than i can the british energy were created by the issue of nuclear power notes to the target ’s shareholders who opted to take up this alternative the were issued by barclays bank plc and were linked to guaranteed contingent value rights instruments that were issued to barclays by edf ’s acquisition vehicle lake acquisitions and which were ultimately guaranteed by edf energy plc lake barclays is required to make yearly payments to for 10 years the amount of which is limited to the corresponding amount paid by lake acquisitions to barclays for the lake basically there is a chain of payments through these derivatives that eventually links back to nuclear energy output

my bank will let me download credit card transactions directly into a personal finance program and by assigning categories to stores i can get at least a rough overview of that of things and then adjust categories splits when needed ditto checks most of my spending is covered by those does n't help with cash transactions though if i want to capture those accurately i need to save receipts there are ocr products which claim to help capture those have n't tried them currently since my spending is fairly stable i 'm mostly leaving those as unknown that would n't work for you

i too was very confused when i tried to be tricky and paid down my balance before the bill date i thought this would be a great thing because it would show my utilization near zero percent the opposite happen it dropped my credit score from to here is the best example i can come up with when it comes to utilization lets pretend you are an insurance company and you trying to figure out who are the best risk drivers the people that drive 10 of the day are a better risk than the people that drive 50 of the day the people that drive 50 of the day are a better risk than the people that drive 90 of the day here is the rub when people drive 0 when you look at the people at 0 they appear to be walking or flying what they are not doing is driving since they are not driving using credit they are viewed as poor drivers since they are not keeping up on their driving skills paying bills watching how they spend and managing their debt so now before the billing date i pay down my balance to something between 5 to 10 of my utilization after the bill is issued i pay it off in full i am not going to pay these crazy interest rates what shows up on my credit report is a person that is driving his credit between 5 and 10 utilization it shows i know i how to manage my revolving accounts i know it 's dumb you would think they reward people that have zero debt i do n't hate banks i hate the game i do love me some reward points =)

the problems with ratings and the interpretation of ratings is that they are retrospective and most people read them as prospective they basically tell you that debtor is solvent right now what does that mean it means that the ratings are based on the audited financial statements of a company government or other organization issuing debt so in the best case scenario where the rating agency is acting properly they are still dependent on folks with fiduciary responsibility telling the truth and even if they are telling the truth accounting rules make it possible to obscure problems for years in some cases municipal are a great example of this the general obligation bonds cities and even states with deep structural budget problems still get good ratings because they are solvent and have sufficient operating cash to meet obligations today but towards the end of a 30-year bond 's life that may not be the case anymore unless they dramatically alter their budgets at the end of the day ratings are one aspect of due diligence they are useful screening devices but you need to understand who you are lending money to by purchasing bonds and diversify your holdings to protect your wealth   the problem of course is when the trustees of your pension fund invests in garbage assets after getting a sales pitch on the beach in hawaii then conveniently place all of the blame for that bad investment on the rating agency you unfortunately have zero control over that

tricky question basically you just want to first spread risk around and then seek abnormal returns after you understand what portions of your portfolio are influenced by and understand your own investment goals for a relevant timely example the german stock exchange and it 's equity prices are reaching all time highs while the greek asset prices are reaching all time lows if you just invested in europe your portfolio will experience only the mean while suffering from exchange rate changes you will likely lose because you arbitrarily invested internationally for the sake of being international instead of targeting a key country or sector just boils down to more research for you if you want to be a passive investor you will get passive investor returns i 'm not personally familiar with funds that are good at taking care of this part for you in the international markets

let 's think like a real estate developer first you need to check with the zoning commission the restrictions for the area let 's say that the plot is actually suitable for 10 homes you buy the land you also need to finance the build itself if you do n't have enough cash you need to acquire financing from banks and perhaps from other sources as well because banks wo n't loan you the entire amount   next you need to divide the plot into 10 pieces making sure that each piece has driveway access to the street and plan access to utilities water sewer electricity broadband phone lines plan the size and position of each house get building approval this is a process that can take some time especially if they have follow up questions get a builder to build the houses including ground work and preparation for utilities get approval for the finished houses a building inspector will check that the houses follow the permission and all laws and regulations that apply this step can entail time and added cost   get a real estate agent to sell the new homes often the selling process starts in the planning phase and early buyers are able to influence both the layout of the house and the finish your cost estimate included a profit of 140k for each house from that a builder needs to subtract financing costs real estate agent costs any costs that you forgot to factor in budget overdrafts contingency costs and salaries for your staff and yourself i estimate the project time to 1.5 2 years so we have an $ 8 m project with a gross profit of $ 1.4 m not including all costs net profit probably just a few hundred thousand or less   real estate developers with local knowledge would be able to make a much more accurate estimate on both time and cost my guess is that they have and since the plot has n't sold in a while either the price is at the upper end of what makes a profitable project or there are other restrictions that limit the number size of homes that can be built on it

listing on nyse has more associated overhead costs than listing on nasdaq   in the case of young technology companies this makes nasdaq a more attractive option perhaps the most important factor is that nyse requires that a company has an independent compensation committee and an independent committee while nasdaq requires only that executive compensation and decisions are made by a majority of independent directors   no self respecting would be instant tech is going to want some independent committee it over their pay packet   additionally listing on nyse requires a company have stated guidance for corporate governance while nasdaq imposes no such requirement   similarly nyse requires a company have an internal audit team while nasdaq imposes no such requirement    fees on nyse are also a bit higher than nasdaq but the difference is not significant a good rundown of the pros cons

when you refinance there is cost guess around $ to cover lawyers paperwork surveys deed insurance etc etc etc someone has to pay that cost and in the end it will be you even if you get a no points no cost loan the cost is going to be hidden in the interest rate that 's the way transactions with knowledgeable companies works they do business because they benefit profit from it the expectation is that what they need is different from what you need so that each of you benefits but when it 's a primarily cash transaction you ca n't both end up with more money so unless value will be created somewhere else from the process and do n't include the + cash because that ends up tacked onto the principle this seems like paying for financial entertainment and there are better ways to do that

any time a large order it placed for buy the sell side starts increasing as the demand of buy has gone up vice versa is also true once this orders gets fulfilled the demand drops and hence the sell price should also lower depending on how much was the demand supply without your order the price fluctuation would vary for if before your order for this particular share the normal volume is around 100 's of shares then you order would spike things up quite a bit however if for other share the normal volume is around 100000 's then your order would not have much impact

ira is not always an option there are income limits for ira that leave many employees those with the higher salaries but not exactly the riches out of it same for roth ira though the magi limits are much higher also the contribution limits on ira are more than three times less than those on 401 k 5 k vs 16.5 k per irs publication 590 page 12 the income limit agi goes away if the employer does n't provide a 401(k or similar plan not if you do n't participate but if the employer does n't provide but deduction limits do n't change it 's up to $ 5 k or 100 of the compensation the lesser even if you 're not covered by the employers pension plan employers are allowed to match the employees 401 k contributions and this comes on top of the limits i.e. with the employers matching the employees can save more for their retirement and still have the tax benefits that 's the law the companies offer the option of 401 k because it allows employee retention i would not work for a company without 401 k and it is part of the overall benefit package it 's an expense for the employer including the matching why would the employer offer matching instead of a raise not all employers do my current employer for example pays above average salaries but does n't offer 401 k match some companies have very tight control over the 401 k accounts and until not so long ago were allowed to force employees to invest their retirement savings in the company see the enron affair it is no longer an option but by now 401 k is a standard in some industries and employers can not allow themselves not to offer it see my position above

now technically she is supposed to pay rent but legally i am not sure her name is not there in the rental agreement so she is not eligible to pay the rent since she is already living in the same house there is some basic courtesy to pay the $ 200 now thing here is how are we going to divide it if she is paying $ 200 will that be deducted out of your room mate 's or yours fact of the matter is who is taking more space and who is paying for it since there is no change to your space you should continue paying the same amount because there is no change in your space as you mentioned before moreover the fact that she is paying the utilities is good enough because that is shared by all 3 so keep the arrangement like somewhat like this you pay half the rent + utilities and your friend and his girlfriend will pay their share of the rent which is equal to yours and they will share the utilities too hope this makes sense    thanks

a big issue for historical data in banking is that they don't can't reside within a single system archives of typical bank will include of different archives made by different companies on different incompatible systems for example see as an illustration of bank mergers and acquisitions and afaik that does n't include many smaller deals for any given account it 's 10-year history might be on some different system often when integrating such systems a compromise is made if bank a acquires bank b that has earlier acquired bank c then if the acquisition of c was a few years ago then you can skip integrating the archives of c in your online systems keep them separate and use them only when if needed and minimize that need by hefty fees   since the price list and services are supposed to be equal for everyone then no matter how your accounts originated if 10 of archives are an expensive enough problem to integrate then it makes financial sense to restrict access to 100 of archives older than some arbitrary threshold

to add to 's answer you should automate all your loans except for the one with the highest interest rate   leave that one manual and pay the most you can afford each month to pay it off as quickly as possible   once you finish that loan move to the next highest interest rate   ultimately this wo n't be quite as convenient as just having 1 loan   the differences are you need to set up all the automatic payments   this is probably comparable to in complexity of consolidating your loans each time you finish one loan you need to turn off an automatic payment and start doing the next loan manually if you organize yourself well initially you 'll know exactly what order to do the loans in so this should n't take too long however unless your consolidated loan has the same interest rate of your cheapest current loan you will likely save money over all by using this method

because the value of distressed assets is close to what they are selling for    when you lend money you know there is a risk of default   you gamble on that risk and you take the responsibility if you lose because the person taking the money ca n't pay   people who buy distressed debt on the idea that they can make more money off of it are only able to do that in two ways   not giving a shit what the impacts of wringing more money out create figuring out a legal way to make someone else pay for it through ripple effects other people also are impacted when a country ca n't function   if you back klarman you may say the point is you are teaching puerto rico and everyone else that they should n't take on debt they ca n't afford    but when has that ever worked   the pensioners who are bankrupt are the ones actually getting the pain of the lesson   another lesson could be to investors not to lend to people who ca n't pay them back   the people lending the money are the ones who now do n't have it because they made a bad choice     seth klarman could also learn a lesson about taking on distressed debt being a non lucrative pastime   or we can all learn a lesson that taking on distressed debt is very lucrative   a big change america implemented was getting rid of debtor 's prisons   this looks a lot like getting excited about debtor 's prison to me   edit   i should note i am thinking of the version of making a ton of money off of distressed national debt   as opposed to making a bit more money off of distressed debt because you were willing to let the collapse figure itself out   though i 'm not so sure about that either

oh i see what you mean it depends which side you look at it from the company or the individual investor   for the individual investor i guess it does n't matter as you said you only buy the amount of stocks you can afford what matters afterwards is whether the price of your stocks goes up or down that 's when the company valuation comes into play if a company is overvalued the stock prices are going to go down until they reach the equilibrium wiki or stocks go down when more people will want to sell than buy creating an excess supply so sellers will be willing to offer lower prices so you buy from them stocks go up when the opposite happens more people will want to buy than sell so buyers will have to offer more money to convince sellers to sell   in essence facebook was overvalued and not enough people were buying their shares creating excess supply so sellers had to offer lower prices had facebook been properly valued people would've felt the stocks were a good price everyone would've rushed to purchase and stock prices would've gone up

trying to engage in arbitrage with the metal in nickels which was actually worth more than a nickel already last i checked is cute but illegal and would be more effective at an industrial scale anyway i do n't think you could make it cost effective at an individual level there are more effective inflation hedges than nickels and booze some of them even earn you interest you could at least consider a more traditional commodities play it 's certainly a popular strategy these days a lot of people shoot for gold as it 's a traditional hedge in a crisis but there are concerns that particular market is overheated so you might consider alternatives to that normal equities i.e. the stock market usually work out okay in an inflationary environment and can earn you a return as they 're doing so and it 's not like commodities are n't volatile and subject to the whims of the world economy too tips inflation indexed treasury bonds are another option with less risk but also a weaker return and still have interest rate risks involved since those are n't directly tied to inflation either

e.g. a european company has to pay 1 million usd exactly one year from now while that is theoretically possible that is not a very common case mostly likely if they had to make a 1 million usd payment a year from now and they had the cash on hand they would be able to just make the payment today   a more common scenario for currency forwards is for investment hedging   say that european company wants to buy into a mutual fund of some sort say fusex that is a usd based mutual fund you ca n't buy into it directly with euros so if the company wants to buy into the fund they would need to convert their euros to to usd but now they have an extra risk parameter they are not just exposed to the fluctuations of the fund they are also exposed to the fluctuations of the currency market perhaps that fund will make a killing but the exchange rate will tank and they will lose all their gains by creating a forward to hedge their currency exposure risk they do not face this risk flip side if the exchange rate rises in a favorable rate they also do n't get that benefit unless they use an fx option but that is generally more expensive and complicated

if you have an s corp with several shareholders you probably also have a tax adviser who suggested using s corp to begin with   you 're probably best off asking that adviser about this issue if you decided to use s corp for multiple shareholders without a professional guiding you you should probably start looking for such a professional or you may get yourself into trouble that said and reminding you that 1 free advice on the internet is worth exactly what you paid for it and 2 i 'm not a tax professional or tax adviser you should talk to a ea cpa licensed in your state here 's this generally s corps are disregarded entities for tax purposes and their income flows to their shareholders individual tax returns through k-1 forms distributed by the s corp yearly the shareholders do n't have to actually withdraw the profits but if not withdrawing they 're added to their cost bases in the shares i 'm guessing your corp does n't distribute the net income but keeps it on the corporate account only distributing enough to cover the shareholders taxes on their respective income portion in this case the amount not distributed is added to their basis the amount distributed has already been taxed through k-1 if the corporation distributes more than the shareholder 's portion of net income then there can be several different choices depending on the circumstances the extra distribution will be treated as salary to the shareholder and a deduction to the corporation i.e. increasing the net income for the rest of the shareholders the extra distribution will be treated as return of investment reducing that shareholder 's basis in the shares but not affecting the other shareholders if the basis is 0 then it is treated as income to the shareholder and taxed at ordinary rates the extra distribution will be treated as buy back reducing that shareholder 's ownership stake in the company and reallocating the bought back portion among the rest of the shareholders in this case it is treated as a sale of stock and the gain is calculated as with any other stock sale including short term vs. long term taxation there 's also sec that can come in handy here the extra distribution will be treated as dividend this is very rare for s corp but can happen if it was a c corp before in that case it will be taxed as dividends note that options 2 3 and 4 subject the shareholder to the while option 1 subjects the shareholder to fica self employment tax and subjects the company to payroll taxes there might be other options your licensed tax adviser will go with you through all the facts and circumstances and will suggest the best way to proceed

news about a company is not the only thing that affects its stock 's price there is also supply and demand   that of course is influenced by news but it is not the only actor   an insider with a large position in their company 's stock may want to diversify his overall portfolio and thus need to sell a large amount of stock   that may be significant enough to increase supply and likely reduce the stock 's price somewhat that brings me to another influence on stock price perception   executives and other insiders with large positions in their company 's stock have to be careful about how and when they sell some of that stock as to not worry the markets   many investors watch insider selling to gauge the health of the company which brings me to another important point   there are many things that may be considered news which is material to a certain company and its stock   it is not just quarterly filings earnings reports and such   there is also news related to competitors news about the economy or a certain sector news about some weather event that affects a major supplier news about a major earthquake that will impact the economy of a nation which can then have knock on effects to other economies etc there are also a lot of investors with varying needs which will influence supply and demand   an institutional investor needing to diversify may reduce their position in a stock and thus increase supply enough that it impacts the stock 's price   meanwhile individual investors will make their transactions at varying times during the day   in the aggregate that may have significant impacts on supply and demand the overall point being that there are a lot of inputs and a lot of actors in a complicated system   even if you focus just on news there are many things that fall into that category news does not come out at regular intervals and it does not necessarily spread evenly   that alone could make for a highly variable environment

your confusion is that that answerer is not comparing a $ 5500 roth ira contribution to a $ 5500 traditional ira contribution rather they were comparing a $ 3600 roth ira contribution to a $ 5000 traditional ira contribution it is fairer to do such a comparison because assuming that this person 's marginal tax rate is 28 both of them start with the same amount of pre tax money $ 5000 of pre tax money is equivalent to $ 3600 of post tax money in 28 tax bracket as a result both a $ 5000 traditional ira contribution and a $ 3600 roth ira contribution will leave you with the same amount of cash in your bank account at the end after taxes are filed that 's why it 's a fair comparison and when you do such a comparison it will mathematically indeed always turn out to the same result for traditional and roth if the contribution and withdrawal are at the same tax rate on the other hand if you were to compare a $ 5000 roth ira contribution to a $ 5000 traditional ira contribution even though it 's the same nominal dollar figure you would be comparing apples and oranges because in one case it 's a post tax dollar amount and in the other case a pre tax dollar amount the roth ira contribution actually leaves you with less in your bank account at the end after taxes are filed than the same nominal dollar amount of traditional ira contribution so you are comparing an effectively larger roth ira contribution to a smaller traditional ira contribution of course the larger contribution gets more tax advantages over time and so the result looks better note that since traditional ira contribution and roth ira contributions share the same nominal dollar amount annual limit but we know that $ 1 of roth ira contributions is effectively larger than $ 1 of traditional ira contributions that means that roth ira contributions has an effectively higher annual limit than traditional ira contributions for example a $ 5500 traditional ira contribution is equivalent to a $ roth ira contribution for someone in the 28 bracket whereas a $ 5500 roth ira contribution would be equivalent to a $ traditional ira contribution which you ca n't do so it 's not possible to do a fair comparison when you go near the limit if it is important to you to tax advantage the largest amount of money then that is a reason to go for roth ira since it has an effectively higher annual limit you can not replicate the tax advantage of a $ 5500 roth ira contribution with a traditional ira contribution because that money in pre tax dollars is beyond the limit of a traditional ira contribution

very likely this refers to trading speculating on leverage not investing of course as soon as you put leverage into the equation this perfectly makes sense   2007 2009 for example if one bought the $ spx at its highs in 2007 at to the lows from 2009 at that with only 2:1 leverage a $ account would have received a margin call at least here in europe i can trade index cfd 's and other leveraged products if i trade lets say > 50:1 leverage it does n’t take much to get a margin call and/or position closed by the broker no doubt depending on which investments you choose there ’s always risk but currency is a position too to answer the question i find it very unlikely that > 90 of investors referring to stocks lose money purchasing power anyway i would not deny that where speculators not investors use leverage or try to trade swings news etc have a very high risk of losing money purchasing power

if you keep the account in your name only and your girlfriend is depositing money into it then she is in effect making gifts of money to you if the total amount of such gifts exceeds $ 14 k in 2014 she will need to file a gift tax return irs form 709 due april 15 of the following year but not included with her federal tax return it has to be sent to a specific irs office as detailed in the instructions for form 709 she would need to pay gift tax as computed on form 709 unless she opts to have the excess over $ 14 k count towards her federal lifetime combined gift and estate tax exclusion   of $ and so no gift tax is due   most estates in the us are far smaller than $ 5 million and pay no federal estate tax at all and for most people the reduction of the lifetime combined is of no consequence   another point for your girlfriend to think about if you two should break up and go your separate ways at a later time you are under no obligation to return   her money to her and if you do choose to do so you will need to file a gift tax return at that time if you will be returning her contributions together with   all the earnings attributable to her contributions then keep   in mind that you will have paid income taxes on those earnings all along since the account is in your name only   finally keep in mind that the i in ira stands for individual and your girlfriend is not entitled to put her contributions into your ira account summary do n't do this or open a joint account as tenants in common no matter how much you love each other she should open accounts in her name only and make contributions to those accounts

it 's funny how you say they will resort to laws to stop consumers from getting what they want when in reality the so called upstarts are the ones on very thin ice with breaking the law   if you define netflix as an upstart then i can already see that we do n't agree on the same premise and hence further argument is pointless   and for the record was only possible with tv and all the talented people in production   do you really think youtube or netflix will be able to produce a quality show   i think not   like i pointed out everyone is giving too much credit to netflix because it 's easy to stream a show after the risk has already been taken to spend the time and money to produce a show   this is why these upstarts operate on a profitable margin they are eating tv cable 's lunch   i am all for tv i believe that tv will still be around 50 years from now   the internet and tech is very volatile and you never know where it will stand 5 even 10 years from now   in the end people do not want to watch cheap low quality comedy on their iphones   60 inch lcd home theaters are here to stay in peoples homes   maybe it will be streamed via the internet but tv will very much still pull a lot of weight   afterall tv built the industry they deserve to own it     i do n't see the logic and destroying tv to benefit companies like apple or netflix who really have no idea how to even begin on a quality show    this boils down to the fact that people will always consume the cheapest form of entertainment and while this is true   americans are sophisticated enough to distinguish cheap from quality   tv delivers quality and will continue to deliver quality while the internet delivers a few occasional packaged in mediocrity

the simplest most convenient way i know of to move your savings to canada is to purchase an exchange traded fund like the canadian dollar trust or a similar instrument i identify this fund because i know it exists not because i particularly recommend it your money will be in canadian currency earning canadian interest rates you will pay a small portion of that interest in fees since us banks are already guaranteed by the fdic up to $ 250,000 per account i do n't really think you avoid any risks associated with the failure of an individual bank but you might fare better if the us currency is subject to inflation or unfavorable foreign exchange movements not that such a thing would be a direct risk of a bank failure but it could happen as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve under the of the economy if the economy worsens in the wake of a financial crisis or for that matter if it worsens as a result of something else including legislative regulatory or executive policies read the prospectus to understand additional risks with this investment one of them is foreign exchange risk if the us economy and currency strengthen relative to the canadian economy and its currency you may lose substantial amounts of purchasing power additionally one of the possible results of a financial crisis is a flight to safety the global financial markets still seem to think the us dollar is pretty safe and they may bid it up as they have done in the past resulting in losses to your position at least in the short term i do not personally recommend moving all your savings to canada especially if it you of income from more profitable investments over the long term but moving some of your savings to canada at least is n't a stupid idea and it may turn out to be somewhat profitable having some canadian currency is also a good idea if you plan to spend the money that you are saving on canadian goods in the intermediate future

1 are the definitions for capital market from the two sources the same yes   they are from two different perspectives   investopedia is looking at it primarily from the perspective of a trader and they lead off with the secondary market this refers to the secondary market a market in which individuals and institutions trade financial securities this refers to the primary market organizations institutions in the public and private sectors also often sell securities on the capital markets in order to raise funds also the investopedia definition leaves much to be desired but it is supposed to be   so you are comparing apples and oranges to some extent   one is an article as short as it may be this other one is an entry in a dictionary 2 what is the opposite of capital market according to the definition in investopedia   it 's not quite about opposites this is not physics   however that is not the issue here   the investopedia definition simply does not mention any other possibilities   the wikipedia article defines the term more thoroughly   it talks about primary secondary markets in separate paragraph 3 according to the wikipedia 's definition why does stock market belong to capital market given that stocks can be held less than one year too if you follow the link in the wikipedia article to money market as money became a commodity the money market is nowadays a component of the financial markets for assets involved in short term borrowing lending buying and selling with original maturities of one year or less the key here is original maturities of one year or less here 's my attempt at explaining this financial markets are comprised of money markets and capital markets    money is traded as if it were a commodity on the money markets   hence the short term nature in its definition   they are more focused on the money itself      capital markets are focused on the money as a means to an end companies seek money in these markets for longer terms in order to improve their business in some way a business may go to the money markets to access money quickly in order to deal with a short term cash crunch   meanwhile a business may go to the capital markets to seek money in order to expand its business note that capital markets came first and money markets are a relatively recent development    also we are typically speaking about the secondary capital market when we are talking about the stock or bond market   in this market participants are merely trading among themselves   the company that sought money by issuing that stock bond certificate is out of the picture at that point and has its money    so facebook got its money from participants in the primary market the underwriters   the underwriters then turned around and sold that stock in an ipo to the secondary market   after the ipo their stock trades on the secondary market where you or i have access to trade it   that money flows between traders   facebook got its money at the beginning of the process

japan has entered the next phase unlimited money printing   investors have been watching japan for over a decade now wondering what happens to a country that has a debt to gdp ratio of big   to realistically pay off we are starting to get the answer for review japan was the first country in the modern central banking era to begin a policy of   quantitative easing an unconventional form of monetary policy that is used when interest rates have already been lowered to the zero bound quantitative easing which involves the purchase of printed money to buy government bonds was widely viewed in japan as a failure but what most people do n't understand about japan 's early qe experiments is that they were very small less than $ 20 billion a month it took prime minister abe and boj governor   to ramp up asset purchases significantly in what was called      abe japan 's prime minister photographer bloomberg      the results of have been mixed but the stock market is certainly higher and the yen is certainly lower although it 's not clear that either of those two developments have really helped japan 's stock market is mostly foreign owned and the weaker yen did n't materially help the balance of trade still there are a lot of people who said that japan 's endless debt deflation would have been worse   without so it has remained firmly in place for five years   rapidly began to cause distortions as accelerated asset purchases caused the bank of japan to hold a huge percentage of outstanding government bonds at 40 and rising as well as being the majority holder of index etfs investors who traffic in have remarked that the market now functions very poorly since so much of the market is held by the boj it seems that will get worse not better last year the boj implemented a policy of yield curve targeting ostensibly to help the banks keeping the overnight rate negative but targeting a 10 year rate at zero percent the boj has been buying longer dated bonds for years but this was the first time it ever explicitly capped a rate at longer maturities some people wondered how committed the boj would be to maintain that cap in the event that were caught up in a global duration selloff which we experienced in the last two weeks   as 10-year yields rose above 0.10 last week the boj announced that it was prepared to buy an   unlimited amount of bonds to keep yields close to zero percent as you can imagine buying an unlimited amount of 10-year involves printing a theoretically unlimited amount of yen so the yen weakened significantly on the news   it still remains about ten percent stronger than it was in 2015 we are getting closer to the endgame for japan what happens if yields rise further what happens if the yen depreciates significantly how much could it depreciate could japan have a currency crisis what happens if the boj ends up owning the entire bond market these are the questions that investors are asking and nobody really knows the answers we are in territory i believe that a currency crisis is n't just possible it 's inevitable and it probably happens at about the time that the boj owns all or nearly all of the market and has to resort to   canceling the debt this sounds like a neat magic trick to make the debt go away but the laws of economics are not to be conned anything is possible a currency crash a bond market crash anything this is the very definition of debt monetization that resulted in hyperinflation in places like weimar germany and zimbabwe is japan different we shall see we will find out soon as japan has taken a major step in that direction   is the   author of all the evil of this world and the editor of the 10th man newsletter for economics subscribe here   forbes articles have 8 tracking cookies and 9 tracking scripts this comment has r

we ’re buying the home right over $ 200,000 so that means he will only need to put down as a roughly $ 7000 i 'm with the others do n't call this a gift unless it is a gift    i 'd have him check with the bank that previously refused him a mortgage if putting both of you on a mortgage would their concerns   your cash flow would be paying the mortgage payment and if you failed to do so then they could fall back on his   that may make more sense to them even if they would deny each of you a loan on your own   this works for them because either of you is responsible for the whole loan   it works for him because he was already willing to be responsible for the whole loan   and your alternative plan makes you responsible for the whole loan so this is just as good for you    at what percentage would you suggest splitting ownership and future expenses typically a cash financing partnership would be 50/50 but since it ’s only a 3.5 down payment instead of 20 is that still fair surprisingly enough a 3.5 down payment that accumulates is about half the equity of a 20 down payment   so your suggestion of a split makes sense if 20 would give a split    i expected it to be considerably lower   the way that i calculated it was to have his share increase by his equity share of the rent which i set to the principal plus interest payment for a thirty year loan   with a 20 down payment this would give him 84 equity   with 3.5 about 40 equity   i 'm not sure why 84 equity should be the equivalent of a 50 share but it may be a side effect of other expenses   perhaps taking property taxes out would reduce the equity share    note that if you increase the down payment to 20 your mortgage payment will drop substantially   the difference in interest between 3.5 and 20 equity is a couple hundred dollars   also you 'll be able to eliminate any pmi payment at 20    it could be argued that if he pays a third of the monthly mortgage payment that that would give him the same 50 equity stake on a 3.5 down payment as he would get with a 20 down payment   the problem there is that then he is effectively subsidizing your monthly payment   if he were to stop doing that for some reason you 'd have what is effectively a 50 increase in your rent   it would be safer for you to handle the monthly payment while he handles the down payment    if you could n't pay the mortgage it sounds like he is in a position to buy out your equity rent the property and take over the mortgage payment   if he stopped being able to pay his third of the mortgage it 's not evident that you 'd be able to pick up the slack from him much less buy him out   and it 's unlikely that you 'd find someone else willing to replace him under those terms   but your brother could construct things such that in the face of tragedy you 'd inherit his equity in the house   if you 're making the entire mortgage payment that 's a stable situation    he 's not at risk because he could take over the mortgage if necessary   you 're not at risk because you inherit his equity share and can afford the monthly payment   so even in the face of tragedy things can go on   and that 's important as otherwise you could lose your equity in the house

the short answer is it depends the longer answer is that balance transfers are tricky and often a bait and switch they 'll offer 0 interest but charge a 3 4 fee which is n't interest and is perfectly legal on the amount transferred if you transfer $ 5000 you now owe the new card company $ now that could be fine with you at an 18 20 apr on your old card you may have been charged that much in just one or two months and by capitalizing this fee up front you lock in 0 for a year however there are other possible machinations behind the scenes for instance you may incur retroactive interest on the full balance if not paid off in the year at 20 apr on $ 5000 that 's an extra grand you will owe if there 's even one dollar of the original transferred balance left in the account paying off the balance and thus avoiding these penalties has actually been made harder by the card act which required creditors to apply any payment made to the highest interest portion of the balance first as balance transfers are 0 they are the last on the list so if you transfer a balance and then carry an additional balance you are setting yourself up for failure you must have a zero dollar balance for one month sometime during the year in order to be sure the balance transfer is paid off and no penalties will be incurred that can be hard because 5 grand is a lot to pay off to pay off a $ 5000 balance in 12 months requires payments of $ miss one and you 'll have to make it up over the remaining months if you transferred a balance you probably did n't have $ to pay to the card in the first place in summary balance transfers can work but you have to understand all of the terms and conditions and what will happen should you violate any of them if you do n't understand what you 're getting into you could very well end up worse than you started

i would also check into whether you can keep using your credit card instead of switching to a debit card tied to your checking account   the credit card provides you protection from someone wiping your account out   most banks will help you get the money back if this happens while using a debit card   but you are out the money while the bank figures out who is wrong   in the credit cards case none of your money is actually taken from your account while you dispute the charge i also agree with the others that having all your money in one account is more difficult to keep real spending money separate from emergency fund money

hmmm as far as i know wire transfers are still the best option if you make sure your us account accepts international wires for free like td bank does you 'll have eliminated most of the costs assuming your foreign bank does n't charge too much for wiring the funds in the first place also if your able to you could consider wiring 6 or so months at the same time i 'm not familiar with xe.com but it seems it 's not set up for transferring money so much as for trading currencies while you could probably use it to transfer funds if you 'd link both your accounts it seems a rather complicated way to go about things paypal could be an option if they 'd allow you to set up an account in each country or if you have a relative that could help out but it gets more expensive than wire transfers quickly as for getting the best exchange rate i 've given up on that a long time ago and have accepted that as the cost of living internationally

as i 'm sure you are reading in hull 's classic the basic valuation of bonds depends on the chance of entity defaulting on those bonds   let 's start with just looking at the us   the united states has a big advantage over corporations in issuing debt as it also prints the same currency that the debt is denominated in   this makes it much easier not to default on your debt as you can always print more money to pay it   printing too much currency would cause inflation lowering the value of debt but this would also lower the value of us corporate debt as well   so you can think of even the highest rated corporate bonds as having the same rate as government debt plus a little extra due to the additional default risk of the corporation the situation with other aa rated governments is more complicated   most of those governments have debt denominated in their local currency as well so it may seem like they should all have similar rates   however some governments have higher and some actually have lower rates than the united states   now as above some of the difference is due to the possible need of printing too much currency to cover the debt in crisis and now that we have more than one country to invest in the extra risk of international money flowing out of the country 's bonds however the bigger difference between aa governments rates depends more on money flow central banks and regulation   bonds are still mostly freely traded instruments that respond to supply and demand but this supply and demand is heavily influenced by governments   central banks buy up large portions of the debt raising demand and lowering rates   regulators force banks to hold a certain amount of treasuries perhaps inflating demand finally to answer your question the united states has some interesting advantages partially just due to its long history of stability controlled inflation and large economy making treasuries valuable as one of the lowest risk investments   so its rates are generally on the low end but government manipulation can still mean that it is not necessarily the lowest

this is the best tl;dr i could make publication the high road seattle labor market and the effects of the minimum wage increase data limitations and methodological problems bias new analysis of minimum wage reduced by 97 i 'm a bot gt rather than a smooth distribution of workers at and above any statutory minimum wage a regular feature of local state and federal minimum wages is that there are noticeably more workers who earn exactly any new minimum wage than there are just above the new minimum   gt the fact that in their figure 1 the authors fail to detect any new spike due to the minimum wage increase to $ again suggests that the study is not estimating the true effects of the minimum wage and instead merely reflecting wage growth in seattle that is occurring regardless of the the minimum wage increase   gt one reason the study may be finding strong employment gains well above any plausible range where the minimum wage could be having an effect on employment is that seattle was experiencing a labor market boom at the same time the city was implementing the minimum wage increase    extended summary**](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr | faq](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr comments/31b9fm faq_autotldr_bot/ version 1.65 tl;drs so far | feedback](http://np.reddit.com message compose?to=%23autotldr pm 's and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome | top keywords wage**^#1

whether or not you choose to buy is a complicated question   i will answer as what you should consider think about as i do n't think what should i do is on topic first off renting tends to look expensive compared to mortgages until you factor in the other costs that are included in your rent property taxes   these are a few grand a year even in the worst areas and tend to be more   find out what the taxes are ahead of time   even though you can often deduct them and your interest you 're giving up your standard deduction to do so and with the low interest regime currently unless your taxes are high you may not end up being better off deducting them home insurance this depends on home and area but is at least hundreds of dollars per year and could easily run a thousand   so another hundred a month on your bill and it 's more than renter 's insurance by quite a lot upkeep costs for the property   you 've got a lot of up front costs buy a etc types of things plus a lot of ongoing costs general repair plumbing breaks electrical breaks whatnot    sales commission as scott notes in comments   when you sell you 're paying about 6 commission so you wo n't be above water if housing prices stay flat until you 've paid off 6 of your loan value plus closing costs another couple of percent   you hit the 90 point on a 15 year about year 2 but on a 30 year you do n't hit it until about year 5 so you might not be above water when you want to sell risk of decrease in value whenever you buy property you take on the risk of losing value as well as the potential of gaining value   do n't assume that because prices are going up they will continue to remember that a lot of investors are well aware of possible profits from rising prices and will be buying and driving prices up themselves   2008 was a shock to a lot of people even in areas where it seemed like prices should 've still gone up you never know what 's going to happen   if you buy a house for 20 or so down you have a bit of a safety net if it drops 10 20 in value you 're still above water though you do of course lose money while if you buy it for 0 down and it drops 20 in value you wo n't be able to sell at all for years all that together means you should really take a hard look at the costs and benefits make a realistic calculation including all actual costs and then make a decision i would not buy simply because it seems like a good idea to not pay rent   if you 're unable to make any down payment then you 're also unable to deal with the risks in home ownership not just decrease in value but when your pipe bursts and ruins your basement or when the roof needs a replacement because a tree falls on it   yes home insurance helps but not always and the deductible will still get you just to have some numbers for my area we pay about $ 8000 a year in property taxes on a $ 280k house $ 200k mortgage $ 1k a year in home insurance so our escrow payment is about $ 750 a month   a 15 year for $ 200k is about $ 1400 a month so $ 2200 or so total cost   we do live in a high property tax area so someone in lower tax regimes would pay less say 1800 1900 but not that cheap   a 30 year would save you 500 or so a month but you 're still not all that much lower than rent

are you geometrically linking the spot rates for each spot period over of the next year i.e. are you looking at the spot strip or just taking today 's spot rate and it   if you are looking at the spot strip then a ytm for a bond maturing in one year should equal the return from investing in rolling one month spot rates for the next year more or less if this variance is large then there is scope for arbitrage

what teachers have is not ridiculous stop blindly accepting what the media is throwing at you what teachers have is the right to a due process when they are being evaluated that 's all    why try this the next time you assert pseudo free market principals into education at least take into account the fact that unlike a free market schools can not hire anybody to teach simply because you want to someone on wall street can hire literally anyone they want based simply on the idea that they 're convinced the person can do the job   not in education the people demand that a teacher go through literally years of classes observations training and tens of thousands of dollars to earn their credential in other words if you were a principal and you stumbled across somebody that you were convinced would make an excellent teacher you could n't hire them   there is no free market system in education because the people have demanded standards for what qualifies someone as a professional teacher   here 's the point what kind of people would jump through all those hoops to become a teacher or or policeman without something to protect what they 've earned we 're already losing record number of teachers because of the bullshit that comes from letting politicians run our schools take away union protections and they 'll be leaving in droves   what 's fucking ridiculous is a public that wants no child left behind performance at a fraction of what they paid forty years ago

re a trader when buying needs to buy at the ask price and when selling needs to sell    at the bid price so how can a trade happen in between the bid and ask saying the trade can happen in between the bid ask is simplistic   there is a time dimension to the market   it 's more accurate to say that an order can be placed in between the current best bid ask observed at time t=0 thus establishing a new level for one or the other of those quoted prices observed at time if you enter a market order to buy or sell then yes you 'll generally be accepting the current best ask or best bid with your order because that 's what a market order says to do accept the current best market price being offered for your kind of transaction   of course prices may move much faster than your observation of the price and the time it takes to process your order you 're far from being the only participant market orders aside you are free to name your own price above or below the current best bid ask respectively then one could say that you are placing an order in between the bid and ask at the time your order is placed   however and this is key you are also moving one or the other of those quoted prices in the process of placing your above bid buy order or your below ask sell order then only if somebody else in the market chooses to accept your new ask or bid does your intended transaction take place and that transaction takes place at the new ask or bid price not the old one that was current when you entered your order read more about bid ask prices at this other question p.s fwiw i do n't necessarily agree with the assertion from the article you quoted i.e. by looking for trades that take place in between the bid and ask you can tell when a strong trend is about to come to an end   i would say maybe perhaps but maybe not

the following is from wikipedia term life insurance with very minor editing because term life insurance is a pure    death benefit its primary use is to    provide coverage of financial    responsibilities for the insured    such responsibilities may include but    are not limited to consumer debt    dependent care college education for    dependents funeral costs and    mortgages term life insurance is    generally chosen in favor of permanent    life insurance because it is usually    much less expensive depending on the    length of the term many financial    advisors or other experts commonly    recommend term life insurance as a    means to cover potential expenses    until such time that there are    sufficient funds available from    savings to protect those whom the    insurance coverage was intended to    protect for example an individual    might choose to obtain a policy whose    term expires near his or her    retirement age based on the premise    that by the time the individual    retires he or she would have amassed    sufficient funds in retirement savings    to provide financial security for    their dependents this suggests the questions why do you have this policy also how many term life policies do you need or how much insurance do you need clearly you will be better off investing the premiums in the market   your beneficiaries may be better off either way depends when you die and to a lesser extent on market performance if you are not able to retire now but expect to be able to later you should strongly consider having sufficient insurance to provide income replacement for your spouse   this is a fairly common why

a specific strategy to make money on a potentially moderately decreasing stock price on a dividend paying stock is to write covered calls   there is a category on money se about covered call writing but in summary a covered call is a contract to sell the shares at a set price within a defined time range you gain a premium called the time value which when i 've done it can be up to an additional return on the position   with this strategy you 're collecting dividends and come out with the best return if the stock price stays in the middle if the price does not shoot up high enough that your option is called you still own the stock and made extra return if the price drops moderately you may still be positive

gt;it 's sad when i hear young workers talk about their job application strategies more often than not they involve figuring out how to fool the hr bots   lol   it took me a second with your hr bots to realize you were talking about the software and not the hr personnel   because i have always even 30 years back viewed hr as basically operating on a lot of faulty fundamental assumptions the best way to get hired even back then before the software application screening process was to do an end run around hr   part of the reason is that hr or previously the personnel dept was really designed from the get go only to fill the generic factory worker positions jobs that had minimal base level skill requirements i.e. the checkbox type stuff where any relatively intelligent person should be able to determine with a pretty high accuracy whether the candidates could do the job in other words the open positions that were effectively commodities and where the turnover was high and/or the number of people employed fairly large   but then a combination of hr wanting to be more professional combined with the advent of the generic mba manager who believes he she can manage anything without specific domain knowledge or experience created an opening for hr to take over the hiring of virtually all positions   so what we ended up with was the generic mba manager lacking domain knowledge experience shifting the responsibility or at least most of it for candidate filtering amp hiring off to generic hr people processes who pretty much by definition lack domain knowledge experience and who then attempted to the whole thing     add in stuff like equal opportunity anti discrimination laws and lawsuits to drive the generic of the whole process and you have the perfect pre conditions for the storm that is the current fiasco   so we end up with generic and lets face it often ignorant managers taking job requirements and coming up with checklist style help wanted ads cs degree 5 10 years of ruby on rails work experience hr departments that are clueless about the validity availability of those requirements pretty much just the crap into the ads amp application filtering software in a rote fashion and like a badly constructed google search it should n't be surprising that they come up with minimal results   of course within the discarded applicants are probably several potentially excellent hires but they will simply never be found     so smart people will still again do their best not to game the bots but to do an end run around the whole thing   and that means using your network to get your name in the door and your resume in the hands of the person that matters within the company that may or just as often may not be the manager who makes the hiring decision it may very well be the most experienced person in his department who then pushes the manager to interview and hire you and you preferably do that before the damned ad is even written and before the hr department is even aware that there is a need for a hire keep in mind that there is often a span of several weeks if not several months between the real awareness of a need and the manager hr getting around to actually starting the help wanted fiasco ridden process   one key aspect of that is that via the in the door ahead of time even if the company requires the hr process to be followed the job spec can be constructed to match the pre qualified candidate and his her resume can go to the top of the stack already being in the manager 's hands with a recommendation endorsement from one of his critical team members i.e. hire this guy gal   unfortunately it seems that for all the emphasis on networking these days colleges and other how to get hired classes seldom if ever teach those techniques   but if you ask around look around within companies and identify the really good fit people a lot of them will have been hired by this method and emphatically were not found via hr listings amp processes

yes it can be a good idea to close unused credit cards   i am going to give some reasons why it can be a good idea to close unused accounts and then i will talk about why it is not necessarily a bad idea why it can be a good idea to close unused accounts i 'd like to close the cards   that is reason enough    simplifying your financial life is a good thing   fewer accounts let you focus your energy on the accounts that you actually use unused accounts still need to be monitored for fraud you mentioned that you have high credit card balances that you are carrying   this may indicate that you have trouble using credit responsibly and having more credit available to you might be a temptation for you if these unused cards have annual fees keeping them open will cost money unused cards sometimes get closed by the bank due to inactivity   as a result the advice often given is that in addition to not closing them you are supposed to charge something to it every month   this of course takes more of your time and energy to worry about as well as giving you another monthly bill to pay why it is not necessarily a bad idea to close unused accounts other answers will tell you that it may hurt your credit score for two reasons it would increase your utilization and lower your average account age   before we talk about the validity of these two points we need to discuss the importance of the credit score depending on what your credit score currently is these actions may have minimal impact on your life   if you are in the mid 700 's or higher your score is excellent and closing these cards will likely not impact anything for you in a significant way if you are n't that high in your score yet do you have an immediate need for a high score   are you planning on getting more credit cards or take out any more loans   i would suggest that since you have credit card debt you should n't be taking out any new loans until you get that cleaned up   so your score in the mean time is not very important are you currently working on eliminating this credit card debt   if so your utilization number will improve even after you close these accounts when you get those paid off   utilization has only a temporary effect on your score when your utilization improves your score improves immediately your average account age may or may not improve when you close these accounts depending on how old they are compared to the accounts you are leaving open   however the impact of this might not be as much as you think i realize that this advice is different from other answers or other things that you may read online   but in my own life i do a lot of things that are supposedly bad for the credit score i only have two credit cards ages 2.5 and 1.5 years   i closed my other cards when i got these   my typical monthly utilization is around 25 on these cards although i pay off the balance in full each month never paying interest   i have no car loan anymore and my mortgage is only 4 months old   no other debt   despite those terrible credit practices my credit score is very high conclusion make your payments on time get out of debt and your score will be fine   do n't keep unwanted accounts open just because someone told you that you should

the good debt bad debt paradigm only applies if you are considering this as a pure investment situation and not factoring in a house is something you live in and a car is something you use for transportation these are not substitutes for each other while you can live in your car in a pinch you ca n't take your house to the shops looking at the car i will simplify it to 3 options you can now make a list of pros and cons for each one and decide the value you place on each of them e.g. public transport will add travel time per week $ x per hour how much you value your leisure time an expensive car will make me feel good and i value that at $ y. for each option put all the benefits together this is the value of that option to you then put all of the costs together this is what the option costs you then make a decision on which is the best value for you   once you have decided which option is best for you then you can consider how you will fund it

i think a larger issue is that you 're trying to do market timing whether you had a large or small amount of money to invest no one wants to put the money in to watch it go down   you ca n't really predict if prices in a market or security will go up in six months in which case you want to put all your cash in now of if it will go down in which case you 'd want to wait until the bottom or if it will around in which case you 'd want to only buy at the bottoms   of course if you 're magic enough to nail all of those market conditions you 're a master finance trader and will quickly make billions if you 're really concerned with protecting your money and want to take some long positions i 'd look into some put options you 'll of course pay the fees for those put options but they 'll protect your downside   much of this depends on your time horizon at the age of 35 someone can expect to see ~6 more recessions and perhaps ~30 more market corrections before retirement with that big of a time range it 's best to avoid micro optimizing since that tends to hurt your performance overall because you wo n't be able to time the market correctly most of the time   one thing that 's somewhat reasonable if you have the stomach for it is to not buy at somewhat obvious market highs and wait for corrections this is n't fool proof by any means but as an example many people realized that us equities basically were on a ~5 year up run by december 2014 many people cashed out those positions expecting that a correction would be due and around late summer of 2015 that correction came for those with patience they made ~15 with a few mouse clicks   of course many others would have been waiting for that correction since 2010 and missed out on the market increases   boiled down

in response to your points 1 and 2 in general yes it is true that capital gains are only subject to half one 's marginal rate of income tax   that does n't mean 50 of the gain is due as tax rather it means that if one 's marginal tax rate tax bracket on the next $ 10 k would have been say 32 then one is taxed on the gain at 16   the percentages are examples not factual however because these are employee stock options the tax treatment is different than for a capital gain     details on the federal tax return are lines for reporting security option benefits line 101 and security options deductions line   the distinction between a regular capital gain and an employee stock option benefits is important   in many cases the net effect may be the same as a capital gain but the income is characterized differently and there are cases where it matters   somebody who is about to or has realized employee stock option benefits should seek professional tax advice in response to your next two points no one can not transfer a capital gain or other investment income into a tfsa immediately after the fact in order to receive the tax free benefits of the tfsa on that income   only income and gains earned within a tfsa are free from tax i.e. the options would have to have been in the tfsa before being exercised   once a gain or other investment income has been realized in a non sheltered account it is considered taxable   the horse has already left the barn so to speak however despite the above there is another strategy available   one can create an offsetting deduction by contributing some of the realized gain into an rrsp   the rrsp contribution assuming room is available would yield a tax deduction to offset some tax due on the gain   however the rrsp only defers income tax upon withdrawal of funds ordinary income tax is due hopefully at a lower marginal rate in retirement there is no minimum amount of time that money or assets have to be inside a tfsa to benefit from the tax free nature of the account   however there are limits on how much money you can move into a tfsa in any given year and many folks were n't aware of the rules p.s let me add once more that this is a case where i suggest seeking professional tax advice

if you can qualify for two mortgages this is certainly possible   for this you can talk to a banker however most people do not qualify for two mortgages so they go a different route   they make offers on a new home with a contingency to sell the existing home   a good realtor will walk you through this and any possible side effects keep in mind that the more contingencies in an offer the less attractive that offer is to sellers   this is how cash buyers can get a better deal no contingencies and a very fast close   given the of your market a seller might reject your offer as opposed to first time home buyer that does not need to sell an old home   on the other hand they may see your contingency as low risk as the market is so hot    this is why you probably need a really good agent   they can frame the contingency in a very positive light

craig touched on it but let me expand on the point deposits by definition are withheld at your marginal rate and since you can choose roth vs traditional right till filing time you know with certainty the rate you are at each year   absent any other retirement income i.e. no pension and absent an incredibly major change to our tax code i know your starting rate zero the first $ 10 k or so per person is part of their standard deduction and exemption for a couple the next $ 18k is taxed at 10 and so on let me stop here to expand this important point this is $ for the couple and the tax on it is less than $ 1900 5 there is no 5 bracket of course it 's the first $ 20 k with zero tax and that first $ 18,000 taxed at 10 that $ takes nearly $ 1 m in pretax accounts to offer as an annual withdrawal the 15 bracket starts after this and applies to the next $ 57 k of withdrawals each year over $ 95 k in gross withdrawals of pretax money and you still are n't in the 25 bracket   this is why 100 in traditional or 100 in roth are n't either ideal i continue to offer the example i consider more optimizing using roth for income that would otherwise be taxed at 15 but going pretax when you hit 25 then at retirement you withdraw enough traditional to just stay at 10 or 15 and roth for the rest   it would be a shame to retire 100 roth and realize you paid 25 but now have no income to use up those lower brackets   oddly time value of money is n't part of my analysis it makes no difference and note the exact numbers do change a bit each year for inflation there 's a also a good chance the exemptions goes away in favor of a huge increased standard deduction

yes you often can buy stocks directly from the company at little or no transaction cost   many companies have either a dividend reinvestment plan drip or a direct stock plan   with these plans you purchase shares directly from the company although often there is a third party transfer agent that handles the transaction and the stock is issued in your name   this differs from purchasing stock from a broker where the stock normally remains in the name of the broker generally in order to begin participating in a drip you need to already be a registered stockholder   this means that you need to purchase your first share of stock outside of the drip and get it in your name   after that you can register with the drip and purchase additional shares directly from the company   if the company has a you can begin purchasing shares directly without first being a stockholder with the advent of discount brokers drips do not save as much money for regular investors as they once did   however they can still sometimes save money for someone who wants to purchase shares on a regular basis over even a discount broker if you are interested in drips and and want to learn more there is an informative website at that has lots of information on which drips are available and how to get started

from intuit yes but there are limits losses on your investments are first used to offset capital gains of the same type so short term losses are first deducted against short term gains and long term losses are deducted against long term gains net losses of either type can then be deducted against the other kind of gain if you have an overall net capital loss for the year you can deduct up to $ 3,000 of that loss against other kinds of income including your salary for example and interest income any excess net capital loss can be carried over to subsequent years to be deducted against capital gains and against up to $ 3,000 of other kinds of income so in your case take the loss now if you have short term gains   also take it if you want to take a deduction on your salary but this maxes at 3k but you can keep using an additional 3k each year into the future until its all used up there is n't really an advantage to a long term loss right now since long term rates are lower than short term rates

if you were making that large of a payment via a cashiers check or other    withdrawal means from a cash account    to a credit card would the payment    generate a cash transaction report probably yes if it does require the bank to make a ctr then is there any harm in    that or anything to be concerned about    like that transaction appearing    suspicious personal reporting    implications etc are there any    other reasons why one might want to    make sure payments to a credit card    are broken up made in amounts smaller    than $ 10 k you should be concerned if you can not explain the source of the money legally if you withdrew cash from your own account and paid your credit card with it in case of questions asked you can show the account statement with the matching withdrawal and you 're done the point in this report is to point at people who move around large amounts of cash usually people pay credit cards with checks or ach transactions but if you want cash it 's your right as long as the cash was obtained legally but if you 're paying your credit cards off with the cash you got as a bribe or by selling cocaine on the streets then you should be worried by the way breaking into smaller payments may not save you from being reported to the money laundering detection agencies the report is per transaction not per payment so if the credit card statement is $ 11 k and you pay $ 5 k and $ 6 k the transaction is still $ 11k. also the bank can file a report even if it is not required it was clarified in the other answer to the same question you 're referring to if the clerk thinks the transaction is suspicious this leaves the decision on filing a report solely on the banks common sense and internal policies which you do n't know so even paying $ 10 in cash may trigger a report if the bank suspects wrongdoing

the reason people like mint is because it allows you to see all of your financial details in one place when you create an account you ’re able to link all of your bank accounts credit cards and investment accounts this linking enables mint to update your transactions automatically the catch is that you have to provide the username and password you use for each one which can certainly make you feel if you ’re worried about a security breach mint is designed to be a read only service which means you ca n’t transfer money back and forth between accounts if someone were to get their hands on your mint login all they ’d be able to do is view your balances and transactions your full account numbers are n’t displayed nor are your bank account or credit card usernames and passwords the only thing that would be visible would be your email address if a hacker was interested in taking things a step further there ’s always the possibility that they could physically steal the information from mint ’s secure servers but that ’s really a long shot that would require knowing where the servers are located bypassing the physical security measures that are in place and cracking the code on how the data is encrypted if that were to happen then your personal information might be at risk but so far there ’s no record of it being attempted i was very skeptical of mint and how secure it truly was i did my fair share of research try looking at

the best thing to do is not worry about what time is best to buy but put in a conditional order before the market opens if your conditions are met during the trading day your order will go through and you will buy the shares this keeps your emotions out of your trading and will stop you from either chasing the market or buying when you consider the wrong time as you have already done your analysis and made your decision before market open thus you should place your conditional orders and stop losses before market opens as well

as other answers have pointed out professional real estate investors do own residential investment properties however small residential units typically are not owned by professional real estate investors as your experience confirms this has a fairly natural cause the size of the investment opportunity is insufficient to warrant the proper research due diligence to which a large investment firm would have to commit if it wanted to properly assess the potential of a property for a small real estate fund managing say $ 50 mm it would take 100 properties at a $ 500 k valuation in order to fully invest the funds this number grows quickly as we decrease the average valuation to reflect even smaller individual units it is unlikely that you will find large institutional investors buying stocks with market caps of $ 20 mm they simply can not invest a large enough portion of total aum to make the diligence make economic sense   as such institutional real estate money tends to find its way into large multi family units that provide a more convenient purchase size for a fund

from a long term planning point of view is the bump in salary worth not having a 401(k   in this case absolutely at $ 30k year the 4 company match comes to about $ 1,200 per year   to get that you need to save $ 1,200 yourself so your gross pay after retirement contributions is about $    now you have an offer making $ 48,000   if you take the new job you can put $ 2,400 in retirement to get to an equivalent retirement rate and now your gross pay after retirement contributions is $    now if the raise in salary were not as high or you were getting a match that let you exceed the individual contribution max the math might be different but in this case you can effectively save the company match yourself and still be way ahead note that there are many other factors that may also be applicable as to whether to take this job or not do you like the work the company the coworkers the location is there upward mobility are the benefits equivalent but not taking a 67 raise just because you 're losing a 4 401(k match is not a wise decision

legally speaking when you convert that bit coin onto something else the israeli tax authority will look into the value of that something else compare it to the original value of the previous something else you used to buy bit coins usd in your example and charge you capital gain taxes for the difference according to the israeli law you 're supposed to pay taxes when selling converting the bit coin to something else and since you 're not using any formal bank or stock broker which will automatically deduct the taxes you have to pay the taxes yourself by not doing so you 're committing a tax fraud the real question you 're asking is whether they 'll come after you well that depends on the amounts they might pay attention there 's no statute of limitation for tax fraud in israel they may come after you in 50 years from now another thing to keep in mind if you used bit coins to buy something services or products of any kind you probably did n't pay the vat which is another case of tax fraud on your behalf ps i 'm not a lawyer or accountant so get a professional advice but i have been dealing with the tax authority in israel so i 've got a pretty good idea of what the rules are

most countries with income tax including the usa design their withholding system so that in straightforward cases tax is withheld from each month 's paycheck on an annualized basis tax for a month is calculated on the assumption that you will keep earning the same monthly amount for the rest of the year and the withholding is set so that the tax is spread evenly across the year another way of putting that is that in practice you only get the tax brackets allocated proportionately throughout the year so up till the end of august you 'll only have been assigned of the $ bracket and so on so if your income does n't change and your general tax affairs do n't change your paycheck also should n't change if your income is irregular or changes during the year then things can get more complicated as other answers have noted withholdings are calculated according to tables that normally just take into account that specific month 's income there are various possible changes to your tax affairs that might cause the withholdings to change for example there 'd be an impact from any change in your contributions to tax advantaged things like health insurance or retirement health or education savings you might also use form w-4 to change your withholdings yourself note that even with a regular income that does n't change through the year you might find yourself either owing money or being owed a refund when you file your taxes after the end of the year it 's worth making sure that your w-4 accurately records the allowances you are entitled to to minimize or eliminate this adjustment

well it would appear that you had a wash sale that canceled out a loss position   without seeing the entire report i could n't tell you exactly what was happening or how you triggered 1091   but just from the images it appears as though your purchase of stock was layered into multiple tranches perhaps you acquired more of the stock in the period than you sold possibly because of a prior holding    if in the period around the sale of stock 30 days before and 30 days after you also acquire the same stock including by contract or option then it out your loss   if you held your stock for a while then in a period bought more and sold some then any loss would be washed out by the acquisition   of course it is also a wash sale if your purchase of the stock follows your sale rather than it   your disallowed loss goes into the basis of your stock holding so will be meaningful when you do have a true economic sale of that stock from irs pub 550 a wash sale occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss and within 30 days before or after the sale you buy substantially identical stock or securities acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade acquire a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities or acquire substantially identical stock for your individual retirement account ira or roth ira if you sell stock and your spouse or a corporation you control buys substantially identical stock you also have a wash sale looking at your account images we can see a number of positions sold at a loss sale proceeds less than basis but each one is adjusted to a zero loss   i suspect the fuller picture of your account history and portfolio will show a more complicated and longer history with this particular stock   that is likely the source of the wash sale disallowed loss you might be able to confirm that all the added numbers are appearing in your current basis in this stock or were reflected upon your final exit from the stock

adding to 's answer before you calculate your profits you can pay money tax free into a pension fund for the company director that is you then if you pay yourself dividends if you made lots of profit you do n't have to pay it all as dividends you can take some where the taxes are low and then pay more money in later years    what you must not do is just take the money the company may be yours but the money is n't it has to be paid as salary or dividend you can give the company director a loan but that loan has to be repaid especially if a limited company goes bankrupt the creditors would insist that loans from the company are repaid   after a bit more checking here 's the optimal approach perfectly legal expected and ethical   you pay yourself a salary of £ per month that 's the point where you get all the advantages of national insurance without having to pay above that you would have to pay employers ni contributions and 12 employee 's ni contributions so for £ 100 salary the company has to pay £ and you receive £ below £ you pay nothing   you deduct the salary from your revenue then you deduct all the deductible business costs be wise in what you try to deduct then you pay whatever you want into a pension fund well up to i think £ 25,000 per year   the rest is profit the company pays 19 corporation tax on profits then you pay yourself dividends any dividends until your income is £ 11,500 per year are tax free then the next £ 5,000 per year are tax free then any dividends until income + dividends = £ 45,000 per year is taxed at 7.5 it 's illegal to pay so much in dividends that the company ca n't pay its bills   above £ 45,000 you decide if you want your money now and pay more tax or wait and get it tax free every pound of dividend above £ 45,000 a year you pay tax but there is nobody forcing you to take the money you can wait until business is bad or you want a holiday or you retire so at that time you will stay below £ 45,000 per year and pay only 7.5 tax

i 'd say that because you are young even the riskier asset classes are not as risky as you think for example assuming conservatively that you only have 30 years to retirement investing in stocks index might be a good option in short term share prices are volatile and prone to bull and bear cycles but given enough time they have pretty much always outperformed any other asset classes the key is not to be desperate to withdraw when an index is at the bottom some cycles can be 20 years so when you need get nearer retirement you will need to diversify so that you can survive without selling low just make sure to pick an index tracker with low fees and you should be good to go a word of warning is of course past performance is no indication of a future one but if a diversified index tracker goes belly up for 20 + years we are talking global calamity in which case buy a shotgun and some canned food

the sec 30-day yield you 're seeing is a standardized yield calculation set out by the securities exchange commission   it can be useful for comparing bond funds but it does n't guarantee what you 'll actually earn from a fund important the sec 30-day yield represents a bond fund 's returns from the previous 30 days expressed as an annual percentage of the current fund price yes an annual percentage in other words do n't expect return on your money every 30 days   such a return is too good to be true return in today 's low rate environment   per year   more reasonable even then the you see is merely an estimate one based on assumptions of what you might expect to earn if you keep your money in place for the next year   the estimate is based on the assumptions that these are n't reliable assumptions   's price does fluctuate   you are not promised to get your principal back with a bond fund   only an individual bond promises your principal back and only at maturity so earning $ on $ 10,000 invested for a full year while taking on interest rate and other risks might not be worth the trouble of putting your money in a brokerage account you 'll need to transfer the money in and out and there are potential trading fees to take into account   how much to buy sell units an fdic insured high interest savings account makes more sense

a stock price is nothing but the price at which some shares of that stock were sold on an exchange from someone willing to sell those shares at that price or more to someone willing to buy them at that price or less pretty much every question about how stock prices work is answered by the paragraph above which an astonishingly large number of people do n't seem to be aware of so there is no explicit tracking mechanism at all just people buying and selling and if the current going price on two exchanges differ then that is an opportunity for someone to make money by buying on one exchange and selling on the other until the prices are close enough that the fees and overhead make that activity unprofitable this is called arbitrage and a common activity of investment banks or more recently hedge funds and specialized trading firms spun off by said banks due to regulation

is there not some central service that tracks current currency rates that banks can use to get currency data sure   but this does n't matter   all the central service can tell you is how much the rate was historically   but the banks paypal do n't care about the historical value   they want to know the price that they 'll pay when they get around to switching not the last price before the switch   beyond that there is a transaction cost to switching   they have to pay the clearinghouse for managing the transaction    the banks can choose to act as a clearinghouse but that increases their risk   if the bank has a large balance of us dollars but dollars are falling then they end up eating that cost   they 'll only take that risk if they think that they 'll make more money that way   and in the end they may have to go on the currency market anyway   if a european bank runs out of us dollars they have to buy them on the open market   or a us bank might run out of euros   or yen   etc    another problem is that many of the currency transactions are small but the overhead is fixed   if the bank has to pay $ 5 for every currency transaction they wo n't even break even charging 3 on a $ 100 transaction   so they delay the actual transaction so that they can make more than one at a time   but then they have the risk that the currency value might change in the meantime   if they credit you with $ 97 in your account $ 100 minus the 3 fee but the price actually drops from $ 100 to $ 99 they 're out the $ 1    they could do it the other way as well   you ask for a $ 100 transaction   they perform a $ 1000 transaction of which they give you $ 97   now they have $ $ 1000 minus the $ 5 they paid for the transaction plus the $ 3 they charged you for the transaction   if there 's a 1 drop they 're out $ $ in currency loss plus a net $ 2 in fees    this is why banks have money market accounts   so they have someone to manage these problems working twenty four hours a day   but then they have to pay interest on those accounts further eating into their profits   along with paying a staff to monitor the currency markets and things that may affect them

first of all dilip 's answer explains well how the business deductions generally work for most big expenses you depreciate it however in some cases you need to capitalize it which is another accounting method when you capitalize your expense it becomes part of the basis of the product you 're creating since you 're an engineer this might be relevant for you talk to your tax adviser how exactly you deduct depreciate capitalize things and what expense goes which way depends greatly on the laws and jurisdictions even in the us different states have different laws and the irs and state laws do n't have to conform unfortunately for example the limitations on sec 179 deduction in 2010 2011 were 20 times higher on federal level than in the state of california this could have lead to cases where you fully deducted your expense on your federal tax return but need to continue and depreciate it on your state return or vice versa good tax adviser is crucial to avoid or manage these cases

the short answer is yes you probably can take the deduction for a home office because the space is used exclusively and you are working there for the convenience of your employer if you do n't have a desk at your employers office the long answer is that it may not be worth it to take the home office deduction as an employee you 're deduction is subject to a 2 agi floor you can only deduct a percentage of your rent or the depreciation on your home a quick and dirty example if you make $ 75k year rent a 1200 sqft 2 bedroom apartment for $ 1000/month and use one bedroom 120 sqft regularly and exclusively for your employer you can deduct 10 of the $ 12000 $ 1000 12 months assumes your situation did n't change in rent or $ 1200 however because you are an employee you are subject to the 2 agi floor so you can deduct $ salary 2 floor = so in order to deduct the first dollar you need an additional $ 300 worth of deductible expenses   depending on your situation it may or may not be worth it to take the home office deduction even if you qualify for it

this is a simple solution because you do n't have to monitor a person 's trades over time or even their frequency implementing this in the modern computer exchanges seems trivial to me asking an exchange to monitor each trader 's trades to ensure no hfts seems full of loopholes ask a computer to execute hfts across multiple trader ids for example and i think is a distraction suggestion   the reason that i think these taxes do n't get is as correctly states these taxes empower the government which is something that a lot of political players republicans libertarians and anarchists do n't want i have always wondered what would happen if these fees were imposed by the government implemented by the exchanges but all money went to say the american red cross i think that that would be a pretty good idea   finally i also want to mention that the government plays a large role in markets already for example enforcing contracts managing and preventing fraud are all things that the government does to ensure that markets work well this is another simple thing the the government can do to reduce market uncertainty and make our financial markets work better

my suggestion would be to do the math that is the best advice you can get when considering any investment   there are other factors you have n't considered too like the fact that interest rates are at extremely low levels right now so borrowing money is relatively cheap if you 're outside the us though that may be less of a consideration as the mortgage lending institutions in europe only tend to give 5-year locks on loan rates without requiring a premium you may be somewhere else in the world   you will probably struggle to do the actual math about the probability of the market going down or up but what you can do is this   figure out what it would cost you to cash out the investments you say your balance is $ 53,000 in various items congrats that 's a nice chunk of money but with commissions and taxes and etc it may reduce the value of your investments by 10 25 when you try to cash out those investments paying $ 3,000 to get that money out of the investments is one thing but if you 're sending $ 10,000 to the tax man when you sell this all off that changes the economics of your investments a lot in that case you might be better off seeing what happens if the markets correct by 10 you 'd still have more than if you sold out and paid major taxes once you know your down payment calculate the amount of property you could afford you know your down payment could be somewhere around $ 50,000 after taxes and other items at an loan to value ratio that 's about $ 250,000 of a property that you can qualify for assuming you could obtain the loan for $ 200,000   what could you buy for that do some shopping and figure out what your options are   once you have two or three potential properties figure out the answer to what would the property give you is it going to be rented out are you going to live there both   if you 're living in it then you come out ahead if the costs for the mortgage debt and the ongoing maintenance and repairs are less than what you currently pay in rent figure out what you pay right now to put a roof over your head will the place you could buy need repairs will you pay more on a mortgage for $ 200,000 usd in your local currency than what you currently do for housing do n't even factor in the possible appreciation of a house you when you 're making this kind of investment decision it could just as easily burn down as go up in value   if you would rent it what kind of rental would that be long term rental expect to pay for other people to break your stuff short term rental you can collect more money per tenant per day but you 'll end up with higher vacancy rates and people still break your stuff but do the math and see if you could collect enough in rent from a tenant person or business or whatever the properties are you could buy to cover the amount you are paying in debt plus what you would pay in taxes rent is income plus what you would need for maintenance plus insurance   if the numbers make sense then real estate can be a lucrative investment i own some investment properties myself it is a great hedge against inflation you can raise rents when contracts lapse usually and it is an excellent way to own a tangible item but if you do n't know the numbers and exactly how it would make you better off than sitting and hoping that the markets go up because they generally do over time then do n't take the jump

the irs has a faq page about hardship distributions from a 401(k the irs defines a hardship in this case as an immediate and heavy financial need of the employee and the amount must be necessary to satisfy the financial need   included in the list of examples is certain expenses for the repair of damage to the employee 's principal residence   however whether your former employer allows this particular reason is up to their plan documents   it sounds like from what you described on the website that your plan does include this reason as a possibility for you next you need to decide if the projects you have in mind qualify as repair of damage   this uses the same rules as the deductible casualty rules found in irs publication which defines a casualty this way a casualty is the damage destruction or loss of property resulting from an identifiable event that is sudden unexpected or unusual a sudden event is one that is swift not gradual or progressive an unexpected event is one that is ordinarily unanticipated and unintended an unusual event is one that is not a day to day occurrence and that is not typical of the activity in which you were engaged examples are given in pub   if the projects you have in mind are necessary due to an event like a flood or a fire it might be allowed   but most home improvement projects would not qualify for this if you 'd like a way to simplify your financial profile an option for you since you no longer work at this employer is to roll over this 401(k into a rollover traditional ira   this way you wo n't have to deal with your former employer anymore   you could pick an ira custodian that you already have another account with if you like and reduce the number of statements that you get   but the ira will not let you take money out without penalty for home improvement projects either

the whole point of buying puts is cheaper cost and lower downside risk if you short the box you are assuming he already holds gold holdings to short against it 's not the same as short selling where you borrow shares   either way you are far more vulnerable to downside risk if you are short the stock whether you borrowed or shorted already owned shares if gold suddenly has a 20 pop over the next year which could be possible given the volatility and uncertainty in the marketplace you have big trouble whereas if you buy puts you only lose your costs for the contracts the amount that you miss by in your bet is n't going to factor into anything

it reminds me of the efficient market hypothesis except that just states in its weakest form that the current market price accounts for all information embedded in previous market prices in other words people buying today at 42 know it was selling for 40 yesterday and the patterns and such to say that stock is memoryless strikes me as not quite right to the extent that stocks are valued based on earnings much of what we infer about future earnings relies on past and present earnings one obvious counterexample to this memoryless claim is bankruptcy if a stock files bankruptcy and there is n't enough money to pay senior debt your shares are worth 0 in perpetuity

i have had my card blocked at home only rarely one occasion comes to mind i had bought something fairly large online late at night no sooner had i clicked purchase than my phone the bank was asking had i actually just spent $ amount at $ online store i said yes and that was that a little later i made another purchase late at night on a different card it went through but when i tried to use the card the next day for something small in a store it was declined embarrassed i used a different card then called the bank they said they had put the card on hold because of the online purchase for a large amount even though they had let the purchase go through they had n't called me because it was late at night and they had n't given themselves any reasonable mechanisms to compensate for that like calling me the next morning emailing me or the like they 'd just blocked the card we had what you might call a frank and open exchange of views on the matter   not all banks use the same strategies or software i suggest far and away the simplest thing is just to have more than one card so that these declines are a momentary hiccup you might forget by the time you and your rolex are out of the store

to be honest i think a lot of people on this site are doing you a disservice by taking your idea as seriously as they are not only is this a horrible idea but i think you have some alarming misunderstandings about what it means to save for retirement first off precious metals are not an investment they are store of value the old saying that a gold coin would buy a suit 300 years ago and will still buy a suit today is pretty accurate buying precious metals and expecting them to appreciate in the future because they are undervalued is just flat out speculation and really does n't belong in a well planned retirement account unless it 's a very small part for the purposes of diversification so the upshot to all of this is the most likely outcome is you get zero return after inflation maybe you 'll get lucky or maybe you 'll be very unlucky next you would say that sure you 're giving up some expected return for a reduction in risk but you 've done away with diversification which is the most effective way to minimize risk and i 'm not sure what scenario you 're imagining that the stock market or any other reasonable investment does n't make any returns if you invest in a market wide index fund then the expected return is going to be roughly in proportion with productivity gains to say that there will be no appreciation of the stock market over the next 40 years is to say that technological progress will stop and/or we will have large scale economic disruptions that will wipe out 40 years of progress if that happens i would say it 's highly questionable whether silver will actually be worth anything at all i 'd rather have food property and firearms so to answer your question practically any other retirement savings plan would be better than the one that you currently outlined but the best plan is just to put your money in a very low cost index fund at vanguard and let it sit until you retire the expense ratios are so stupidly small that it 's not going to meaningfully affect your return

i think in such situations a good rule of thumb may be if you are asked to pay significant sums of money upfront before anything is done stop and ask yourself what would you do if they do n't do what they promised they know who you are but usually most you know is a company name and phone number both can disappear in a minute and what are you left with   if they said they 'd pay off the debt and issue the new loan fine let them do it and then you pay them if they insist on having money upfront without delivering anything unless it 's a very big and known and established company you probably better off not doing it either it 's a scam or in the minuscule chance they are legit you still risking too much you 're giving money and not getting anything in return

best as i can tell the simple answer is the smartest approach to investing for dividends is to pick a company that is has and will continue to make a solid profits there are lots of them out there specifically companies with no debt a history of long term and steady growth and a stable market share will almost always recoup any drop in stock valuation due to a dividend payout and usually in short order this is why dividends were created as a mechanism for distributing profits back to investor without diminishing thier stake in the company the trick then is to find such companies with the best ratio between stock price and dividend payout and again there are a lot of good options out there   all the is justified however as many unscrupulous companies will try to pull investors in with high dividends as a means to simply generate capital these companies have few of the quality attributes mentioned above instead high debt fluctuating or negative profits minimal market share or diminishing growth present a very risky long term play and will be avoided by this conservative investor

i think this is a good question with no single right answer   for a conservative investor possible responses to low rates would be probably the best response is somewhere in the middle consider riskier investments for a part of your portfolio but still hold on to some cash and in any case do not expect great results in a bad economy for a more detailed analysis let 's consider the three main asset classes of cash bonds and stocks and how they might preform in a low interest rate environment by stocks i really mean mutual funds that invest in a diversified mixture of stocks rather than individual stocks which would be even riskier   you can use mutual funds for bonds too although diversification is not important for government bonds cash advantages safe in the short term   available on short notice for emergencies disadvantages low returns and possibly inflation although you retain the flexibility to move to other investments if inflation increases bonds advantages somewhat higher returns than cash   disadvantages returns are still rather low and more vulnerable to inflation   also the market price will drop temporarily if rates rise stocks advantages better at preserving your purchasing power against inflation in the long term 20 years or more say   returns are likely to be higher than stocks or bonds on average   disadvantages   price can fluctuate a lot in the short to medium term   also expected returns are still less than they would be in better economic times although the low rates may change the question a little the most important thing for an investor is still to be familiar with these basic asset classes   note that the best risk adjusted reward might be attained by some mixture of the three

the entire time you 've talked about cost changing incomes matters little if the cost scales with it me thinks you do n't understand how a market works even a semi planned one if more people make more money the price of most goods goes up this is n't due to real actual demand its due to something called inflation when the amount of money in circulation increases we have inflation lets say i make 35k a year as a store clerk is my labor being undervalued compared to the income of a store clerk in the past or is the price of goods scaling faster than my income has scaled   simply adding more money does n't fix anything the price of the good or service is what matters the most while everyone having more money is good you ca n't just magically give everyone more money without the cost of goods and services rising i imagine that if everyone suddenly were at least a millionaire the price of a laptop would sky rocket the cost of the laptop in parts would n't be that much more but since most people would have disposable income beyond their needs some goods would then get more expensive once that happens the inflation of prices starts to spread until its effects are seen across the market   i do n't think the fruit of my labor is being stolen by the upper class if anything the fruit of my labor gets taken more and more by my own government and transferred to the lower classes more and more i 'm not rich not even close but i know i 've had at least 15k of my income in the last 5 years taken and distributed through taxes on my income to people that are generally unable to earn enough on their own   if these people are the upper class then i must be

does it ever make sense yes but almost never   if you 're in a situation where you 're invested in something with low rates think government securities or cash equivalents then you do need to think about rate spread as you mention does the savings over the life over the mortgage beat out the 35 hit now plus all the interest you would earn over those 20 years have you factored in other considerations such as mortgage interest deduction on taxes do n't forget you need to think about how rates will change down the line they ca n't go much lower so potentially you 'll get better rates in the 401(k down the line do n't forget there 's also the impact of inflation again the rates on your savings may go up but your mortgage is a fixed payment so with even a low rate of inflation your payments effectively become less over time if your investments are in something like stocks and bonds then i would say undoubtedly you would want to keep the money in the 401(k time in market and compounding are your best friends over a long time horizon also as mentioned by @johnfx the hit of your 35 now is something you will absolutely feel now hopefully not but your life situation could change where you have an emergency and need to drain your savings or you may not see the end of that 20 years

if you define dollar cost cost averaging as investing a specific dollar amount over a certain fixed time frame then it does not work statistically better than any other strategy for getting that money in the market   ie aunt wants to invest $ 60,000 in the stock market and does it $ 5000 a month for a year it will work better on some markets and worse on others but on average it wo n't be any better dollar cost averaging of this form is effectively a bet that gains will occur at the end of the time period rather than the beginning sometimes this bet will pay off other times it wo n't a regular investment contribution of what you can afford over an indefinite time period ie 401k contribution is not dollar cost averaging but it is an effective investment strategy

look for states that have no income tax a lot of these states supplement their revenue with higher property taxes but if you rent and do not own property in the state then you will have no state tax liability similarly many states treat capital gains no differently than income tax so if you make your earnings due to a large nest egg then way you will still incur no tax liability on the state level look for unincorporated areas as these are administrative divisions of states that do not have a municipal government and as such do not collect local taxes look for economic development perks of the new jurisdiction many states have some kind of formal tax credit for people that start business or buy in certain areas but money talks and you can make an individual arrangement with any agency municipality etc if the secretary at city hall does n't know about a prepackaged formal arrangement that is offered to citizens then ask for the development package which generally has a processing fee involved this is something you make up ie what is the processing fee for the development package quote on quote states like maryland and nevada have formalized this process but you are generally paying off the secretary of state for favorable treatment you 'll always be paying off someone

does the full time phd student extend to 70 80 hours week or more if not can you pick up an extra job to aid with living expenses also whose name is the debt in is your wife paying to avoid the black mark on her credit record or her mother 's basically what it looks like to me is that you guys currently have a car you can not afford and that her mother does n't seem to be able to afford either at a ridiculous interest rate on top refinancing might be an option but at a payoff amount of 12k you 're upside down even when it comes to the kbb retail value i 'm somewhat allergic to financing a asset especially at a quick back of the envelope calculation suggests that she 's already paid them around $ 18k if you are indeed three years into the loan what i would be tempted to do in your situation is to attempt to negotiate a lower payoff to see if they 're willing to settle for less and give you clean title to the car worst thing they can say is no but you might be able to get the car for a little less than the $ 12k then preferably use your emergency money to pay off the car and put it up for sale use some of the money to buy her a cheaper car for say $ or less if you 're mechanically inclined and put the rest back into your emergency fund the problem i see with refinancing it would be that it looks like you 're underwater from a balance vs retail value perspective so you might have a problem finding someone to refinance it with you throwing some of your emergency money at it in the first place

beta is the correct answer   it is the measure of the risk relationship of a stock with the broad market r squared is incorrect unless you mean something very odd by co efficiency   a stock that goes up each time the market goes down has very low co efficiency negative risk as you have defined it but very high r squared   a stock that goes the same direction as the market but twice as far with a lot of noise has a very low r squared but contains a lot of market risk   a stock that always goes in the same direction as the market but only a as far is very safe but has a very high r squared you can calculate beta using slope in excel or doing a regression but the easiest thing is just to look up the beta in yahoo finance or elsewhere   you do n't need to calculate it for yourself normally

dollars more on average across 12 million employees bro that adds up   that 's about 5 dollars an hour more   not much but the upward mobility in government jobs is severely lacking so i 'm not sure if that $ 5.00 an hour makes up for their inability to get raises   i do hope you have proof for that number however   i call monopolized or monopolized corporations and high end ceos rent seekers because they seek to make far more than they need to even thrive   the government does n't make far more than it needs to thrive   it does however funds and delivers them to corporations that lobby them   corporations are beholden to only their shareholders   if i were to let corporations run the roads you can be sure that only the most profitable areas would have roads and most roads would have tolls   those without the means or without big corporations nearby would have to do with trails   the gateway to success that big government is supposedly closing down with subsidies would actually be closed down because private industry would control your methods of transportation communication education and survival itself   to reduce competition they would keep you low and suck off your funds   they would call it fair because you chose to live where you do and not work hard enough neglecting their own part in establishing the high wall that you can not get over   what do you think would happen if big government was sent away and our basic necessities were privatized     do you have illusions of free market dancing in your dreams   where companies compete rather than collude     do you imagine roads to the far reaches of the nation being kept up or just the roads important for goods and people with money   i want to know what you imagine the endgame will look like

careful this could be a scam   but if not there is no feasible way to turn that into cash without a very good reason that will require your banker to know you as a depositor reasonably well   and it sounds like you are n't banked at all if this is your money please pay attention class in america is defined by financial knowledge   if you are unbanked and lower class $ 2 m is actually dangerous read a book called money for nothing about what happens to lottery winners   honestly the tendency is for lower class people to be possessed to keep making lower class financial decisions which directly lead them to be broke and bankrupt in months regardless of the size of the windfall so making decisions differently is literally rehab no exaggeration   to change your thinking you 'll want to read suze orman john bogle and napoleon hill   for an american who thinks about money the way the upper middle class does $ 2 m in the bank means the end of the 9 5 grind he will still need to work but will be able to be much more selective about choosing jobs which are fulfilling   it brings him the utopia we were promised    if you are currently unbanked you will simply need to get banked to handle a check of this size    handling this much cash is literally impossible due to the rico laws designed to stop drug dealing and money laundering   even if you split it into many small amounts that itself is structuring which is a felony all its own   so let 's get banked    a $ 2 m check is a terrible into the banking world because it makes you smell like a criminal or scammer at first introduction   i could deposit one no problem because i have 10 years of history with my bank   but you you 'll need to convince the bank you 're the real deal and give them reason to trust you be prepared to that trust to include depositing some money at the least the bank will want to know you 're good for the bad check fees they suspect will follow go to a local bank or savings and loan that you trust the smaller the better and sit down with a banker   describe your situation honestly and have him open an account and deposit the check   if your burned your ability to open checking accounts with a chexsystems mark you 'll need to be more selective about banks and be honest about that to the banker   and wait a month for that check to clear positively believe me your banker will be watching that    at that point if you want great of the money out quickly it 'll need to be in the form of a cheque or bank check   cash ai n't gon na happen nor should it   the reason is again the rico laws    of course if you are a criminal or scam victim none of the above applies sorry

this is always a judgement call based on your own tolerance for risk   yes you have a fairly long time horizon and that does mean you can accept more risk more volatility than someone closer to starting to draw upon those savings but you 're old enough and have enough existing savings that you want to start thinking about reducing the risk a notch so most folks in your position would not put 100 in stocks though exactly how much should be moved to bonds is debatable one traditional rule of thumb for a moderately conservative position is to subtract your age from 100 and keep that percentage of your investments in stock for stock bond age will find lots of debate about whether and how to modify this rule i have gone more aggressive myself and have n't demonstrably hurt myself but past results are no guarantee of future performance a paid financial planning advisor can interview you about your risk tolerance run some computer models and recommend a strategy with some estimate of expected performance and volatility if you are looking for a semi rational approach that may be worth considering at least as a starting point

to answer the investment aspect takes a bit of math first solar numbers   this represents the average sun hours per day for a given area you can see the range from 4 to 6 or hrs to about hrs of sun per year depending on location i believe electricity also has a range of cost but 15 cents per kwh is a good average   so a panel will produce as much as $ per year of electricity in a high sun hrs area but only $ in a lower sun hrs area   if we agree to ignore the government subsidies and look for the stable price unaffected by outside influence an installed price of even $ 2500 would produce a return of 13 and a reasonable full payback over an 8 year period   i call this installed price a tipping point the price where this purchase provides a decent return some would accept a lower return and therefore a higher price as duff points out this should be treated as the post rebate tax credit price those help to push the price below this point at the price point where the energy cost per panel is below the government intervention may be unnecessary the power companies may find consumer owned panels are the cheapest way to clip the peak consumption which tends to be the most expensive power demand one can take the numbers and cost of local power to produce a grid showing the return for a panel in $ $ at this point the cost of money kick in the present value of $ is far higher today than if short term rates were say 8   once panels drop to where they are compelling for the higher return areas i 'd expect volume to drive continued improvements in cost and better economies of scale initially the need for storage is n't there as the infrastructure is in place to drive your meter backwards if you produce more than you use the peek sun coincides with peek demand and the electric companies are happy to have your demand go negative during those times   update the conversation with duff led me to research demand charge a bit more you see the utility company has to have equipment to generate the peak demand usually occurring in the early afternoon say as the sun is brightest and ac use in particular highest i found that austin energy has a pdf describing the fee for this simply put the last kw of demand will cost you $ in summer months and $ in winter this adds to $ that a panel might save the owner even if one does capture the full power at peak every month $ 100 is still non trivial this factor alone justifies $ 1000 worth of panel cost and as duff points out the government may find it cheaper to use this method to clip peak demand than by funding bigger power generators   to summarize the question is n't so much are they worth it as what is a panel worth a function of annual savings and time value of money the ever decreasing installed cost for a given system makes solar an inevitable part of the future power technology i am not a green tree hugging guy but i do like to breathe fresh air as much as anyone i 'm happy with whatever role solar plays in cutting down pollution

is a student loan a type of loan or just a generic name used to refer to a loan for someone who is going back to school a student loan from the federal government is a specific type of loan used for education purposes i.e. attending college they have guidelines associated with them that are very flexible as compared to a student loan from a private bank   if a student loan is a different type of loan does it only cover the costs of going to the school every student at a university has a budget or the cost of attendance that includes direct and indirect costs direct costs are ones billed directly to you i.e. tuition room and board should you choose to live on campus and associated fees indirect costs are such things like books travel expenses if you live out of state and personal things direct costs are controlled by the school indirect costs are estimated the school will usually conduct market research to determine the costs for indirect items some students go above that and some go below for example transportation is an indirect cost a school could set that at $ 500 there are students who will be above that and some below that if you choose not to live on campus then rent and food will become an indirect cost student loans can cover up to 100 of your budget direct and indirect added together if your total budget is $ 60,000 tuition room and board transportation books supplies etc then you are able to borrow up to that amount $ 60,000 however because your budget is both direct and indirect costs you will only be billed for your direct costs tuition etc so if your direct costs equal $ 50,000 and your student loan was certified for $ 60,000 then you will get that $ 10,000 back in the form of a refund from the school that does not mean you do n't have to pay it back you still do but that money is meant for indirect costs i.e. books rent if you 're not staying on campus etc if your school is on semesters vs quarters then that amount is divided between the terms summer term is not factored in that 's another process also with student loans there are origination costs the money associated with processing a loan   a good rule of thumb is to never borrow more than you need   source i used to work in financial aid at my college

mrchrister makes some good points but i saw his invitation to offer a counter opinion first there is a normal annual deposit limit of $ 13,000 per parent or donee this is the gift limit due to rise to $ 14,000 in 2013   if your goal is strictly to fund college and this limit is n't an issue for you the one account may be fine unless both kids are in school at the same time in that case you 're going to need to change beneficiaries every year to assign withdrawals properly   but as you mention there 's gift money that your considering depositing to the account in this case there 's really a legal issue the normal 529 allows changes in beneficiary and gifts to your child need to be held for that child in an irrevocable arrangement such as a utma account there is a 529 flavor that provides for no change of beneficiary a utma 529 clearly in that case you need separate accounts   in conclusion i think the single account creates more issues than it potentially solves if the true gift money from others is minimal maybe you should just keep it in a regular account edit on further reflection i strongly suggest you keep the relatives gifts in a separate account and when the kids are old enough to have legitimate earned income use this money to open and deposit to roth iras they can deposit the lesser of their earned income or $ 5000 in 2012 $ 5500 in 2013   this serves two goals avoiding the risk of gift money being stolen from one child for benefit of the other and putting it into an account that can help your children long term but not impact college aid as would a simple savings or brokerage account

the risk besides the extra interest is that you might be upside down on the loan because the car loses value the moment you drive off the lot the slower you pay it off the longer it takes to get the loan balance below the resale value of course if you have a significant down payment the risk of being upside down is not as great even buying a used car does n't help because if you try to sell it back to the dealer the next week they wo nt give you the full price you paid some people try and split the difference get the longer term loan but then pay it off as quickly as the shorter term loan yes the interest rate is higher but if you need to drop the payment back to the required level you can do so

the best approach depends on how much of an emergency fund you have if you have no emergency fund calculate how much you need in order to pay your expenses for 1 month and put at least that amount in a savings account   3 6 months worth of expenses is better   put the remainder towards one credit card if you have less than 3 months worth of expenses in your emergency fund deposit 1 additional month 's worth of expenses into your savings account and apply the rest to one card if you have an emergency fund that you 're completely comfortable with pay $ 8000 towards one card and $ 2000 towards the other one   paying off one card fully gets rid of a bill that you have to think about each month even if the two cards are otherwise identical

what is a good resource to learn about options trading strategies options are a quite advanced investment form and you 'd do well to learn a lot about them before attempting to dive into this fairly illiquid market yale 's online course in financial markets covers the options market and is a good starting point to make sure you 've got all the basics you may be familiar with most of it but it 's a decent on lingo and black scholes how can i use options to establish some cash flow from long standing investments while minimizing capital gains expenses this question seems designed to get people to talk about covered calls essentially you sell call contracts you let people buy things you already have at a price in the future at their whim they pay you for this option though usually not much if the options are n't in the money you can think of this as trading any return above the call option for a bit of extra cash   i do n't invest with taxable accounts but there are significant tax consequences for options because they expire there will be turnover in your portfolio and up front income when you take the sell side so if you trade in options with close expiration dates you 'll probably end up with a lot of short term capital gains which are treated as normal income one strategy is to trade in broad based stock index options which have favorable tax treatments some people have abused this though to disguise normal income as capital gains so it could go away obviously the easy approach is to just use a tax advantaged account for options trading an etf might also be able to handle the turnover on your behalf for example vix is a series of options on s&p500 options a second strategy i 've heard of is buying calls and puts at a given strike price for example if you bought dec 13 calls and puts on spx 115 today it would cost you about $ 35 dollars if the price moves more than 35 dollars away from 115 by dec 13 in either direction you 've made a profit if you reflect on that for a bit you 'll see why vix is considered a volatility index i guess i should mention that shorting a stock and buying a put option at the market price are very similar with the exception that your loss is limited to the price of the option   is there ever an instance where options investing is not speculative the term speculative is not well defined for many people the answer is no it 's very easy to just buy put options and wait for prices to fall or call options and wait for prices to rise moreover the second strategy above essentially gives you similar performance to a stock without paying full price these all fall under the headline of increasing a risk portfolio rather than decreasing it which i figure is a decent definition of speculation on the other hand there are ways to use options minimize risk rather than increase it you can buy underwater options as portfolio insurance if your portfolio drops below a certain amount you still have the right to sell it at a higher one and the case schiller index is run in part on the hopes that one day there might be a thriving market for real estate options or futures when you buy a home or lend money to someone to buy one you could buy regional case schiller options to protect you if the regional market tanks but in all of these cases it 's required for someone else to take the opposite trade risk is n't reduced it 's traded around so technically there is a speculative element to these as well i think the proper question here is whether speculation is present but whether speculation can be put to good ends without speculators the already very thin market for options would faster

gt;the scales on the chart are not consistent even in regards to stats the author purports to be comparable   scales and especially missing zero points are one of the easiest ways to manipulate the perception of viewers of charts amp graphs   especially when we are dealing with exponential things even the choice of linear vs logarithmic can generate entirely different reactions to the same data   add in cherry picking and of data and such things are rife with the possibility of being misleading often in ways that the creators of the charts themselves are entirely unaware of

you 're forgetting the fundamental issue that you never have to actually exercise the options you buy   you can either sell them to someone else or if they 're out of the money let them expire and take the loss it is n't uncommon at all for people to buy both a put and call option this is a straddle when the strike price of both the put and call are the same from investopedia.com a straddle is an options strategy in which the investor holds a position in both a call and put with the same strike price and expiration date paying both premiums this strategy allows the investor to make a profit regardless of whether the price of the security goes up or down assuming the stock price changes somewhat significantly    read more straddle

and please tell me what is my agenda by alluding banks are ponzi schemes i never made that claim   i just saw a similarity i was asking if the similar idea of taking money from investors and returning it just like a ponzi scheme but the similarity ends there apparently in the background one is using future investors as payouts the other uses fractional reserve banking to reinvest   to me it seems like the latter just seems smart but idk   that was my agenda finding out if my latter idea was possible and/or why its not a ponzi e and how does it differ   i think i got the answer w the accounting equation but getting to that point was like trial by fire apparently

think of it this way a billionaire may have a net worth of $ 1b with an income of $ 300 million per year in the most likely scenario s)he is spending at most $ 50 a million a year    now they have the same income as 6,000 separate people making $ 50 thousand a year   but those people are going to spend maybe 90 of their income   in other words the 6,000 average people are putting an additional $ 220 million more than 4 x the billionaire back into the economy to generate activity and growth

how and why is this considered fair and/or legal let 's use an analogy   the issue is not fairness it is just the rules the assets you own and the cash you receive are reported differently if the rules do n't make sense i suggest you hire an adviser that can teach you and help you get the most out of your investments

considering land mass natural resources population tech and a thriving free market this country could be heaven it 's just good if not for corruption in washington that legalized a bribing system that allows politicians to be owned by corporations that through lobbying write themselves laws that favor them instead of the majority of the people this country would be in a much much better place    since most laws have to benefit the richest people first and those are the of people it reflects on society you have the walton family worth hundreds of billions of dollars through a company that makes of billions of dollars but refuse to pay their employees decent wages on top of that many billionaires get tremendous tax cuts or do n't pay at all the burden is all on the middle class people are angry    and do n't give me that redneck leave the country argument i am discussing a topic posted on a public forum it 's what i think and i am sure a lot of americans agree with me are you going to tell them to leave as well i have a house in three continents you ca n't tell me shit

overpriced shares cheaper to raise new capital through secondary share offerings or debt using shares as a security off hostile take overs since the company is too dear when a company is taken over it needs only one set of management top management of the company that is taken over loses their jobs no one wants to lose their job shareholders love to see share price grow sale brings them profit secures jobs for company management shares are used as a currency during acquisitions if company shares are overpriced that means they can buy another company on the cheap paying with the overpriced shares undervalued shares more expensive to raise additional capital through secondary share offerings for the same amount of capital the management has to offer a bigger chunk of the company have to offer bigger chunk of a company as a security as well makes company vulnerable to hostile take overs company is makes it an attractive bargain once the company is taken over top management will almost certainly lose jobs falling price makes shareholders unhappy they will vote management out makes difficult to acquire other companies

i agree i made my example very simplistic and other more sophisticated methods can be employed   i was just trying to create simple illustration that these laws can be and are abused   i do n't believe bk laws were originally intended the spirit of the law for these mechanisms   while not illegal i do think it 's unethical

gt;the other piece of course is that this person consistently gets raises that meet or beat inflation    that 's exactly the idea i am disputing it 's the reason the deficit is such a huge problem   having a budget deficit at of gdp would make sense if you 're expecting your economy to continue growing at a high rate that 's the keynesian argument the idea that your debt can keep growing because your total economic productivity is going to continue growing every year   however it 's not something that i expect to see happening why is that    if we look at us annual gdp growth we find that the trend is in the annual gdp growth was at 4.5 percent in the 21st century annual gdp growth is stuck at around 1.5 percent on a yearly basis this is a global issue   part of the issue is that population growth rates are going down us fertility rate is stuck at a record low per woman    more importantly however is that the typical american has seen no increase in his household income in over more than a decade for the typical american the peak was in 1999 the economy has gone downhill since hart nation if the typical american sees his income decline it 's a very bad idea to increase government spending at the same time   why this large divide between the elite 1 whose income is growing and the rest of the public part of the issue is that the typical american spends a far larger portion of his income on resources that are limited energy food these are products that have grown very expensive and are eating up a larger chunk of a typical american 's budget   the high wealth and income of the 1 is effectively an unsustainable illusion created by quantitative easing and other bubble blowing policies these people own stock that have surged up despite a weak economy they own expensive houses the prices of which can be artificially pushed into the   this wealth of our elite is all hypothetical wealth that evaporates when you try to tax it if you look at us gdp to base your budget policies on the impression of sustained economic growth is deceiving you you end up spending far more than you will ever manage to pay back

i considered the prepaid legal but instead tried the legalzoom business legal plan and found it to be very good it does n't have any membership or new account fees you pay each month for the month and if you prepay for half a year or a year they throw in a nice discount 15 so far i 'm subscribed for less than a month and had 2 attorney consultations and a document review although they did n't tell me anything i did n't know already seems to be very cost effective considering most people do n't have sufficient legal knowledge or the ability to research it is as @duffbeer703 mentioned not an insurance and if a legal matter arises that requires representation their plan has almost no coverage only discounts as opposed to prepaid legal plan that on the paper does have some representation but to have 2 3 attorney consultations for $ 30 is definitely a bargain

the short answer is that it 's never the right time to buy an emerging technology as long as the technology is emerging you should expect that newer revisions will be both better and less expensive with solar specifically there are some tax credits to help the early adopters that may help you on the cost benefit analysis but in the end you still have to decide whether the benefits outweigh the costs now and if not whether that will change in the near future for me part of the solar benefit is the ability to generate electricity when the power goes out that option does require local battery storage however one of the benefits of using musk 's solar tiles instead of actual slate is the weight of the quartz tiles which is much lower than the weight of real slate in many cases a slate roof is heavy enough to require major reinforcement of the roof before installation the lower weight also saves significantly on shipping costs this is where musk can lower costs enough to be competitive to some of the materials he hope to compete with

you mean gary johnson he was not a libertarian he was a republican   he also left new mexico dependent on the federal government they are just now fixing must reduce = all   libertarians advocate for privatizing all basic infrastructure and eliminating all forms of social welfare   what gary johnson did was cut spending on those at a state level knowing the federal government would pick up the slack like they did in the southern states   new mexico went from being tax positive with the federal budget to massively depending upon it         the point is they will be because you are the fringe of the fringe and mean nothing to the political process   your opinions are a drop of ink in an ocean   change them and contribute among the vast vast majority of americans who believe in a nation state or knowingly continue spouting your ideology which will amount to nothing

what you are referring to is called an externality in economics efforts are often made by governments to internalize costs to groups and individuals that do n't experience consequences of their actions    but from another perspective forces such as scientific advancement bring new methods of eliminating such consequences much like the wall e concept per the movie of the same name technology reorganizing or converting what was previously waste    this is another aspect of the free market but it has what some economists call or delay from problem to solution as scientific advances are often done via fiscal motives urged on by the marketplace and public demand
