bitcoin prices are likely rising as a result of the simple issue of supply and demand   supply is constrained as there are n't much in the way of new bitcoins coming into existence and demand is high right now as a result of various events for example this reuters article goes into some detail as to some current influences   mostly crypto hedge funds are buying a lot of bitcoins as a speculative move i.e. believing the price will continue to rise    the evidence suggests that few of the users are buying bitcoin to use it as a means of exchange but are speculating to increase their capital many describe the bubble as similar to the tulip craze in century from the same reuters article it ’s got all the of your tulip bubble chart but that tells you nothing about where that price line could go depending on the number of people who wish to own it standard life ’s head of investment strategy andrew said on wednesday who is to say it does n’t reach $ 100,000 you can see in the volume chart from that the trading volume for bitcoins has really increased and if you look at the market price you see a very similar movement however if you look at the number of transactions per day that number is basically constant meaning the actual uses of bitcoins by people just buying or selling goods or services is n't really changing much but the dollar amount is   that 's indicative of a speculation caused bubble below is a graph i made from the data from above that price with trading volume you can see clearly the increase in volume and increase in price are nearly simultaneous   bitcoin itself has some actual utility mostly for black market sellers and similar people participating in activities that are less than legal not ethically bad for example people in nations with oppressive regimes that limit contact with the outside world or try to restrict foreign currency purchases   it 's unlikely that the degree of adoption so far however has driven it to this level and the fact that bitcoin can be broken up into very small chunks means that the big boom in price of individual bitcoins causes the demand side pressure from the actual use of bitcoins to be as there is now 1/10th the demand for bitcoins from people who use them for non speculative reasons

somehow i just stumbled onto this thread   gt you essentially robbed the person holding the debt since you promised to pay it off    depends on leverage with fractional reserve lending   banks are permitted to loan out 30x their actual assets or more   if i have $ 1 but can loan out $ 30 and anything more than $ 1 gets paid back i have n't lost any money   in addition i can write off the amount defaulted and the government will pay me back for certain types of loans   with student loans since they are almost impossible to discharge gov't will pursue the borrower for years and decades and ultimately collect more interest   here is an article on it     gt according to the government stands to earn $ more in interest from a $ 10,000 loan that defaulted than if it had been paid in full over a 20-year term and $ more than if it had been paid back in 10 years alan founder of borrowers rights advocacy student loan justice said the high recovery rates provide a perverted incentive for the government to allow loans to go into default estimates the recovery rate would need to fall to below 50 in order for default prevention efforts to become more lucrative than defaults themselves    not to mention     gt so essentially the department is given a choice   either do nothing and get nothing or outlay cash with the knowledge that this outlay will realize a 22 percent return ultimately minus the governments cost of money and collection costs   from this perspective it is clear that based solely on financial motivations and without specific detailed knowledge of the loan i.e. borrower characteristics etc the would clearly favor the default scenario   for not only the   return but perhaps the potential savings in subsidy payment as well      and do n't forget the penalties accruing to the person defaulting they will probably have to move out of the country in order to escape collection   and let 's factor in the huge roi the lender sees by creating an indentured servant class   plus the gov't will issue as much currency as it wants to make itself whole   and how much of a loss is the loss when the whole of the loan amount went right back into the local economy paying professors janitors landlords grocery stores etc   and do n't forget all those taxes income and sale that the gov't collects   government will collect of the loan immediately as income and sales tax plus a portion of it every time the money changes hands i pay income tax then use some of my after tax money to pay you for a product or service and you still have to pay tax on that money and so on   so it 's more complicated than having robbed the person holding the debt   banks at 30x leverage do n't lose money as long as they get back of the total amount lent out including interest fees and penalties before considering write offs and government repayment   in fact the point of over leverage is so you can make loans that have risk attached   if you could only lend what you actually had you would have to stay away from anything risky because it would be too easy to lose money   having virtual $ to bet means you can serve market segments that have higher risk   this makes more money for the banks that 's why they do it   they are already playing with funny money so they do n't lose any even if you default and move to another country   and the money you spent has also made its way back to them in various amounts such as your professor 's mortgage payments auto loan etc   your taking on debt already helped the bank get its other loans repaid   so roughly speaking if you took out $ 90,000 and $ 3,000 of that made its way back to the bank through various means they have n't lost any money because it only cost them $ 3,000 actual dollars in the first place

for many people giving to charity will have minimal effect on their taxes non profits love to attract donations by saying the money is tax deductible but for most people it does n't work out that way you will only itemize deductions if they exceed your standard deduction the irs allows you to either itemize your deductions where you list each deduction you can take or take the standard deduction consider a married couple filing jointly in 2011 their standard deduction is $ they are in the 28 tax bracket they donate $ 100 of old clothes to the goodwill and are looking forward to deducting that on your taxes and getting $ 28 of that back if that 's their only deduction though they 'd have to give up the standard deduction to take the itemized deduction not worth it suppose instead they have $ 11,500 of deductions in 2011 now we 're talking right no the tax impact of itemizing is only $ 28 since they only exceeded the standard deduction by $ 100 the cost of having a tax accountant fill out the form probably offsets that small gain there 's also all the time that went in to tracking those deductions over the year not worth it   tax deductions only become worthwhile when they significantly exceed the standard deduction you need some big ticket items to get past the itemized deduction threshold for most people this only happens when they have a mortgage as the interest on a residence is deductible   folks love to suggest that having a mortgage is a good deal because the interest is deductible however since you have to exceed the standard deduction before it makes sense to itemize it 's not likely to be a big win for most people tl;dr give to charity because you want that charity to have your money tax implications are minimal let your accountant sort it out disclaimer i am not an accountant

term insurance is definitely expensive at 60 but so is permanent insurance   let 's think about why people buy each one term makes sense if you are worried about death during a certain period of time but not afterward   often this is young people trying to get out of debt have young dependents etc who expect to have more money later in life and less need for insurance permanent makes sense if you want to ensure that your dependents get paid tax free at your death even if you die at an age when you are basically uninsurable   these plans make sense if you hold them forever but if you get out of them early there are often large fees that will make it a pretty bad deal the fact that your uncle is already in a permanent plan makes me think it might make sense to continue   check the details to see how large the fees on getting your money out early would be    given that he has a disabled wife having a permanent plan may make sense especially if her disability is not one associated with dying younger having said that i can see an argument for term insurance if your uncle is primarily concerned with providing for his daughter and wo n't be concerned about it after she 's out of school    the answer really depends on

what said i think of each strategy in terms of capital at risk car it 's a good thing to know when considering any position and then conveniently the return is always profit with covered calls it 's pretty easy pay $ 1000 for stock receive $ 80 in premium net car is $   if you own the stock and write calls many times that expire worthless or you that you buy back there are two measurements to consider first treat every covered call as a buy write even if you already own the stock disregard the real cost basis and calculate from the moment you write the call using the stock price at that time the second measure is more complicated but involves using something like the xirr function in a spreadsheet this tracks the series as a whole even accounting for times where there is no written call outstanding for the written put even though your broker may only require 30 collateral in a margin account mentally treat them as cash secured strike less premium is your true if the stock goes to zero by expiration that 's what you 're on the hook for you could just compute based on the 30 collateral required but in my view that confuses cash collateral needs with true risk note a written put is exactly identical to a covered call at the same strike if you tend to favor puts over ccs ask yourself why just like a loaded gun leverage is n't inherently bad but you sure want to know when you 're using it

it does not matter your credit score is affected by late payments by credit usage and by age of credit do not pay late   paying early is only good in that it means you do n't pay late your credit usage is calculated by percentage of the credit you have that you actually use   keep your usage to under 20 of your limit and you look great as a credit risk as you have lots of buffer

none of that is filtered my way as a part owner sure it is it 's just not always obvious when a company makes money it either other then the fourth option the first three all increase the total value of the company   if you owned 1 of a company that was worth x and is now worth x+1 the value of that 1 ownership should go up as well one model of the value of a share of stock is the present value of all future cash flows that the company produces for its shareholders which would be either through dividends earnings provided that they are invested back into the company or through liquidation sale   so as earnings increase or more accurately as projected future earnings increase so does the value of a share of the company also note that the payment of dividends causes the price of a stock to go down when the dividend is paid since that 's equity cash that 's leaving the company reducing the value of the company by an equivalent amount of course there 's also something to be said for the behavioral aspect of investing meaning that people sometimes invest in companies that they like and sell stock of companies that they do n't like or disagree with e.g. 's

you can not dump $ 450 k of cash into any type of retirement account retirement accounts have maximum annual contribution limits and earned income requirements   if the $ 450 k is already in a retirement account you may be able to rollover these funds into a different type of account i personally invest in dividend paying stocks and recommend the strategy for just about everyone $ 450 k earning 4 in dividends would generate k in annual dividends the first year and compounded would generate k in dividends over a 10-year period all this being said i am not a registered professional of any kind and you should consult a professional before making any decisions and yes i know this question is from 2012

there could be a number of reasons the price hit your number $ but by the time your order hit the market the price had gone up perhaps the stock went up between when you placed the stop loss and when the order was executed a trailing stop loss will ratchet up very simply the trailing stop maintains a stop loss order at a precise percentage below the market price or above in the case of a short position the stop loss order is adjusted continually based on fluctuations in the market price always maintaining the same percentage below or above the market price

how can i avoid this so we are taxed as if we are making the $ 60k yr that we want to receive   you ca n't in the us the income is taxed when received not when used if you receive 1 m this year taking out 60 k does n't mean the other k were n't received they were and are taxable create a pension fund in the corporation feed it all profits and pay    out $ 60k yr of pension i doubt that the corporation could deduct a    million a year in pension funding you can not do that you can only deposit to a pension plan up to 100 of your salary and no more than $ 50 k total maybe a little more this year its adjusted to inflation buy a million dollars in business equipment of some sort each year    to get a deduction then sell it over time to fund a $ 60k yr salary i    doubt such a vehicle exists if there 's no real business purpose it will be disallowed and you 'll be penalized your only purpose is tax avoidance meaning you 're trying to shift income using your business to avoid paying taxes that 's illegal do crazy section 79 life insurance schemes to tax defer the income    the law caps this so i can only deduct < $ 100k of the $ 1 million    annually and there are other problems with this yes would n't go there   added from what i understand this is a term life insurance plan sponsored by the employer for the employee this is not a deferral of income but rather a deduction instead of paying your term life insurance with your own after tax money your employer pays with their pre tax it has a limit of $ 50 k per employee and is only available for employees there are non discrimination limitations that may affect your ability to use it but i do n't see how it is at all helpful for you it gives you a deduction but its money spent not money in your pocket end added do some tax avoidance like facebook does with its double irish trick    storing the income in some foreign subsidiary and drawing $ 60k yr in    salary to be taxed at $ 60k yr rates this is probably cost prohibitive    for a $ 1mm yr company you 're not facebook what works with a billion will not work with a million keep in mind that you 're a one man business things that huge corporations like google or facebook can get away with are a no no for a sole proprietor even if incorporated bottom line you 'll probably have to pay the taxes get a good tax professional to help you identify as much deductions as possible and if you can plan income ahead plan it better

the answer is that it depends on your bank and your creditor whomever you are paying most banks offer overdraft protection for a fee they will process the payment as if you had the money and your account will become overdrawn the next deposit you put in will be applied to the overdraft and once the account is zeroed funds will begin to become available the fees charged and whether a particular charge will go through depend on the bank a few banks will process a payment without a fee if it only happens occasionally some will hit you with a charge per debit in excess of the amount while others will charge you per day on which debit transactions were made while your account was overdrawn and still others will tack on a charge for leaving your account overdrawn for an extended period in almost all cases the for profit institutions banks will charge more than non profit institutions credit unions   watch out for banks that offer automatic overdraft transfer they 'll automatically transfer from another account including eek a credit card to cover a debit to an account with insufficient funds sounds great but the fee they charge is often close to the overdraft fee while without overdraft protection if the payment were simply denied at point of sale most banks have smartphone apps that allow for instantaneous transfer of funds for free i 've never heard of a partial payment you either have sufficient funds to cover the debit or you do n't if you do n't and you do n't have overdraft protection the bank will simply decline to pay the result of that situation depends on the exact circumstances if a utility check bounces they may try to run it again the next day or they may immediately cut your utilities and come after you for the balance at point of sale they simply wo n't give you the merchandise some places are really about pursuing hot check writers if the check does n't clear you have to pay in cash on the spot or they call the police as far as interest on debt it does n't work that way it 's a service fee otherwise it would be subject to some pretty hefty federal regulation however if you figure it as interest you 'd be amazed let 's say you bought lunch at a burger joint for $ 10 you did n't have enough in the account but it was close so the bank let it go and charged you $ 35 you have effectively inflated the cost of that meal to $ 45 a 350 instantaneous price increase or if you prefer 350 interest on that $ 10 i dunno about you but if i were paying $ 45 for one lunch it would n't be at a burger joint most banks simply will not process a check on an already overdrawn account overdraft service or otherwise they 'll hit you for the overdraft fee usually actually a fee for an nsf check and decline the payment so if you had $ 1 in your account and wrote a rent check for $ 1000 it 'd still bounce even with overdraft service

in finance a lot say corporate tax is the original sin   corporate taxes make debt financing more attractive so every company 's debt ratio is much higher than it would be if there were no corporate tax which makes them more vulnerable to shocks in cashflow and at higher risk of default in a downturn   a slight downturn can snowball into a larger one because companies are so heavily debt financed they end up unable to service their debt and end up in worse situations than if they were more equity financed subsequently banks become much more important in the economy because everyone is more leveraged and more company value is tied up in bank debt balances   of course the voting public does n't generally want to lower the corporate tax rate because the general population believes this is how they get their pound of flesh out of corporate america however that is rarely the case

to get the factors you want start with a complete amortization calculator and a tax deduction calculator filling in values for your down payment purchase price tax rates and mortgage rate   if you are talking about a specific property you should be able to get taxes for the current year and perhaps using historical values estimate taxes going out   some calculators will include pmi which you should avoid like the plague in an actual purchase   given some preliminary data you can calculate your insurance so once you have your principal interest tax and insurance monthly payment and tax deduction you can calculate how much you spend a month on the house minus the deduction to estimate maintenance costs you could either figure out about what you 'd need to replace in the given time you plan to stay put and use a rough estimate on what it is   you can also use some rough estimates like this 1 of the property value yearly or this moving the number up to a whopping 2 do n't forget closing costs as a buyer and seller   you can find estimates for these as well and they are a function of the purchase price usually around 2 so to figure out how much it costs you to live in a house for x months you can do so your total cost is total return is you can adjust that total return for inflation using this calculator to get your total return adjusted for inflation   if projecting into the future you can try a formula found here to figure out the return on your investment use so to figure out the total return adjusted you need for a given roi find

remember that risk should correlate with returns in an investment this means that the more risk you take on the more return you should be receiving in an efficient marketplace that 's why putting your money in a savings account might earn you < 1 interest right now but putting money in the stock market averages returns over time you should be very careful not to use the word interest when you mean returns in your post you are calling capital gains the increase in value of owned property interest this may be in your head the level of risk associated with property ownership in the case of the bank they are not in the business of home construction rather than take that risk themselves they would rather finance many projects being done by construction companies that know the business the bank has a high degree of certainty of getting its money back because its mortgages are protected by the value of the property   part of the benefit of an efficient marketplace is that risk gets bought by individuals who want it this means that people with a low risk tolerance such as banks people on fixed incomes seniors etc can avoid risk and people with a high risk tolerance stock investors young people with high income etc can take on that risk for higher average returns the bank 's reasoning should remind you of the risk associated with property ownership increases in value are not a sure thing if you do not understand the risk of your investment you can not be certain that you are being well compensated for that risk note also that most countries place regulations on their banks that limit the amount of their funds that can be placed in higher risk asset classes typically this something along the lines of if someone places a deposit with your bank you can only invest that deposit in a low risk debt based asset ie you can take money deposited by customer a and use it to finance a mortgage for customer b this is done in an attempt to prevent collapse of the financial sector if risky investments start failing

suggested way to make the decision to repair or buy figure out what it will cost to repair your car if necessary pay a garage to evaluate it as if your daughter was interested in buying it then think about whether you would pay that much to buy a car just like yours but without those problems if the answer is yes fixing it us probably your most cost effective choice even if it is a big bill if the answer is no consider a used car and again have the mechanic check it for any horrors before committing to buy it that avoids the line tax where a new car loses a significant percentage of its value the moment it leaves the dealership an almost toy car us virtually indistinguishable from a new car costs much less and realistically has about the same expected life span i bought a new car once at about $ 300 over the dealer 's real as opposed to sticker cost since i was willing to take the one he was stuck with from the previous model year thank you consumer reports for providing the dealer 's cost info and making this a five minute transaction if it had n't suffered flood damage i 'd probably still be driving it and even so i sorta regret not pricing what it would have cost go completely replace the engine if you really plan to drive it until it is completely you may be able to justify a new car but realistically buying a or two year old car would have been a better choice

then why do countries with single payer health plans see the cost for medical services increase beyond the rate of inflation every year    seriously just look at these assets watson global medical trends   it does n't matter that they spend less of of gdp on health care than us because the net effect of thier models cause cost inflation that increases that percentage just like ours you could transplant thier model to the us and still see the same upward momentum it is mathematically unsustainable

generally a one time thing is considered a gift for the donor this is obviously not a deductible expense except for some specific cases for example promotional gifts under $ 25 to vendors can be deducted if you 're a business or charitable contributions to a recognized charity however if this is a regular practice that would not be considered as a gift but rather as a tax fraud a criminal offense being attentive i would like to make a little gift or give some little    < 100 $ amount of money cash wire online for that why generally gift is exempt from income if no services were provided and the gift was made in good faith in the situation you describe this does n't hold when the gift is exempt from income to the receiver the donor pays the tax in this case below exemption the tax is zero if the gift is not exempt from income to the receiver it is no longer a gift and the receiver is paying income taxes not the donor the situation you describe is a classic tax evasion scheme if someone does it consistently and regularly as a receiver donor or both he would likely end up in jail

it reminds me of the efficient market hypothesis except that just states in its weakest form that the current market price accounts for all information embedded in previous market prices in other words people buying today at 42 know it was selling for 40 yesterday and the patterns and such to say that stock is memoryless strikes me as not quite right to the extent that stocks are valued based on earnings much of what we infer about future earnings relies on past and present earnings one obvious counterexample to this memoryless claim is bankruptcy if a stock files bankruptcy and there is n't enough money to pay senior debt your shares are worth 0 in perpetuity

a consortium of investment banks go on a road show to their clients to see who 's interested at which price in the ipo the arrange this price through various financial models to determine the market value of the company   the banks price the offering deliberately low to ensure a pop on the open of trading to send a positive signal to the market this is their story at least ipos mispriced on the low side result in less money for the company making the offering   i think a better way to perform an ipo is the way google did the theirs a reverse auction this is the same way the treasury sells bonds and definitely would put more money in the companies and less in the banks unfortunately the banks do n't love the idea and you need a lot of clout to get them to change their minds

payment such as square do not normally withhold tax it is up to you to pay the appropriate tax at tax time that having been said square does report your payments to the irs on a form 1099-k if your payments are large enough according to square you 'll get a 1099-k from them if your total payments for the year add up to $ 20,000 and more than 200 transactions   whether or not they report on a 1099-k you are required to pay the appropriate taxes on your income   so now the question becomes do i have to pay income tax on the proceeds from my garage sale and the answer to that question is usually not when you sell something that you previously purchased if you sell it for more than you paid for it you have a capital gain and need to pay tax on that however generally you sell things in a garage sale at a loss meaning that there is no tax due   if you make more than $ 20,000 at your garage sale and the irs gets a 1099-k the irs might be curious as to how you did that with no capital gain so if you sell any big ticket items a for example you should keep a record of what you paid for it so you can show the loss to the irs in the event of an audit

yes an estate plan can be very important   estate planning typically attempts to eliminate uncertainties over the administration of a probate and maximize the value of the estate by reducing taxes and other expenses are often designated for minor children and beneficiaries in in general your estate includes all of your assets less all debt plus death benefits from all life insurance policies not held in an irrevocable trust the biggest reason to have an estate plan is to make sure that your personal values about both medical and personal finance financial matters are honored in the event that death or prevents you from acting for yourself in addition tax is a further and very important goal of estate planning for persons with taxable estates to create an estate plan for yourself or update an existing plan you will most likely need the services of an estate planning attorney when you consult with an estate planning attorney the attorney considers how you want assets distributed to heirs what taxes might your estate be liable for and whether there are tax strategies that would be appropriate and appealing what your preferences and values are with respect to the management of medical and financial affairs in the event of and any complicating family issues to deal with these issues your attorney will need full and accurate information about you including when an estate plan is created be sure you understand what the attorney is saying estate planning ideas can be confusing it is also appropriate and expected for you to ask about the attorney 's fee for any legal service some articles and resources get ahead of your estate planning estate planning by cba

i am not a financial advisor but i an tell you what i did in exactly this situation which is pretty much what you are proposing   i put money into the offset savings account until i had only a small amount of mortgage balance left less than a year 's worth of mortgage payments then i set it up so that each month i did the transfer from the offset savings pot into the mortgage itself this depleted the offset savings in line with the mortgage debt and the interest on the two balanced out almost to zero this was self sustaining and meant that i kept the same margin owing over time i.e. if i was in this situation for 5 years for the whole 5 years i would effectively have 1 year remaining on the mortgage meanwhile since i now did n't have any mortgage outgoings from my regular income i put any spare money into isa savings no need to withdraw money from the mortgage to move to the isa the benefits of this as opposed to just paying off the damn mortgage already were that i kept the full liquidity of the mortgage amount i could withdraw all the offset savings pot if i wanted to although i would then have to have funded the mortgage payments differently and as that liquidity went down over time i was building up other savings in parallel it worked well for me it almost does n't matter what the offset mortgage rate is since you are effectively paying it off by keeping the offset savings pot so high

i have heard that people say the greater earning means greater    intrinsic value of the company then the stock price is largely based    on the intrinsic value so increasing intrinsic value due to    increasing earning will lead to increasing stock price does this make    sense yes though it may be worth portions here as a company generates earnings it has various choices for what it can do with that money it can distribute some to shareholders in the form of dividends or re invest to generate more earnings what you 're discussing in the first part is those earnings that could be used to increase the perceived value of the company however there can be more than a few interpretations of how to compute a company 's intrinsic value and this is how one can have opinions ranging from companies being overvalued to undervalued overall of mines forests and would be an article giving examples that make things a bit more complex consider how would you evaluate a mine a forest or a farm where each gives a different structure to the cash flow this could be useful in running the numbers here

rob i 'm sorry your first visit here has been unpleasant   what you are asking for is beyond the capability of most software if you look at you find the standard deduction for married filing joint is $ in 2012 and $ in 2013 i offer this anecdote to share a deduction story the first year i did my mil 's taxes i had to explain that she did n't    have enough deductions to itemize every year since she hands me a    file full of paper medical deductions that do n't exceed    7.5 of her income in turn i give her two folders back one with the 5 or so documents i needed and the rest labeled trash fewer than 30 of filers itemize and a good portion of those that do have no question that 's the right thing to do e.g. my property tax is more than the $ 12 k so anything else i have that 's a deduction adds right to the number   it 's really just those people who are at the edge that are likely frustrated i wrote an article regarding standard deduction vs itemizing in which i describe a method of pulling in one 's deductible expenses into odd years reducing the number in even years to allow a bi annual if this is your situation you 'll find the concept interesting   you also ask about filing status think on this for a minute after pulling in our turbotax imports the data right from adp i do the same for our stock info the stock info and all schedule a deductions are n't assigned a name so any effort to split them in search of savings by using married filing separate would first require splitting these up turbotax has a what if worksheet for this function but when the marriage penalty was lifted years ago the change in status had no value items that phaseout over certain income levels are often lost to the separate filer anyway when i got married i found my real estate losses each year could not be taken they accumulated until i either sold or until our income dropped when the mrs retired   so while is respect your desire for these magic within the software i think it 's fair to say they would provide little value to most people   if this thread stays open i 'd be curious if anyone can cite an example where filing separately actually benefits the couple

but speculation is absolutely intended to happen and is considered necessary for healthy a investment environment   what i am saying however is that this desire to rid the world of hft appears to be moral rather than logical there is very little reason to eliminate hft as it stands although there appears to be a propensity for very emotional responses to the basic concept ones i can appreciate however i am suggesting they are misguided as the people who should be upset with hft are the hedge fund managers and day traders they are not you or me who buy and sell shares on a whim every so often if you want to ban day traders that is a separate argument i do n't want to go into   the idea that these computer algorithms are all set to sell sell sell is provably nonsensical if that were the case all of the hft participants would have gone massively bankrupt during the flash crashes also it is quite patently the case that somebody has to be buying in order for anybody to sell saying this is what caused some of the crashes is just your desire for a simple explanation it must have been more complex than this and to my knowledge none of these crashes have been adequately explained although some poorly designed algorithms have been note that in one of these cases iirc a fund closed its doors due to the losses and the market was largely unaffected so it seems like a problem that self corrects in this case and one that only harms the participant that   also to correct a basic misunderstanding selling happens all of the time and does not inherently drive the price down there are by definition an equal number of sales to what drives the price down is the people buying being willing to pay   edit as another aside a point i have made elsewhere and seems suitable to make here flash crashes whilst causing panic are again something only the professional intra day trading community are likely to be affected by their very name implies so the reason being that anybody investing based on the long term investment potential of a company will only benefit in the temporary drop in price as they can purchase more of the company at a bargain price any intelligent investor will not be by the drop in price as price has no bearing on a company 's real value and stocks do tend towards this value over time whatever happens over the short term the only case in which it could is if the company owns a large portfolio of stock that itself devalues dramatically that they intended to sell and as a result experience cash flow problems this is so incredibly unlikely with a flash crash as to be ignored

perfect credit would be defined by your credit score   you may have a perfect repayment history but that is only one factor in your credit score   paying off a loan early does n't by itself cause your score to go down   a lack of history however will result in a lower score   lenders use the score because the general consensus is that what you have done in the past is the best indicator of what you will do in the future   in essence your credit score tells a potential creditor what type of risk they are taking by lending you money   if you have very little history the risk is not necessarily higher but it is less predictable so you have a lower score these pages explain what makes up your credit score

firstly and this part is rather opinion based i would absolutely not think of making more pension contributions when you are currently totaling 6 of salary as over contributing there are some who argue that you should be putting a minimum of 20 away for retirement throughout your working life you do n't say how old you are how close to retirement you are but a common rule of thumb is to halve your age and put away that of your salary into your pension so i would certainly start with upping those contributions   i actually do n't think it makes much difference whether you go for just your workplace pension versus a separate private one in general you end up paying management fees that are a of the value so whether it is in one place or split does n't cost any less the all eggs in one basket syndrome is a possible argument but equally if you change jobs a few times and end up with half a dozen pension pots it can be very hard to stay on top of them all if you end up with everything in one pot and then transfer it when you change jobs it 's easier to manage other options    isa as you mentioned on the plus side these are tax free on the minus side you can either go for a cash isa which at the moment has very low rates of return and/or a stocks and shares isa which exposes you to risks in the stock market    if you have debt consider paying it off early overpaying student loans may or may not be the exception to this depending on your personal situation certainly if you have a mortgage you can save a vast amount by overpaying early    other investments stocks and shares btl housing fine wines bitcoin there are almost limitless possibilities but it makes sense to max out the tax efficient options before you look into these

most funds keep a certain amount in cash at all times to satisfy outflows   net inflows will simply be added to the cash balance while net outflows subtract   when the cash gets too low for the manager 's comfort level depends on the typical pattern of net inflows and outflows as well as anticipated flows based on recent performance the manager will sell some of his least favorite holdings and when the cash gets too high he will buy some new holdings or add to his favorite existing holdings   a passive fund works similarly except the buys sells are structured to minimize tracking error

on the statement it now tracks how much is contributed to the account    pre and post tax this is the key your withdrawals will be proportional assuming you have contributed 90 in regular contributions pre tax and 10 in roth post tax when you withdraw $ 1000 it will be $ 900 from the regular taxed fully and $ 100 from the roth not taxed assuming its a qualified distribution earnings attributed proportionally to the contributions i agree with you that it is not the best option and would also prefer separate accounts but with 401k the account is per employee instead of doing 401k roth non roth consider switching to regular 401k and roth ira then you can separate the funds easily as you wish

is your name on the title at all you may have slightly more leverage in that case but co signing any loans is not a good idea even for a friend or relative as this article notes generally co signing refers to financing not ownership if the    primary fails to make payments on the loan or the retail    installment sales contract a type of auto financing dealers sell    the co signer is responsible for those payments or their credit will    suffer even if the co signer makes the payments they ’re still not    the owner if their name is n’t on the title the consumer finance protection bureau cfpb notes if you co sign a loan you are legally obligated to repay the loan in    full co signing a loan does not mean serving as a character reference    for someone else   when you co sign you promise to pay the loan yourself it means that    you risk having to repay any missed payments immediately if the    borrower defaults on the loan the creditor can use the same    collection methods against you that can be used against the borrower    such as demanding that you repay the entire loan yourself suing you    and your wages or bank accounts after a judgment your    credit may be impacted by any late payments or defaults co signing an auto loan does not mean you have any right to the    vehicle it just means that you have agreed to become obligated to    repay the amount of the loan so make sure you can afford to pay this    debt if the borrower can not per this article and this article options to remove your name from co signing include if you 're name is n't on the title you 'll have to convince your ex boyfriend and the bank to have you removed as the co signer but from your brief description above it does n't seem that your ex is going to be cooperative unfortunately as the co signer and guarantor of the loan you 're legally responsible for making the payments if he does n't not making the payments could ruin your credit as well one final option to consider is bankruptcy bankruptcy is a drastic option and you 'll have to weigh whether the disruption to your credit and financial life will be worth it versus repaying the balance of that auto loan per this post another not so pretty option is bankruptcy this is an extreme route    and in some instances may not even guarantee a name removal from the    loan your best bet is to contact a lawyer or other source of legal help to review your options on how to proceed with this issue

adding international bonds to an individual investor 's portfolio is a controversial subject   on top of the standard risks of bonds you are adding country specific risk currency risk and diversifying your individual company risk   in theory many of these risks should be rewarded but the data are noisy at best and adding risk like developed currency risk may not be rewarded at all also most of the risk and diversification mentioned above are already added by international stocks   depending on your home country adding international or emerging market stock etfs only add a few extra bps of fees while international bond etfs can add 30 of fees over their domestic versions   this is a fairly high bar for adding this type of diversification   us bonds for foreign investors are a possible exception to the high fees though the government 's bonds yield little if your home currency or currency union does not have a deep bond market and/or bonds make up most of your portfolio it is probably worth diversifying a chunk of your bond exposure internationally   otherwise you can get most of the diversification much more cheaply by just using international stocks

gt a good cashier is not someone who is better at sliding packages over a scanner good cashiers are friendly engaging fast and have a sharp eye for they have good judgment and relate well to their colleagues they care about the customer 's experience   those are nice qualities but wal mart feels they are getting enough of those qualities for the price and let 's not ourselves into thinking that they are high skill anyone could be trained in the basics of watching for theft in less than 2 weeks   gt walmart has chosen to compete solely on price not on service therefore they hire the cheapest cashiers and sacrifice all of the soft skills that make a cashier a pleasurable part of someone 's shopping experience   wal mart has realized that these qualities are nice but not really worth that much extra money most people do n't want to have a wonderful conversation with their checker especially if this comes at a much higher cost at the counter most people have friends and even the best shopping experience is taking away from their life few of us want to prolong the experience with artificial and conversation with our checker which feels like a social obligation on most days we want an accurate total and a swift checkout when people are trying to get out of the grocery store they do n't search for the line with the checker they search for the one who is sliding packages across the scanner like lightning   gt are they missing out on an opportunity to build customer loyalty   customer loyalty is overrated the most loyal customer is n't going to their family for a really great checker experience and wal mart knows that i 'm reminded of people complaining that wal mart has manufacturers make a cheaper version of their for their customers supposedly this was a plan to make items disposable so people would have to buy more in reality wal mart just realizes the average guy who buys a drill is n't seriously going to get into like he 's always saying he 's going to pull it out 2 3 times after the initial enthusiasm wears off i thin wal mart pisses people off because they know what we really are as opposed to the people we pretend to be   gt they 're creating a workforce incentivized to get back at the company whenever possible   wal mart has a pretty good on their workforce they 're not losing money this getting back is highly theoretical in reality they 're going to gripe about their job and cycle through a lot of low wage jobs on their way back to wal mart again   i do n't know if you 've worked with low skill workers before but there 's a reason they are where they are they 're not these noble creatures from novels i worked at quite a few of these low wage jobs while putting myself through college   these are the people who show up to work these are the people who work for a few weeks and then suddenly flip out for seemingly no reason at all these are the people who when told to perform a task say no one tells me what to do that 's what the check is for dummy that 's what a job is these are the same people who sat in the back of the classroom in school and talked shit about how the teacher was stupid school was stupid they did n't need that shit to be successful they are mostly ignorant and filled with pride which they 've been told they should have not for accomplishments but for simply existing when you 've actually been around the poor masses for a while raised around them as i was as a child you stop and them they 're not all bad workers but most of them are bad at working   these are those soft skills that you were talking about wal mart raising wages wo n't make those people good workers it 'll put them out of a job wal mart only hires those people because they 're a bargain if they 're forced to raise wages tomorrow most of those people are going to be out and replaced with higher skill workers like you would prefer at the very least wal mart would start hiring higher skill workers to replace their lower skill workers so what problem have you solved do the low skill workers now have magically more wages no they 're low skill and wages are higher they 've been priced out of the market   gt but i must note that a good cashier enhances the shopping experience rather than simply being a human   you obviously come from a different place i think you 'd be shocked by how many of us would like exactly that do n't be surprised when wal mart moves to rfid tags and get 's rid of cashiers altogether

having just gone through this process as a buyer via broker in israel here are my thoughts tl;dr an incentive such as you are suggesting would not be particularly helpful in this case your best option is to spend your efforts shopping for a broker that you can trust the rest your main concern is that the broker will find you a place at the top of your budget and will not negotiate aggressively the main person responsible for negotiation is you you are paying for the property and you are putting in bids not your agent the agent should advise you but in the end should pass along your bids directly the real problem is that you as the buyer generally do not have as close a feel for the pulse of the market as the broker who should be quite aware of recent closings in the neighborhood therefore there are a few things that you can do to help arm yourself at the end of the day if you have decided to use a broker you are making a large financial commitment to hire someone to find you the best place and therefore it may be more important at this point to spend your efforts shopping around for the best broker rather than trying to figure out how to outsmart her you are correct buyers agents do have incentives to sell you on places that may not be right or good for you for example although your scheme may help a bit with the first concern it will not help at all with the other two which i assume to be much more likely problems in any event instead find recommendations for brokers from others have the broker show you a few properties and put in some low bids to get a feel for how she handles them discuss the properties together and try to assess if they really have your interests in mind you are paying a lot for their service and you should make sure as much as possible that they really are working honestly and in your best interest a good broker who knows his market and is trying to help you can be a great asset in the opaque cutthroat real estate market good luck

in general when companies are regarded as hot growth stocks they are expected to keep up an accelerated level of growth for a good long time that accelerated growth justifies a high pe relative to a slow growth stock when companies that are supposed to grow miss expectations or worse lose money the markets punish the stock severely particularly if the company does n't make analysts aware of problems early on netflix is a great example of a company a few different business problems creating a much bigger one in the process a poorly conceived rate hike killed the reliable cash flow of the company and that crazy thing just confused everyone now nobody trusts the management blackberry is another example of a high performing company that just screwed up damaging shareholders in the process we 're living in a very challenging era today but growth stocks are always risky by nature growing a company rapidly is very difficult

while i do not have an issue with treating customers clients well the whole mentality of the customer is always right needs to be re evaluated    in a case where a customer has unreasonable demands or is treating an employee poorly by no fault of the employee their privilege to be right ends in situations like that it is more important to stand up for your employees then it is to side with the customer if you do side with the customer in that situation it not only reinforces that behavior from the customer but makes the employee feel undervalued and will lead to morale issues if your workplace has consistent morale issues you will have a high turnover rate this will end up costing you considerably more not just in human capital but in workplace knowledge time and most prominently money chances are if a customer is being a huge drain of your resources they are likely not worth too much to your company to begin with see below    another reason why this mentality of every customer is valuable is a bad idea is found within the 80/20 principle simply put 80 of your revenue will come from 20 of your customer base and usually the 20 tend to be the lowest maintenance and have the lowest resource demand another application of this principle shows that 20 of your customer base accounts for 80 of the resource usage within your company the principle itself is not limited to 80/20 but the of a majority of x is provided by the minority of y is something that remains consistent across economies and cultures    in short not all customers are created equal and as a result do not deserve the same resources as one another in addition to this workforce integrity is more important in the long run than possibly losing a customer average firms provide good service excellent firms provide smart service

when you own a share you also own a vote in most cases that vote is your means of controlling the assets and management of the company if you had enough votes and wanted to trade a share for an iphone or liquidate the company entirely you could do it the only thing that prevents you from doing that is that companies are not set up to handle the transaction that way stock holders are usually trying to buy investments not iphones there are companies that have more cash in the bank than the market cap total value of their stock they usually do n't remain as public companies for long in that case an investor or group of investors buy them up and split the cash if you had enough shares of apple you could do that to or just trade one for an iphone

i 'm of the belief that you should always put 20 down   the lower interest rate will save you thousands over the life of the loan   also pmi is no different then burning that much cash in the fireplace every month from wikipedia lenders mortgage insurance also known as private mortgage insurance pmi in the us is insurance payable to a lender or trustee for a pool of securities that may be required when taking out a mortgage loan it is insurance to offset losses in the case where a is not able to repay the loan and the lender is not able to recover its costs after foreclosure and sale of the mortgaged property you are basically paying money each month for the bank to be insured against you not paying your mortgage   but in actuality the asset of the condo should be that insurance only you can decide if you are comfortable with having $ 50k in liquidity or not   it sounds like a good cushion to me but i do n't know the rest of your expenses

as of now the two scenarios are very similar if not the exact same concept at this point db is not legally required to fulfill that request maybe eventually they will be but right now no they are not   that only leaves the other element of ethical obligations which is what i agree with except that 's exactly the same conflict apple had when they refused to give the us government access to a terrorist 's phone which of course had been suspected to possibly contain information relevant to other plans   edit the main point is both these companies stand to gain from refusing to follow a reasonable government request i 'm not saying db or even apple made the right choice overall but both companies of course had good business minded reasoning for refusing to help the government reaching out to them in each case

a bond fund will typically own a range of bonds of various durations in your specific fund the fund holds high quality long term new york municipal bonds with an    average duration of approximately years so through this fund you get to own a range of bonds and the fund price will behave similar to you owning the bonds directly   the fund gives you a little diversification in terms of durations and typically a bit more liquidity   it also may continuously buy bonds over time so you get some averaging vs. just buying a bond at a given time and holding it to maturity   this last bit is important over long durations the bond fund may perform quite differently than owning a bond to maturity due to this ongoing refresh   another thing to remember is that you 're paying management fees for the fund 's management as with any bond investment the longer the duration the more sensitive the price is to change in interest rates because when interest rates change the price will track it i.e. compare a change of 1 for a one year duration vs. 1 yearly over 10 years if i 'm correct why would anyone in the u.s. buy a long term bond fund    in a market like this one where interest rates are practically    bottomed out that is the multi trillion dollar question   bond prices today reflect what people are willing to pay for them   those people include the federal reserve which through various programs qe operate twist etc has been forcing the interest rates to where they want to see them   if no one believed the fed would be able to keep interest rates where they want them then the prices would be different but given that investors know the fed has access to an infinite supply of money it becomes a more difficult decision to bet against that   aka do n't fight the fed   my personal belief is that rates will come up but i have n't been able to translate that belief into making money   this question is very complex and has to do not only with us policies and economy but with the status of the us currency in the world and the world economy in general   the other saying that comes to mind in this context is that the market can remain irrational and it certainly seems to be that longer than you can remain solvent

according to your post you bought seven shares of at $ each on august 23rd   you paid €   now on august 25th is worth $   so you have   but you want to know what you have in eur not usd   so if i ask google how much $ is in eur it says €   that 's even lower than what you 're seeing    it looks like usd has fallen in value relative to eur   so while the stock price has increased in dollar terms it has fallen in euro terms   as a result the value that you would get in euros if you sold the stock has fallen from the price that you paid    another way of thinking about this is that your price per share was € and is now €   that 's actually a small drop    when you buy and sell in a different currency that you do n't actually want you add the currency risk to your normal risk   maybe that 's what you want to do   or maybe you would be better off sticking to euro denominated investments    usually you 'd do dollar denominated investments if some of your spending was in dollars   then if the dollar goes up relative to the euro your investment goes up with it   so you can cash out and make your purchases in dollars without adding extra money    if you make all your purchases in euros i would normally recommend that you stick to euro denominated investments   the underlying asset might be in the us but your fund could still be in europe and list in euros    that 's not to say that you ca n't buy dollar denominated investments with euros   clearly you can   it 's just that it adds currency risk to the other risks of the investment   unless you deliberately want to bet that usd will rise relative to eur you might not want to do that    note that usd may rise over the weekend and put you back in the black   for that matter even if usd continues to fall relative to the eur the security might rise more than that   i have no opinion on the value of   i do n't actually know what that is as it does n't matter for the points i was making   i 'm not saying to sell it immediately   i 'm saying that you might prefer euro denominated investments when you buy in the future   again unless you are taking this particular risk deliberately

in australia any income you earn is taxable despite where it came from using your example your taxable income is $ 70,000 keep in mind that with a business even as a sole trader any business expenses that contribute to the earning of your business income is deductible reducing the final amount of tax you 'll have to pay   the ato website has lots of good information and examples to look at including tax rates   if your total income is pushing   into a higher tax bracket over tax per $ 1 earned it may be worth looking at shifting your business to operate under a company structure that just has a fixed tax rate around per $ 1   that said for me i do n't want the paperwork overhead of a company yet so i 'm running my side business as a sole trader too i 'd rather do that and keep it easy for now while my business gets profitable that waste time on admin structures for tax reasons even if in the it may mean slightly higher tax in the end you only pay tax on profit income minus expenses as opposed to raw gross income   for more info there are good books in the or local library to read free on starting a business on the side while still working they discuss these issues too

the danger to your savings depends on how much sovereign debt your bank is holding   if the government defaults then the bank if it is holding a lot of sovereign debt could be short funds and not able to meet its obligations i believe default is the best option for the euro long term but it will be painful in the short term   yes historically governments have shut down banks to prevent people from withdrawing their money in times of crisis   see argentina circa 2001 or us during great depression   the government prevented people from withdrawing their money and people could do nothing while their money rapidly lost value see the emergency banking act where title i section 4 authorizes the us make it illegal for a bank to do business during a national emergency per section 2 without the approval of the president   fdr declared a banking holiday four days before the act was approved by congress   this documentary on the crisis in argentina follows a woman as she tries to withdraw her savings from her bank but the government has prevented her from withdrawing her money if the printing press is chosen to avoid default then this will allow banks and governments to meet their obligations   this however comes at the cost of a seriously debased euro i.e. higher prices   the euro could then soon become a hot potato as everyone tries to get rid of them before the ecb prints more   the us dollar could meet the same fate what can you do to avert these risks   yes you could exchange into another currency   unfortunately the printing presses of most of the major central banks today are in   this may preserve your savings temporarily i would purchase some gold or silver coins and keep them in your possession   this you from the banking system and gold and silver have value anywhere you go   the coins are also portable in case things really start to get interesting   attempt to purchase the coins with cash so there is no record of the purchase   this may not be possible

as a sole proprietor the tax liability of your business is calculated based on combining your business income with your personal income together   it is good advice to keep all personal and business financial matters separate this makes it easier to prove to the irs that all your business expenses are actually business related in this case however the two items tax payment for personal income vs tax payment for business income are what you can do however for your own personal records is calculate how much of your tax payment relates to your business i would n't get complicated about this i would simply take the net income of your business as a of your taxable income and multiply that against your tax payment ie if your business net income is $ 10,000 and your total taxable income is $ 50,000 and you paid $ 6,000 in taxes i would record that 20 of the $ 6k was related to business income if you have a separate bank account for your sole proprietorship you could make a transfer to your personal account of $ 1,200 and then make the $ 6k payment from your personal account remember that tax payments for either your sole proprietorship and your personal income will be treated the same federal tax payments are not tax deductible and state tax payments are tax deductible whether they were paid for your sole proprietorship or the rest of your personal income so even though this method is simplistic for example it does n't factor in that different investment income types earned personally will have a lower rate than your sole proprietorship income any difference would n't have an impact on any future tax liability this would only be for your own personal record keeping

in a quote driven market must every investor trade with a market         maker in other words two parties that are both not market makers         can not trade between themselves directly in a way yes all trades go through a market maker but those trades can be orders put in place by a person ie you or me does a quote driven market only display the best bid and ask         prices proposed by the market makers in other words only the         highest bid price among all the market makers is displayed and         other lower bid prices by other market makers are not similarly         only the lowest ask price over all market makers is displayed and         other higher ask prices by other market makers are not no you can see other lower bid and higher ask prices in a order driven market is it meaningful to talk about the current stock price which is the price of last transaction well that 's kind of an opinion information is information so it wo n't be bad to know it personally i would say the bid and ask price is more important however in the real world these prices are changing constantly and quickly so realistically it is easier to keep track of the quote price and most likely the bid ask spread is small and the quote will fall in between the less liquid a security is the more important the bid ask is this goes for all market types for a specific asset will there be several transactions happened at     the same time but with different prices today with electronic markets trades can happen so quickly it 's difficult to say in the us stock market trades happen one at a time but there is no set time limit between each trade so within 1 second you can have a trade be $ 50 or $ however it will only go to $ when the lower ask prices have been exhausted    does an order driven market have market makers   by definition no what are some examples of quote driven and order driven financial markets in which investors are commonly trading stocks and derivatives especially in u.s. quote driven market bond market forex order driven market nyse comes from an order driven market but now would be better classified as a market conclusion if you are asking in order to better understand today 's stock markets then these old definitions of quote market or order market may not work the big markets in the real world are neither ie nasdaq nyse the nyse and nasdaq are better classified as a market as they use more then a single tactic from both market types to insure market liquidity and transparency markets these days are strongly electronic fast and fairly liquid in most cases here are some resources to better understand these markets an introduction to securities markets the nyse and nasdaq how they work understanding order execution

the deferral for the 401k means that you 're not collecting your pay immediately but instead diverting it to a retirement account roth 401k in this case this article defines deferral well what is the difference between a regular 401(k deferral pre tax and a roth 401(k deferral   under either a regular 401(k deferral or a roth 401(k deferral you    make a deferral contribution by electing to set   aside part of your    pay by either a certain percentage or a certain dollar amount   for    a regular 401(k deferral the   taxable wages on your w-2 are reduced    by the deferral contribution therefore you pay less current income    tax    however you will eventually pay tax on these contributions and    earnings when the plan distributes the regular   401(k deferrals and    earnings to you   the result is that the tax on the regular 401(k    deferrals and earnings is only   postponed   a roth 401(k deferral is an after tax contribution which   means you    must pay current income tax on the deferral    since you have already    paid tax on the deferral you wo n’t pay tax on it again when you    receive a distribution of   your roth 401(k deferral   in addition if    you satisfy distribution conditions then you wo n’t have to    pay tax   on the earnings either   this means   that the distribution of    the roth 401(k earnings can be tax free not just tax   postponed traditionally this deferred compensation typically was directed to a 401k but now that roth 401k is another available option deferred compensation can be directed there as well

i went to morningstar 's performance page for fusex 's s&p 500 index fund and used the compare tool to compare it with and as well as fidelity emerging markets fund   according to the data there outperformed fusex in 2012 outperformed in 2010 and outperformed fusex in both 2010 and 2012   when looking at and 15-year trailing returns both and outperformed fusex what does this mean   it means it matters what time period you 're looking at   us stocks have been on an almost unbroken increase since early 2009   it 's not surprising that if you look at recent returns international markets will not stack up well   if you go back further though you can find periods where international funds outperformed the us and even within recent years there have been individual years where international funds won as for correlation i guess it depends what you mean by low   according to this calculator for instance and fusex had a correlation of about over the last 15 years   that may seem high but it 's still lower than say the correlation between fusex and small cap   it 's difficult to find truly low correlations among equity funds since the interconnectedness of the global economy means that bull and bear markets tend to spread from one country to another   to get lower correlations you need to look at different asset classes e.g. bonds so the answer is basically that some of the funds you were already looking at may be the ones you were looking for   the trick is that no category will outperform any other over all periods   that 's exactly what volatility means it means the same category that in some periods will underperform in others   if international funds always outperformed no one would ever buy us funds   ultimately if you 're trying to decide on investments for yourself you need to take all this information into account and combine it with your own personal preferences risk tolerance etc anecdotally i recently did some simulation based analyses of vanguard funds using data from the past 15 years   over this period vanguard 's emerging markets fund comes out far ahead of us funds and is also the least correlated with the s&p 500   but again this analysis is based only on a particular slice of time

so basically they are trying to see two things   one is whether prices are correlated to each other for long periods of time as a preliminary study suggested which would go against efficient markets hypothesis since you could use that info to game the market or if that result is illusory and the long term returns are close to a standard normal distribution which would follow the markets   the second thing i do n't follow as well but they 're trying to solve the first thing so that they can then look at why when they look at returns at different time scales one hour one week the model which had been proposed for these returns is not supported by the data   the first thing they say that the old model levy says that the variability should not be the same at the different time scales but the data suggests that it is   so they then propose a modification of the old levy model and say that it would also explain the strange first result they looked at that prices are correlated for longer periods   that probably does n't make any sense but you might have more luck by posting in /r statistics

if i was an upside down homeowner and i went to my bank to refinance the mortgage at a lower rate and they declined i 'd give them the middle finger by not paying the mortgage and declaring bankruptcy     a homeowner has no incentive to continue paying a mortgage for a home that is no longer the value of the mortgage and if the bank is unwilling to work with the upside down homeowner to get the home owner a lower interest rate that is the least the bank could do then make the home the bank 's problem and let them eat their cake    this home owner is not asking the bank to forgive part of the mortgage or write it off but asking for his mortgage to be refinanced at the lower rate that is pretty straight forward and simple we as taxpayers bailed the banks out in 2008 the least they could do is help upside down homeowners the banks reluctance to help upside down homeowners is why we have a stagnant housing market    the bank by not working with this home owner to refinance his mortgage at a lower interest rate is a bank that indicates they do n't care about having a paying customer

yes of course there have been studies on this   this is no more than a question about whether the options are properly priced if properly priced then your strategy will not make money on average before transaction costs and will lose once transaction costs are included   if you could make money using your strategy on average then the market should and generally will make an adjustment in the option price to compensate the most famous studies on this were conducted by black and scholes and then by merton this work won the nobel prize in 1995 although the black scholes or black scholes merton equation is so well known now that people may forget it they did n't just sit down one day and write and equation that they thought was cool they actually derived the equation based on market factors beyond this work you 've got at least two branches of study   academics have continued to study option pricing including but not limited to revisions to the original black scholes model and hedge funds large trading house have quants looking at this stuff all of the time   the former you could look up if you want the latter will never see the light of day because it 's proprietary if you want specific references i think that any textbook for a quantitative finance class would be a fine place to start   i would n't be surprised if you actually find your strategy as part of a homework problem this is not to say by the way that i do n't think you can make money with this type of trade but your strategy will need to include more information than you 've outlined here   choosing which information and getting your hands on it in a timely manner will be the key

the short answer it depends the long answer off the top of my head there are quite a number of factors that an analyst may look at when analyzing a stock to come up with a recommendation   some example factors to look at include the list goes on   quite literally any and all factors are fair game for a recommendation   so the question is n't really what analysts do with financial data it is what do analysts do with financial data that meets your investment needs as an example if you have two analysts one who is focused on growth stocks and one who is focused on dividend growth they may have completely different views on a company   if both analysts were to analyze apple aapl 5 years ago the dividend analyst would likely say sell or at the most hold because back then apple did not have a dividend   however an analyst focused on growth would likely have said buy because apple appeared to be on a clear upward trend in terms of growth   likewise if you have analysts who are focused on shorting stocks and ones who are focused on deep value investing the sell analyst may be selling sell because they are confident the stock will go down in price so you can make money on the short position   conversely the deep value investor may be saying buy because they believe that based on the companies strong balance sheet and recent shake ups in management the stock will eventually turn around   two completely different views for the same company the analyst focused on shorting is looking to make money by capitalizing on falling share price while the analyst focused on deep value is looking for companies in a whom s he believe will turn around the thesis being that if you dollar cost average as the price drops when it corrects you 'll reap the rewards that all said to answer the question about what analysts look for so really you should be looking for analysts who align with your investment style and use those recommendations as a starting point for your own purchases   personally i am a dividend investor so i have passed many buy recommendations from analysts and my former broker because those were based on growth stories   that does not mean that the analysts my former broker or myself are wrong   but we were all incorrect given the context of how i invest and what they recommend

well what you said about money is the reason people say things are only worth what people are willing to pay for them there is plenty of economic reasons to for instance conserve and the environment because deforestation and destruction have negative externalities associated with that have to paid out in the future by who ever suffers from those externalities however there is n't a market for eco bonds or a way to value that effectively which is a real issue for ecological conservation   there are people trying to do what and there is an interesting article this week in the new scientist about such nexus between and economics but while there is clear value somewhere assigning it a price only works if people are willing to buy or invest in it    its quite sad how many of the critics of modern banking do n't really appreciate what they do and what finance does or more commonly confusion arises about what finance even is let alone what it does

stimulus money artificially without actual demand for the sector where it goes delaying the natural recession that comes when demand off people spend money when they are better off buying an item economics is organic people trade to improve their lives artificially lowering the cost of some services and items or lowering interest rates by increasing the deficit only delays the natural decline of demand for whatever services receive stimulus it was exactly this that caused the great depression when the money supply was expanded stimulus by 2/3 then contracted the 20s boom was created by the government artificially creating the appearance of demand incentivizing overproduction then when the real demand does n't materialize a depression follows

i agree but think it goes a lot deeper towards the issue of trust something few brands seem to place much value on these days demographics all the quantifiable numbers and metrics are more important than ever in the minds of advertisers with little value given to the trust and relationship between the channels and their respective audiences    google is a great example of the of advertising spaces making the assumption that all spaces are created equally while this works for selling commodity widgets there is an erosion of trust that takes place between a commodity audience and commodity content used to sell commodity advertising by removing the sense of authority and that brands would once gain from aligning themselves with specific audiences via specific channels you turn the whole system into a numbers game which further the problem   it ’s also likely to only continue to get worse as everything increasingly becomes and advertising product placement or promotional opportunity so good on anyone that does not blindly and take advertising at face value

this is the same as any case where income is variable   how do you deal with the months where expected cash flows are lower than projected when i got married my wife was in the habit of allocating money to be spent in the current month from income accrued during the previous month   this is slightly complicated because we account for taxes and benefit expenses withheld in the current months paychecks as current expenses but we allocate the gross income from that check to the following month for spending the benefit of spending only money made during the previous month is that income shocks are less shocking   i was working for a start up and they missed payroll that normally arrived on the first of the month   most of my co workers were calling the bank in a panic to avoid over draft fees with their mortgage payments but my mortgage payment was already covered   similarly when the same start up had a reduction in force on the first day of a new quarter i did n't have to pull any money from savings during the 3 weeks i was unemployed in the end you 're going to have to allocate money to the budget based on the actual income which is lower than your expectations   what part of the budget should fairly be reduced is a question you and your wife will have to figure out

like dheer said the demand for shorter term money is greater than for longer term money precisely because the banks do n't want to have to pay big interest rates for long periods banks borrow short term and lend long term so they take money from you for one year and lend it away as a 20 year mortgage after a year they take money for another year since short term rates tend to be higher than longer term rates they make money off the spread or the different between the rate they lend and the rate they borrow in this scenario banks should pay higher for longer term deposits but overall banks realize that interest rates will go up and down and they do n't want to lock the up for a longer term since banks believe that rates will come down in the 1 2 year period they offer good rates only till the 1 year period and longer term deposits by offering lower rates if you look at the interbank or money markets trading of very short term bulk money shows that for the 10 15 day periods the interest rates being offered are 10 or so while for one year it 's just 9.5 the market believes that interest rates will go down in the one year time frame but you never really know since this is just a bunch of people that believe so eventually if rates continue to go up the demand at the longer term will also go up because it will become obvious that the rate pressure continues to be strong   if you do want higher rates for the long term check out state bank of india bonds that are currently trading on the nse you can buy them if you have a brokerage account they are just about as safe as sbi fixed deposits and the rate being offered is around for a 10 15 year term hope that helps

october 18 2017 by john goldman sachs making too little money is not the worst of the world ’s problems but inside the investment bank ’s new york headquarters it feels like an insult   goldman is not suffering a financial crisis as it did in 2008 when it officially converted to being a bank holding company amid panic that the whole of wall street could collapse it faces something deeper an identity crisis   it used to be the role model for many rival banks even while for its single minded focus on investment banking and trading but as tuesday ’s disclosure of a 26 per cent fall in its bond trading revenues confirmed banking has changed instead of lenders such as jpmorgan chase wanting to become as glamorous as goldman it needs to be more like them   this is a telling moment albeit less dramatic than 2008 investment banking enjoyed a lucrative two decades spurred by globalisation and financial goldman ’s revenues rose from its initial public offering in 1999 to 2007 and boomed in 2009 it could do no wrong financially although it turned out to have done wrong to some of its customers   but guess what regulation works governments and central bank supervisors set out to make complex trading in bonds and derivatives the securities business in which goldman specialised more expensive and less profitable the rules now favour deposit taking and lending instead of   no one really planned the second aspect of the bank ’s difficulty the huge dose of monetary easing since the crisis has volatility and made markets more predictable hedge funds themselves under pressure no longer need to reward goldman and others for taking on financial risk   goldman ’s bond and commodities trading division from which emerged a of leaders including lloyd blankfein its chairman and chief executive tells its own story it used to occupy two floors of the new york office but has shrunk to one as wall street ’s total bond trading revenues have halved since 2009 more prices are calculated by computers than humans   when you rely heavily on one engine and that engine you are in trouble the bank ’s financial advisory and capital raising division is performing well and it has an investment management arm but it lacks a consumer powerhouse like morgan stanley ’s wealth management operation or the lending and credit card activities that drive banks such as jpmorgan   the truth for goldman is that us retail banking has become not only more reliable than investment banking but more profitable jpmorgan ’s balance sheet is three times the size of goldman ’s and its retail banking arm made a 19 per cent return on equity in the third quarter compared with goldman ’s 11 per cent   the best historical comparison for goldman ’s predicament is ironically the jpmorgan of the 1990s jpmorgan was a blue chip corporate bank but found that this business was no longer profitable enough as lending margins fell it launched an effort to return to investment banking having been separated from morgan stanley in by the glass steagall act   jpmorgan had a good stab at it compensating for the fact that goldman and others dominated wall street ’s bulge bracket by credit derivatives which later turned out badly but it could not make enough progress alone and settled for being bought by chase manhattan in 2000   both banks have struggled to keep pace with the rapid growth of the leading investment banks which are in businesses that have been far more lucrative than the lending business at the core of commercial banking the new york times noted in its account of the merger years and one financial crisis later jpmorgan has reversed this order of profitability   so goldman is now trying to do the opposite of the old jpmorgan by adding banking to investment banking jpmorgan ’s former dilemma has not gone away lending to blue chip companies is not much of a a more tempting target is the high margins that banks make on credit cards   hence marcus goldman ’s online lender named after its founder marcus goldman which offers loans to prime us consumers as an alternative to credit card debt marcus which will launch next year in the uk accounts for $ of the $ in new lending and financing planned by goldman in the next three years as it diversifies   but it is no simpler for goldman to break into main street than it was for the old jpmorgan to break back into wall street $ on a balance sheet of $ is an interesting financial experiment not a revolution it would need to inflict on consumer banking with technology what amazon did to the retail industry to rival fully jpmorgan and bank of america   we ’re a bank and we ’re committed to being a bank says one partner firmly but selling personal loans and mortgages which could be marcus ’s next target is not a job designed for masters of the universe this is goldman ’s identity crisis regulation and economics are rendering it ordinary

it is a general truism but the reasons are that the rules change dramatically when you simply have more capital here are some examples limited to particular kinds of markets under $ 2,000 in capital nobody is going to offer you a margin account and if you do get one it is n't with the best broker on commissions and other capabilities so this means cash only trading enjoy your 3 business day settlement periods this means no shorting a trader to only buy and hold strategies making them more dependent on luck than a more capable trader this means it is more expensive to buy stock since you have to put down 100 of the cash to hold a share whereas someone with more money puts down less capital to hold the exact same number of shares this means no covered options strategies or spreads again limiting the market directions where a trader could earn under $ 25,000 in capital in the stock market the pattern day trader rule applies to retail margin accounts with a balance under $ 25,000 and this limits the kinds of trades you are able to take because of the limit in the number of trades you can take in a given time period forget managing a multi leg option position when the market is n't moving your direction under $ 125,000 in capital worse margin rules you excluded portfolio margin from your post but it is a key part of the answer over $ 1,000,000 in capital participate in private placements regulation d offerings reserved for accredited investors these days as buy and hold investments these generally have more growth potential than publicly traded offerings over $ 5,000,000 in capital you can easily get the compliance and risk manager to turn the other way on margin rules this is not conjecture leverage up to infinity try not to bankrupt yourself and the trading firm

this answer will expand a bit on the theory a company as an entity represents a pile of value some of that is business value the revenue stream from their products and some of that is assets real estate manufacturing equipment a patent portfolio etc one of those assets is cash if you own a share in the company you own a share of all those assets including the cash in a theoretical sense it does n't really matter whether the company holds the cash instead of you if the company adds an extra $ 1 billion to its assets then people who buy and sell the company will think hey there 's an extra $ 1 billion of cash in that company i should be willing to pay $ 1 billion shares outstanding more per share to own it than i would otherwise granted you may ultimately want to turn your ownership into cash but you can do that by selling your shares to someone else from a practical standpoint though the company does n't benefit from holding that cash for a long time cash does n't do much except sit in bank accounts and earn small amounts of interest and if you wanted pathetic amounts of interests from your cash you would n't be owning shares in a company you 'd have it in a bank account yourself really the company should do something with their cash usually that means investing it in their own business to grow and expand that business or to enhance profitability sometimes they may also purchase other companies if they think they can turn a profit from the purchase sometimes there are n't a lot of good options for what to do with that money in that case the company should say i ca n't effectively use this money in a way which will grow my business you should go and invest it yourself in whatever sort of business you think makes sense that 's when they pay a dividend you 'll see that a lot of the really big global companies are the ones paying dividends places like coca cola or exxon mobil or what have you they just ca n't put all their cash to good use even after their growth plans many people who get dividends will invest them in the stock market again possibly purchasing shares of the same company from someone else or possibly purchasing shares of another company it does n't usually make a lot of sense for the company to invest in the stock market themselves though investment expertise is n't really something most companies are known for and because a company has multiple owners they may have differing investment needs and risk tolerance for instance if i had a bunch of money from the stock market i 'd put it in some sort of growth stock because i 'm twenty something with a lot of savings and years to go before retirement if i were close to retirement though i would want it in a more stable stock or even in bonds if i were retired i might even spend it directly so the company should let all its owners choose unless they have a good business reason not to sometimes companies will do share buy backs instead of dividends which pays money to people selling the company stock the remaining owners benefit by reducing the number of shares outstanding so they own more of what 's left they should only do this if they think the stock is at a fair price or below a fair price for the company otherwise the remaining owners are essentially giving away cash this actually happens often on the other hand if the company 's stock is depressed but it subsequently does better than the rest of the market then it is a very good investment the one nice thing about share buy backs in general is that they do n't have any immediate tax implications for the company 's owners they simply own a stock which is now more valuable and can sell it and pay taxes on that sale whenever they choose

the steps you outlined are fine by themselves step 5 seeking criticism can be less helpful than one may think   see   there are a lot of opposing opinions all of which can be correct over different time frames   try and quantify your confidence and develop different strategies for different confidence levels i was never smart enough or patient with follow through to be a successful value investor it was very frustrating to watch stocks trade sideways for years before the company 's intrinsic value was better reflected in the market   also you could make an excellent pick but a macro change and slump could set you back a year and raise doubts in my experience portfolio management techniques like asset allocation and dollar cost averaging is what made my version of value investing work your interest in is something to applaud   is there something specific about that you do not understand   context is key these types of reports are more relevant and understandable when compared to competitors in the same sector    it is good to assess over confidence   it is also good to diversify your knowledge and the effort put into securities analysis 6th edition will help with other books in the field   i see a bit of myself in your post and if you are like me than subsequent readings and full mastery of the concepts in securities analysis 6th ed   will lead to over confidence or a false understanding as there are many factors at play in the market   so many that even the most scientific approaches to investing can just as equally be described as an art i 'm not aware of the details of your situation but in general for you to fully realize the benefits from applying the principals of value investing shared by graham and more recently warren buffett you must invest on the level that requires use of the consolidation or equity method of accounting e.g. > 20 ownership    sure the same principals used by buffett can work on a smaller scale but a small scale investor is best served by wealth accumulation which can take many forms not the addition of instant equity via acquisitions to their consolidated financials lastly to test what you have learned about value investing and order execution try the inverse   at least on paper   short a stock with low value and a high p e.   may be a good example learn what it is like to have your resources at stake and the anguish of market and security volatility it would be a lot easier to wait it out as a long term value investor from a beach house in santa barbara

first as dheer mentioned above there is no right answer as investment avenues for a person is by many subjective considerations given that below a few of my thoughts strictly thoughts 1 have a plan for how much money you would need in next 5 7 years one hint is do you plan you buy a house car get married try to project this requirement 2 related to the above if you have some idea on point 1 then it would be possible for you to determine how much you need to save now to achieve the above possibly with a loan thrown in it will also give you some indication as to where and how much of your current cash holding that you should invest now 3 from an investment perspective there are many instruments some more risky some less the exact mix of instruments that you should consider is based on many things one among them is your risk and fund requirement projections 4 usually not as a rule of thumb the of savings corresponding to your age should go into low risk investments and into higher risk investment 5 you could talk to some professional planners all banks offer the service hope this helps i reiterate as dheer did there is no right answer for your question all the answers would be rather

wire transfers normally run through either the fedwire system or the clearing house interbank payments system chips the process generally works like this you approach a bank or other financial institution and ask to transfer money you give the bank a certain code either an international bank account number or one of several other standards which informs the bank where to send the money   the bank sends a message through a system like fedwire to the receiving bank along with settlement instructions   this is where the process can get a bit tricky for the wire transfer to work the banks must have reciprocal accounts with each other or the sending bank must send the money to a bank that does have such an account with the receiver if the sending bank sends the money to a third party bank the transaction is settled between them and the money is then sent to the receiving bank from the third party bank this last transaction may be a wire transfer ach transfer etc   the federal reserve fits into this because many banks hold accounts for this purpose with the federal reserve this allows them to use the fed as the third party bank referred to above interestingly enough this is one of the significant ways in which the fed makes a profit because it along with every other bank and routing agent in the process collects a miniscule fee on this process   you 'll often find sources that state that fedwire is only for transferring large transactions while this is technically correct it 's important to understand that financial institutions do n't settle every wire transfer or payment immediately although the orders are put in immediately the financial institutions settle their transactions in bulk at the end of the business day and even then they normally only settle the difference so if chase owes bank of america $ 1 m and bank of america owes chase $ 750 k they do n't send these as two transactions chase simply credits bac $ 250k.   you did n't specifically ask about ach transfers which as littleadv pointed out are different from wire transfers but since ach transfers can often form a part of the whole process i 'll explain that process too ach is a payment processing system that works through the federal reserve system among others the federal reserve through the and systems is by far the largest payment processor   the physical cash itself is n't transferred in simple terms the money is transferred through the ach system between the accounts each bank maintains at the federal reserve   here is a simple example of how the process works i 'm summarizing the example from wikipedia let 's say that bob has an account with chase and wants to get his paycheck from his employer stack exchange directly deposited into this account assume that stack exchange uses bank of america as their bank   bob the receiver fills out a direct deposit authorization form and gives it to his employer called the originator once the originator has the authorization they create an entry with an originating depository financial institution which acts as a middleman between a payment processor like the federal reserve and the originator the odfi ensures that the transaction complies with the relevant regulations in this example bank of america is the odfi   bank of america the odfi converts the transaction request into an ach entry and submits it through an ach operator to the receiving depository financial institution rdfi which in this case is chase bank chase credits deposits the paycheck in bob 's account   the federal reserve fits into all of this in several ways through systems like and the fed acts as an ach operator and the banks themselves also maintain accounts at the federal reserve so it 's the institution that actually performs the settling of accounts between banks

in the u.s. form 1040 is known as the tax return   this is the form that is filed annually to calculate your tax due for the year and you either claim a refund if you have overpaid your taxes or send in a payment if you have underpaid   the form is generally due on april 15 each year but this year the due date is april 18 2016 when it comes to filing your taxes there are two questions you need to ask yourself am i required to file and should i file am i required to file the 1040 instructions has a section called do i have to file with several charts that determine if you are legally required to file   it depends on your status and your gross income   if you are single under 65 and not a dependent on someone else 's return you are not required to file if your 2015 income was less than $ 10,300   if you will be claimed as a dependent on someone else 's return however you must file if your earned income from work was over $ 6300 or your unearned income from investments was over $ 1050 or your gross total income was more than the larger of either $ 1050 or your earned income + $ 350   see the instructions for more details should i file even if you find that you are not required to file it may be beneficial to you to file anyway   there are two main reasons you might do this if you have had income where tax has been taken out you may have overpaid the tax   filing the tax return will allow you to get a refund of the amount that you overpaid as a student you may be eligible for student tax credits that can get you a refund even if you did not pay any tax during the year how to file for low income tax payers the irs has a program called free file that provides free filing software options

all very good answers for the most part but i have a definition for good and bad debt which is a little bit different from those mentioned here so far the definitions come from robert kiyosaki in his book rich dad poor dad which i have applied to all my debts good debt good debt is debt used to fund a money making asset an asset which puts money into your pockets or bank account each month in other words the income produced by that asset is more than all the expenses including the interest repayments on the debt associated with the asset bad debt bad debt is debt used to fund both money losing assets and non assets where the interest repayments on the debt are more than any income if any at all produced by the goods or services the debt was used to purchase so that you need to take money out of your pockets or bank account each month to sustain the debt based on this definition a mortgage used to purchase the house you live in would be classed as bad debt why because you are making interest repayments on the mortgage and you have other expenses related to the house like rates and maintenance but you have no income being produced by the house even a mortgage on an investment or rental property where the rent is not enough to cover all the expenses is considered to be bad debt for the debt on an investment property to be considered as good debt the rent would have to cover the full interest payments and all other expenses in other words it would need to be a positively geared or a cashflow positive asset why is this definition important in distinguishing between good and bad debt because it looks at the cashflow associated with the debt and not the profit the main reason why most investors and businesses end up selling up or closing down is due to insufficient cashflow it may be a profitable business or the value of the property may have increased since you bought it but if you do n't have enough cash every month to pay the bills associated with the asset you will need to sell it if the asset produces enough cashflow to pay for all the expenses associated with the asset then you do n't have to fund the asset through other sources of income or savings this is important in two ways firstly if you are working and suddenly lose your job you do n't have to worry about paying for the asset as it is more than paying for itself secondly if you do n't have to dig into your other source s of income or savings to sustain the asset then theoretically you can buy an unlimited number of similar type assets just a note regarding the mortgage to buy a house you live in being classed as bad debt even though in this definition it is considered as bad debt there are usually other factors which still can make this kind of debt worthwhile firstly you have to live and the fact that you have to live means that if you did not buy the house you would probably be renting instead and still be stuck with a similar monthly payment secondly the house will still appreciate over the long term so in the end you will end up with an asset compared to nothing if you were renting just another note to mention the definition provided by john stern debt is a technology that allows borrower to bring forward their spending it 's a financial time machine that 's a clever way to think of it especially when it comes to good debt

to dispute your first point it can be racist if it 's the truth the accuracy of a statement does n't impact it 's    if you were over weight and i called you a fat fuck it may well be true though it 's still mean   in the same way if your mother was dying of cancer and i was to say she is a weight on our social structures and she 's not likely to live long anyway all of those things may be factually correct however it is still malicious for me to say those things in that way    similarly even if what he says is factually is an issue i 'll get to does not change whether what he said and the way he said it was malicious or to a particular race now whether what he said is socially acceptable is a matter of culture you seem to think it 's perfectly acceptable as another said many of his business connections might also i happen to think it 's not acceptable clearly in line with op i 'm not looking to argue about whether it is acceptable to ever be racist because that is a nuanced line though fairly simple to keep away from that has been covered over and over in many other discussions arguments and protests    to the matter of whether or not what he has said is factually correct    i agree with you on this zimbabwe is incredibly rich in resource and is a largely untapped land in the modern seemingly not for long    however i would make the distinction in my argument in the causality is it the fault of the zimbabwe people that they have not fully taken advantage of their resource and if so is that fault in anyway linked to their skin colour    for me even if you the first the 2nd is untenable clearly seen in the rise of asia and of india through the 20th century education medicine social support and infrastructure play a much larger role in the ability of a society to effectively allocate resource than the vain colour of ones skin or the line of ones heritage   not to say the first is entirely true either as the mistakes of yours weigh on your ability as much as their success accelerates you   there are key resources and educations the places such as zimbabwe lacked the made them unable to use   resource historically in the same way as the modern western world water hygiene tool making resource most notably land able to support intensive farming and food storage       instead the cultures would have developed to use the land resources as is most efficient though may not be the cities and farming of europe     further i would argue education and infrastructure as was seen originally with the foundation of the us the america 's resource was untapped without the machinery or knowledge to take advantage of it which comes best from the close quarters of europe    writing also improving the transfer of information by orders of magnitude first created in the middle east taken up by the greeks then the romans therefore much of europe 's success amount other thing s can be credited to to romans and theirs to the greeks and theirs to the    clearly the nor even the romans were white by any pure standard especially noting england 's boom occurred after introduction of roman infrastructure and more recently asia with western international corporation 's     i would argue that the size of a society and it 's economic success which may not be the aim of the society has more to do with the tools available the location and access to trade infrastructure and social support including medicine    these are things that are not linked to the colour of ones skin therefore to say that blacks by virtue of being black lacking any other qualifying information are inherently less able to bring america into economic success than whites by virtue of them being white lacking any qualifying information is not entirely factually correct and is naturally open to criticism    by changing you argument to be less directed at the colour of ones skin and more toward the nature of the society and the capabilities of their technology your argument is made more tolerable though still entirely open to   but as soon as you change your argument to i 'm glad that people of america and bringing to to success did instead of people were n't able to america and bring technology with them the argument becomes somewhat null of course a society whether black white or any other with advanced technology and access to trade such as who had control of many trade lines and much of indian production would be able to and take advantage of resources better than a society which did not have those things control of large trade routes ships ect and these things have less to do with the colour on ones skin and more to do with infrastructure trade and social support    the fact is when the racism is taken out the argument is n't worth mentioning because the ability to speaks to a society that takes effective advantage of trade infrastructure and technology   this fact is and makes any attempt to justify the argument seem a thinly veiled justification for   as if not to be racist what is the argument actually a arguing what does his statement actually say without specifying the colour of ones skin   so to i 'm not entirely against the line of thought nor that the guy said he gets in the good books of his friends what i am against is a society that supports racism the society he is supporting in making that type of statement what i am against is the idea that if something is true it does n't matter how it 's said remember your fat ass mom i 'm what i am against is the use of null arguments to justify a controversial opinion if the controversial aspect of the sentence is able to be taken away and it was would it have any meaning   sorry if i was overly aggressive in this response and for any grammatical mistakes and if you have a response i would appreciate a similar amount of effort and will do my best to my bias   thank you   edit grammar

the main driver behind countries not printing themselves out of debt is the fact that it will cripple the economy destroy citizens savings asset valuations and piss all the countries trade partners off so much that they may stop doing business with them   you will have a few different extremes look at zimbabwe as an example of a country that just prints money like no ones business   america is essentially devaluing its currency to compete with china that annoys the chinese because their holdings are devalued and as such you then see people moving away from us treasuries into more stable commodities and currencies

i have researched this question extensively in previous years as we have notoriously high taxes in california while neighboring a state that has zero corporate income tax and personal income tax many have attempted pull a fast one on the california taxation authorities the franchise tax board by incorporating in nevada or attempting to declare full year residence in the silver state this is basically just asking for an audit however   california religiously examines taxpayers with any evidence of having presence in california if they deem you to be a resident in california and they likely will based on the fact that you live in california physical presence you will be subject to taxation on   your worldwide income you could incorporate in nevada or bangladesh and california will still levy its taxation on any business income single member llcs are disregarded as separate corporate entities but still taxed at ordinary income rates on the personal income tax basis to make things worse if california examines your single member llc and finds that it is doing business in california based on the fact that its sole owner is based in california all year long you could feasibly end up with additional penalties for having neglected to file your llc in california california llcs are considered domestic and only file in california unless they wish to do business in other states nevada llcs are considered foreign to california requiring the owner to file a domestic llc organization in nevada and then a foreign llc organization in california which still gets hit with the minimum $ 800 franchise fee because it is a foreign llc doing business in california   evading any filing responsibility in california is not advisable ftb consistently researches llcs s corporations and the like to determine whether they 've been organized out of state but still principally operated in california thus having a tax nexus with california and the subsequent requirement to be filed in california and taxed by california no one likes paying taxes and no one wants to get hit with franchise fees especially when one is starting a new venture and that minimum $ 800 assessment seems excessive in other words you could have a company that earns nothing zero zip nada and still has to pay the $ 800 minimum fee but the consequences of tax laws and filing requirements will make the franchise fee seem trivial in comparison   if you 're committed to living in california and desire to organize an llc or s corp you must file with the state of california either as a domestic corporation llc or foreign corporation llc doing business in california the only alternatives are being a sole proprietor unincorporated or leaving the state of california altogether not what you wanted to hear i 'm sure but that 's the law

when they make the most money off of charging interest on late payments this is incorrect do you have any data to back this in the past decade there was a tendency by financial institutions to make money from late payments and there were certain rewards incentives for people who paid late however the bubble cracked soon enough and there were huge losses in the card industry today most of the revenue for card companies is from margins on customers who pay on time and growth avenues are promoting to pay every transaction by card why do they actively seek people who pay their bills on time as evidence by requiring good credit scores to get approved for a card instead of they opposite as indicated above remember if one customer defaults it wipes out margins made by tons of customers in spite of giving credit to people with good credit score the average credit card debit an us individual holds is still quite high

this will end badly the only question is how long it will take performing bank transfers is not difficult and there is no way a 3rd party would be paying her large sums of money to perform these transfers unless the purpose was illegitimate and they were taking advantage of her   in my experience it is as simple as entering the target bank account routing and account entering the name this is not double checked by the bank to associate with the target account entering a dollar amount and then agreeing to the terms of the transfer there are not people out there who have a lot of money but would rather pay somebody $ 2000 + to do 2 minutes of work in an unofficial capacity instead of just doing it themselves unless they are trying to hide something and/or take advantage of a mark

even straight index funds grow at about 6 7 on average or over long periods of time   in short time periods quarters years they can fluctuate anywhere from -10 to + 20   would you be happy if your bank account lost 10 of its value the week before you had to pay the bill for the repairs    is it appropriate to invest small amounts for short periods of time in general no   most investments are designed for long term appreciation    even sophisticated financial companies ca n't do any better than 1 or 2 annualized on short term cash reserves where you can make a huge difference is on the cost side   bargain with suppliers or wait for sales on retail items   both will occasionally forego their margin on certain items in order to try to secure future business which can make a difference of 20 or more in the cost of repairs

do you have other things you might want to spend that cash on in the near future like a down payment on a house beyond having emergency cash the only reason to keep a pile of cash around is because you might need it for another purchase unless you are going to have other expenses that will require higher interest loans to cover them there 's no need to sit on a big pile of cash as long as you are getting the full match on your 401(k that 's the free money that might be worth more than the interest you are paying on the loans in any case i suggest you aim for at least 10 into your 401(k account moving forward in your life so that you can properly fund retirement 15 would be even better it does n't sound like you would be losing anything by paying the student loans and you could then use the money freed from your loan payments to pay down your car faster

in a nutshell in order to file for chapter 9 bankruptcy the city or county first has to actually be insolvent the state has to give authorization for the city or county to file and the city or county must have made an attempt to negotiate with creditors bondholders pensioners etc once those conditions are met and they must be specifically met the city or county files the bankruptcy petition and the automatic stay typically goes into effect shortly after this stay basically allows the municipality to stop making payments on some of their obligations throughout the course of the bankruptcy case chapter 9 bankruptcies are usually very protracted and very expensive so fast forward a year or two the creditors that are owed money have all been assigned to different classes by the bankruptcy court with each class getting a specific recovery based on the type of creditor the city or county has the sole right to propose a plan of reorganization some debts such as a bond backed specifically by revenues generated by a sales tax are usually considered special revenues and secured those bondholders will have first priority on those revenues pledged to them throughout the bankruptcy process and are usually other creditors such as general obligation bondholders or employee pension plans are usually considered unsecured and will not receive their contractually obligated payments during the bankruptcy process and will likely have to take a haircut on the principal amount they are owed by the city or county the municipality must be solvent in order to advance the plan of reorganization and exit the bankruptcy process so quite often employee contracts are adjusted services will be reduced pension and promises to retired workers will be curtailed and bonded debt is reduced to a manageable level it 's not pretty and it is very expensive

there are two factors in your credit score that may be affected the first is payment history lenders like to see that you pay your bills which is the most straightforward part of credit scores imo if you 've actually been paying your bills on time though then this should still be fine the second factor is the average age of your open accounts longer is considered better here because it means you have a history of paying your bills and you are n't applying for a bunch of credit recently in which case you may be taking on too much and will have difficulties paying them if this card is closed then it will no longer count for this calculation if you do n't have any other open credit accounts then that means as soon as you open another one your average age will be one day and it will take a long time to get it to good levels if you have other matured accounts then those will balance out any new accounts so you do n't get hit as much incidentally this is one of the reasons why it 's good to get cards without yearly fees because you can keep them open for a long time even if you switch to using a different card primarily

no there 's no personal responsibility per se if you set up a corporation but if you do n't have a track record a creditor will likely insist that you personally guarantee the debts of the corporation beyond that personal responsibility would be the result of a piercing of the corporate veil which is something the courts are unlikely to do unless there is of fraud or the like there are also some statutory provisions that can lead to personal liability of a corporation 's directors e.g. unpaid wages but i do n't think that 's really what this thread is getting at

no insult detroit was to cars what glasgow was to ships it happened all over the west during the last 30 years   is funny though i live in a small town really a few miles out of glasgow is technically more accessible to me to the north   glasgow has been pretty much rebuilt from it 's and fame   still issues but they are getting there detroit will too   in south west we had a massive industry of lace and mining once   some of the best in the world apparently that all disappeared to the far east during the 50s during the we had a massive plant and even dec had production here   guess what as those could be automated that was all too   further north we had silicon i believe the pun was intended   ibm had a massive site of many thousand workers lenovo took them over and within a few years that was all gone too   the original ibm workers had great benefits they originally sold the site and off the staff and then re leased the site and took all the staff back on via an agency   the only difference being all the benefits of working for ibm were gone   that went on for a few years or so and then lenovo took over consumer hardware side     this being the side of things built for silicon and then hardly used     to be fair there is still a huge site at and we are supposedly getting another 3k workers back a bit like the cat story   this area will be very grateful for the work just like your southern states   the trend i interpreted is that as soon as things could be automated that was when things went away and when margins started to fall out of electronics that was just the excuse they needed   in theory a production line that had 100 staff might be doable with just 10 these days maybe with all the horrific horror stories of abroad companies are now being able to justify 10 plebs over here   it starts to sound like i 'm being slightly anti globalist here i 've no problem with globalism but the same thing that helps companies should allow me to buy shit from abroad at the cost i can find rather than being forced to buy region locked or crap   if it costs you £ 5 to make a shirt in india you should be selling it to me for £ 15 not £ 35   what you talk of does represent more what happened across europe rather than just the uk poland and the previous eastern bloc being your southern states   thatcher for good or bad the unions in the uk a new one when she was in power hence the only 1 time the natural gas powered plant was fired up   we have rights in the uk that are now being legislated from europe but to be honest they hardly seem worth the paper they are written on the unions like yours just do n't have the anymore   on thinking about it do you think the earthquake had anything to do with the migration of that cat site back to the us

i think what those articles are saying is if you want to leave some money to charity and some to relatives do n't a roth to charity while taxable accounts to relatives   in other words it 's not bad to leave a roth ira to charity it 's just not as good as giving it to humans if there are humans you want to give money to in your situation the total amount you want to leave to relatives is less than the value of your roth   so it sounds like the advice as it applies to you is do n't leave your relatives $ 30 k from your taxable funds while leaving the whole roth to charity   instead leave $ 30 k of your roth to your relatives while leaving all the taxable funds to charity along with the leftover $ 20 k of the roth   in other words the roth is a last resort for charitable giving only give away roth money to charity if you already gave humans all the money you want to give them   i 'm unsure of the details of how you would actually designate portions of the roth for different beneficiaries but some googling suggests it is possible

if you can afford the cost and risk of 100 shares of stock then just sell a put option   if you can only afford a few shares you can still use the information the options market is trying to give you see below a standing limit order to buy a stock is essentially a synthetic short put option position 1   so deciding on a stock limit order price is the same as valuing an option on that stock options and standing limit orders are hard to value and the generally accepted math for doing so the black scholes merton framework is also generally accepted to be wrong because of black so rather than calculate a stock buy limit price yourself it 's simpler to just sell a put at the put 's own midpoint price accepting the market 's best estimate options market makers whole job and the purpose of the open market is price discovery so it 's easier to let them fight it out over what price options should really be trading at the result of that fight is valuable information use it sell a atm put option every month until you get exercised after which time you 'll own 100 shares of stock purchased at this will typically give you a much better cost basis several dollars better versus buying the stock at spot and it the valuation math onto the options market   meanwhile you get to keep the cash from the options premiums as well disclaimer markets do make mistakes   you will lose money when the stock drops more than the option market 's own estimate if you ca n't afford 100 shares or for some reason still want to be in the business of creating synthetic options from pure stock limit orders then you could maybe play around with setting your stock purchase bid price to approximately see your statistics book for how to set 1 standard deviation gives you a 30 chance of a fill 2 gives you a 5 chance etc disclaimer the above math probably has mistakes do your own work   it 's somewhat invalid anyway because stock prices do n't follow a normal curve so standard deviations do n't really mean a whole lot   this is where market makers earn their keep or not if you still want to create synthetic options using stock limit orders you might be able to get the options market to do more of the math for you try setting your stock limit order bid equal to something like this where is the strike price of a put option for the equity you 're trading   which option expiration and strike you use for depends on your desired time horizon and desired fill probability   to get probability you can look at the delta for a given option   the relationship between option delta and equity limit order probability of fill is approximately disclaimer there may be math errors here   again do your own work also while this method assumes option markets provide good estimates see above disclaimer about the markets making mistakes

i know an answer has been accepted but you need an emergency fund ideally enough to cover at least 3 months of after tax basic living expenses as a free 6 months would be even better this is n't a fun way to tie up your money but it is a prudent way what if you lose your job or decide you want to change your line of work what if you 're told a close family member has only months to live and you want to take significant time off unpaid what if your car breaks down and you need a new one what if your freelance business hits a dry patch for a few months what if you want to move but ca n't sell your next house quickly i 've known people who had these types of situations come up unexpectedly some were financially prepared and had the freedom to make the choices they wanted to make others did n't and now have regrets once you have a basic emergency fund in place then go for investing with the rest of the money best of luck

a living wage is a great idea but asking business to pay for it is bad it 's not that companies ca n't afford it it 's that for every company that can afford it there are about a dozen small ones that ca n't eg small businesses   the solution is to have a universal wage subsidy funded by the government and sourced through increased taxes especially in the financial sector this would allow companies to pay wages while the government tops it up to ensure that low paid workers get more money

without knowing actual numbers it 's tough to say   personally i would pay off the car then going forward use the money that would have been paid on your car note toward your mortgage   i always think of things in the worst possible scenario   it 's easier and faster to repossess a car than to foreclose on real estate   also in an emergency situation depleting your fund for your car loan and your mortgage would be significantly more detrimental than only paying a mortgage with a car owned outright   fewer obligations means fewer things to draw down your funds in an emergency whether the tax deductability of the mortgage interest outweighs the lower rate on your car loan will depend on a lot of factors that have n't been shared   i think it 's safe to assume with only 1 of separation the real difference is n't significant   i think when determining which credit cards to pay off choosing the one with the highest rate is smart   but that 's not the situation you 're in if you do n't have foreclosure concerns i 'd still pay off the car then start investing

a credit card is not a bank account   it is essentially a contract to extend a line of credit on an as needed basis through a process accepted by the through approved cash advance etc   there is no mechanism for the bank to accept or hold a deposit   while most card issuers will simple retain the money for a period of up 30 60 days to apply toward transactions i have had a card that actually charged a fee for having a negative balance in excess of $ 10 for more than 30 fee was $ 10/month so no you can not deposit money on any credit card   you need an account that accepts deposits to make a deposit

so from investopedia who actually declares a dividend states that the board of directors of a company sets the 4 key dates as these dates are chosen by the board of directors either by internal corporate convention or special situation conceivably a board may choose a payable date greater than 2 weeks which may make sense if their accounting partners are unavailable i.e. extended national holiday i assume that any period of time longer that what may seem reasonable and customary will be a topic at the next shareholder meeting

i was a school board member and district negotiator for the teacher contract   i came off the board in the last couple years   in this case it does n't seem like tenure is the issue   this is a seniority issue   teacher unions like most unions are strict seniority shops   that is basically the only thing that matters   tenured teachers can be let go without cause essentially only for budget reasons   districts schools will identify which grade level for elementary or what program subject the reduction in staffing will occur   the lowest senior person is let go first regardless of skill or past performance   interestingly if a teacher is certified to teach in more than 1 subject area this can also cause chaos   if that same teacher is the one who is reduced from a given department and they have higher seniority than the department where they also have certification they will bump that other teacher thus taking their job   let 's say you have a teacher who is certified in science and math in the high school setting   they are number 90 out of 200 on the seniority list   this teacher may have been teaching science for 10 years but the other teachers in that department are all higher on the seniority list   the lowest senior teacher in the math department is number 100 out of 200   if the district identifies that a reduction of 1 science teacher is necessary that teacher gets to bump the math teacher out of the job thus getting laid off so that they can fill the math slot even though they have n't taught math in over 10 years     while not in all cases often the teachers union negotiators set the stage for these type of layoffs   usually districts have only so many resources to go around   their funding is set for them by the state and any local operating levy needs to be voted into place which can be difficult   also recognize that the teachers at the table in the negotiating session are the more senior teachers in the district since they have been around longer and are much less likely to lose their jobs due to staff reductions   if the teachers union negotiates a raise that is higher than the district can support with the same number of teachers the number of teachers must be reduced   if you think the negotiators are there for all the teachers you are wrong   one of the teachers i negotiated with once said the following we would rather a higher compensation package at the expense of teacher reductions   the system is designed to defend teacher compensation and provide job security as the first priority not to provide the best education for our kids   as with this teacher they are losing a great asset because an outdated and terrible system was being upheld

in almost any jurisdiction the restaurant will pay tax on the amount after the discount discounting is just a selective way to reduce prices for particular clients and thus achieve some degree of price discrimination it 's no different in principle to cutting prices for everyone or having a sale or similar it would be very strange for a tax jurisdiction to work any other way because businesses would end up being taxed on money they never actually got while tax systems often have that kind of anomaly in rare cases at the edge of the system discounting via vouchers is extremely common for example here are the rules in the uk

i think also by insurance from other the risk gets spread around and these guys actually know what they are doing i 've heard insurers sometimes do n't using really rough thumb rules like buy 2 cats and end up with suboptimal reinsurance policies but they always make sure they are covered the have a better idea of what the risk is and can outsmart the insurers when they sell the reinsurance policies    expanding on the 2 cat thing insurers need to keep enough reserves + reinsurance to cover everything the gist is if they buy 2 catastrophe insurance then the will cover losses over 2 of the portfolio so the insurers only need to cover the first 2 of their portfolio it might be a bit more complicated than this of course   they might be better keeping higher reserves than 2 self insuring more buying less re insurance or they might be better keeping less than 2 reserves and self insuring less buying more re insurance it depends on the price they negotiate with the re insurer whatever the case they have to make sure that they can cover any disaster and the government will regulate this or end up getting pressured to fund bail outs as insurers go bankrupt and home owners are left with nothing

the following is based on my experian credit scoring feedback and experience here in the uk over many years   and for further information i currently hold a credit score of 999 the highest possible with 6 credit cards   now i 'm assuming that while there may be some differences in particulars in your case due to the difference in locality nevertheless the below should hopefully provide some broad guidelines and reasonable conclusion in your situation having a large number of active credit accounts may be seen as a negative   however having a large number of settled accounts should on the contrary have a positive effect on your score   as you keep your accounts mostly settled i think having another card will not be to your detriment and should in time be beneficial a large total credit balance outstanding may count against you   but see the next point    having your total outstanding debt on all credit accounts be a smaller proportion of your total available credit counts in your favour   this means having more cards for the same amount of credit in use is net net in your favour   it also has the effect of making even larger outstanding credit balances as in point 2 to be a lower percentage of your total available credit and consequently will indicate lower risk to lenders    it appears from my experience the higher the highest credit limit on a single card you are issued and are managing responsibly e.g. either paid off or used responsibly the better needless to say any late payments count against you   the best thing to do then is to set up a direct debit for the minimum amount to be paid like clockwork every month   lenders really like consistent payers new credit accounts initially will count against you for a while   but as the accounts age and are managed responsibly or settled they will eventually count in your favour and increase your score making many credit applications in a short space of time may count against you as you may be seen to be credit reliant   conclusion on balance i would say get the other card   your credit score might be slightly lower for a couple of months but eventually it will be to your benefit as per the above     having another card also means more flexibility and more more options if you do end up with a credit balance that you want to finance and pay off over a period as cheaply as possible    in the uk the credit card companies are falling over themselves trying to offer one interest free or 0 balance transfer offers   of course they 're not truly 0 since you typically have to pay a transfer fee of a couple of percent still this can be quite cheap credit much much cheaper than the headline apr rates actually associated with the cards   the catch is that any additional spending on such cards are paid off first and attract interest at the normal rate until paid off   usually also if you miss a payment the interest rate reverts to the normal rate   but these pitfalls are easily avoided pay by direct debit and do n't use card you 've got a special deal on for day to day expenses so having more cards available is then very useful because you then have choice   you can roll expensive debts to the cheapest lender at your disposal for as long as they 'll offer and then simply not use that card for any purchases while paying off the balance as cheaply as possible meanwhile using another card for day to day expenses

i think this advice to carry a balance each month is nonsense   you 're just wasting money that way   personally i have always paid off my credit cards every month for as long as i can remember and my credit score is only 8 points below the max   the bigger factors by far are it might be good advice to charge a small amount each month on your credit cards each month in order to keep seldom used accounts active remember longer payment history is better but there 's no reason not to pay off the balance to avoid the interest charges   in short the ideal balance to carry month to month on a credit card is zero

i am not sure about transferwise and how they work but generally when i had to transfer money across countries i ended up using a foreign currency transfer company who needed the destination account details i.e. a gbp account in the uk in your case and money from the source account basically that means your father would need to open an eur account probably in an eu country is this an option but may be in the uk is fine too depending on transfer fees and a gbp account in the uk perhaps see if there is a better business account than hsbc around i have used them as well as santander before the only fx transaction done in this straightforward set up is the one performed by the specialised company there are a few and their spread difference between interbank i.e. official and your price is likely to be around 1.0 1.5 the other expenses are transfer fees to the fx company account say a flat fee of $ 25 for the swift payment the full amount less the spread above then goes to your uk gbp account there are still the running costs of both eur and gbp accounts of course but here the advice would be just to shop around for offers free banking periods etc point being given the saving in fx conversion it might still be a better overall deal than just letting hsbc deal with it all

you are at the point that many millions of people are at and where i used to be you have no idea where your money is going you just spend spend spend until there 's nothing left and/or you borrow more to keep going   there are general rules of thumb on how much house and car you can afford but there is a great deal of personal variation housing and utility costs vary greatly from location to location city dwellers can use public transit instead of buying and maintaining a car how much other debt do you have that you need to pay off do you have expenses that are not common e.g. medical bills a more personal approach would be to figure out your own budget the first step is creating a written budget figure out how much you can spend in total i.e. your take home pay and the start allocating that money to expenses until you run out i started by looking backwards   look back at how much you spent on each category each month list them in order of priority e.g. food health housing utilities transportation entertainment everything else if the money runs out you either stop spending or reduce spending in another category e.g. can you cook a few extra meals at home instead of going out can you take lunch to work instead of a drive through the amount you have left over now indicates how much more house and car you can afford once you get to a point where you can budget comfortably then you can start looking at saving for retirement and other long term goals this worked for me and highlighted some areas where i overspent because i had good categorized records ironically because i used credit cards which i mostly stopped once i created a budget if you do n't have good records then you have to estimate   how much do you think you spend on food gas etc each month   then set aside that much and once it 's gone do n't spend anymore   now obviously you 're not going to stop eating but the idea is to plan ahead and realize i have only $ 20 left to spend on food this month maybe i should n't go to the movies it takes lots of practice and you wo n't get it right very often if you have enough left over you can set aside some as a cushion in case you do go over your budget but if you want true financial discipline you should start by reducing other categories first this is not easy by any means it will take of practice and trial and error to get to a point that you 're comfortable with the lifestyle that you can afford    so in the end there are only two variables in your equation income and outflow   do you want more house either spend less on other things or increase your income

generally speaking having more institutional investors is a good sign of course there are many types of institutions   normally we are thinking of mutual funds pension funds endowments and hedge funds   they may not all have the same implications   hedge funds in particular are out to make a buck with very little restriction on how they do it   they may buy an undervalued stock and then use their voting power to improve the company or they may do something more questionable like pump up the stock price and then sell at the high causing volatility   the people you are referring to may be thinking of something like the latter those concerns are generally small when compared with the known positives of institutional ownership

auto correlation is a statistical concept for measuring repeating patterns in series   in stocks it is of particular interest as if future prices can be reliably guessed from past prices a lot of money could be made    note even in cases where auto correlations are high and persistent near 1 there is still some possibility that the next time period would be down even if the previous period was up   now the important part here is that high and persistent auto correlation also means once the price falls the next period the price is also more likely to fall once one period was down the next period is more likely to be down so the price does not need to go to infinity   instead it generally would display up and down trends now the key word above for investing is persistence for stocks auto correlations are at best persistent at reasonable time scales   so even if a stock was highly auto correlated during a previous period it is tough to make consistent money off of trading on these past trending patterns   this does not mean some people do n't try

yikes not always is this the case for example you purchased a new car with an interest rate of 5 even higher why pay that much interest throughout the loan sometimes trading in the vehicle at a lower rate will get you a lower or sometimes the same payment even with an upgraded newer safer technology design the trade off when going from new to new the car may depreciate faster than what you would save from the interest savings on a new loan sometimes the tactics used to get you back to the dealership could be a little harsh but if you do your research long before you inquire you may come out on the winning end look at what you 're paying in interest and consider it a re finance of your car but taking advantage of the manufacturer 's low apr special to off set the costs

first accept the fact that you are not going to be able to predict the ups and downs of the market well enough for that to be a viable strategy in the long run these schemes tend to be losers because it forces you to guess correctly twice when to get out when to get back in and missing either date can cost you a better strategy to benefit from market volatility

and i was being facetious apologies    i think your assertion that the   gt entire crux of the story was that credit ratings agencies were n't transparent   is a massive simplification of what happened there are many great analyses of the crisis and most of them come to the conclusion that it was a perfect storm of different factors   i gather you think the problem was regulatory i think the problem is systemic    to me it does n't matter how the regulations are written what matters are the incentives i see no evidence that the regulatory agencies in the us can effectively police let alone effectively deter financial institutions from the laws in fact i think wall street runs on such a of grey area regulations that without wholesale root and branch reform e.g. antitrust laws similar to standard oil to be used on the big banks there 's no hope that any of regulations well intentioned as they may be from making a difference    cdos are a great example of what to avoid

whatever you do you need to be saving a lot more to have a good chance at retirement at a reasonable age with a combined salary of $ 150,000 i 'd recommend in total that 's $ in tax advantaged accounts plus whatever you put into taxable accounts your $ 150,000 yearly income less $ in savings is still an income of $ 60,000 people live comfortably and raise families on a lot less consider how fortunate you are you could retire in 10 years if you wanted by increasing your savings and decreasing your expenses seriously i 'm speaking from first hand experience if you stay on your present course saving $ at a 7 real return you 'll need about 37 years to accumulate $ in today 's dollars which is enough to even if those student loans are forgiven that only knocks off about 2 years if you are in your late 30s now there 's a decent chance you 'll be dead before you retire as for buying a house or not this depends a lot on your personal circumstance and how the rental market in your city compares in your decision do n't forget to consider renting is not necessarily throwing money away any more than buying a house is if you take out a mortgage you 'll be throwing away a lot of money anyway look for a loan amortization calculator to see how much goes to interest versus principal for a $ 500,000 loan at a 3.5 rate you will be paying approximately $ 1400 per month in interest versus only $ 800 towards the principal when you deduct insurance taxes maintenance etc from that $ 800 you may find you are still throwing away most of your monthly payment on interest and expenses you would n't have if you rented the money you do save after interest and expenses is n't really saved housing markets go up and down but on average over the long term they go up just enough to keep up with inflation meaning a 0 real return if renting means less cash out of pocket per month you can put that extra cash towards investments that yield a much higher return sure you may need to continue making rental payments in perpetuity but you can save enough extra money to pay for the rental in investment income again it depends considerably on how the housing and rental markets compare where you live popular cities san francisco new york paris etc tend to favor renting unpopular cities detroit st. louis and rural areas tend to favor buying further reading mr. money mustache rent vs. buy if you have to ask you should probably rent

for a time period as short as a matter of months commercial paper or bonds about to mature are the highest returning investments as defined by benjamin graham   an investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return operations not meeting these requirements are speculative there are no well known methods that can be applied to cryptocurrencies or forex for such short time periods to promise safety of principal the problem is that with $ 1,500 it will be impossible to buy any worthy credit directly and hold to maturity besides the need for liquidity eats up the return risk adjusted   the only alternative is a bond etf which has a high probability of getting crushed as interest rates continue to rise so that fails the above criteria the only alternative for investment now is a short term deposit with a bank for speculation anything goes the best strategy is to take the money and continue to build up a financial structure saving for risk adjusted and time discounted future annual cash flows   after the average unemployment cycle is funded approximately six or so years then long term investments should be accumulated internationally diversified equities

bartering is a tricky discussion yes it definitely applies when you are self employed and do a job that you would charge anyone else for but what if you are helping a friend in your spare time if you receive something in exchange the value of the item you received would be your income but what if you do n't receive anything in exchange if the company bought a computer that they loan to you to do occasional work for them there 's no reason you could n't take the computer home and have that company retain ownership of the property they could still expense the depreciation of the computer without giving it to you if it were a car though you would have to count mileage for personal use as income what if you exchange occasional tech support for the use of an empty desk and internet connection as long as they are n't renting desks for money to others there 's probably no additional marginal cost to them if they allow you to use the space so the fair market value question breaks down

limited price is probably equivalent to the current par value of a limit order markets move fast and if the commodity is seeing some volatility in the buy and sell prices if you place an ordinary buy order you may not get the price you were quoted a limit order tells your broker or whomever or whatever is making the order on your behalf that you will pay no more than x yuan while the market is below that price the trader will attempt to get you the quantity you want but if they ca n't get you your full order for an average price less than the limit the whole thing is rolled back you can set a limit at any price but a limit order of 1 yuan for a pound of sterling silver will likely never be executed as long as the market itself is functioning so you are being provided with a par value that they can guarantee will be executed in the current market prices are probably prices offered to the managers of trust funds a trust is simply a set of securities and/or cash which is placed under the nominal control of a third party who then must in good faith attempt to fulfill the goals of the actual owner of the securities with regards to growth or retention of value trustees almost never speculate with the money they control but when they do move money it 's often a chunk hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars instead of a few thousand dollars here and there so in return for the long term holdings large buys and sells and thus the reduced cost of maintaining a business relationship with the broker the broker may offer better prices to trust fund managers

as for refinancing many institutions charge up front fees when doing any type of vehicle loan typically this is in the neighborhood of 1 the value of the loan with a floor of $ 100 although this may vary by lender however for the loan the be secured by the vehicle the principle value must be less than the collateral value in your case this means there is a collateral shortfall of $ 4,000 when working with a traditional bank you would have two options pay the difference up front reducing the principle value of the loan or obtaining a separate loan for the difference this separate loan would often have a higher interest rate unless you have some other form of collateral to secure it with i doubt carmax would do a separate loan all that being said if you plan on selling the vehicle within the next months do n't bother refinancing it wo n't be worth the hassle

bargaining existed before the government officially granted people that right    collective bargaining is an ambiguous term that could refer to many concepts there is voluntarily agreed to collective bargaining which has nothing wrong with it and then there are laws that force the employer to collectively bargain with a union if a union requests it which is a mandate and violates the employer 's contract liberty   gt;however we 've been through that in this country and child labor unsafe working conditions and 80 hour weeks    i r business to this claim made by another redditor as well   gt;the prevalence of child labor was decreasing long before any law was created prohibiting it child labor is necessary in poor countries because people are far less productive per hour worked as productivity increases parents can afford to send their children off to school instead of working since their own work is enough to support the family   labor is something that needs to disappear on its own in response to changing economic conditions if you introduced a law prohibiting child labor in a poor country like cambodia right now it would lead to widespread hardship and an increase in mortality   gt;in other words no government mandate created due to union pressure can possibly lead to beneficial change since laws that limit people 's economic rights under the assumption that 51 knows what 's better for the minority than they themselves do generally do much more harm than good   nothing good comes for the country from using the threat of violence as all laws do to deny people a right to manage their own property how they see fit   gt;like all laws there is a balance to be struck between individual rights and the common good and what can be seen as a right for one can often be seen as a right to violate another 's rights for someone else   there is no game reason to assume or empirical evidence that suggests that violating people 's property ownership rights leads to a greater betterment of the common good than would have happened with property ownership rights intact   gt;&gt;the mighty is those who use the force of government or the threat of violence e.g. violent strikes to prevent another party from exercising their contract liberty and firing them   gt;this is some pretty extreme hyperbole and hard to take seriously   as history over the last century has shown it 's no hyperbole labor unions backed regulations soft socialism has succeeded in spite of the resistance of employers   membership in this country has dwindled to around 10 down from around 50 during the middle of the century and the erosion of the middle class has been the undeniable result   because unions have destroyed nearly every major industry where they had a natural tendency to form large scale capital intensive manufacturing operations where large numbers of workers were concentrated in one place    in no union dominated industries did unions fade due to greater power by employers vehicle manufacturing low value high volume consumer goods manufacturing ship building passenger rail service us steel in all of these industries the number of unionized employees declined because the industries themselves contracted in the us   the force of government you know we may have the right to strike in this country but there 's no law that says a company ca n't hire replacement workers indefinitely   the force of government prevents companies from refusing to collectively bargain with a labor union   of violence violent strikes this is a straw man if i 've ever seen one who is threatening violence here   this existed before government laws were created that made legal threats on behalf of employees that want to keep unionized employees employed and force companies to collectively bargain with a union   now of course the themselves are not directly threatening violence since they are backed by the force of government   when you look at the wealth disparity in this country it 's pretty hard to argue that the right to collective bargaining has resulted in an unfair advantage for workers   collectively bargaining does n't benefit workers in general it benefits in the short term those workers who are employed and unionized at the expense of long term wage growth and employment opportunities for the unemployed and non unionized employees

here 's a little different perspective i 'm not going to talk about the quality of the investment the expected return or any of the other things you normally talk about when evaluating investments this is about family and the most important thing here is the relationships   what you need to do here is look at the different possible scenarios and figure out how each of these would make you feel only you can evaluate this for example here are some questions to ask yourself i know how i would answer these questions but that would n't help you any but the advice i would give you is assuming you have this money to lose and are also investing elsewhere evaluate this solely on the basis of the effect on your family relationships   the only other piece of advice i would give you is to knock out that student loan and car loan debt as fast as you possibly can minimize your investments until that debt is gone so you can get rid of it even faster

i 've seen target stores with some strange layouts in buildings that they did n't build themselves and those stores have succeeded so i would n't necessarily blame the reuse of existing buildings in and of itself as a factor   my local target is a former ward store and has a somewhat bi level layout because of this especially when compared to two bi level stores that target built themselves in nearby towns   but all three stores are successful   target 's problem with buying out the leases was that they had too large of a store footprint before they were ready to service it   if they had started small with one or two locations and then built up gradually they would have probably been fine working the bugs out on a few stores vs. 100 + stores   a acquisition could have happened later on

the whole point of the envelope system as i understand it is that it makes it easy to see that you are staying within your budget if the envelope still has cash in it then you still have money to spend on that budget category if you did this with a bunch of debit cards you would have to have a way to quickly and easily see the balance on that card for it to work there is no physical envelope to look in if your bank lets you check your balance with a cell phone app i guess that would work but at that point why do you need separate debit cards just create a spreadsheet and update the numbers as you spend the balance the bank shows is always going to be a little bit behind because it takes time for transactions to make it through the system i 've seen on my credit cards that sometimes transactions show up the same day but other times they can take several days or even a week or more so keeping a spreadsheet would be more accurate or at least more timely but all that said i can check my bank balance and my credit card balances on web sites i 've never had a desire to check from a cell phone but at least some banks have such apps my daughter tells me she regularly checks her credit card balance from her cell phone so i do n't see why you could n't do it with off the shelf technology side not not really related to your question i do n't really see the point of the envelope system personally i keep my checkbook electronically using a little accounting app that i wrote myself so it 's customized to my needs i enter fixed bills like insurance premiums and the mortgage payment about a month in advance so i can see that that money is already spoken for and just when it is going out besides that what 's the advantage of saying that you say $ 50 per month for clothes and $ 100 for gas for the car and $ 60 for snacks and if you use up all your gas money this month than you ca n't drive anywhere even though you have money left in the clothes and snack envelopes i mean it makes good sense to say the mortgage payment is due next week so i ca n't spend that money on entertainment i have to keep it to pay the mortgage but i do n't see the point in saying i ca n't buy new shoes because the shoe envelope is empty i 've accumulated $ 5000 in the shampoo account since i went bald and do n't use shampoo any more but that money is off limits for shoes because it 's allocated to shampoo

there are at least three important missing from your equation however they come with some uncertainty as one typically can not tell the future performance appreciation of the rental units value when comparing to the gain of any alternative investment an increasing value of the flat is a gain too increase of rent rents are typically adjusted either on a regular basis or at least when changing with a flat rent over 20 years is therefore way off tax deductions due to capital expenditures i.e. mortgages expenses for the upkeep and maintenance of the property and management and so on obviously those are depending on your local legislation there are multiple other issues to consider of course e.g. vacancy which would not act in your favour

so i 've been actively looking for work in my field education since graduation 2013 with little success but i 'll give it a shot since no one else has yet some tricks i 've picked up along the way with little success mind you   nothing nothing gained if you do n't do the work and begin the process of applying and feeling out their interest for a candidate you wo n't learn how much they are willing to buy your labor for    they have a price in mind before you apply they look at your credentials and determine if you will do the job and exceed expectations based on your status age current position other known facts of your life married kids they all bring and expectations to the table that they may or may not consider or know but can affect yours and their expectations and bring a or dynamic to the table depending on the at hand do you like them and can you see yourself liking to work for them   so what kind of do they want to be most likely they want to be on the bleeding edge if their new and cut away from the flock but realistically they can probably hardly afford to pay for a 's portion of your current position without some heavy backing them who is backing them   so you will need to go in expecting a dollar gained for the company is a dollar given to you hopefully down the road if you take 5 pay cut this year you better be getting a 5 20 increase in the following 5 years based on performance but how do you sell yourself as a facet of the team that achieves these longterm goals how do you fit therefore if you do n't gain this round make sure you have or written of compensation in the future to follow up with when due   on top of this dynamic look at similar advertised recently on various other websites to anchor your asking price aim higher and you 'll hopefully land on the moon if not the stars normally i would go to linkedin to check out the history and glassdoor but not sure that s needed in this case since you know them already and its a newer company with that in mind ask yourself is this a job i would and could see myself eager to be challenged by the next 3 years

i actually have a bit of experience with the supplier side of this having worked with other people attempting to get the business launched i can shed a bit of insight the primary reason for the pricing is that there simply is n't enough competition to warrant dropping the price any lower than it already is large companies such as hallmark will typically buy card designs at 5 of the card 's selling price with their existing distribution network this makes bringing in new and varied designs much easier for large companies that are already well established having talked with such designers in the past someone working full time producing designs makes on average 30 60k annually from this which is worth it to someone who does n't want to jump through the hoops of actually getting into the business independently the primary issue stifling competition is actually getting your product into stores there are topics here that i can not discuss due to nda but i can break down the overall outline for you you need to start with a large number of designs with enough variety that companies think could sell well if you bring a handful of designs with you no company is going to take your business venture seriously enough you need to find a company that can stamp out a large production process for you the company is going to need to be nice enough to take smaller purchase orders on the magnitude of several hundred cards but also be capable of scaling that production to several hundreds of thousands of cards very quickly for cards specifically most companies want you to ship custom racks with your cards some companies may provide their own racks for stocking your product but not all of them will this will also cost a lot of money up front you need to find a buyer for a company you want to sell your product to this is important and what killed our original business plans think wal mart target or even cvs pharmacy these big companies are going to have people who 's entire job is to buy new products to put on their shelves this is where networking is key you need to find people with connections to these buyers if you 're not already well established with them you will also likely fail several times either getting outright ignored or through a broker that ca n't meet expectations for example we had a broker that introduced us to a buyer for a large store chain and after several months of work we found out that this broker was just pulling our strings typically a company will want to test your product in a handful of stores to see if it will sell for example target may want to test your product in 100 200 stores over 3 months and expect your product to sell at a minimum rate finally you need to be able to scale your production suddenly you 'll be asked to go from supplying 100 stores to supplying 1,800 stores with a deadline in 2 weeks buyers will even turn you down at this point if they do n't think you can meet the production all of this work takes at least a year and typically takes several years to go from an initial product to having your product in every store without breaking the numbers down too much we could make a profit of for every $ 3 card that sold that number does n't cover the cost of racks and other overhead that 's just the per card profit even then people are more likely to go view the hallmark or other big name cards over your offering only when another company becomes a big powerhouse to be competitive will these companies be forced to drop their prices

remember that prices refer to discrete events in the market trades it is easily possible that the highest price for a trade in the next period is lower than the highest price in the current one as someone in the current period may be willing to pay more in this period than anyone in the next the ending price of a period is also determined this way it is the last price that someone was willing to pay in this period not the first price that someone will pay in the next period why because the last price in this period is not in the next period by definition edit added something on illiquid stocks illiquid stocks may have intraday gaps in the sequence of candlesticks where no trading occurred below is one such chart for 1 pm a uk based leasing company thanks to yahoo finance for this

the largest problem and source of anxiety ruin for homeowners during the housing market collapse was caused by the inability to refinance many people had bought homes which they were stretched to afford by using variable rate mortgages   these would typically offer a very attractive initial rate with an annual cap on the potential increase of rate   many of these people intended to refinance their variable rate to a fixed rate once terms were more favorable   if their house wo n't appraise for the value needed to obtain a new loan they are stuck in their current contract with potentially unfavorable rates in the later years above prime was not unheard of also many people especially those in areas of high inflation in the housing market used a financial device known as a balloon mortgage which essentially forced you to get a new loan after some number of years 2 5 10 when the entire note became due   some of those loans offered payments less than principal + interest so say you move near los angeles and ca n't afford the $ 1.2 m for the ranch in which you wish to live   you might work out a deal with your mortgage broker banker in which you agree contractually to only pay $ 500/month with a balloon payment of $ 1.4 m due in 5 years which seemed like a good deal since you and everyone else actually expect the house to be worth $ 1.5 m in 5 years this type of thing was done all the time back in the day   now imagine the housing bubble bursts and your $ 1.2 m home is suddenly only valued at perhaps $ 750k   you still owe $ 1.4 m sometime in the next several years maybe very soon depending on timing and can only get approved financing for the current $ 750k value so you 're basically anticipating becoming homeless and bankrupt within the same year that is a source of much anxiety about being upside down on a loan see this question for an unfortunate example

kid you need to start thinking in thresholds there are several monetary thresholds that separate your class from a more well funded class 1 you can not use margin with less than $ 2000 dollars brokers require that you have at least $ 2000 before they will lend to you 2 in 2010 congress banned under 21 year olds from getting access to credit unless they get cosigned this means that even if you have $ 2000 no broker will give you margin unless you have a good credit history already there was a good reason for this but its based on the assumption that everyone is stupid not the assumption that some people are objective thinkers 3 the brokers that will open an account for you have high commissions the commissions are so high that it will destroy any capital gains you may make with your $ 1000 for the most part 4 the pattern day trader rule you can not employ sophisticated risk management while being subject to the pattern day trader rule it basically limits you from trading 3 times a day its more complicated than that read it yourself if you have less than $ 25,000 in one account 5 non trade or stock related investments buy municipal or treasury bonds they will give you more than a savings account would and are tax free this is n't exactly what i would call liquid though ie if you wanted to access your money to invest in something else on a whim 6 what are you studying if its anything technical then you might get a good idea that you could risk your money on to create value but i would stick to high growth stocks before blowing your $ 1000 on an idea that s not exactly what i would call access to capital 7 arbitrage lets say you know a friend that buys the trendy collectors shoes at discount and sells them for a profit he might do this with one $ 200 pair of tennis shoes and then use the $ 60 profit different to go buy video games for himself if he wanted to scale up he could n't because he never has more than $ 200 to play with in comparison you could do 5 pairs $ 200 x 5 and immediately have a larger operation than him making a larger profit $ 60 x 5 = $ 300 now you have $ 1300 and could do it again with 6 pairs to make an even great er profit not because you are better or worked at it but solely because you have more capital to start with keep an eye out for arbitrage opportunities usually there is a good reason they exist if you notice it the market is too small and illiquid to scale up with or the entire market will be saturated the next day efficient market theory learn about it 8) take everything i just taught you and make a small investor newsletter website with subscribers online sites have low overhead costs

may result in more taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable    account when the fund manager decides to sell shares of a stock and those shares have grown in value that growth is a capital gain if that fund is part of a taxable account then the investors in the fund will have to declare that income gain on their tax forms that could require the investors to have to pay taxes on those gains   of course if the investors are holding the fund shares in a ira or 401 k then there are no taxes due in the near term a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction    costs   these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating    expenses or in the previous expense examples reduce the fund ’s    performance the annual fund operating expenses are the expenses that they can assume will happen every year they include salaries the cost of producing statements paperwork required by the government research it does n't include transaction costs which they ca n't estimate what they will be in advance if the fund invests in a particular segment of the market and there is a disruption in that segment they may need to make many new investments if on the other hand last year they made great choices the turnover may be small this year during the most recent fiscal year the fund ’s portfolio turnover rate    was 3 of the average value of its portfolio that may be your best indicator

if you 're looking for a purely financial answer ignoring the social environmental aspects there are a few different ways you can look at it for these types of improvements the simplest is a payback calculation   how long would it take you to recoup the initial costs    for example if the entire installation cost $ 5,000 including any tax credits and you save $ 100 per month i 'm making both numbers up you 'll pay back your investment in 50 months or about 4 years    note that if you borrow money to do the improvement then your payback period is longer because you 're reducing the amount that you 're saving each month by paying interest if you 're deciding between different uses for the money like investing or paying down other debt then you can look at the return that you 're getting   using the same example you are spending $ 5,000 and getting $ 100 per month back for a 24 annual return $ 1,200 $ 5,000 which is better than you can get on almost anything but a 401(k match meaning do n't stop your 401(k contributions to do this either the decision on whether or wait or not then becomes will the price drop faster than the amount of savings you will realize   so if you will save $ 100 per month in your electric bill is the price of the complete installation going down by more than $ 100 each month   if not you 'd be better off buying now and start paying back the investment sooner

if they directly paid for your education it is possible that it would n't count as taxable income to you according to the irs depending on the amount if you receive educational assistance benefits from your employer    under an educational assistance program you can exclude up to $    of those benefits each year this means your employer should not    include those benefits with your wages tips and other compensation    shown in box 1 of your form w-2 this also means that you do not have    to include the benefits on your income tax return source however your situation is a bit trickier since they are sort of retroactively paying for your education i 'd think the answer is maybe and you should consult a tax professional since it is a gray area   update on further research i 'm going to downgrade that maybe to probably not but hopefully soon the reason i am doing so is that there is a bill in congress specifically to allow what you are asking which presumes that you currently ca n't do this   the bill is hr bill the student loan employment benefits act of 2013 sponsored by rep steve israel d it has co sponsors from both parties so that is promising for it 's passage i suppose however it appears to be still early in the legislative process if this issue is near dear to your heart maybe you should call your congressman summary of the bill from student loan employment benefits act of 2013 the internal    revenue code to exclude from the gross income of an employee amounts    paid by an employer under a student loan payment assistance program    limits the amount of such exclusion to $ 5,000 in a taxable year requires an employer student loan payment assistance program to be a    separate written plan of an employer to provide employees with student    loan payment assistance   defines student loan payment assistance as    the payment of principal or interest on any indebtedness incurred by    an employee solely to pay qualified higher education expenses which    are paid or incurred within a reasonable time before or after such    indebtedness was incurred and are attributable to education furnished    during a period in which such employee was a student eligible for    federal financial assistance

i think a lot of people do not understand corporations people talk about the 99 and the 1 but expanding that out it comes down to investors i 'm an investor personally the job of the company is to make as much money as possible to make my investment as valuable as possible also as stated in the article   this move could be sparked by the desire to not pay double tax both american and canadian regardless of what moving their tax money does long term the company is acting with the investors 's interests pure and simple

yeah because paying millions a year in taxes is somehow less than than paying the nothing the poor pay this constant belief that services should cost a percentage instead of a fixed rate that everyone pays is a joke there is nothing equal about going into a mcdonalds lining everyone up based on income then making one guy pay for everyone else because he was more successful then calling it equal or fair which it is n't

use international transfer i think it is called swift or something like that the charges are generally low fixed charge of around 15 euros for both sending receiving banks and it is generally fast takes 1 3 working days depending on the country or bank choose each bank pays its own costs for the optimal cost otherwise you pay more costs as the whole cost is taken beforehand there are no capital restrictions in turkey yet so there should n't be any problems   you could also use hsbc in turkey which should have free transfers between hsbc in different countries if you have hsbc in your home country but i would n't worry about that too much this is all coming from personal experiences i 'm a turkish expat having lived in various countries around europe

while nothing is guaranteed any stock market or country could collapse tomorrow if you have a fairly long window 15 + years is certainly long etfs are likely to earn you well above inflation   looking at long term etfs you typically see close to 10 annual growth over almost any ten year period in the us and while i do n't know european indexes they 're probably well above inflation at least the downside of etfs is that your money is somewhat less liquid than in a savings account and any given year you might not earn anything you easily could lose money in a particular year   as such you should n't have money in etfs that you expect to use in the next few months or year or even a few years perhaps but as long as you 're willing to play the long game ie invest in etf do n't touch it for 15 years except to reinvest the dividends as long as you go with someone like vanguard and use a very low expense ratio fund mine are 0.06 and 0.10 i believe you are likely in the long term to come out ahead   you can diversify your holdings hold 10 to 20 in bond funds for example if you 're concerned about risk look at how some of the target retirement funds allocate their investments to see how diversification can work target retirement funds assume high risk tolerance far out and then as the age grows the risk tolerance drops do n't invest in them but it can be a good example of how to do it    all of this does require a tolerance of risk though and you have to be able to not touch your funds even if they go down studies have repeatedly shown that trying to time the market is a net loss for most people and the best thing you can do when your diverse investments go down is stay neutral talking about large funds here and not individual stocks i think this answers 3 and 4    for 1 share price and quantity matter assuming no splits   this depends somewhat on the fund but at minimum funds must dividend to you what they receive as dividends   there are dividend focused etfs which are an interesting topic in themselves but a regular etf does n't usually have all that large of dividends   for more information investopedia has an article on the subject   note that there are also capital gains distributions which are typically distributed to help offset capital gains taxes that may occur from time to time with an etf   those are n't really returns you may have to hand most or all over to the irs so do n't consider distributions the same way the share price tracks the total net asset value of the fund divided by the number of shares roughly assuming no supply demand split   this should go up as the stocks the etf owns go up overall this is for non dividend etfs more often the larger volatility both up and down for vanguard 's s&p500 etf which you can see here there were about $ 3.50 in dividends over 2014 which works out to about a 2 return $ share price   on the other hand the share price went from around $ at the beginning of 2014 to $ 190 at the end of 2014 for a return of 13    that was during a good year for the market of course there will be years where you get 2 3 in dividends and lose money in 2011 it opened at 116 and closed the year at 115 i do n't have the dividend for that year certainly lower than 3.5 i 'd think but likely nonzero the one caveat here is that you do have stock splits where they cut the price say in half and give you double the shares   that of course is revenue neutral you have the same value the day after the split as before net of market movements all of this is good from a tax point of view by the way changes in price do n't hit you until you sell the stock fund unless the fund has some capital gains while dividends and distributions do   etfs are seen as tax friendly for this reason for 2 vanguard is pretty good about this in the us i would n't necessarily invest monthly but quarterly should n't be a problem   just pay attention to the fees and figure out what the optimal frequency is ie assuming 10 return what is your break even point   you would want to have some liquid assets anyway so allow that liquid amount to rise over the quarter then invest what you do n't immediately see a need to use you can see here vanguard in the us has no fees for buying shares but has a minimum of one share so if you 're buying their s&p500 voo you 'd need to wait until you had $ 200 or so to invest in order to invest additional funds

there are many ways to calculate the return and every way will give you a different results in terms of a percentage value one way to always get something meaningful count the cash you had 977 + 31 and in the end you have which means you have earned dollars but what is your return in terms of percentage one way to look at it is by pretending that it is a fund in which you invest 1 dollar what is the fund worth in the beginning and in the end the tricky part in your example is you injected new capital into the equation initially you invested 977 dollars which later in the second period became worth you then sold off 200 shares for 950 dollars remember your portfolio is still worth split between 950 in cash and 523 in shares so far so good still easy to calculate return 977 -1 = return now you buy share for dollars but you only had 950 in cash we now need to consider 2 scenarios either you or someone else injected 31 dollars into the fund or you actually had the 31 dollars in the fund to begin with if you already had the cash in the fund to begin with your initial investment is and not 977 977 in shares and 31 in cash in the end the value of the fund is which means your return is = 36 consider if the 31 dollars was paid in to the fund by someone other than you you will then need to recalculate how much you each own of the fund just before the injection the fund was worth 950 in cash and in stock 310 200 = 110 x = dollars then 31 dollars are injected bringing the value of the fund up to the ownership of the fund is split with = of the value for the old capital and 2.2 for the new capital if the value of the fund was to change from here you could calculate the return for each investor individually by applying their share of the funds value respective to their investment because the value of the fund has not changed since the last period bullet 3 the return on the original investment is 977 1 = and the return on the new capital is 31 31 = 0 if you and not someone else injected the 31 dollar into the fund you will need to calculate the weight of each share of capital in each period and get the average return for each period to get to a total return in this specific case you will still get return but it gets even more for each time you inject new capital

i gather that while it is not illegal for a merchant to pass their payment card processing fees on to their customers directly in the form of a surcharge doing so is a violation of their merchant agreements with the payment card processor at least for visa mc it 's not has been permissible since 2013 as a result of a class action lawsuit against visa and mc it 's still prohibited by state law in 9 states   if you 're in one of those 9 states you can contact your state attorney general to report it if you 're not you can check to see if the business is complying with the rules set forth by the card brands which include signage at the point of sale a separate line item for the surcharge on the receipt a surcharge that does n't exceed 4 of the transaction etc and if they 're in violation contact the card company however some of those rules seem to matter to the card companies more than others and it 's entirely possible they wo n't do anything in which case there 's nothing you can really do
