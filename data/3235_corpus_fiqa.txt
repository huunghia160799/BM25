i thought this was because credit card companies charge the retailer a fee to accept credit card payments if you spend $ 100 the retailer pays $ 1 or whatever percentage they have negotiated to the credit card provider   handing over $ 100 cash and paying $ 1 fee to visa means a loss to the retailer the same transaction on $ 100 worth of product means the loss is accepted out of the profit margin which the retailer accepts to attract custom

square does not care if you run a $ 10 transaction to test the system they are concerned with its use to move meaningful amounts of money     the only people who do this will be the gang who only think they are clever   because of course square will hunt them down sue garnish and/or prosecute them   but the expense of doing so is all on square making it a total lose   the cheapest resolution is to not let it happen in the first place    the ~3 cash advance fees lack of rewards points and the higher interest rate are not just for profiteering   they reflect and pay for the higher risk of loaning money via cash advance to put it the risk of default    cash advance credit limits are often much lower than purchase limits    if a merchant is selling himself phantom merchandise to get easy cash advances it means he is not using regular ways of borrowing money   perhaps because he ca n't because he has exhausted his other opportunities to borrow risk managers have cut him off   square has no reason to care either way but the issuing bank does and through visa etc they will disallow this behavior      paypal here 's rate used here instead of square 's to simplify math

square charges a 2.75 fee which the merchant pays so you would be losing money if you only got a 1.5 cashback bonus i would guess that the real reason square prohibits you from getting cash is because of visa mc state and federal regulations   visa mc probably prohibit it for regular merchants due primarily to laws that are designed to prevent money laundering certain merchants like casinos are allowed to give you cash advances against a credit card but regular merchants are not allowed to do this it is much more difficult to get visa mc to approve merchants to handle cash advances and they are subject to many additional regulations   services like western union will let you send cash with a regular credit card but they are classified as money and must comply with additional state and federal regulations if square were to allow cash advances this would likely subject them to a bunch of additional regulations   it would cost them more to comply with these regulations and is outside their business model so they simply prohibit it
# 518710
this is most likely protecting square 's relationship with visa mastercard amex etc credit card companies typically charge their customers a much higher interest rate with no grace period on cash advances withdrawals made from an atm using a credit card if you use square to generate something that looks like a merchandise transaction but instead just hand over a wad of banknotes you 're forcing the credit card company to apply their cheaper purchases interest rate on the transaction plus award any applicable cashback etc square would absolutely profit off of this but since it would result in less revenue for the partner credit card companies that would quickly sour the relationship and could even result in them terminating their agreements with square altogether this is the kind of activity they are trying to prevent   1 bill yourself $ 5,000 for merchandise but instead give yourself cash   2 earn 1.5 cashback $ 75   3 use $ of the cash and a $ 75 statement credit to pay your credit card statement   4 pocket the difference   5 repeat note the fees involved probably negate any potential gain shown in this example but i 'm sure with enough creative thinking someone would figure out a way to game the system if it was n't expressly forbidden in the terms of service

there are two answers to this excluding central banks which are really just a banks to private banks   please note   this is an oversimplification and not accounting for the fact that banks operate in both categories now     banks are either depository institutions or financial service transaction providers     depository institutions are your typical retail bank regions boa retail wells fargo retail etc   they accept deposits from account holders and lend out via reserve lending to mortgages and business loans for their revenue generation     financial service transaction providers are better known as   you have your goldman sachs deutsche bank jp morgan morgan stanley etc   these have traditionally been banks that do not accept deposit accounts but revenue generation comes from financial services such as asset management and research or from financial transaction such as market making offering both buy sell quotes in capital markets   this is generally the role that banks have played historically from the medieval ages on they started out as being entities that provided access to connecting buyers and sellers of markets

village are you in the states i am not saying start a car dealership i am saying look for cars that are sold below the value they usually go for this takes a bit of time and effort of looking at each car and seeing what they generally sell for blue book is a decent indicator but do not go solely on that alone go to a car auction and write down each car you can judge each car the mileage and condition and see what it goes for at auction then go to other areas and find other similar cars and see what they are sold for there build up a database of sorts and the cars with the best margins and preferably higher turnover and get those    this is not a business per say it is a way to make money and learn the market for a while once you get a good bit of general knowledge and build up a lot more money then you could likely start a car dealership depending on your area you will likely need a good 50k to get started maybe more depending on insurance and lease agreements

to focus on your question pay it off then trade in the reason is because say you just have 14k laying around and buy a car for 14k you must pay 14k plus tax if you are in one of the states that allows the tax break then trading the 14k valued vehicle in for a 14k vehicle will your sales tax as per your question if you traded the car in at 7k you would then owe 7k plus tax you only have 7k so how would you pay for the tax and why would you want to pay off the car and you 'll have 14k of tax free off any car

luke i 'd like to point out some additional benefits of the roth ira accounts 1 going roth you can effectively increase the amount of your contribution to your ira account in your example you are assuming that your contribution to roth ira is in fact $ 85 $ 100 less $ 15 tax paid in reality albeit more costly roth ira allows you to contribute full $ 100 $ less $ tax incurred using this method you can in fact grow your tax free funds to $ over 30 years the larger you effective tax rate is the larger will be the difference between your maximum effective traditional vs roth ira contribution will be 2 should you need to access your ira funds in case of emergency unqualified event of not buying your first home nor paying for your college education roth ira account contributions can be withdrawn without incurring the 10 penalty charge that would be imposed on your unqualified traditional ira distribution 3 as other contributors noted it 's hard to believe that lower us tax rates would prevail chances are you will be contributing to traditional 401k later throughout your work life having a roth ira account would afford you a tax diversification needed to hedge against possible tax rate hikes coming in the future considering the future of the social security funding and ever growing us national debt can we really expect for there to not be any tax rate increases in the next 20 40 years by the way as others pointed out your effective tax rate will always be lower than your marginal tax bracket

let me provide a general answer that might be helpful to others without addressing those specific stocks dividends are simply corporate payouts made to the shareholders of the company   a company often decides to pay dividends because they have excess cash on hand and choose to return it to shareholders by quarterly payouts instead of stock buy backs or using the money to invest in new projects i 'm not exactly sure what you mean by dividend yield traps   if a company has declared an dividend for the upcoming quarter they will almost always pay   there are exceptions like what happened with bp but these exceptions are rare   just because a company promises to pay a dividend in the approaching quarter does not mean that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future   if the company continues to pay a dividend in the future it may be at a significantly different amount some companies are structured where nearly all of there corporate profits flow through to shareholders via dividends   these companies may have unusually high dividends but this is simply a result of the corporate structure     let me provide a quick example certain etfs that track bonds pay a dividend as a way to pass through interest payments from the underlying bonds back to the shareholder of the etf there is no company that will continue to pay their dividend at the present rate with 100 certainty   even large companies like general electric slashed its dividend during the most recent financial crisis   so to evaluate whether a company will keep paying a dividend you should look at the following update in regards to one the first stock you mentioned this sentence from the companies of yahoo finance explains the unusually dividend the company has elected to be treated as a reit for federal income tax purposes and would not be subject to income tax if it distributes at least 90 of its reit taxable income to its share holders

just like pete for me a simple budget is good my budget is probably more complicated than some but for medical expenses i only have one budget item titled medical   however if you 've already been breaking it out further than that and you are happy with it there is no need to change now   something you can do is to separate your budget categories from your money accounts here 's what i mean let 's say that last year at this time before the fsa you had $ 500 total allocated to your various medical budget categories this year you can do the same the only difference is that $ 300 of that just happens to be in your fsa and $ 200 is in whatever account you kept your medical money in last year then when you have your next medical expense you 'll subtract it from one of your medical budget categories which tells you how much you have left to spend on medical expenses and you 'll also subtract it from whichever account you actually spent the money so you know your current account balances you 'll want to spend your fsa money first since it 's use it or lose it if that seems like a lot of work a good budgeting software program such as ynab everydollar or mvelopes will do most of the accounting for you separating your budget category balances from your bank balances they allow you to split up your money without having to worry about which account you are paying from

here are a few things that you could try but note that they are all capable of failing they will just reduce the chance of you personally having a lost decade first a quibble john bogle advocates a total stock market index something like vanguard 's vtsmx instead of an s&p fund as the latter represents only 85 or so of the us market 's total capitalization smaller companies behave slightly differently than members of the s&p so this might provide a small help bogle also advocates holding some bonds in addition to equities i 'll expand on that below account for dividends just because the value of the index is the same as its value 10 or 20 years ago does n't necessarily mean that decade was lost the companies in the s&p are currently paying out an annualized dividend of about 2 even if the actual value of the index does n't change you 're still getting that 2 per year   include bonds   as i mentioned above bogle recommends holding some bonds i have seen two common rules one is to never have less than 20 of your total holdings in bonds and never have more than 80 of your total holdings in bonds the other popular rule is to hold your age in bonds for example i 'm about 30 so i should keep about 30 of my holdings in bonds regardless of the split rebalance periodically to keep yourself at that split what effect would holding bonds have on a lost decade to make the math easy let 's say you split your holdings evenly between an s&p fund and 10 year treasuries coincidentally 10 year t notes have the same 2 yield as the s&p dividends if you 're getting that on half your holdings and nothing on the other half you 're netting 1 per year not great but not totally lost to illustrate the effect of rebalancing use my example of a 70/30 stock bond split the s&p lost about 50 of its value from its peak to the bottom of the market in early 2008 if you only held stock you would need the market to increase in value by 100 in order for you to recover that value if 30 of your holdings are in bonds and you rebalance at exactly the bottom of the stock market you only need the stock index to increase in value by about 80 from the bottom in order to make you whole again i mention those two to emphasize that your investment return is not just a function of the price of a stock index dollar cost average it 's rare that you will actually face the situation of putting say $ 100,000 into the market all at once let it sit for 10 20 years then take it all out at once the situation you face is closer to putting about $ 1000 into the market every month for 100 months if you do that then you 're getting a different price for each purchase you make your actual return will be a weighted average of the return from each of those purchases but note that this could help or hurt you using the chart victor showed in his answer if your lost decade is from one peak to the next peak your average price will be below the price you would have entered and left at so this helps but if your lost decade is from trough to trough then your average price is higher than the start and end price so this has hurt you those are the two extreme cases and the general case will be somewhere in between and you can use these regular purchases to help you carry out your regular rebalancing foreign equities since you mention the s&p500 specifically i assume that you are in the united states the us equities is approximately 45 of the world equities market so even if the s&p500 has a lost decade it 's unlikely that the rest of the world will also have a lost decade at the same time for comparison the tokyo stock exchange is the third largest in the world behind the us 's nyse and nasdaq the market cap of the tse is less than 20 that of the combined market cap of the nyse and the nasdaq which puts it at about 10 of the world 's market cap when the nikkei had its lost decades no one else had a lost decade note that buying foreign equities is more expensive than buying domestic and it exposes you to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the currencies but the benefit of diversification probably outweighs those downsides and obviously it 's easier to diversify away from japan than it is to diversify away from the united states but there are people who advocate holding exactly the market weight of every country in the world

retirement accounts often can be invested with pretax money with the exception of roth accounts that use post tax and have tax free growth if you follow the rules rather than after tax money as well as provide a shelter so that you are n't having to pay annual taxes on dividends and other possible distributions another point would be to consider how much money you 'd be investing as some funds may have institutional versions that can be much cheaper than others e.g. compare vanguard 's index funds that the 500 index in investor shares admiral shares and institutional forms where the tickers would be vfinx vfiax viiix to consider some companies may have access to the institutional funds that are n't what you 'd have unless you are investing millions of dollars upfront lastly if there is n't an employer plan and you make a ton of cash you may not qualify for a deductible ira or roth ira contribution for something else that may happen if you want to start playing with what if

cart 's answer is basically correct but i 'd like to elaborate a futures contract both the buyer of a contract and the seller of a contract to conduct the underlying transaction settle at the agreed upon future date and price written into the contract aside from settlement the only other way either party can get out of the transaction is to initiate a closing transaction which means   the party that sold the contract buys back another similar contract to close his position   the party that bought the contract can sell the contract on to somebody else whereas an option contract provides the buyer of the option with the choice of completing the transaction   because it 's a choice the buyer can choose to walk away from the transaction if the option exercise price is not attractive relative to the underlying stock price at the date written into the contract   when an option buyer walks away the option is said to have expired however and this is the part i think needs the original seller writer of the option contract does n't have a choice   if a buyer chooses to exercise the option contract the seller wrote the seller is obligated to conduct the transaction   in such a case the seller 's option contract is said to have been assigned   only if the buyer chooses not to exercise does the seller 's obligation go away   before the option expires the option seller can close their position by initiating a closing transaction   but the seller ca n't simply walk away like the option buyer can

a stock exchange is a marketplace where people can bring their goods shares to be traded there are certain rules stock exchange does not own any shares of the companies that are trading in   the list of who owns with stock is with the registrar of each company the electronic shares are held by a financial institution securities depository so even if the exchange itself goes down you still hold the same shares as you had before it went down one would now have to find ways to trade these shares possibly via other stock exchange this leaves the question of transactions which again would be recorded and available think of it similar to ebay what happens when ebay goes bankrupt nothing much all the seller still have their goods with them all the buyers who had purchased good before have it when them so the question remains on goods where the buyer has paid the seller and not yet received shipments

here are the reasons i did not lease my current car when you lease you 're tied in at a monthly payment for 48 months or more the only way to get out of that payment is to transfer the lease or buy out the lease if you buy finance you can always sell the car or trade it in to get out of the payments or you can pay down more of the vehicle to lower the payments most leases calculate the cost of leasing based on the residual value of the vehicle often these values are far lower than the actual worth of the vehicle if you owned it for those months and sold it yourself so when you do the math the lease costs you more with today 's low financing rates

signing bonuses are probably the most variable of all as there is a general understanding that more personal factors are taken into account as a result hr is n't under a huge obligation to explain away the differences in comparison for salary there 's the wide expectation that same job = same pay since there 's so variable but also fairly rare budget is n't a main concern for many hr departments and they certainly wo n't have a finely grained budget breakdown this year we 'll pay $ for $ 50000 for relocation payments $ 100,000 for pension transfers $ for stock option losses it 's generally tossed on one big heap cost of hiring so what can you ask for that 's really a market question what 's your value to the company how much of that is already reflected in salary and other benefits the main downside to signing bonuses is that a company wo n't know how long you 'd stay your value to the company is probably your monthly work therefore they can not amortize that bonus over a fixed amount of months what if you leave after 3 months for that reason a conditional signing bonus is a reasonable offer from your side e.g. ask for one month salary conditional on you staying for 24 months and otherwise you 'll repay them from your last salary

i dunno the problem with a great depression taking place today is that we 're all interconnected    despite the massive debt burdens amp imf knocking on doors things are not as tough as they could be most of us will not starve to death and have a roof over our heads be looked after when sick and can afford basics which were once considered luxuries i.e. tv internet microwave etc   yet that 's the kind of picture you paint when you mention the great depression walking around barefoot worrying about where the next meal will come from it 's at best and it allows the people with cash to demand higher interest payback so it 's in their best interests to keep the shit out of doom amp gloom news   it 's all getting a bit see through imo and people are beginning to question whether the markets and bondholders are real people or whether they 're some make believe god

there is no relationship between the government appraisal and the mortgage appraisal   the loan appraisal is done by a lender to determine if the property value is in agreement with the loan amount the government appraisal is done to determine how much to charge you in taxes they use the values of residences and commercial property to get their operating budget each year they also set the rate to generate the amount of income money they need if they cut all appraisals in half they would just double the rate in some jurisdictions the government appraises every year in other places every three years some only when the property is sold in some jurisdictions the maximum increase or decrease in government appraisal is set by law but then they reset after the house is sold that being said use this time to review the appraisal from the government they may have facts wrong they may think you have a pool or more bedrooms or a garage when you do n't some jurisdictions use an automated process others do a more detailed individual process if there was a mistake ten years ago with the description it will never get caught unless you complain   check with the website for how to appeal some have windows of opportunity for an appeal

depending on the improvement you have to amortize or depreciate it over time which effectively allows you to write off the value over a period of years even if you pay for it all up front this messes with cash flow which is different than profitability but when you span the write off over five or ten years the distinction between cash flow and profitability for a private self funded company is irrelevant if the money ai n't there the money ai n't there operating capital is life blood   taxes also alter the roi equation of the investment since you do n't keep all the money you put in   way over simplified example lets say i close out the year with some arbitrary profit ten million bucks in my war chest 3.5 could go to taxes i also know that my supplier ca n't handle my volume for next year while the season is hot so i 'd like to buy inventory in the off season last year i sold 6.5 mill worth of stuff from this supplier but i estimate i could sell 9 10 mill if i did n't have availability problems if i buy 9 10 mill in inventory i ca n't pay taxes if i pay taxes i ca n't buy enough to grow next year    sure cogs is a deductible expense but the expense is n't realized until the inventory is sold which wo n't be until long after these taxes are due   i now have taxes interfering with my expansion even though eventually i can write that off   now lets look at the manufacturer sure he could expand his capacity and make more money but he has to deduct the 5 mill machine he needs over twenty years or ten or whatever while the purchase price needs to be made today this year he 's gon na pay tax on 90 or 95 of the money he used to buy that machine which would eat into the money he needs to buy raw materials to fill orders he already has   of course the real world is much more complicated and you can leverage leasing agreements and purchasing terms to alleviate this to some extent but i wanted to illustrate a point i hope my extremely simplified example communicated what i mean   does that make sense

let 's talk interest rates on your junk bonds even after all that the us has been through and is still going through the united states dollar is widely regarded as one of the safest safe havens for your money as such it serves as a de facto baseline against which all other investments can be measured the bar everyone has to pass if you could earn 4 on a 5-year us treasury bond or earn 4 on anything else over the next 5 years you pick the treasury bond in many ways this means that the interest rate on a treasury bond is the closest single measure we have to the price of money all by itself if someone is loaning you money they could be loaning it to the treasury instead they are losing out by making this loan to you and must charge you at least this rate just to break even but most people governments countries are n't as credit worthy as the us treasury a few are the us treasury is n't magical after all just really good at what it does but generally they are not there is a possibility when loaning money to these entities that you will not get your money back that is risk all entities have some risk even the us treasury and some have more than others junk bonds have a somewhat elevated level of this risk now you do n't just take a risk on for free unless you 're being charitable or something but i hope you can find better beneficiaries of charity than the average junk bond you need to be compensated for that risk lenders will demand compensation commensurate with that risk or they will just walk away without making any loans or buying any bonds because it 's not worth it the difference between the interest rate on a us treasury bond and the interest rate on another bond such as a junk bond is the risk premium the cost of carrying that risk therefore you can see that the interest rate on a junk bond is the price of money plus the risk premium now the federal reserve adjusts the price of money from time to time by buying and selling us treasury bonds until the price is something they like this means that one component of interest rate on a junk bond is the interest rate on the us treasury bond and it is effectively controlled by the federal reserve through that layer of the other component of the interest rate on a junk bond is the risk premium it 's not generally possible to know in advance whether or not some company will actually default people have to guess and decide how comfortable they are taking that risk this means that risk is more expensive and interest rates are higher when they think the companies in question are going through some hard times and risk will also be more expensive when people decide that they ca n't take as many risks perhaps they 've already lost some money and need to take additional steps to protect the rest it 's definitely very hard for an individual to decide what the risk on a particular bond is the good news is that you generally do n't have to there are a bunch of rich jerks hedge funds retirement funds insurance companies and other investment entities out there who spend all day looking at things like bonds trying to estimate the risk their willingness to exploit minuscule differences between the interest rate on a bond and the real risk means that the average bond on the market will be fairly priced according to what all those people think plenty of them can still be wrong mind you cf mortgage backed securities but in the general case the price of any security reflects all the information everyone in the world has on it on average so if you 're wrong you 're in good company when you buy a nice diversified bond fund you have access to a bunch of bonds at a pretty standard price   so that 's interest rates for you but you asked about prices as it turns out they 're the same thing just expressed slightly differently   one way or another a bond is essentially meant to be a stream of payments worth a certain amount in the end this is why you 'll hear them referred to sometimes as a fixed income security the interest rate is essentially the difference between the price you pay now and the value you receive later except expressed as a rate technically you could structure the bonds differently e.g. does the bond pay little bits of interest as you go along or just pay one big lump sum in the end but you can use math to convert between these two situations and figure out how much money is worth which when so it does n't really matter anyway this means that rising interest rates means lower bond prices on bonds you already own and falling interest rates means higher bond prices so if the federal reserve increases interest rates the face value of your bond funds will fall also if people think that the companies issuing the bonds are too risky the face value of those bonds will also fall you were probably expecting the latter effect though mind you you will still get the same amount of future money out of them as you would otherwise that 's why they 're fixed income securities however a higher interest rate means i can get more money in the future for less money now and so people will be willing to pay you less for your bond in the present this is known as interest rate risk it is higher on longer term bonds because those have more time to earn interest

i think the logic in your example demonstrates it is silly to make a decision for tax benefits alone    saving 75 is much preferred to a cash outflow of 100 less tax savings of 25 to answer your question paying mortgage interest represents the fee for the cheapest money most people will ever access which in itself is a benefit e.g. renting vs buying the benefits are maximized when the aggregate of   appreciation inflation tax savings exceeds total interest expense

this is a speculative question and there 's no correct answer but there are definitely some highly likely outcomes let 's assume that the united states defaults on it 's debt it can be guaranteed that it will lose its aaa rating although we do n't know what it will drop to we know it will be aa or lower   a triple a rating implies that the issuer will never default so it can offer lower rates since there is a guarantee of safety there people will demand a higher yield for the lower perceived security so treasury yield will go up   the us dollar or at least forex rates will almost certainly fall since us treasuries will no longer be a safe haven the dollar will no longer be the safe currency it once was and so the dollar will fall the us stock market and international markets will also have a strong fall because so many institutions financial or otherwise invest in treasuries so when treasuries tumble and the us loses triple a investments will be hurt and the tendency is for investors to overreact so it is almost guaranteed that the market will drop sharply financial stocks and companies that invest in treasuries will be hurt the most a notable exception is nations themselves for example china holds over $ 1 trillion in treasuries and a us default will hurt their value but the yuan will also appreciate with respect to the dollar thus other nations will benefit and be hurt from a us default now many people expect a double dip recession worse than the crisis if the us defaults i count myself a member of this crowd nonetheless we can not say with certainty whether or not there will be another recession or even a depression we can only say that a recession is a strong possibility so basically let 's pray that washington gets its act together and raises the ceiling or else we 're in for bad times and lastly a funny quote i could end the deficit in 5 minutes    you just pass a law that says that    anytime there is a deficit of more    than 3 of gdp all sitting members of    congress are ineligible for       warren buffett

a quick excel calculation tells me that if you are earning a guaranteed post tax return of 12 in a liquid investment then it does n't matter which one you pick according to the following excel formula you would be able to invest now at 12 interest and you could withdraw every month for 24 months   which means that the option and the option are essentially the same this of course is depending on that 12 guaranteed return   where i come from this type of investment is unheard of   if i was sure i 'd still be using the same service two years from now i would choose the payment option you asked in the comments how to change the formula to account for risk in the investment   risk is a hard thing to quantify   however if you are certain that you will be using this service in two years from now you are essentially achieving 13 in a guaranteed return by pre paying your fee   in my experience a 13 guaranteed return is worth taking   trying to achieve any more than that in an investment is simply a gamble that having been said at the amount we are talking about each percent difference in return is only about   the biggest risk here is the fact that you might want to change services before your term is up   if these amounts are relatively small for you then if there is any chance at all that you will want to drop the service before the 2 years is up just pay the monthly fee

i think you may be confused on terminology here financial leverage is debt that you have taken on in order to invest it increases your returns because it allows you to invest with more money than what you actually own   example if a $ 1,000 mutual fund investment returns $ 60 6 then you could also take on $ 1,000 of debt at 3 interest and earn $ 120 from both mutual fund investments paying $ 30 in interest leaving you with a net $ 90 9 of your initial $ 1,000 however if the mutual fund takes a nose dive and loses money you still need to pay the $ 30 interest in this way using financial leverage actually increases your risk it may provide higher returns but you have the risk of losing more than just your initial principle amount in the example above imagine if the mutual fund you owned collapsed and was worth nothing now you would have lost $ 1,000 from the money you invested in the first place and you would also still owe $ 1,000 to the bank the key take away is that no risk and high returns do not go together safe returns right now are hovering around 0 interest rates if you ever feel you have a mix of options that leaves you with no risk and high returns check your math again as an addendum if instead what you plan on doing is investing say 90 of your money in money market type funds and 10 in the stock market then this is a good way to reduce your risk however it also reduces your returns as only a small portion of your portfolio will realize the typically higher gains of the stock market once again being safer with your investments leads to less return that is not necessarily a bad thing in fact investing some part of your portfolio in interest earning low risk investments is often advised 99 is basically the same as 100 however so you almost do n't benefit at all by investing that 1 in the stock market

private companies can serve the campaign donation needs of congress the usps ca n't   that 's the driving force behind privatization in the us raising campaign funds is the one thing congress is good at government agencies are n't allowed to make political donations but they can be replaced with private companies that can replace well paid workers who might donate to democrats with corporate executives who donate to republicans and minimum wage workers who ca n't afford to donate to anyone taxpayers get to pay even more because competition only lowers prices in profitable markets while government provides unprofitable but necessary services   for example the usps is required to provide universal service which is costly but contributes to a better society and a more robust economy fedex and ups do n't want to service rural locations cities and suburbs are more profitable

i know an answer has been accepted but you need an emergency fund ideally enough to cover at least 3 months of after tax basic living expenses as a free 6 months would be even better this is n't a fun way to tie up your money but it is a prudent way what if you lose your job or decide you want to change your line of work what if you 're told a close family member has only months to live and you want to take significant time off unpaid what if your car breaks down and you need a new one what if your freelance business hits a dry patch for a few months what if you want to move but ca n't sell your next house quickly i 've known people who had these types of situations come up unexpectedly some were financially prepared and had the freedom to make the choices they wanted to make others did n't and now have regrets once you have a basic emergency fund in place then go for investing with the rest of the money best of luck

and just as easily someone could find a reason for such a derivative to exist   let 's say i 'm a vendor of for a given sports team but unlike most vendors i 'm only a vendor for a particular team   given that there is a large lead time between orders placed and received perhaps on the order of a month between order and receipt it is inherently risky to order large orders towards the end of a season   however if they 're going to be in the there 's a huge opportunity to sell but if they do n't you 'd be left with tons of surplus inventory   so would n't it be handy for there to be a way to hedge that risk     we 've actually seen times when such things are n't unreasonable   large risks are hedged article even in sports

the key word you forgot to include from slide 29 is free riding investopedia defines free riding as in the context of a brokerage firm a free rider problem refers to a situation where a client has been allowed to purchase shares without actually paying for them and then subsequently sells the shares ideally for profit the problem with this scenario is that the client if allowed to free ride can profit from a stock trade without actually using any of his or her own capital this is illegal i have not heard of any issues with this type of action being a problem with trading accounts in australia nor have i been able to find any such rules on the asx website or any of by brokers websites so i think this may be an issue in the usa but not australia you should check the rules in any other countries you wish to trade in

perhaps in a sense it is useless but likewise the number of people that work for them is irrelevant here as well   what matters is the portion of gdp generated across company size and the means by which some of that is recaptured by the people to a repay for the investment in the economic infrastructure that allowed the companies to make that money in the first place and b invest in future infrastructure that is of benefit to companies ultimately all of which is done for the purposes of betterment of the people of the country   the relevance then is what portion of the gdp is generated by which while size category of business if we just take large versus small and medium enterprise sme with the boundary being 500 employees or fewer and we excluding farming which the stats seem to universally do u.s. gdp is generated by non farm compared to in canada they also appear to employ more than 50 of all private workers   of additional importance is the dynamic effect that is if large companies can grow faster because of lower effective taxation that means will tend to fall further and further behind not out of a fair and open marketplace but because of unfair taxation   generally speaking the reverse is preferred because diversity of competition brings huge value for innovation the same as in crop breeding techniques as well as the poor economic performance of monopolies and oligopolies you want to hinder large companies from becoming too large and instead break them up in to many smaller components hence incentives should work the reverse of the above meaning larger companies should be paying a higher percentage tax than the not to mention the too big to fail problem and all for the good of the people

assuming you are in the usa i would recommend making this a gift   you can gift someone up to per year without paying a gift tax additionally you can gift someone up to but it is a one time deal tied to inheritance tax    you can have a general expectation with the that they will return the money with some interest on some schedule   you can even write that payment schedule down   but for legal tax and personal relationship reasons you should both consider all these payments gifts if you think failure to repay will put a strain on your relationship then you should n't make the loan   if not then the payments in both directions really are gifts as a gift legal documentation can be really minimal really only the has to document anything and that is just on their tax return even then i think it is only necessary if you exceed the annual gift limit i would however recommend documenting any interest rates or payment schedules for personal reasons being a gift these numbers are just guidelines but at least you wo n't find yourself arguing about whether or not the guidelines are being met depending on how large the amounts involved are you might want to spread the load over several people to stay under that annual limit but the limit is per tax year so you could do half now and half in january

did a great job highlighting the primary pros and cons of hsas so i wo n't go into detail there however i did want to point out another pro hsas are or can be easy to manage you said is this a better way to approach health care costs instead of itemizing health care expenses on yearly federal taxes i 'm not sure which company you are looking at establishing your hsa with but with mine i have a debit card that i use when paying for medical care and then at the end of the year i get a 1099-sa that provides the amount of money spent on qualified purchases that calendar year yes there are a few extra boxes i need to fill in for my 1040 come tax time but i do n't need to itemize my healthcare costs over the year it really is pretty simple and straightforward also one con that is worth noting is that you become much more sensitive to healthcare costs due to the high deductible healthcare plan an hsa requires for example in all the years we 've had an hsa we 've not yet met our deductible which means we pay out of pocket for any non routine doctor visits the health insurer pays 100 of routine visits like my wife 's annual well baby check ups for the little one and so on so when you 're feeling really sick and think a doctor 's visit would be warranted you have to make a decision after being faced with this decision a time or two you will start to envy those who have just a $ 20 copay of course that 's just an emotional con each year i run the numbers on how much we spent per year on out of pocket plus premiums and compare it to what it would cost in premiums for an type plan and the hsa plan always comes ahead in part because we are a pretty healthy family and i work for myself so do not get to enjoy group discount rates but i thought it worth mentioning because there are certainly times when i know i need to see a doctor or specialist and i cringe because i know i am going to be slapped with a big bill in the not too distant future

first of all i am sorry for your loss at this time worrying about money is probably the least of your concerns it might be tempting to try to pay off all your debts at once and while that would be satisfying it would be a poor investment of your inheritance when you have debt you have to think about how much that debt is costing you to keep open since you have on your student loan it does not make sense to pay any more than the minimum payments you may want to look into getting a personal loan to pay off your other personal debts the interest rates for a loan will probably be much less than what you are paying currently this will allow you to put a payment plan together that is affordable you can also use your inheritance as collateral for the loan getting a loan will most likely give you a better credit rating as well you may also be tempted to get a brand new sports car but that would also not be a good idea at all you should shop for a vehicle based on your current income and not your savings i believe you can get the same rates for an auto loan for a car up to 3 years old as a brand new car it would be worth your while to shop for a quality used car from a reputable dealer if it is a certified used car you can usually carry the rest of the new car warranty the biggest return on investment you have now is your employer sponsored 401(k account find out how long it takes for you to become fully vested being vested means that you can leave your job and keep all of your employer contributions if possible max out or at least contribute as much as you can afford to that fund to get employee matching you should also stick with your job until you become fully vested the money you have in retirement accounts does you no good when you are young there is a significant penalty for early withdrawal and that age is currently 59 1/2 doing the math it would be around when you would be able to have access to that money you should hold onto a certain amount of your money and keep it in a higher interest rate savings account or a money market account you say that your living situation will change in the next year as well take full advantage of living as cheaply as you can do n't make any unnecessary purchases try to brown bag it to lunch instead of eating out etc save as much as you can and put it into a savings account you can use that money to put a down payment on a house or for the security and first month 's rent try not to spend any money from your savings and try to support yourself as best as you can from your income make a budget for yourself and figure out how much you can spend every month do n't factor in your savings into it your savings should be treated as an emergency fund since you have just completed school and this is your first big job out of college your income will most likely improve with time it might make sense to job hop a few times to find the right position you are much more likely to get a higher salary by changing jobs and employers than you are staying in the same one for your entire career this generally is true even if you are promoted at the by the same employer if you do leave your current job you would lose what your employer contributed if you are not vested even if that happened you would still keep the portion that you contributed

interesting article i know that this might not be a popular opinion here but here goes   it can be argued that the economy was a major goal of the fed in the first place to prevent the unrestrained runs that 1913 1929 saw which resulted in thousands of investors losing everything    its true that jp saved the day before the fed existed but having a government institution do so is an attempt to prevent favoritism from occurring in times of crisis   yes it could be argued that even in this last crisis favoritism existed as firms like lehman and bear were left to die while others were but i think that has more to do with the of those in politics with those in banking     our global banking system relies on the assumption that not every depositor will want to want to withdraw their funds at the same time having a depositor of last resort the fed ensures that even when the population at large panics and withdraws funds the loans that those deposits funded will continue to exist and the broader funding of the businesses that drive the economy will continue    yes the governance is not always perfect and i would agree that on some level the fed 's policies are capable of the economy but by and large i think the institution has been a success as evidenced by the continued functioning of our banking system despite a large swath of the population losing wealth in the housing market

i started out thinking like you but i quickly realised this was a bad approach you are a team are n't you are you equals or is one of you an inferior of lower value i think you 'll generate more shared happiness by acting as a team of equals i 'd pool your resources and share them as equals i 'd open a joint account and pay both your incomes directly into it i 'd pay all household bills from this   if you feel the need have separate personal savings accounts paid into equally from the joint account   major assets should be in joint names this usually means the house in my experience it is a good idea to each have a small amount of individual savings that you jointly agree each can spend without consulting the other even if the other thinks it is a shocking waste of money however spending of joint savings should only be by mutual agreement i would stop worrying about who is bringing in the most income are you planning to your children how much is that worth my advice is to put all this aside stop trying to track who adds what value to the joint venture and make it a partnership of equals where each contributes whatever they can suppose you fell ill and were unable to earn should you wife then retain all her income and keep you in poverty i really believe life is simpler and happier without adding complex and stressful financial issues to the relationship of course everyone is different the main thing is to agree this between the two of you and be open to change and compromise

the is from the merchant   to protect themselves a merchant requires payment before giving you your purchased item service that is why you are charged immediately   when getting a refund the same reason applies the merchant needs to ensure that you are returning the correct item or that it is still good or that you are not trying to defraud the merchant in some way once the merchant processes that refund it is all over for them and they have no recourse later if they find out they were cheated that is why they wait a while the delay gives them time to discover any problems

yes you can do that and it it wise to do so however you should make sure that the general trend of the stock is upwards and you buy during a in the uptrend so basically if the stock is making higher highs and higher lows on the daily or weekly charts then you would want to buy around one of the higher lows before the ex dividend date if the stock is making lower lows and lower highs then it is in a downtrend so never buy in this instance it is better to miss out on a dividend of $ 1 rather than to buy just for this $ 1 dividend and lose $ 5 or more when the price continues to drop further

banks in general will keep saving rates as low as possible especially if there is a surplus of funds or alternative access for funding as in the case of the fed in the usa generally speaking why would bank pay you a high interest rate when they can not generate any income from your money usually we will expect to see a drop in the loan interest rate when their is a surplus of funds so as to encourage investment but if the market is volatile then no banks will allow easy access to money through loans the old traditional policy of lending money without proper security and no control from the central bank has created serious problems for savings account holders when some of these banks went into bankruptcy it is for this reason most countries has modified their financial act to offer more protection to account holders at the moment banks must follow rigid guidelines before a loan can be approved to a customer in my country we have seen the collapse of a few banks which sent a shock wave across the county for those that have savings held at those bank we have also seen unsecured loans having to be written off thus putting serious pressure of those banks so government stepped in a few years ago and amended the act to make it mandatory to have commercial banks follow certain strict guidelines before approving a loan

in the us there are a few different schemes namely regulated and unregulated in regulated states e.g. colorado everything except for some of the generators are owned by one company called a vertically integrated utility and that company is allowed a specific return on its investment rates being set by a formula that includes the utility 's fixed costs the variable amp fuel costs and this return in unregulated markets like texas the generators transmission system load serving entities aka distributors and retailers are all separate although sometimes the same company owns parts at various levels the transmission and load serving entities function like the traditional utilities i described above but can choose their own retailer and the retailers then buy energy from the generators    here is a good video about how the us energy market works   to answer the question i think the answer is actually that in most cases the wires costs for us customers is lower due to the higher density and of the various power systems in the us in the the primary energy market in australia there are significant distances between loads and the larger generators and there are overall fewer customers per mile of line other than that the system both and from a market design standpoint is generally based on the us system specifically   the other big difference is that australia does not have a single grid like the us does us has 3 but is one big grid

the key for you   this year 2015 be aggressive in paying the taxes quarterly so that you do not have to do the quarterly filings or pay penalties for owing too much in taxes in future years   the tax system has a safe harbor provision if you have withheld or sent via the estimated quarterly   taxes an amount equal to 100 of the previous years taxes then you are safe that means that if you end to the irs in 2015 an amount equal to 100 of your 2014 taxes then in april 2016 you can avoid the penalties you should note that the required percentage is 110 for high income individual   because you can never be sure about your side income use your ability to adjust your w-4 to cover your taxes you will know early in 2016 how much you need to cover via withholding so make the adjustments yes the risk is what you over pay but that may be what you need to do to avoid the quarterly filing requirements from irs pub 17 if you owe additional tax for 2014 you may have to pay estimated tax    for 2015 you can use the following general rule as a guide during the year to    see if you will have enough withholding or if you should increase    your withholding or make estimated tax payments   general rule     in    most cases you must pay estimated tax for 2015 if both of the    following apply you expect to owe at least $ 1,000 in tax for 2015 after subtracting your withholding and refundable credits you expect your withholding plus your refundable credits to be less than the smaller of 90 of the tax to be shown on your 2015 tax return or 100 of the tax shown on your 2014 tax return but see special rules for farmers fishermen and higher income taxpayers later your 2014 tax return must cover all 12 months and   estimated tax safe harbor for higher income taxpayers if your 2014    adjusted gross income was more than $ 150,000 $ 75,000 if you are    married filing a separate return you must pay the smaller of 90 of    your expected tax for 2015 or 110 of the tax shown on your 2014    return to avoid an estimated tax penalty

well the one variable you 're forgetting is that we did n't have as much debt hanging over our heads as we do now as i understand it maintaining that conflict cost so much money we 're still paying for it today the better part of a century later are you sure that the federal government should undertake that level of spending again as the fed is poised to raise rates reversing a decades long trend of cheap borrowing   edit typo added sure

i 'm from canada so your going to have to take that into account when reading this as things are done a little differently here     i would n't go the accounting route as it 's going to require more education on top of this i d there is a program that focuses more on the management of finances that would be ideal there are many mid to entry level positions that deal with the flow of cash throughout the company from there you work your ass off and see where it can get you sometimes they go as far as hiring someone with no experience but a certificate and a some educational knowledge will go a long ways in helping you    you probably could if you went to the right sources gain similar knowledge by learning things yourself but it wo n't look nearly as appealing to potential employers hope this helps    also it blows my mind the difference in cost of tuition i spent 12k over 3 finished those kids in montreal have no idea how good they have it

some accounts such as my electric and payments to the tax collector charge a significant enough fee that is counter productive to use a rewards card   one example of this is air   they give you a $ 6 discount if you pay with a debit card which was about 5 of the ticket price anytime you borrow money even as well intentioned and thought out as you plan to do so you are increasing risk   by managing it carefully you can certainly mitigate it   the question becomes does that time spent in management worth the $ i did the costco amex deal for about 12 years earning about $ 300-$400 per year and only once getting hit with a late finance charge   despite the success i opted to end this for a few different reasons   first off people using credit tend to spend more   secondly i felt it was not worth my time in management   thirdly i did not want the risk despite the boasts of many the reality is that few people actually pay off their card each month   by your post it seems to me that you will be one of the rare few   however if you are expending 5 k per month your income must be above the us national average   is $ 600 really worth it perhaps budgeting for christmas would be a better option

if i really understood it you bet that a quote currency stock market anything will rise or fall within a period of time     so what is the relationship with trading i see no trading at all since i do n't buy or sell quotes you are not betting as in betting on the outcome of an horse race where the money of the participants is redistributed to the winners of the bet you are betting on the price movement of a security to do that you have to buy sell the option that will give you the profit or the loss in your case you would be buying or selling an option which is a financial contract that 's trading then since anyone should have the same call when a currency rises and put when it falls how can you know what will be the future rate of exchange of currencies it 's not because the price went up for the last minutes hours days months years that it will continue like that because of that everyone wo n't have the same strategy also not everyone is using currencies to speculate there are firms with real needs that affect the market too like importers and exporters they will use financial products to protect themselves from forex rates not to make profits from them how the brokers websites can make money the broker or bank will either i 'm really afraid to bet because i think that they can bankrupt at any time are my fears correct there is always a probability that a company can go bankrupt but that 's can be very low probability brokers are usually not taking risks and are just being intermediaries in financial transactions but sometime their computer systems have troubles thanks to that they are not likely to go bankrupt you after you buy your option also they are regulated to insure that they are solid last thing if you fear losing money do n't trade if you do trade only play with money you can afford to lose as you are likely to lose some maybe all money in the process

i actually think mcdonald 's tastes fine since my expectations are in line with the price of the meal i do n't expect it to taste as good as a more expensive restaurant 's offerings nor do i expect it to taste as good as a home cooked meal as both have higher costs than mcdonald 's to clarify in the case of home cooked meals the cost is time   at the point at which i have made the decision to grab mcdonald 's for dinner the alternatives were too costly i like many americans am busy and am unable or unwilling to find the time to prepare a proper meal on numerous occasions at other times my decision is different as some days i have more time or more money to go with something better   i do n't think mcdonald 's can really objectively be considered barely qualifying as food as food tastes and health decisions are subjective one decent but not definitive proxy as is often the case with subjective matters is popularity mcdonald 's is very popular while this is n't an argument in and of itself it should remind you that taste in food is indeed a subjective opinion   i just plain do n't understand why so many people despise mcdonald 's it 's a fast food joint that some people like and some who cares i do n't particularly like vegan food but i do n't take pleasure in seeing a vegan restaurant shut down as an aside vegan cookies are delicious   if folks want to talk about say mcdonald 's business practices labor relations or environmental record that 's another story but mcdonald 's tastes like shit type comments typically result in a storm of upvotes that i have trouble understanding   finally it seems to be overlooked that mcdonald 's and many other american fast food companies are different abroad when compared to restaurants at home in america eating mcdonald 's is very much a quick and dirty affair but it widely varies from country to country with from what i can tell american mcdonald 's setting something of a floor as far as mcdonald 's dining experiences go

ok fair enough but you did say a large part of their barrier to entry is government in relation to general industry in defense of your earlier statement that monopolies can rarely exist without one or two things government support or limited geographic area   my contention is that regulation can present a barrier to entry but this is not nearly as large a barrier as size and barriers due to size is the primary reason for monopolies or oligopolies in recent times   if you do n't want to use the aircraft industry as an example let 's use amazon itself amazon is cleaning everyone 's clocks whatever you try and sell if it is available on amazon a smaller player will not be able to compete with them except on the edges their market share continues to increase they own 43 of all us online retail   why does n't someone just start up and compete with them why are n't there 10 12 different competitors to amazon   now clearly amazon got a head start they were among the first to shift into the non specialized internet retail market pets.com only sold pet food whereas amazon now sells everything there is no arguing that they do things very well and have advanced the area of online sales   but they are now without competition and will not have significant competition unless they badly and even then they may not have competition see ebay which now sucks but still has no real competition   when i look at changing sectors in my general geographic area i see massive up sizing coupled with a lack of new entries into the sector i 'll give a few examples   auto dealers i had a relative who owned a dealership in the 70s just one he did ok from it now most of the dealerships are owned by people who own somewhere between 5 and 15 different dealerships    gas stations i had a relative who owned a gas station again just one there were lots of these guys around now most of the gas stations are owned by 2 or 3 conglomerates who own many dozens of stations   banks yes regulation is in play here but there used to be dozens of different banks in my region now there are maybe 2 regional banks and 3 national banks gone are the days when there was one bank that had 2 3 branches even credit unions are consolidating   hardware stores we are down to home depot lowe 's and a regional chain that has 20 30 stores no independent guys   grocery stores my region has exactly two full service grocery store chains plus maybe 2 discount chains when i was a kid there were 10 different regional chains in the area    not the best example but video stores there used to be 10 12 different mom and pop stores which consolidated into two blockbuster hollywood video which got crushed by netflix smart tvs have allowed for there to be more players in the on demand world but the level of skill needed to enter this area can not be more different between the initial mom and pop video store and the world of online content delivery   the list goes on and on consolidation is the name of the game and when a market the average person can no longer enter it as it further the above average person can no longer enter it and when it gets to a certain point no one can enter it that has harmed the economy because people have stopped playing the game because they know they ca n't win they ca n't compete with the big boys   now i do n't know what to do about this but my observation is that this has accelerated in the past 30 years i think that technology has accelerated it but i also think that tax code and lack of anti trust enforcement has also accelerated it i would put my bet on tax code as the 1 culprit tax code has made it attractive for people to try and earn tens of millions of dollars per year there is truth to the conservative claim that if the tax rates are too high people will not work as hard that 's not necessarily a bad thing though markets are driven by demand and at any point in time they have a finite demand a total size if there is $ 15 million worth of demand for hardware in a region that demand can either be satisfied by one massive global corporation or by 15 $ 100k small businesses or by 30 $ 50k small businesses    there can be an advantage to one massive global corporation cheaper prices higher quality but there can also be a downside which is eventually higher prices less innovation and even lower quality plus the downside of the elimination of opportunity for the 30 people who would serve that demand if the massive corporation did not exist opportunities which turned over every so often due to businesses closing due to retirement or even incompetence    i do not think that tax code innovation though because people innovate for passion not for money steve jobs and steve wozniak founded apple when the top tax rate was 70 they did it because they wanted to make computers not because they wanted to make money i think that a high tax rate would stifle the relentless pursuit of more dollars by using existing dollars to consolidate sectors

it 's much more complicated than that but to be extraordinarily brief tech companies and pharma and everyone else off shore the further development of ip etc once it 's going to be successful they then license it back to the us based entity and gin up all manner of tax benefits source i did this for a living   the problem is that the revolutionary product that 's generating billions of dollars was conceived of in the us developed in the us under the benefits of the us economy at large protected by us laws often subsidized by us tax dollars initially driven by us markets and is owned by a us parent company however having used the vehicle to wealth that is the us the company then cuts off the tax revenue to the us that 's suppose to continue to fuel the broader context that gave rise to the benefits in the first place    say what you want about us corporate tax rates this money has been subjected to 0 taxes in most cases and no chance in us tax rates will chance that calculation    this ted talk is worth talks

i do n't understand the op 's desire i 'd love to have a few hundred dollars coming in each month until i really get the hang of things   when growing your wealth so that it will be large enough in retirement to throw off enough profits to live on you must not touch the profits generated along the way   you must reinvest them to earn even more profits   the profits you earn need not show up as cash   most investments also grow in re sale value this growth is called capital gains and is just as more important than cash flows like interest income or dividends     when evaluating investing choices you think of your returns as a percent of your total savings at any time   so expecting $ 100/month equals $ would require a $ 12,000 investment to earn 10%/yr from the sounds of it the op 's principal is not near that amount and an average 10 should not be expected by an investment with reasonable risk i would conclude that there is no free lunch   you need to continually save and add to your principal   you must invest to expect a reasonable return less than 10 and you must reinvest all profits whether cash or capital gains or else start a business which can not be compared to passive investing

below is just a little information on this topic from my small unique book the small stock trader   the most significant non company specific factor affecting stock price is the market sentiment while the most significant company specific factor is the earning power of the company perhaps it would be safe to say that technical analysis is more related to psychology emotions while fundamental analysis is more related to reason that is why it is said that fundamental analysis tells you what to trade and technical analysis tells you when to trade thus many stock traders use technical analysis as a timing tool for their entry and exit points technical analysis is more suitable for short term trading and works best with large caps for stock prices of large caps are more correlated with the general market while small caps are more affected by company specific news and speculation perhaps small stock traders should not waste a lot of time on fundamental analysis avoid the financial position market position and management of the focus companies it is difficult to make wise trading decisions based only on fundamental analysis company specific news accounts for only about 25 percent of stock price fluctuations there are only a few important figures and ratios to look at such as perhaps also furthermore single ratios and figures do not tell much so it is wise to use a few ratios and figures in combination you should look at their trends and also compare them with the company ’s main competitors and the industry average preferably you want to see trend improvements in these above mentioned figures and ratios or at least some stability when the times are tough despite all the exotic names found in technical analysis simply put it is the study of supply and demand for the stock in order to predict and follow the trend many stock traders claim stock price just represents the current supply and demand for that stock and moves to the greater side of the forces of supply and demand   if you focus on a few simple small caps perhaps you should just use the basic principles of technical analysis such as   i have no doubt that there are different ways to make money in the stock market some may succeed purely on the basis of technical analysis some purely due to fundamental analysis and others from a combination of these two like most of the great stock traders have done jesse livermore baruch nicolas william and steven cohen it is just a matter of finding out what best fits your personality   i hope the above little information from my small unique book was a little helpful author of the small stock trader

depending on your local laws such a layoff may be an unlawful act if the whole purpose of the lay off is to strip the employees of their rsu 's the employer may be liable and get sued however you have to check that with a lawyer licensed in your jurisdiction in many places there are no laws against this in any case you may claim that there was no good faith just cause in the action and still sue the employer mere threat of a lawsuit may the whole deal so i suggest the employees to lawyer up and talk to the employer that by the way will require to create a union a representative body for the employees in some places that by itself may be a just cause for termination in some extremely anti union jurisdictions i would guess if there were some they would be in the us bottom line talk to a lawyer

i wonder if these two concepts are compatible or mutually exclusive   the minimum wage should provide a decent living standard above the poverty line we should have as close to zero unemployment as possible   if those two statements are not compatible with each other then i do n't see how prohibiting eligible members of the workforce from an opportunity is at all desirable   yes this would mean that some individuals would be earning less money than it would take to make a decent living but those individuals know who they are we do n't   which means that they have the ability to make choices concerning their lives that we should n't try to anticipate   if minimum wage is not a decent wage for what they need they need to adjust their situation to change that   minimum wage was never intended to be a livable wage only the lowest amount you could pay someone   i would argue that if someone has been stuck earning minimum wage for more than 2 years they 're doing something wrong   either they 're not trying to advance or they 're not looking for a better job

i recognize you are probably somewhere in the middle of various steps here but i 'd start and go through one by one in a disciplined way that helps to cut through the overwhelming torrent of information that 's out there here is my start at a general checklist others can feel free to edit it or add their input how much house would you like to buy in terms of $ $ $ and bedrooms sq ft you can start pretty general here but the idea is to figure out if you can actually afford a brand new 2,500 sq ft house upwards of $ 500 k in your neck of the woods according to or maybe with your current resources you 'll be looking at something like a that is more entry level but still yours some might recommend that this is a good time to talk to any significant others and understand manage expectations my wife usually cares a lot about schools at this stage but i think it 's too early just ballpark whether you 're looking at a $ 500 k house a $ 300 k house or a $ 200 k   how much house can you afford in terms of monthly payments only not considering other costs like utilities yet looking around at calculators like this one from bankrate.com can help you figure this out set the interest rate 5 30-year loan and change the mortgage amount until you have something that is about of what you currently pay in rent each month i 'll get to why to your rent payment later   crap ca n't afford my dream house if you do n't have the down payment to make the numbers work remember that this does n't even include closing costs yet there are other loan options like fha loans that can go as low as about 5 down payment the math would be the same but you replace 0.8 with 0.95   then look at your personal budget come up with general estimates of what you currently bring in and spend each month overall just ballpark it   next figure what you currently spend towards housing in particular whether you are paying for it or your landlord is paying for it someone pays for a lot of different things for housing for now my list would include 1 rent 2 mortgage payment 3 electricity 4 gas 5 sewer 6 water 7 trash 8) other utilities tv internet phone 9 property insurance 10 renter 's insurance and 11 property taxes   i would put it into a table in excel somewhere that has 3 columns the first has the labels the second will have what you spend now and the third will have what you might spend on each one as a homeowner if you pay it now put it in the second column if your landlord pays it right now leave it out as that 's included in your rent payment obviously each cell wo n't be filled in fill in the rest of the third column you wo n't pay rent anymore but you will have a mortgage payment you probably have a good estimate of any electricity bills etc that you currently pay but those may be slightly higher in a house vs. a condo or an apartment as for things like sewer water trash or other community utilities my bet would be that your landlord pays for those if you need a good estimate ask around with some co workers or friends that own their own places they would also be a good resource for property insurance estimates shooting from the hip i would say about $ 100/month based on this website i 'm not affiliated   the real ouch is going to be property tax rates based on the data from this website your county is about 9 of property value so add that into the third column as well   can you really afford a house round 2 now add up the third column and see how that monthly expense amount on housing compares against your current monthly budget if it 's over you do n't have to give up but you should just understand how much your decision to purchase a house will strain your budget also you should use this information to look again at how much house can you afford   now do some more research if you need to get a revised loan amount based on the fha loan decision then use the bankrate calculator to find out what the monthly payment is for a 95 loan against your target price but remember that an fha loan will also carry pmi that is extra on top of your monthly payment or if you need to revise your mortgage payment downwards or upwards change the loan amount accordingly   once you 've got the numbers set look for properties that fit this way you can have a meaningful discussion with yourself or other stakeholders about what you can afford as far as arranging financing a realtor will be able and willing to point you in the right direction for obtaining funding etc and at that point you can just check anything you 're offered by shopping interest rates etc against what the internet has to say   feel free to ask us too it 's hard to give much better direction without more specifics

i am voting you up because this is a legitimate question with a correct possible answer yes you should n't buy penny stocks yes you should n't speculate yes people will be jealous that you have money to burn your question how to maximize expected return there are several definitions of return and the correct one will determine the correct answer for your situation $ 1,000 sounds like disposable income and that you have the human capital to make more income in the future with your productive years so we will not assume you want to take this money and reinvest the remains until you are dead this rules out 2 it sounds like you are the sole beneficiary of this fund and that your value proposition is regardless of asset class and competition to other investment opportunities in other words you are committed to blowing this $ 1,000 and would not consider instead putting the money towards paying down credit card debt or other valuable uses this rules out 3 you are left with 1 expected value now there is already evidence that penny stocks are a losing proposition in fact some people have been successful in setting up email accounts and waiting for penny stock spam then shorting those stocks so to maximize expected return invest 0 of your bankroll but that 's boring let 's ignore it as you have correctly identified the transaction costs are significant $ 14 in tolls on crossing the bridge both ways on a $ 1,000 investment already exceeds the 5-year us bond rate diversification will affect the correlation and overall risk kelly criterion of your portfolio but it has no effect on your expected return   in summary diversification has zero effect on your expected return and is not justified by the cost

as others mentioned i am not sure what you mean by stating that your 401 k was rolled over to a money market account assuming that it was rolled over to an ira account you can roll it over to another ira account with a financial institution of your choice either a brokerage or a bank alternatively you can withdraw these funds but since you are under 59.5 years old you would have to cough up 10 penalty to irs for this unqualified withdrawal therefore i would strongly recommend for you to wait till you reach this eligible age other qualified penalty free withdrawals are purchase of the first home college tuition medical insurance premiums for unemployed individuals disability and medical expenses exceeding 7.5 of your adjusted gross income i would assume that your 401 k was a traditional 401 k account before tax contributions and not roth 401 k so yo would also have to pay taxes upon withdrawing funds whether you do it now or after you are 59.5

of course you can transfer it and it will be legal there 's no taxes on transferring your own money there 's income tax on gains you realized by selling the property but that is money you already owe it does n't matter where the proceeds are it also does n't matter how you acquired the property except for figuring out your basis what matters is that you had gains and these gains are taxable in the us you need to figure out the value of the property when your father bought it and that is your basis the difference between what you sold it for and that basis is your taxable gain and you already owe taxes on that gain

technically this does n't seem like a scam but i do n't think the system is beneficial   they use a lot of half truths to convince you that their product is right for you some of the arguments presented and my thoughts do n't buy term and invest the rest because you ca n't predict how much you 'll earn from the rest    also do n't invest in a 401k because you ca n't predict how much you 'll earn they are correct that you wo n't know exactly how much you 'll have due to stock market but that does n't mean the stock market is a bad place to put your money   investing in a 401k is risky because of the harsh 401k withdrawal rules   yes 401ks have withdrawal rules ca n't typically start before 59.5 must start by 70.5 but those rules do n't hamper my investing style in any way     most term life insurance policies do n't pay out   they are correct again but their conclusions are wrong yes most people do n't die while you have a term insurance policy which is why term life insurance is relatively cheap    but they are n't arguing you do n't need insurance just that you need their insurance which is better you need the guaranteed growth they offer   the chart used to illustrate their guaranteed growth includes non guaranteed dividends    they invest $ 10,000 per year for 36 years and end up with $ 1,000,000    that 's a 5 return   i use 10 for my estimate of stock market performance but let 's say it 's only 8    the same $ 10,000 per year results in over $ 2 million dollars   using 10.5 average return of the s&p 500 over it 's lifetime the result is a staggering $ 3.7 million    so if i 'm looking at $ 3.7 m vs. $ 1 m it costs me $ 2.7 million dollars to give me the same coverage as my term life policy that 's one expensive term life insurance policy my personal favorite blindly following the advice of wall street and financial gurus such as dave ramsey and suze orman got you where you are are you happy with the state of your finances do you still believe their buy term insurance and invest the difference   yes i sure do believe that and i 'm quite well thank you while i do n't think this is a scam it 's outrageously expensive and not a good financial choice

it 's actually quite simple you 're actually confusing two concept which are taking a short position and short selling itself basically when taking a short position is by believing that the stock is going to drop and you sell it you can or not buy it back later depending on the believe it grows again or not so basically you did n't make any profit with the drop in the price 's value but you did n't lose money either   ok but what if you believe the market or specific company is going to drop and you want to profit on it while it 's dropping you ca n't do this by buying stock because you would be going long right so back to the basics to obtain any type of profit i need to buy low and sell high right this is natural for use in long positions well now knowing that you can sell high at the current moment and buy low in the future what do you do you ca n't sell what you do n't have so acquire it ask someone to lend it to you for some time and sell it so selling high check   now buying low you promised the person you would return him his stock as it 's intangible he wo n't even notice it 's a different unit so you buy low and return the lender his stock thus you bought low and sold high meaning having a profit so technically short selling is a type of short position if you have multiple portfolios and lend yourself i.e. maintaining a long term long position while making some money with a short term short term strategy you 're actually short selling with your own stock this happens often in hedge funds where multiple strategies are used and to the transaction costs and borrowing fees they have algorithms that clear match long and short coming in from different traders algorithms etc keep in mind that you while have a opportunities risk associated   so basically yes you need to always borrow a product to be able to short sell it what can happen is that you lend yourself but this only makes sense if

you can certainly borrow from your parents and they can take out a loan under their own names if you can persuade them to do so that really is the best solution i can think of for a loan to a minor assuming that your parents think the trip is important enough to justify the cost and commitment of taking out a loan at all if they do n't they would n't co sign for a loan either other than that i think the simple answer is no you are probably going to have to find some other way to raise the money or delay the trip yes theoretically there are things that can be done with them guaranteeing a loan on your behalf but at your age i do n't know whether you would be considered legally competent to sign that agreement in most jurisdictions and realistically it winds up being no less risky for your parents than the approach i suggested since they 're still on the hook if you ca n't repay in time

standard markowitz 's portfolio optimization takes trend into account not mean reversion otherwise since a portfolio is a linear combination of your individual assets you could 1st model them separately and than establish a second layer criteria for weighting for the 1st layer mean reversion as well as trend of returns can be captured with a model and for the 2nd layer you could use the kelly criterion for instance a more direct approach to mean reversion portfolio selection is working with pairs trading i 'm not linking any materials as those topics are plentiful on the web if that 's still not the answer you 're looking for the problem with predicting economic cycles is that they are long and we hardly have a sufficient measured history to forecast anything reliable in order to predict the mean reversion of a stock or bond market cycle you 've got to measure their long term mean first and there you 'll have disagreements right on the start some researchers see jeremy siegel have tried to measure the long term mean of returns for various asset classes some argue that stocks are the long run winners and that capm explains that but others say that 's just questionable since measurements go just as far as the western countries us uk etc have thrived other countries have much more recent economic records

consolidation makes sense if your friend has his act together and is n't going to run up more debt finding a lender will be tough i 'd suggest trying local credit unions making sure first that there has been no late or missed payments for 6 9 months you need to talk to a human at a local lender who will give you informal guidance about what you need to approve so you do n't end up getting lots of if its more than $ 10k it will be hard to get a loan like this from anyone in that case you need to focus on the smallest debts first because your friend 's cash flow is going to be by making payments to multiple creditors it 's critical to pay all creditors on time for at least the minimum amount due   the problem is once you start paying things down the creditors will start down credit limits when that happens you 're at greater risk for getting with fees and higher minimum payments which may be considered a universal default by other lenders   there is n't alot of detail here but depending on income and the amount of debt your friend should be prepared to file for chapter 13 bankruptcy

one commenter brought up steve jobs i think it 's mandatory and it seems like people forget that apple 's first project was n't new or revolutionary there were other personal computers out there but it was what people wanted people wanted a keyboard wanted an easy to interface display wanted to be able to add on to the system they learned what the customer wanted by showing their early systems to others at the computer meetings and people told them what they wanted   jobs and delivered it nothing new but it was just flat out good

it depends on what you want it for if it is just salary then maybe not for instance some mba programs may suggest their graduates make $ 100,000 per year but you work in an oil field barely finishing high school and make $ 300,000 a year   if you go for the mba right now you may miss your chance to work in the oil industry for another few years or weeks but at the same time the mba lasts forever although real world experience is also relevant and it may give you a leg up when you are 50 years old in the unemployment line or maybe not because you are overqualified everything in life is a cost benefit analysis passing the gre lasts for five years so keep that in mind

you are not missing something basic   putting money in the bank will cost you in terms of purchasing power   the same thing has been true in the us and other places for a long time now   the real interest rate is negative there is too much aggregate wealth being saved compared to the number of profitable lending opportunities   that means any truly risk free investment will not make as much money as you will lose to inflation    if the real interest rate appears to be positive in your home country it means one of the following is happening capital controls or other barriers are preventing foreigners from investing in your home country keeping the interest rate there artificially high expected inflation is not being measured very accurately in your home country inflation is variable and unpredictable in your home country so investors are demanding high interest rates to compensate for inflation risk   in other words bank accounts are not risk free in your home country if you find any securities that are beating inflation you can bet they are taking on risk   investing in risky securities is fine but just understand that it 's not a substitute for a risk free bank account   part of every interest rate is compensation for the time value of money and the rest is compensation for risk   at present the global time value of money is negative

gt will end up over taking instagram and facebook in the next 5 10 years    holy shit lmao i wish there was some way i could bet everything i own against this statement facebook will not be overtaken by any other social media company for the next 10 + years and will never be overtaken by snap inc facebook is actually the smartest long term investment out of everything you mentioned and amazon as well snapchat and gopro are horrible long term holdings gopro will be worth half of what it is worth now in the next 5 years the money you are bragging about is peanuts and irrelevant because you were talking about long term holdings in your first reply and now you are bringing up day trading which is a completely different story yes snap is probably good for some short term gains but i do nt see how you are that into thinking that is good for long term retirement funds   fwiw making money in this climate is easy as fuck it wo nt be like this forever and when the markets begin to crash companies like twitter and snap inc who have no revenue will be the first ones to to nothing i have a 37 annual return since 2009 entered the market a great time and i have no background in investing before that so do nt get a big head about making correct choices in the short term

there will not be enough money to fill the holes that are caused by banks easy money policies combined with the trillions in derivative hedges that the banks have off balance sheet    the idea is that the chain reaction collapse of the european banking system can be avoided by plugging the holes in the dam in spain italy greece portugal and ireland but it is a crazy idea next comes france and then what at some point there is not enough money to plug the holes and the entire facade collapses anyways   adults would dismantle the eurozone now and let each country see to itself let the banks collapse capital in the form of dollars gold etc will reappear and means will evolve rapidly to connect capital with people who need loans for business    consumer loans are going the way of the bird

major things to consider if you 're expecting to look at the property market it might prove to be sensible to start doing it now since the market is just recovering and imho warning not a professional investor just a random guy on the internet prices still has n't caught up with value fundamentals   check out cash isa 's for a 24 36 month timeframe most do a reasonable 3 4 with the current inflation rate being around 4 this will at the very least make sure your money does n't loose it 's purchasing power finally a word of caution have a rather rubbish rates this by itself would n't be much of a problem on a 30 40 years timeframe but keep the current and historically strictly increasing 4 inflation rate in mind this implies the purchasing power of any money tied in these vehicles will   loose it 's purchasing power in a compounding manner hope this helps let me know if you have any questions

4000 miles a year is not a few european average is about 9000 but nevertheless but when it comes to risk then 1 nothing stops you from changing circumstances and drive 10 times as much as in previous the insurance remains the same the only thing the insurance company can do is to charge you more next year taking the miles you 've made this year as a basis for calculations 2 drivers who drive very seldom are a huge risk because of their low experience i know a few people that drive more than 100 miles only a few times a year and on average once a year have accident during that drives it does n't mean that an average sunday driver have similar risk of accident as daily driver but it 's in no way similar   germany switzerland based the whole eu is likely to be the same

if you know when and by how much something will fluctuate you can always make money buy it when it 's cheaper and sell it when it 's more expensive if you just know that it fluctuated a lot recently then you do n't know what it will do next most securities that go to zero or go much higher bounce all over the place for a while first   but you do n't know when they 'll move lower or higher   so how could you figure out if you 'll make money you ca n't know dca will on average make you better off unless the extra commissions are too high relative to your purchase sizes but it will in retrospect make you worse off in many particular cases this is true of many investment disciplines such as rebalancing they are all based on averages   if the volatility is random then on average you can buy more shares when the price is lower using dca but when the lowest price turns out to have been on a certain day you 'd have been better off with a single lump sum put in on that day no way to know in advance   degree of volatility should n't matter any fluctuation is enough for dca or rebalancing to get you ahead though it 's true they get you ahead farther if the fluctuations are larger since there 's then more difference between dca and a lump purchase   i think the real reason to do dca and rebalancing is risk control they reduce the risk of putting a whole lump sum in on exactly the wrong day and they can help keep a portfolio growing even if the market is stagnant

the primary advantage of hfts is their speed to act upon opportunities that exist for only fractions of a second the reason why they are able to do this is because they invest heavily in hardware custom software and custom algorithms   most of the fleeting advantage as they all manage to top each other 's hardware seemingly every other day is from the hardware investment   to see the extremes that hfts will go to invest in hardware one might view this it is highly likely that the trader with the market making algorithm could have been ignorant of the hide not slide order and missed out on many more opportunities while still being successful   who is very much against this order type was not so lucky if it was truly an investment bank then it was unlikely that they were actually front running which is very illegal and easily possible with much more low tech means since companies like citadel handle most orders now and they have not been successful in investment banking the reality of hft is slowly coming to light that while hft can provide extremely consistent returns with enormous sharpe ratios the capital investment is equally enormous and the amount of capital that can be employed is also as enormously limited   after all the richest people on the planet are not hft owners also when it comes to time periods longer than their results become very human

if you enter a futures contract it costs nothing   so every time prices move against you there is a margin call and you must put up some new money inverse etf 's use a variety of similar strategies to get their returns   many of these strategies may indeed require a margin call to the etf issuer if prices move against you   but remember the etf did not cost nothing   investors contributed money in order to purchase each share of the etf   therefore the etf issuer has a big pot of money available for use as margin   that 's why the margin call never comes through to you in a sense you posted a ton of margin up front so you wo n't have to make any additional margin contributions   the money that will be used for margin calls is being kept in treasuries and money market securities by the etf issuer until it 's needed if prices move against you badly enough that it looks like the etf is at risk to not be able to post margin the etf would liquidate and you 'd get whatever pittance was left after they exit all those positions

bit hesitant to put this in an answer as i do n't know if specific investment advice is appropriate but this has grown way too long for a comment the typical answer given for people who do n't have the time experience knowledge or inclination to pick specific stocks to hold should instead invest in etfs exchange traded index funds what these basically do is attempt to simulate a particular market or stock exchange an s&p 500 index fund will generally attempt to hold shares in the stocks that make up that index they only have to follow an index not try to beat it so are called passively managed they have very low expense ratios far below 1 and are considered a good choice for investors who want to hold stock without significant effort or expense and who 's main goal is time in the market it 's a contentious topic but on average an index and therefore an index fund will go even with or outperform most actively managed funds with a sufficiently long investment horizon which you have these may be ideal for you trading in etfs is also typically cheap because they are traded like stock there are plenty of low fee online brokers and virtually all will allow trading in etfs my broker even has a list of several hundred popular etfs that can be traded for free   the golden rule in investing is that you should never buy into something you do n't understand do n't buy individual stock with little information it 's often little more than gambling the same goes for trading platforms like do n't use them unless you know their business model and what they stand to gain from your custom as mentioned i can trade certain funds for free with my broker but i know why they can offer that and how they 're still making money

the key with analyzing financial statements is that you need to look at all angles of a particular item ie sales has gone up but has the cost of sales increased by even more implying narrower margins or interest expense has gone up but is that because new debt was taken on to pay for expansion   in the specific case you mentioned buying assets that will create depreciation expense over time there is a grouping on the cash flow statement called investing which will state the amount of cash used during the year to invest in the business this could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on other factors and your personal preference regarding dividends being paid to shareholders in addition you can see the amount of depreciation expense separately listed on the cash flow statement this tells you many things consider a company with $ 10 m in assets on the balance sheet but $ 2 m in depreciation expense this tells you that in a very loose sense every 5 years the assets owned by the company will all need to be replaced compare that with the investing section of the cash flow statement if they are buying $ 4 m of new assets this year this tells you that on an overall basis they are likely expanding the business because the new investments outpace the depreciation   but is your concern of under reported earnings a common issue typically keep in mind that the most common bias of a company is to over report earnings this is because management compensation in the form of performance bonuses and stock option valuation is increased by profitable years however in a year where a loss poor performance is likely a reverse bias occurs to take as much of a loss as possible in that year this is because if a manager 's bonus is already 0 due to poor company performance having a worse year will not turn the bonus negative so by taking all expenses possible today on the financial statements next year might have less allocated expenses and therefore the manager might get a bigger bonus impact next year this is called taking a big bath   note that public companies must meet certain reporting standards and they are audited by external accounting firms to show that they meet those standards of course there is no guarantee that the auditors will catch all cases of accounting manipulation see enron etc etc

there is only a catch if you swallow the hook   the hook is that the bank hopes you will use the increased credit limit to buy more stuff and not pay what you owe before the interest free period expires   this will allow them to charge their high interest rate on the outstanding balance   now if you do n't increase your spending and keep paying your balance in full nothing happens

i think the discrepancy you are seeing is in the detail of what happens once you pay off your student loan   if you take your monthly payment for your student loan and apply that to your mortgage once the student loan is payed off paying the highest interest loan will out ahead    if on the other hand you take your student loan payment and do something else with it not pay down your mortgage you would be better off paying on your mortgage   say you have $ 1000 to put towards either loan and there is 5 years to pay on the student loan and 25 years to pay on the mortgage   by paying on the student loan you are roughly saving 5 years of 5 interest on that $ 1000   by paying on the mortgage you are saving 25 years of 3 interest

companies theoretically have an infinite number of equity units at their disposal   issuance must be approved according to its founding contracts if an equity is trading on an open market then the price of each unit issued in lieu of cash compensation is known   even if an equity does n't trade openly bidders can be solicited for a possible price or an appraisal   this can be a risky route for the potentially compensated market are frequently generally approximately equal to the sales of a company   salaries and wages are frequently generally two thirds of sales it is indeed expensive for the average company to compensate with equity thus so few do usually restricting equity compensation to executives and exceptional laborers   besides they frequently have enough cash to pay for compensation avoiding transaction costs for companies in growth industries such as technology or medicine their situations are usually reversed cash constrained yet equity abundant because of large investment and dearly priced equities   for a company trading at a market capitalization multiplied by forty times the revenue compensating with equity is inexpensive

presumably the inverse of the advantages you are guaranteed the interest rate that is written on your mortgage commitment as long as the first draw happens before the rate hold expiry date typically 120 days from application date in most cases it takes at least 6 months or more to build a home from the ground up that means that you are taking a chance at what the interest rates and qualifying criteria will be several months down the road you can normally only lock in 120 days prior to possession with a completion mortgage lenders are constantly changing their guidelines and rates are predicted to increase over the coming months that means you are much better to obtain draw mortgage financing to avoid any of these uncertainties you will know that you have your financing in place right away before construction even starts this is a huge peace of mind so you can relax and get ready for the big move so thus if interest rates are lower 6 months or a year from now that 'd be the disadvantage a longer lock in period

the government could actually do either one to expand the money supply as necessary to keep up with rising productivity an increased labor supply   the question is merely political in the case of the us printing money involves convincing politicians to spend it   while we currently run a deficit there is a large lobby within the us who are incredibly anti deficit and are fighting against this for no good reason   if the money supply were left in their hands we would end up with a shrinking money supply and rapid deflation on the other hand the fed can simply bypass the politicians and control the money supply directly by issuing bonds   it 's easier for them they do n't have to explain it to voters only to economists and it gives them more direct control without any messy political considerations like which programs to expand or cut

if you buy a cd through a brokerage the trade confirmation will indicate whether the cds is fdic insured unless you have authorized the broker in writing to exercise discretion in your account meaning they can act in your account without contacting you first they must contact you and discuss the specific investment with you before buying it if they have misled you and the cd is not actually fdic insured you have a right to ask them to reverse the transaction   keep in mind that brokerages are also required to insure the assets in your account which they hold on their balance sheets cash bonds stocks mutual funds but not commodities this is provided by sipc the equivalent of fdic in the brokerage world most large brokerages also insure you beyond the sipc minimum keep in mind unlike fdic you 're not insured against market risk only against a bankruptcy of the brokerage also sipc is funded by the securities industry not by the us government

you should certainly look into investments if you do n't expect to need the money until retirement then i 'd put it in an ira so you get the tax advantages it makes sense to keep some money handy just in case but $ 23k is a very large amount of money for an emergency fund of course much depends on your life situation but i 'm hard pressed to think of an unexpected emergency that would come up that would require $ 23k if you 're seriously planning to go back to school then you might want to put the money in a non retirement fund investment as i write this september 2015 the stock market is falling so if you expect to need the money within the next few months putting it in the stock market may be a mistake but long term the stock market has always gone up so it will almost certainly recover sooner or later the question is just when investing versus paying off debts is a difficult decision what is the interest rate on the debt if it 's more than you 're likely to make on an investment then you should pay off the debt first my broker recently told me that over the last few decades the stock market has averaged 7 annual growth so i 'm using that as my working number if the interest rate is low some people still prefer to pay off the debt because the interest is certain while the return on an investment is uncertain and they 're unwilling to take the risk

if the answer were no you still found the black swan type exception that proves the answer to be yes right my experience is this again just my experience my bank when by balance goes below $ 10 i have the account trigger an email i wrote a check i forgot to register and subtract so the email was sent and the account balance in fact showed negative i transferred to cover the check and the next day there was a history that did n't go negative the evening deposit was credited prior to check clearing   i set up my bills on line i set a transfer in advance for the same dollar amount as a bill that was due e.g. $ 1000 transfer for a $ 1000 bill i woke up to an email and the account showed the bill was paid prior to the transfer so one line showed going and the next line + $ 100 after transfer even though it 's the same online process again the next day the history re ordered to look like i was never negative but even on a day i know i 'm having payments issued i can never just ignore that email   the first time this happened i asked the bank and they said if the negative went until the next day i 'd get an overdraft short balance notice   this is a situation to ask your bank how they handle this

the pros and cons of investing in a closed end fund both stem from the fact that the price per share is likely to differ from the net asset value nav of the underlying assets that could work to your advantage if the fund is selling for less than nav or at a discount then you get the benefit of the bargain and hope to sell the shares in the future for par or even a premium more than nav on the other hand if you buy such a fund at a premium you stand to have a relative loss if the value of the fund goes back to par or a discount compared to nav that 's because a closed end fund has a fixed number of shares with the assets continually being reinvested in essence you are buying out an existing shareholder of the fund at a price determined by supply and demand this differs from an open end fund in which your contribution creates new shares all other things being equal then the fund has to invest your money and charges you a fee for the service on exactly a pro rata basis with other investors in the fund meaning that you will enter and exit such a fund at par in either case your return depends mainly on the performance of the underlying assets but there are premium discount issues for investing in a closed end fund

read about upfront mortgage brokers that site has a bunch of information on mortgages and brokers including mistakes to avoid when shopping for a mortgage you can also find lenders with upfront pricing i 've used it for shopping and you will find very competitive rates i 'm wary of brokers when we sold our house the buyers young first time buyers got screwed by an unscrupulous broker and did n't actually have a loan lined up delayed closing by 2 days while they to find a legit lender who could put together funding the one time we used a broker our first time we got a deal that was n't really as good as it should have been hindsight

you 're trying to mitigate the risk of having your investments wiped out by fraud committed by your broker by using margin loans to buy stock secured by other non cash assets in your account the solution that you are proposing does not make any sense at all you mitigate a very low probability high impact risk by doing something that comes with a high probability medium impact risk   in addition to interest costs holding stocks on margin subjects you to the very real risk of being forced to sell assets at inopportune times to meet margin calls given the volatility that the markets are experiencing in 2011 there is a high risk that some irrational decision in greece could wipe you out if i were worried about this i would if you have enough money that sipc protection limits are an issue you desperately need a financial adviser do not implement any strategy involving margin loans until you talk to a qualified adviser

in usa if you take a personal loan you will probably get rates between 8 19 it is better that you take a loan in india as home loan rates are about is the lowest offered by sbi   this might not be part of the answer but it is safer to hold usd than indian rupees as india is inflating so much that the value of the rupee is always going 1970 when you could buy 1 dollar for 7 rupees there might be price fluctuations where the rupee gains against the dollar but in the long run i think the dollar has much more a personal opinion and since you are taking a home loan i am assuming it will be somewhere between 10 20 years so you would actually save a lot more on the depreciating rupee than you would pay interest yes if you can get a home loan in usa at around 4 it would definitely be worth considering but i doubt they will do that since they would not know the actual value of the property coming to answer your question getting a personal loan for 75k without keeping any security is highly unlikely what you can do since you have a good credit score is get a line of credit for 20 25k as a backup and use that money to pay your emi only when absolutely required that way you build your credit in the united states and have a backup for around 2 years in india in case you fail to pay up moreover line of credits charge you interest only on the amount you use cheers

you must consider the different levels of risk associated with each loan when the bank loans you money it does so based on a high degree of information about your financial situation through your credit report + additional information gathered at the time of granting your request it feels quite confident that you will repay them and therefore considers you to be low risk in order to make a profit off of all its low risk clients the bank only needs to charge a small rate of interest competitive with the market but enough to cover the losses from clients who will default when you loan money through a peer to peer program you are at two distinct disadvantages from the bank 1 your loan portfolio will not be diversified that is you may have only a single person or a small handful of people owing you money any catastrophic event in their lives may wipe out their loan to you whereas the bank can play the averages with a broader client base 2 you have less information and ultimately less effective power to reclaim your losses would you feel confident walking behind the desk at a bank today and deciding whether to approve someone 's loan based on the information that the bank 's back end has already determined is necessary to make that decision now how about when you are doing it on your own because of this you take on more risk from a peer to peer loan than a bank takes on from you that 's why the person is willing or required due to market availability to pay a higher rate they know they are higher risk that does n't mean this is a bad idea just that there is a specific reason that the difference in rates exists and it implies that you should consider carefully whether the risks outweigh the benefits note that the concept of taking a buy sell position on two theoretically identical assets while earning a net profit at no risk is known as arbitrage arbitrage situations rarely exist and never for long whenever you see a position that appears to be arbitrage consider what might make it not so ie you could buy inventory in location a and sell it at 10 higher margin in location b but have you considered transportation carrying costs and interest for the period that you physically held the inventory the appearance of arbitrage may in my opinion be a sign that you have incomplete information

bigco is selling new shares and receives the money from venturo if venturo is offering $ 250k for 25 of the company then the valuation that they are agreeing on is a value of $ 1 m for the company after the new investment is made   if jack is the sole owner of one million shares before the new investment then bigco sells shares to venturo for $ 250k   the new total number of shares of bigco is venturo holds 25 and jack holds 75 the amount that jack originally invested in the company is irrelevant   at the moment of the sale the venturo and jack agree that jack 's stake is worth $ 750k   the value of jack 's stake may have gone up but he owes no capital gains tax because he has n't realized any of his gains yet   jack has n't sold any of his stake   you might think that he has because he used to hold 100 and now he holds 75   however the difference is that the company is worth more than was before the sale   so the value of his stake was unchanged immediately before and after the sale jack agrees to this because the company needs this additional capital in order to meet its potential see why is stock dilution legal for further explanation and another example of this see the question if a startup receives investment money does the startup founder owner actually gain anything your other scenario where venturo purchases existing shares directly from jack is not practical in this situation   if jack sells his existing shares you are correct that the company does not gain any additional capital   an investor would not want to invest in the company this way because the company is struggling and needs new capital

in the u.s. at least a lot of these coinstar machines are now owned and operated by the store or other venue in which they 're placed as a convenience to customers and the fee for using it is waived   these machines even without a fee attached are still beneficial to the store for two reasons first they bring in potential customers the machine usually spits out a ticket that you take to the cashier meaning you pass by all the impulse items they put in the checkout lines and someone using the change will invariably pick up a pack of gum or a magazine to spend your newfound wealth the fact that one store has a change machine while another does n't can also be the difference between choosing that store over the other for a planned shopping trip second and less obvious a store that owns a coinstar machine has full access to the change people put in it hey they own the machine and are paying out cash on the receipts it spits out during normal use of a cash drawer or register to take in money large bills $ 20/20 € or larger are accumulated to be broken small to medium bills 1 10 units stay roughly static in number as payments are made and larger bills are broken and coins are invariably depleted as change is paid out this means the average retail store needs a constant incoming supply of coinage and that generally happens either through armored car service or similar commercial banking which costs the store money or through change like machines which usually ca n't supply all the needed denominations the coinstar machine effectively reverses at least a portion of this attrition of coins and accumulation of large bills the store can now receive coins and pay out large bills as a part of its day to day business reducing or even eliminating the need to have a bank or armored car perform this service anyway check and see whether the coinstar machine you last used is still operating on a percentage fee basis it might be the case that the store has purchased the machine outright and is offering its services free of charge if not look around other stores may be waiving the coinstar fee where this one is n't or they may have similar non coinstar branded machines lastly as other answers have mentioned if you cash out in the form of a gift card there 's no fee so you can pick a gift card to a store you 're likely to visit anyway in the u.s. there are a lot of good choices like home improvement stores starbucks major department stores clothing retailers and even an airline

assuming a person knows how to use and invest their money wisely would it still be a bad idea to entirely disregard a 401k plan yes a 401k like an ira is a qualified plan and as such enjoys certain legal protections   for a roth 401k the taxes are paid now and the interest accumulates tax free and withdrawals will be tax free doing it on your own means that your own savings will have interest taxed as you earn it   for a traditional 401k current savings are deducted from current earnings and the withdrawals will be taxed doing it on your own loses the deferral of tax at this time    generally 401ks and iras are highly resistant to judgements in civil lawsuits if you file for bankruptcy protection at any time in your working career the assets in these accounts are immune in most states from being used to pay off your creditors if you do it on your own that savings account will be emptied to pay off creditors in bankruptcy and also will be assets that can be taken from you in civil judgements for example you get in a car accident and they sue you you might never be sued nor file bankruptcy in your entire life but you are unnecessarily exposing yourself to risks anything might happen in the next 50 years what you will lose in such circumstances far outweighs any perceived benefits you could possibly earn by rolling your own if you are the sort of person who can max out your 401k and ira contributions each year and still have a significant sum to set aside for savings you should contact an investment advisor and attorney to see about protecting your assets

i am interested in seeing what happens to your report after you test this but i do n't think it 's possible in practice would not affect your credit score and also would n't be worth it for you to carry a negative balance like that having a -1 credit utilization essentially means that you are lending the credit card company money which is n't really something that the credit card companies do they would likely not accept an agreement where you are providing the credit to them having credit is a more formal agreement than just i paid you too much this month even if your payment does post before the transaction and it says you have a negative balance and gets reported to the credit bureau like that this would probably get flagged for human review and a negative credit utilization does n't really reflect what is happening credit utilization is how much do you owe amount of credit available to you and it 's not really correct to say that you owe negative dollars carrying a negative balance like that is money that could be invested elsewhere my guess is that the credit card company is not paying you the apr of your card on the amount they owe you if they are please provide the name of your card they probably do n't pay you anything for that negative balance and it 's money that 's better used elsewhere even if it does benefit your credit score you 're losing out on any interest each month you could have earned with that money to get maybe 1 2 better rate on your next home or car loan when will that be   tldr i think credit utilization approaches a limit at 0 because it 's based on the amount you owe and you do n't really owe negative dollars i am very interested in seeing the results of this experiment please update us when you find out

guaranteed annual return sounds too good to be true am i    right are there likely high fees etc you 're right guaranteed annual return is impossible especially when you 're talking about investments for such a long period of time ponzi and madoff their investors using promises of guaranteed return see this note in wikipedia in some cases returns were allegedly determined before the account was even her financial advisor does n't charge by the hour he takes a    commission so there 's obviously some incentive to sell her things    even if she may not need them definitely not a good sign if the advisor gets a commission from the sale then he 's obviously not an advisor but a sales person the problem with this kind of investment is that it is very complex and it is very hard to track the commission to the broker makes it hard to evaluate returns you pay 10 upfront and it takes awhile to just get that money back before even getting any profits and since you 're only able to withdraw in 20 years or so there 's no real way to know if something wrong until you get there and discover that no money also many annuity funds if not all limit withdrawals to a long period i.e. you can not touch money for like 10 years from investment regardless of the tax issues the tax deferred investment can be rolled over to another tax deferred account but in this case you ca n't i suggest you getting your own financial advisor that will work for you to look over the details and talk to your mother if it is really a scam

the risk of the particular share moving up or down is same for both    however in terms of mitigating the risk investor a is conservative on upside ie will exit if he gets 10 while is ready to take unlimited downside his belief is that things will not go worse while investor b is wants to make at least 10 less than peak value and in general is less risk averse as he will sell his position the moment the price hits 10 less than max peak value so it more like how do you mitigate a risk as to which one is wise depends on your belief and the loss appetite

first off the basics on hst gst    you do n't need to collect hst if you do n't want to until you hit 30k in a particular three month period assuming you 're not regularly passing $ 30k   you then need to collect on the sale that takes you over $ 30k plus all sales after that   see the h&r block page on gst hst for example goes through the roof generating more than $ 30,000 in one particular three month period in this case the day the sale goes through that took you over that $ 30,000 threshold becomes the day you cease to be a small supplier you must charge gst hst on the sale that put you over the $ 30,000 limit and on all sales after that even if you are not yet registered you now have 29 days to register with the government alternately if you hit 30k over four three month periods i.e. a year then you are exempt until the end of that fourth three month period after which you must register and collect hst the month after in excess of $ 30,000 during four or fewer previous consecutive three month periods you will be considered to be a small supplier for those four calendar three month periods plus the next month your first sale after that additional month and all sales thereafter will have to include gst hst you will have 29 days from the first day of the second month to register however many businesses do collect hst gst even under that limit in particular as it means you can collect tax refunds for your input hst gst paid   if you do so then you simply register from the start and then you do n't need to worry about it   you do need to remit those taxes collected though   if you do n't remit you wo n't be able to collect tax rebates for your input hst gst you decide to become a gst hst when you start your business you expect to exceed the $ 30,000 threshold at some time in the near future you also want to receive any gst hst paid back from the government on all expenditures especially those high startup costs and as grant recommends in most cases it ’s generally a good idea to register for gst hst as soon as your business is established provided that your business makes or will make taxable or zero rated supplies early registration ensures that gst hst paid on costs incurred is recoverable since tax paid prior to registration is generally not recoverable except on the purchase of inventory capital property and prepaid services still on hand at the time of registration be sure to register early because in many situations registering late can result in the loss of recoverable gst paid before registration

fair value can mean many different things depending on the context and it has nothing to do with the price at which your market order would be executed for example if you buy market you could get executed below 101 if there are hidden orders at 101 if that sell order is large enough and it is still there when your order reaches the market or at a higher price otherwise

as far as i can recall savings and chequing accounts exist due to regulations on the banking industry that put were into effect after the depression to prevent a run on the bank    a chequing account is a demand account meaning you can go and demand your money and they have to pay immediately by means of a withdrawal or a cheque   banks used to get out of hand and loan out pretty much all the money they had on deposit and of course those people with loans just put the money they borrowed into another chequing account and the bank loaned that out to someone else   the money that people believed they had access to multiplied indefinitely   however when everyone goes to take that money out at the same time you have a run on the bank   therefore government regulations stipulate a that the bank must have on hand   the typical number is 5   that effectively limits the money multiplier to 19 times savings accounts get around this restriction by putting limits on how much and how quickly you can withdraw the amounts   they pay you more interest because the money in a savings account is worth more to them because it 's not subject to those restrictions some chequing accounts pay interest but you have to maintain a minimum balance   some savings accounts allow you to write cheques but i assume the withdrawal limitations probably still apply there 's also something to do with deposit insurance as in the chequing accounts are covered by government deposit insurance but savings accounts are not   i 'm not 100 certain of that though

assuming the data you 're referring to is this line the difference might be related to the different exchanges on which the stock trades   finra could be listing the reported volume from one exchange while the nasdaq data might be listing the volume on all exchanges this is an important distinction because is a canadian company that is listed on the toronto stock exchange and the nyse the q at the end of the line stands for nasdaq according to finra 's for those data my guess is that the finra data is only reporting the volume for the nasdaq exchange and not the total volume for all exchanges toronto nasdaq nyse etc while the data straight from nasdaq oddly enough is reporting the total volume however finra could also face reporting discrepancies since it 's a regulatory body and therefore might not have the most up to date volume data that the various exchanges can access   i do n't know if it 's related or not but looking at the nasdaq historical data it looks like the volume on march 6 the day you 're asking about was much lower than the volume in most of the days immediately before or after it for all i know something might have happened that day concerning that particular stock or the market as a whole i do n't remember anything in particular but you never know

i am surprised at the amount of work this contract wants done   i 'd question if it 's even legal given the high costs   i suspect it 's only there to remind abusive tenants of responsibilities they already have in law for extraordinary abuse beyond ordinary wear and tear they are already on the hook to repaint if they trash the paint think child writing on walls happens a lot and already need to and a lot more if they are a type hoarder who brings in a serious infestation happens a lot   the landlord can already go after these people for additional money beyond the deposit    but that 's not you   so do n't freak out about those clauses until you talk to the landlord and see what he 's really after   almost certainly he really wants a fit and ready to rent unit upon your departure so he does n't have to take the unit off the market for months fixing it   as long as that 's done there 's no reasonable reason for further work a decent landlord would n't require that   nor would a court imo   the trouble with living in a place for awhile is you become blind to its deficiencies   what 's more it 's rather difficult to size up a unit as ready when it 's still occupied by your stuff   a unit will look rather different when reduced to a bare room without furniture and whatnot distracting you   add to it a dose of vanity and it becomes hard to convince yourself of defects others will easily see   so tread carefully here   if push comes to shove first stop is whether it 's even legal    cities and states with heavy tenant populations tend to have much more detailed laws and as a rule they favor the tenant    right off the bat in most states the tenant is not responsible for ordinary wear and tear   in my opinion 6 years of ordinary exempt wear would justify a repaint so that should n't be on the tenant at all   as for the i 'm not in florida so i do n't know the deal maybe there 's some special environmental issue there which somehow makes that reasonable it sure would n't fly in ca   again that assumes you 're a reasonable prudent tenant not a or hoarder   as for the pro carpet cleaning that 's par for the course in any of the tough rent control areas i 've seen so that 's gotten a pass from the legislators   though $ 600 seems awfully high   other than that you can argue the terms are unconscionable too much of a raw deal to even be fair   however this will depend on the opinion of a judge hit or miss   i 'm hoping your landlord will be happy to negotiate based on the good condition of the unit which he may not know landlords rarely visit tenant units unless they really need to you certainly should make the case that you make here that the work is not really needed and it 's prohibitive   your best defense against unconscionable deals is do n't sign them   remember you did n't know the guy when you initially signed the now objectionable language should have been a big red flag back then saying this guy is epic evil run screaming even if that turned out not to be true you have hung around to find out   you may have gotten lucky this time but do n't make that mistake again   unless one of the above pans out though a deal is a deal   you gave your word   the powerful act here is to keep your word   forgive me for getting but successful people say it creates success for them   and here 's the thing you have to read your contracts because you ca n't keep your word if you do n't know what word you gave   it 's a common mistake thinking good business is trust hope faith submission or giving your all   no    in business you take the time to hammer out mutually beneficial win win agreements and you set them on paper to eliminate confusion argument and stress in the future as memories fade and conditions change   that conflict resolution is how business partners remain friends or at least professional colleagues

because people are risk averse suppose that you own an asset worth $ 10,000 to you   suppose that each year the asset has 1 chance of being stolen or completely broken   the expected value is 99 x 10,000 + 1 x $ 0 = $ 9,900 this is the average outcome if you do not buy insurance   now consider two mutually exclusive outcomes 99 chance of keeping $ 10,000 and 1 chance of losing everything expected value $ 9,900   100 chance of keeping $ 9,900 expected value $ 9,900   everyone would choose option 2 even though the expected values are the same   option 2 is an insurance that cost $ 100 fair aka the odds are fair   now suppose the insurance costs $ 150 instead of $ 100 despite that the bad probability is still 1 you are faced with   99 chance of keeping $ 10,000 and 1 chance of losing everything expected value $ 9,900   100 chance of keeping $ expected value $   some people would still choose option 2 even though the expected value is actually lower   the $ 50 is called risk premium which people are willing to pay in order to avoid uncertainty the odds are unfair but the risk premium has its value   that being said competition between insurance companies would drive down the premium until the insurance is close to fair but they have cost to cover sales administration etc making the odds unfair

you have a lot of different questions in your post i am only responding to the request for how to value the espp when valuing an espp do n't think about what you might sell the shares for in the future think about what the market would charge you for that option today in general an option is worth much less than the underlying share itself for the simplest example assume you work at a public company and your exercise price for your options is $ .30 and you can only exercise those options until the end of today and the cost of the shares on the public stock exchange is also $ .30 you have the same strike price as everyone else in the market making your option worth nothing in truth holding that right to a specific strike price into the future does give you value because it means you can realize the upside in share price gains without risking any money on share losses so how do you value the options if it 's a public company with an active options market you can easily compare your $ .30 strike price with the value of call options in the market that have a $ .30 strike price that becomes the value to you of the option caveat it is unlikely you can find an exact match for the terms of your vesting period but you should be able to find a good starting point if it 's a public company without an active options market you will have to do a bit of estimation if a current share is worth $ .25 so close to your strike price then your option is worth a little bit but not much compare other shares in your industry company size to get examples of the relative value between an option and a share if the current share price is worth $ then your option is worth about $ .05 the $ .05 profit you could get by immediately exercising and selling plus a bit more for an option on a share that you ca n't buy in the open market if it 's a private company then you need to be very clear on how shares are to be valued and what methods you have available to sell back to the company other individuals you can then consider as per above how to value the option for a share vs the share itself without a clear way to sell your shares of a private company ideally through a sale directly back to the company that you are able to force them to agree on ie the company will buyback shares at 5x net income for the previous year or something like that then the value of a small number of shares is very nebulous there is an extremely limited market for shares of private companies if you do n't own enough to exert control in your case because the valuation appears to be $ 2/share be sure that these are the same share classes you have the option to buy your option would be worth a little more than $ if you did n't have to wait 4 years to exercise it this would be total compensation of about $ 10k if you were able to exercise today many people do n't end up working for an early job in their career for 4 years so you need to consider whether how much that will reduce the value of the espp for you personally compared with salary of 90k 10k worth of stock in 4 years may not be a heavy motivating compensation consideration note also that because the company is not public the valuation of $ 2/share should be taken with a grain of salt

it used to be quite easy for students to get credit cards when i was in college in the early 1980s credit card companies set up tables in the student center and offered low limit cards along with free t shirts on an almost daily schedule the credit card act of 2009 made this much more difficult for banks if you have a bank or credit union account the first thing i would do is talk to them about getting a card some banks offer a visa student card specifically for college students my daughter was able to get one when she turned 18 just before starting college the credit limit is very low $ 200 for increasing each year until the limit is $ 500 during senior year after graduation it converts to a regular visa account with a limit that depends on post graduation income and the now established 4 years of credit history the visa web site has a list of banks offering this type of card now i will give you the same unsolicited advice i gave my daughter and the same advice i think most others here would give you for building credit this kind of card is excellent but you should still use it very sparingly and pay off the balance every month make it a hard rule to never pay interest on a credit card bill i told her to charge perhaps one or two purchases totaling no more than $ each month and pay them off as soon as the statement arrives this is much easier if you have a deposit account at the same bank since you will be able to pay the bill instantly on line have your employer direct deposit your paychecks into that bank account if at all possible

first lets understand what convexity means convexity   convexity refers to non in a financial model in other    words if the price of an underlying variable changes the price of an    output does not change linearly but depends on the second derivative    or loosely speaking higher order terms of the modeling function    geometrically the model is no longer flat but curved and the degree    of is called the convexity okay so for us idiots this means if the price of abc we will call p is determined by x and y. then if x decreases by 5 then the value of p might not necessarily decrease by 5 but instead is also dependent on y is y who cares its not important for us to know we can understand what convexity is without knowing the math behind it so if we chart this the line would look like a curve clearly this is an over simplification of the math involved but it gives us an idea so now in terms of options convexity is also known as gamma it will probably be easier to talk about gamma instead of using a confusing word like is the convexity of options so lets define gamma gamma the rate of change for delta with respect to the underlying asset 's price so the gamma of an option indicates how the delta of an option will change relative to a 1 point move in the underlying asset in other words the gamma shows the option delta 's sensitivity to market price changes or gamma shows how volatile an option is relative to movements in the underlying asset so the answer is if we are long gamma convexity of an option it simply means we are betting on higher volatility in the underlying your case the vix really that simple well kinda to fully understand how this works you really need to understand the math behind it but yes being long gamma means being long volatility an example of being long gamma is a long straddle side note i personally do trade the vix and it can be very volatile you can make or lose lots of money very quickly trading vix options some resources what does it mean to be long gamma in options trading long gamma how to make a long gamma position work for you delta investopedia straddles strangles further reading if your interested even more reading

incoming is often free except from overseas i 've never found a bank offering free international wire transfers is this coming from a foreign country or another part of the usa if it is from a foreign country at some banks hsbc perhaps you can get us$ checks for us payments at a lower cost than a wire transfer but you have to be careful because the exchange rate might be different if the transfers occur wholly within the usa there is really no good reason to use wire transfer if you can avoid it   ach is usually free and is the same way direct deposit works   use that or if it is within a family like for college you could even use checks

hi   straddle   buy a call and a put with an identical strike price the strike is the price at which you can exercise the option you pay a premium cash to buy the options typically you need a large amount of volatility in pricing movement in order to breakeven on the combined premium paid   strangle purchasing a call and a put option with a non identical strike price once again it is a volatility trading play you need some type of price movement in the underlying security in order to break even or profit on the trade

okay i see where we might be confusing each other in absolute dollar terms the employee might make more working for themselves but money is not the only factor that goes into choosing a job if the worker can make $ working for themselves and $ 500 doing the same job a company they may value the benefits of not worrying about running their own business or the extra free time like you said as being worth more than that $ 100 they are still choosing the option that they value highest to themselves whichever it may be i did nt that the company is giving the employee some sort of gift in hiring them they are just offering the employee the best possible option of the employee 's other choices if it was nt the best option for the worker then they logically should not select that option

opinions vary but i 've always thought that an emergency fund is just that for emergencies not investment while it hurts not to have your emergency money making more money its more important to have quick access to it as long as the interest rate keeps up with the rate of inflation leave it alone   fill up your emergency fund with 3 6 mos salary and then invest your money beyond that however you see fit dave ramsey 's financial peace university is a very good and i would recommend it to anyone asking questions such as this one

1 when it says an investment or mutual fund is a mutual fund not    an investment if no what is the definition of an investment a mutual fund is indeed an investment the article probably mentions   mutual funds separately from other investments because it is not uncommon for mutual funds to give you the option to automatically reinvest dividends and capital gains     2 when it says in terms of stocks why does it only mention    distribution of dividends but not distribution of capital gains since distributions are received as cash deposits they can be used to buy more of the stock capital gains on the other hand occur when an asset increases in value these gains are realized when the asset is sold in the case of stocks reinvestment of capital gains does n't make much sense since buying more stock after selling it to realize capital gains results in you owning as much stock as you had before you realized the gains 3 when it says in terms of mutual funds it says about the    reinvestment of distributions and dividends does distributions not    include distributions of dividends why does it mention    distributions parallel to dividends used in this setting dividend and distribution are synonymous which is highlighted by the way they are used in parallel 4 does reinvestment only apply to interest or dividends but not to    capital gain reinvestment only applies to dividends in the case of stocks mutual funds must distribute capital gains to shareholders making these distributions essentially cash dividends usually as a special end of year distribution if you 've requested automatic reinvestment the fund will buy more shares with these capital gain distributions as well

how will your employer treat your pay and benefits status while you 're on leave    disability income coverage and leave policies work in tandem to solve very different problems   disability income coverage covers your income leave policies guarantee your status as an employee    typically std coverage requires an actual loss of income and will offset it 's stated benefit for any income you 're receiving   in general you ca n't begin a std claim after the 7 day waiting period and also draw income from vacation or sick time   also typically std will cover some percentage of your covered pay sometimes including commission bonus income up to some weekly maximum requires employers to allow certain amounts of time for certain types of leave   is not necessarily an income replacement tool like std coverage    contrary to your post it 's my understanding that if sick and vacation time accrue in to a single pto bucket your employer is prohibited from requiring employees to exhaust accrued time prior to beginning leave in general you 're not missing anything because the point of is to guarantee your job and status as an employee from a benefits perspective benefits language from the department of labor website a covered employer is required to maintain group health insurance coverage including family coverage for an employee on leave on the same terms as if the employee continued to work

if your primary concern is a drop in your credit score go to a mortgage broker instead of multiple banks and finance companies each time you ask a bank or financial institution for a loan they do a hard pull on your credit rating which costs you a couple of points visit a dozen lenders and you 'll lose 24 points you will also be signalling to lenders that you 're shopping for money if you visit a mortgage broker he does a single hard pull on your credit score and offers your loan query to a dozen or more lenders some of which you may not have even heard of this costs you 2 points instead of 24 if you are only going to visit one financial institution or another specific one the drop in credit score is the same couple of points the above answer only applies if you make loan inquiries at multiple institutions

# 293083
your calculations are good as far as they go but there are lots of other factors and pros and cons to each decision yes you should certainly compare the monthly rent to what your mortgage payments would be as you have done yes you should consider how long you might live there if you do move out how difficult will it be to sell the house given market conditions in your area if you try to rent it how difficult is it to find a tenant and what rent could you expect to receive speaking of moving out and renting the place who will manage the property and do maintenance would you still be close enough to do this yourself would you be willing and able to spend the time or would you have to hire someone also what if the tenant does not pay the rent how difficult is it to evict someone in your area speaking from personal experience i own a rental property in ohio and the law says you can evict someone with 3 days notice but in practice they do n't just leave so then you have to take them to court it takes months to get a court date and months longer before the police actually show up to order them out of the house and you have to pay the lawyer and court fees in that time they 're living in your property rent free in my case one tenant also totally trashed the place and stole everything that was n't nailed down i had to spend $ 13,000 on repairs to a house worth a fraction of what you 're talking about being a landlord is not just a matter of sitting back and collecting rent checks there 's a fair amount of work and a lot of risk what do you have to pay the realtor and what other closing costs would you have to pay where i live realtors typically charge 6 to 7 you may also have to pay for an appraisal title search and bunch of other little fees mortgage interest is deductible on your federal income taxes rent is not if you own and something needs to be repaired you have to pay for it if you rent the landlord has to pay for it   if you own you can do pretty much what you like with the property subject to zoning ordinances and building codes and maybe homeowners association rules but you should have a pretty good amount of leeway if you want to install ceiling fans or remodel the kitchen or add a deck it 's up to you if you 're renting it 's up to the landlord to decide what you can do to the property and if he agrees to let you do some upgrade when you 're done it belongs to him with a condo you are not usually responsible for exterior maintenance like mowing the lawn and trimming the and washing the outer walls with a house you are you might pay someone to do this which adds to the cost or you might do it yourself which takes time insurance on a condo or is much less than insurance on a house in my area anyway you should investigate those costs if you buy eventually you own the place and do n't have to pay a mortgage any more if you rent you continue to pay forever even if you do n't live in the same house forever as long as you do n't take a terrible loss when you sell you should then have some money left over to apply to the next house so you are still building equity some of these pros and cons are easily quantifiable others are probabilities like how likely is it that your water heater will fail and how long is it likely to take to find a buyer if you want to sell and others are pretty subjective

it looks like businesses selling services like software downloads from outside the eu to the uk have to register for vat if the amount of such sales goes over the uk vat registration threshold if the value of the taxable supplies you make is over a specified    threshold then you must register for vat so it seems plausible that this business does have some requirement to charge vat on its sales but clearly it should have done so at the time of sale not months later as you say uk and eu law require that prices are displayed including relevant taxes since this business is in the us they might be able to claim that those rules do n't apply to them but i 'm not aware of even us businesses being able to claim sales tax from a us customer months after originally making a sale and it goes against all reasonable principles of law if they would be able to do it so the business should really just accept that they screwed up and they 'll now have to take the hit and pay the tax themselves they can work as if the pre tax price was $ = $ leaving $ they need to hand over to hmrc i do n't think there 's any legal way they can demand money from you now and certainly for such a low sum of money there 's no practical way they could i ca n't find anything definitive one way or the other but i suppose it 's possible that hmrc would consider you the importer under these circumstances and so liable for the vat yourself but i do n't know of any way to actually report this to hmrc or pay them the money and again given the amount there 's no realistic chance they 'd want to chase you for it in your shoes i would either ignore the email or write back and politely tell them that they should have advertised the cost at the time and you 're not willing to pay extra now and you might want to keep an eye on the card you used to pay them to make sure they do n't try to just charge it anyway edit as pointed out in a comment the company behind this or at least one with a very similar problem and wording in their emails did end up acknowledging that they ca n't actually do this and that they 'll need to pay the tax out of the money they already collected as i described above it seems they did n't contact the people they originally emailed to let them know this though there 's some more discussion here

this is my two cents pun intended   it was too long for a comment so i tried to make it more of an answer   i am no expert with investments or islam anything on a server exists physically   it exists on a hard drive tape drive and/or a combination thereof   it is stored as data which on a hard drive are small particles that are charged where each bit is represented by that electric charge   that data exists physically   it also depends on your definition of physically   this data is stored on a hard drive which i deem physical though is transferred via electric often via fiber cable   do n't fall for marketing words like cloud   data must be stored somewhere and is often redundant and backed up to me money is just paper with an amount attached to it   it tells me nothing about its value in a market   a $ 1 bill was worth a lot more 3 decades ago you could buy more goods because it had a higher value than it is today   money is simply an indication of the value of a good you traded at the time you traded   at a simplistic level you could accomplish the same thing with a friend saying if you buy lunch today i 'll buy lunch next time   there was no exchange in money between me and you but there was an exchange in the value of the lunch if that makes sense   the same thing could have been accomplished by me and you exchanging half the lunch costs in physical money or credit debit card or check any type of investment can be considered gambling   though you do get some sort of proof that the investment exists somewhere   investments may go up or down in value at any given time   perhaps with enough research you can make educated investments but that just makes it a smaller gamble   nothing is guaranteed   currency investment is akin to stock market investment in that it may go up or down in value in comparison to other currencies though it does n't make you an owner of the money 's issuer generally it 's similar   i find if you keep all your money in u.s. dollars without considering other nations that 's a sort of ignorant way of gambling you 're betting your money will lose value less slowly than if you had it elsewhere or in multiple places back on track to your question i really buying that currency   you are trading a currency   you are giving one currency and exchanging it for another   i guess you could consider that buying since you can consider trading currency for a piece of software as buying something or is the situation more like playing with the live rates it depends on your perception of playing with the live rates   investments to me are long term commitments with reputable research attached to it that i intend to keep through highs and lows unless something triggers me to change my investment elsewhere   if by playing you mean risk as described above you will have a level of risk   if by playing you mean not taking it seriously then do thorough research before investing and do n't be trading every few seconds for minor returns trying to make major returns out of minor returns my opinion or doing anything based on a whim was that money created out of thin air i suggest you do more research before starting to trade currency into how markets and trading works   think of a market as a closed system with other markets such as uk market french market etc   each can interact with each other   the u.s. or any market has a set number of dollars in the pool   $ 100 for example 's sake   each $ 1 has a certain value associated with it   if for some reason the country decides to create more paper that is green says $ 1 and stamps presidents on them money and adds 15 $ 1 to the pool making it $ 115 each one of these dollars value goes down   this can also happen with goods   this along with the trading of goods between markets peoples attachment of value to goods of the market and peoples perception of the market is what currency trading in simple terms   so essentially no money is not made out of thin air   money is a medium for value   though values are always changing and money is a static amount you are attempting to trade values and own the medium that has the most value if that makes sense   values of goods are constantly changing this is a learning process for me as well so i hope this helps answers your questions you seem to have   as stated above i 'm no expert i 'm actually quite new to this so i probably missed a few things here and there

this does n't seem to explain the odd behavior of the collector but i wanted to point out that the debt collector might not actually own the debt if this is the case then your creditor is still the original institution and the collector may or may not be allowed to actually collect contact the original creditor and ask how you can pay off the debt

buying a starter home is not a bad idea if you have a stable job and plan to stay in the area for a long time owning a house that you can afford is a very good idea   purchasing a home that you do not want to live in long term is not a good idea people who move frequently pay a lot in real estate commissions as you 've mentioned but they also pay loan origination and title fees mortgage interest is tax deductible and many people consider home ownership to better than renting because of that fact alone what they do not consider are costs of property taxes hoa fees common in condos and townhouses but also possible in single family homes and being tied to piece of real estate if the job market changes and they need to move the easy rule of thumb is to consider the ratio of total price to one year of rent if you could purchase for $ 200k but you would rent for $ 800 per month then the price to rent ratio is depending on the market most homes fall between 10 and 20 when the ratio is less than 10 then you would be at a great disadvantage renting instead of purchasing when the ratio is greater than 20 you would be foolish to buy instead of rent unless there was some other compelling factor motivating the purchase

the fact that you 're a minor really only factors into who pays the taxes you or your parents if you are below the age where you can legally earn money and therefore pay taxes then the income will be considered your parent 's or guardian 's income and they will be responsible for the taxes if you are of the age where you are legally allowed to earn your own money then yes you will have to pay taxes either way taxes must be paid if age were a way of escaping the taxes every big would simply open their account in the name of one of their children or a child they know

the apathy and ignorance of the majority of americans is the only reason the economic inequality in america was ever able to reach such devastating proportions the business culture in this country is ruining average quality of life and i fundamentally do not believe that you are okay with that and if you are then you 're just adding to the problem by either being sympathetic towards a delusion or an active apologist for greed and thus put yourself in the category of people to be on the receiving end of that fuck you

capital requirements for a de novo bank as opposed to an established one are a real bitch   basically the government wo nt let you loan nearly as much of your money out   you ca n't skirt this by buying an existing bank   regulators do n't want upstarts making stupid loans and thus encouraging lower credit criteria   also incumbents do n't want more competition and they have lobbyists so i do n't see this changing soon

option liquidity and underlying liquidity tend to go hand in hand according to regulation what kinds of issues can have options even trading are restricted by volume and cost due to registration with the authorities studies have shown that the introduction of option trading causes a spike in underlying trading market makers and the like can provide more option liquidity if there is more underlying and option liquidity a relationship the cost to provide liquidity is directly related to the cost for liquidity providers to hedge as evidenced by the bid ask spread liquidity providers in option markets prefer to hedge mostly with other options hedging residual greeks with other assets such as the underlying volatility time interest rates etc because trading costs are lower since the two offsetting options hedge most of each other out requiring less trading in the other assets

mixing friendship and money whether that 's loans or landlording is risky often things work out but sometimes the unexpected happens and it does n't if things go wrong are you prepared to walk away from either the friendship or the money after you 've considered that the next question is how your roommates feel about the deal you 're looking to charge your friends $ 2000 to rent part of a property that from the sound of it they could rent much cheaper from a stranger maybe the market is different in cleveland but in my area i 'd expect to pay $ 2000 in rent for a place worth closer to $ 300,000 than $ 100,000 have your roommates expressed interest in the idea and have you discussed dollar values with them are you still interested if they ended up paying $ 1600 in rent $ 1000

drawing down from a nest egg is dealing with 3 issues the much used withdrawal amount used to not deplete your principal is 4 some may argue this is too much or not enough but it is regarded as a standard amount   seeing that you have $ 500k you can pull about $ 20k per year using this drawdown percentage   if you can live on $ 20k then you are set   if not you should build up this nest egg
# 479593
i can see that building credit is a valid reason i would also suggest another scenario when you have locked up money in long term savings with a substantial penalty for early withdrawal if you suddenly needed money then you might save money by borrowing against the long term deposit rather than pay the penalties this is especially true if you needed the money only for a short time

where are you from the netherlands has tax treaties with different countries that may offer you some additional options the netherlands calculates a maximum tax free contribution to your pension each year based on your income if you contributed less than you were allowed to you can invest the difference between your actual and allowed contributions in special retirement investments that usually offer tax advantages a gap like this can be due to getting a bonus or a raise after looking around the investments available are either a special savings account or an annuity   your allowed contributions to both will be tax deductible and the investment itself is excluded from wealth tax box 3 taxes   i also see offering an investment annuity that lets you invest in any of 7 of their mutual funds until a certain date at which time you liquidate and use the proceeds to fund an annuity with the dutch retirement options will not in general get the same freedom of choice or low costs associated with iras in the us   i 'm not sure about isas in the uk   it 's also important to check any tax agreements between countries to ensure your chosen investment vehicle gets the tax advantaged treatment in your home country as it does in the netherlands   for us citizens this is important even when living abroad   for others it is important if you return to your home country and still have this investment if you are a us citizen you have an additional option   the us dutch tax treaty allows you to make these contributions to preexisting i.e. you had these before moving to nl retirement accounts in the us like an ira note that in practice it may be difficult to contribute to an existing roth ira because you would need to have earned income after the foreign income tax deduction but less than the maximum income for a roth contribution

vast majority is just too indoctrinated or apathetic to think   yes i agree with this statement in certain states a party platform built upon guns jesus and no more will get you elected even if the rest of the policies amount to having them bring ropes to their own hanging in many blue states shallow rhetoric laden environmental and an appeal for various kinds of social justice will have the same effect insofar as it also tends to get voters voting against their own self interest    there is literally no other reason why a majority of people would ever vote to de fund schools stifle science dismantle society allow corporate prefer pain suffering and bankruptcy financial ruin for millions instead of having sensible healthcare policies for everyone that the military gets almost unlimited funding for its capital purchasing but leaves millions of veterans denied of va services and almost every other kind of support is shameful and should not be acceptable to anyone yet all of this goes unchanged year after year because of the meaningless and ineffective manner in which people vote voting is n't the problem what they vote for is    the underlying problem is a deeply uniformed voter that is easily manipulated by the products of campaign finance even when voters do show up their vote is easily purchased that their vote does not have an effect apart from confirming what the lobbyists paid for

also the city streets are not supposed to be a source of competition for their business   17 states disagree with you but they must have been simple minded   how can brick and mortar restaurants factor in any kind of unknown competition such as another brick amp mortar possibly a better or less expensive version of their own business should they be protected from anything they can not factor into their initial decision to open a business where do you draw the line   i think that businesses should be protected from much larger businesses but i do n't think it 's appropriate to use government to protect businesses from smaller more agile businesses or completely different business models   i think this entire argument is based on a logical fallacy that mobile food is going to put restaurants out of business at a rate faster than they already do go out of business

there are no risk free high liquidity instruments that pay a significant amount of interest   there are some money market accounts around that pay but they often have minimum balance or transaction limits    even if you could get 3 on a $ 4 k balance that would be $ 120 per year or $ 10 per month   you can do much better than that by just going to $ two less times per month or whatever you can cut from your expenses and putting that into the savings account or work a few extra hours and increase your income i appreciate the desire to maximize the return on your money but in reality increasing income and reducing expenses have a much greater impact until you build up significant savings and are able to absorb more risk   emergency funds should be highly liquid and risk free so traditional investments are n't appropriate vehicles for them
