you setup a self directed solo 401k by paying a one time fee for a company to setup a trust name you the sole trustee and file it with the irs none of these companies offer tpa because it opens them up to profit liability after you have your trust setup you can open a brokerage account or several with any of the big names you want vanguard fidelity ameritrade etc or just use the money to flip houses do p2p lending whatever the world is your investment if the company has recurring fees you need to ask what is going on because if they are n't offering tpa services then what the heck could they be charging you for i did see one company i think it was ira financial group that had the option of having a cpa do tpa for you for a recurring fee but i would pass on that the irs administration requirements are typically just the that you have to file as a hard copy by july 31 if your investments are worth more than $ 250k on december 31 yes you have to get the actual form from the irs write on it with a pen and mail it to them every year you can either have your accountant do it or do it yourself if you 're below $ 250k just google solo 401k rule change two or three times a year and do n't try to launder money if anything the rules will loosen with time i do n't imagine the republican congress cracking down on small business owners any time soon

as previously answered the solution is margin it works like this you deposit e.g. usd at your trading company they give you a margin of e.g. so you are allowed to trade with usd   let 's say you buy pieces of a stock at $ 20 usd fully using your limit and the price changes to $ your profit is 5000 $ 0.50 = $ fast money if you are lucky let 's say before the price went up to it had a slight dip down to $ your loss was 5000 $ 0.2 = wait you had just 1000 to begin with you 'll find an email saying margin call or termination notice your shares have been sold at $ and you are out of business the broker willingly gives you this credit since he can be sure he wo n't loose a cent of course you pay interest for the money you are trading with but it 's only for minutes so to answer your question you do n't care when you have your money back the trading company will always be there to give you more as long as you have deposit left i thought no one should get margin explained without the warning why it is a horrible idea to full use the ridiculous high margins some broker offer 1:10 might or might not be fine but is

i would advise against this answering only the first part of question 1 borrowing and lending money among friends and family members can often ruin relationships   while it can sometimes be done successfully this is most likely not the case   all parties involved have to approach this uniquely in order for it to work   this would include your son 's future significant other   obviously you have done very well financially congratulations   your view for your son might be for him to pay you off asap    even after becoming a doctor continue to live like a student until the loan is paid off    his view might be more conventional get the car and house and pay off my loans before i am 50   he may start with your view but two years in he a woman that pressures him to be more conventional    my advice would be to give if you can afford to but if not do not lend   if you decide to lend then come up with a very clear agreement on the repayment schedule and consequences of non payment   you may want to see a lawyer for the rest of it interest payments received are taxable

so one approach would be purely mathematical look at whichever has the higher interest rate and pay it first another approach is to ignore the math since the interest savings difference between a mortgage and student loan is likely small anyways and think about what your goals are   do you like having a student loan payment   would you prefer to get rid of it as quickly as possible   how would it feel to cut the balance in half in one shot if it were me i would pay the student loan as fast as possible student loans are not or and once you get it paid off you can put that payment amount toward your house to get it paid off

make sure you can really do what you plan on doing look at the maximum loan length and the maximum loan amount    from the retirement plans faqs regarding loans a qualified plan may but is not required to provide for loans if a    plan provides for loans the plan may limit the amount that can be    taken as a loan the maximum amount that the plan can permit as a loan    is 1 the greater of $ 10,000 or 50 of your vested account balance    or 2 $ 50,000 whichever is less a plan that provides for loans must specify the procedures for    applying for a loan and the repayment terms for the loan repayment of    the loan must occur within 5 years and payments must be made in    substantially equal payments that include principal and interest and    that are paid at least quarterly   loan repayments are not plan    contributions the referenced documents also discuss the option regarding multiple loans and the maximum amount of all active and recent loans   having a 401 k loan will still count against the maximum amount of monthly payments you can afford also check the interest rate and yes they required to charge interest   some companies will not allow you to make contributions to a 401 k while you have an outstanding loan if that is true with your company then you will miss out on the matching funds

a paycheck is simply a check for your salary   it 's just like a rent check or a birthday check or a grocery check   i 've had paychecks that were personal checks from the owner of the business i 've had ones that are printed in the office i worked in and signed right there and i 've had paychecks that are printed through a third party company and mailed to me my favorite of course is to forgo the paycheck entirely and get direct deposit   really they 're all just checks although that 's a little disingenuous because banks are often slightly more trusting of paychecks   however this has little to do with it being a paycheck per se and more to do with the fact that they see you getting the same check for roughly the same amount on a regular basis having seen you get a paycheck for the same amount from the same company for the last 12 months there is less risk of the check bouncing or being returned unpaid so you can often get banks to waive their hold policy and just give you the money

i understand you make money by buying low and selling high you can also make money by buying high and selling higher short selling high and buying back low short selling low and buying back even lower an important technique followed by many technical traders and investors is to trade with the trend so if the shares are trending up you go long buy to open and sell to close if the shares are trending down you go short sell to open and buy to close but even if the stock price goes up why are we guaranteed that there is some demand for it   there is never any guarantees in investing or trading the only guarantee in life is death but that 's a different subject there is always some demand for a share or else the share price would be zero or it would never sell i.e zero liquidity there are many reasons why there could be demand for a rising share price fundamental analysis could indicated that the shares are valued much higher than the current price technical analysis could indicate that the trend will continue greed could get the better of peoples emotion where they think all my are making money from this stock so i should buy it too just to name a few after all it 's more expensive now what determines if a stock is expensive as joe mentioned was apple expensive at $ 100 people who bought it at $ 50 might think so but people who bought at $ 600 + would think $ 100 is very cheap on the other hand a penny stock may be expensive at $ 0.20 it would make sense if we can sell the stock back into the company for our share of the earnings but why would other investors want it when the price has gone up you do n't sell your stocks back to the company for a share of the earnings unless the company has a share buy back arrangement in place you get a share of the earnings by getting the dividends the company distributes to shareholders other investor would want to buy the stock when the price has gone up because they think it will go up further and they can make some money out of it some of the reasons for this are explained above

tl;dr unfortunately there is little available to the retail investor that fits your description institutional investors can use swaps to gain leverage on the above trade   a bank will build a basket of long msft and short spy and then quote a rate against libor london interbank offered rate and a margin requirement   so at the end of the swap the bank will pay the difference in total return between msft and spy and the investor will pay some amount of cash back   the nice thing for the investor is that the margin requirement will often be fairly small if their credit is good so the investor can lever the trade up significantly a retail investor could call up your broker and try to get the above but on the off chance they let you the margin requirement might be higher than just going short the spy if you are n't a retail investor you might be able to do something like be long a 3x tech etf and short 3x spy etf   if you are very clever you might be able to combine multiple levered tech etfs to get something like 3x msft   however i would strongly caution against levered etfs for most retail investors as the fees are high and levered etfs tend to strongly drift away from the index against the investor over anything but the shortest time periods

what is a good resource to learn about options trading strategies options are a quite advanced investment form and you 'd do well to learn a lot about them before attempting to dive into this fairly illiquid market yale 's online course in financial markets covers the options market and is a good starting point to make sure you 've got all the basics you may be familiar with most of it but it 's a decent on lingo and black scholes how can i use options to establish some cash flow from long standing investments while minimizing capital gains expenses this question seems designed to get people to talk about covered calls essentially you sell call contracts you let people buy things you already have at a price in the future at their whim they pay you for this option though usually not much if the options are n't in the money you can think of this as trading any return above the call option for a bit of extra cash   i do n't invest with taxable accounts but there are significant tax consequences for options because they expire there will be turnover in your portfolio and up front income when you take the sell side so if you trade in options with close expiration dates you 'll probably end up with a lot of short term capital gains which are treated as normal income one strategy is to trade in broad based stock index options which have favorable tax treatments some people have abused this though to disguise normal income as capital gains so it could go away obviously the easy approach is to just use a tax advantaged account for options trading an etf might also be able to handle the turnover on your behalf for example vix is a series of options on s&p500 options a second strategy i 've heard of is buying calls and puts at a given strike price for example if you bought dec 13 calls and puts on spx 115 today it would cost you about $ 35 dollars if the price moves more than 35 dollars away from 115 by dec 13 in either direction you 've made a profit if you reflect on that for a bit you 'll see why vix is considered a volatility index i guess i should mention that shorting a stock and buying a put option at the market price are very similar with the exception that your loss is limited to the price of the option   is there ever an instance where options investing is not speculative the term speculative is not well defined for many people the answer is no it 's very easy to just buy put options and wait for prices to fall or call options and wait for prices to rise moreover the second strategy above essentially gives you similar performance to a stock without paying full price these all fall under the headline of increasing a risk portfolio rather than decreasing it which i figure is a decent definition of speculation on the other hand there are ways to use options minimize risk rather than increase it you can buy underwater options as portfolio insurance if your portfolio drops below a certain amount you still have the right to sell it at a higher one and the case schiller index is run in part on the hopes that one day there might be a thriving market for real estate options or futures when you buy a home or lend money to someone to buy one you could buy regional case schiller options to protect you if the regional market tanks but in all of these cases it 's required for someone else to take the opposite trade risk is n't reduced it 's traded around so technically there is a speculative element to these as well i think the proper question here is whether speculation is present but whether speculation can be put to good ends without speculators the already very thin market for options would faster

you could debate the of tax policy endlessly there are lots of things in tax law that i think are bad ideas and probably a few here and there that i think are good ideas i am well aware that there are things that i think are good ideas that others think are bad ideas and vice versa   to your specific point i suppose you could say that having a place to live is a necessity but most people do not live in the absolute minimum necessary to give them a place to sleep and protection from the weather you could survive with a one room apartment with a bed on one side and a toilet and some minimal cooking facilities on the other most people have considerably more than that at some point that 's luxury and not necessity and if you want to push it you could live in a cardboard box under a bridge you do n't need a house or apartment to survive personally i think it 's absurd that as a home owner i get a deduction for my mortgage interest while if someone were to rent an identical house with a monthly rental equal to exactly the same amount that i am paying on my mortgage he would receive no deduction the stated goal of that one was to encourage home ownership but people who own homes are generally richer than those who rent so the net result is that the poor are paying higher taxes to help subsidize the homes of the rich and then the rich congratulate themselves on how they are giving these tax breaks to help make housing more affordable for poor people to reiterate @keshlam tax laws only makes sense when understood politically yes some people have fine ideas about what is fair and just others simply want tax breaks that benefit their business or people with tough financial situations that just happen by chance to resemble their own many of the people with noble ideas have little concept of what the implications of the policies they push are many of the ideas that some people view as worthy and noble others view as frivolous counter productive or even evil then you mash all these competing groups and interest together and see what comes out

except automation produces an increase in productivity through better leveraging of capital in the past increases in productivity were often seen through better leveraging of the workforce when it 's better leveraging of the workforce that drives the increased productivity you pay the workforce better when it 's better leveraging of capital you pay the capital investors and the managers of that capital better   also it 's hard to say that the middle class has been in decline the wealth gap between the middle class and the upper class has been growing but overall the middle class is better off now than at past points in history the same can be said of the bottom rungs access to health care good food information air conditioning etc is better now than at any point in the past

what kind of deductions are you talking about many deductions like the standard itemized deductions come after the agi and do not affect the agi so i do n't see how this would make any difference maybe you are talking about deductions that come before the agi if you want to increase your agi legitimately here 's a way every year itemize deductions on your federal return and over withhold your state income tax assuming your state has income tax by a lot and/or make voluntary extra payments to your state income tax as a result you will get a huge refund on your state taxes the following year then you will need to include this refund as income on line 10 of the federal return that year which will be included in the agi of course you will also be able to deduct a lot of state income tax paid every year in the federal itemized deductions but those come after the agi

usually the to why sell it is to maintain the specific distribution balance or to track the index that this fund was designed to offer a buy and hold fund could only buy when users are actively putting money into it that limits their ability to follow those approaches   and i think there would be problems withdrawls fair in terms of what shares are sold and how the costs for selling them are distributed that do n't arise for a single buy and hold investor if you 're willing to accept the limitations of the former and can overcome the latter it 's an interesting idea   but note that one of the places index funds save money is that since the composition of indexes changes they are already operating mostly in buy and hold mode it 's unclear how much your variant would save worth exploring in greater depth though i think

you are assuming 100 occupancy and 100 rent collection   this is unrealistic   you could get lucky and find that long term tenant with great credit that always pays their bills but in reality that person usually buys a home they do not rent long term   so you will need to be prepared for periods of no renters and periods of non payment   the expenses here i would expect could wipe out more than you can make in profit based on your numbers have you checked to find out what the insurance on a rental property is   i am guessing it will go up probably 200 500 a year possibly more depending on coverage   you will need a different type of insurance for rental property have you checked with your mortgage provider to make sure that you can convert to a rental property    some mortgages mine is one restrict the use of the home from being a rental property   you may be required to refinance your home which could cost you more in addition if you are under water it will be hard to find a new financier willing to write that mortgage with anything like reasonable terms you are correct you would be taking on a new expense in rental   it is non deductible and the irs knows this well    as littleadv 's answer stated you can deduct some expenses from your rental property i am not sure that you will have a net wash or loss when you add those expenses   if you do then you have a problem since you have a business losing money   this does not even address the headaches that come with being a landlord by my quick calculations if you want to break even your rental property should be about this accounts for 80 occupancy and 80 rental payment   if you get better than that you should make a bit of a profit do nt worry i m sure the house will find a way to reclaim it

so has observed a lot of irresponsible spending from a parent which has so for life ok so we 've got fear so is not very financially savvy and has very little idea about how much we earn   and ignorance    you are entirely correct to worry about the conversation fear plus ignorance equals disastrous conversations i manage our finances apparently your so wishes to have input on the management of your finances without understanding them it strikes me that this serves neither of you well i would note that it is exceedingly difficult to rationally argue someone out of a position that they arrived at through irrational fear and ignorance so i would n't start by having a conversation about charitable giving at all rather i would start by addressing the ignorance because that 's the easy one   how high up we are in terms of being in the top y% of households by income income is irrelevant to the fearful income can vanish with debts remaining if your so is not earning much of that income then so 's future financial security is dependent on the whims of another which has already turned out badly once for so   focusing on raw income is the wrong way to go focusing on an abstraction like percentile is even more irrelevant the figures to focus on are not income and percentile but rather net worth and change in net worth over time   income $ 300 k expenses $ 350 k eventually leads to poverty if you lack net worth even if you are in the 1 of income earners open up with how much do you think we earn playing rhetorical games with ignorant people seems both risky and perhaps unethical to me and it seems unlikely to trust i would approach this situation by first removing the ignorance rather than attempting to take advantage of it for rhetorical purposes   i would also institute a policy that ignorant people do n't get a say if so wants to financial responsibility to you then so should accept your decisions without question if so wants to have a say in your joint financial life then so has a responsibility to make recommendations based on both facts and feelings not just feelings so how to remove this ignorance this will take some doing but not much go through your records and account for from that you can compute your net worth then go back a few years and account for from this you can show the effect of your past prudent decisions on your net worth there should be no percentages there should be no math more complicated than adding and subtracting and it should be very clear what adds and to what   people who are financially savvy are extremely intimidated by jargon if some of your increase in net worth came from a realized capital gain less taxes do not say realized capital gain less taxes on your summary document there should be no depreciation or cost basis or anything even vaguely like that even assets and liabilities are too possessions and debts are more easily understood i 'm thinking something like my so is financially savvy and still i do this about twice a year it 's helpful for both of us to have a quick summary of what 's coming in what 's going out and what we 've got once the ignorance is gone then start working on the fear it sounds like the fear comes from a betrayal of trust so it 's not just enough to be trustworthy you 've got to consistently appear trustworthy a great way to do that is to keep doing what i already suggested on a regular ongoing basis inform so of how you are doing financially when so sees that net worth is consistently improving over time that you are not one bad decision away from poverty the fear should diminish expect this to take a long time

since you are trying to compare corporate bonds that have a defined coupon over the specified time of the bond why not use a simple net present value npv calculation refer net present value npv you could use the discounting factor as the current repo rate of your central bank as i said this would be a simple fast measure not considering risk rating of the bonds inflation and other considerations take a notional 1000 as in each instrument and calculate the npv higher it is better the investment another method in terms of percentage return would be internal rate of return irr though the a bit more complicated it would give you a percentage figure note the above 2 measures are used when the cashflow over the time period is known it will not work for instruments where the cashflow value over different time are not known like stocks

i do n't agree that the market as a whole is a ponzi scheme but there are some ponzi like aspects to it if you buy high quality stocks like coca cola johnson and johnson at&amp;t verizon kraft wells fargo the vanilla bank not one of the crazy ones ibm berkshire hathaway etc and simply hold onto them for the next 10 20 years you will make money even over the last decade when stocks went nowhere you still came out ahead through the dividend payments it was just at an unsatisfactory rate of return also the market consists of a lot more than just stocks corporate bonds are a big market and i always recommend people to look at bonds if you can not judge whether a company is credit worthy how can you invest in the common stock i 've made a lot more money myself in the bond market than in the stock market   however for many stocks they do look a lot like ponzi schemes this is true in particular with many of the tech stocks cuban was a tech investor so that is probably where his sentiment is coming from you have many of these companies that create great products however they never have positive cash flow because all the money is spent to develop new products as the share price goes up the company issues new shares to fund research stock options to employees to enrich them etc however eventually they run into a string of bad research that do not yield a new product and the share price plunges perhaps the company goes bankrupt so you have a company that developed great products but the shareholders never got a penny in dividends and the final shareholders have paper worth zero   take a look at research in motion for example creating the blackberry has to be one of the biggest successes in tech over the last decade however has the shareholders gotten any richer only if they traded amongst themselves nobody got a dividend what happened to the many billions of dollars they made during the peak popularity years of blackberry it went to executives employees and was squandered on development that did not effectively defend the phone 's dominant market position now the stock price is back down to the pre prime years and if a shareholder held onto it throughout the entire period he would not have received a single penny and this is a profitable enterprise things look even more bizarre when you start looking at the tech companies that have never had a positive earnings quarter and no plans to ever have positive earnings something like pandora comes to mind often management at these more bizarre companies run the company as a toy to play with their own ideas and to issue themselves stock as compensation and of course they sell a lot of the stock to cash in before they delve into the next risky venture they have no intention of ever enriching anybody who holds into the stock in the long run if for some reason they make money they will put it all into their next toy project until one of them fails and wipes everything out   if you invest in a profitable business with reasonable management you will generally come out ahead some businesses get displaced by unpredictable circumstances and they go bankrupt but on average if a company is good at doing something and they pay out the earnings you come out ahead you get in trouble when businesses are good at something and they take all the money they make and put it into doing something they are not good at a business might only provide good cashflow for 10 20 years when the product is popular and before competitors cut into margins if that money is squandered the long term shareholder may ultimately have very terrible results the long term shareholder ends up being the guy who keeps going all in on a to win bet that is what management is doing when they bet the company on the next unproven product but eventually he gets zeroed out on one loss   this is why if you look at buffett 's investments they are all in simple businesses that spits off cash to the owner shareholder businesses like soft drinks snacks rail roads vanilla banking utility like energy companies insurance etc you might be good at judging the odds of whether a business will succeed or not aka make more money than your original investment or not but you do n't want management of that company to make a wildly different bet for you just because they are great at operating a company does n't mean they are good enough at judging odds or disciplined enough to make those bets for you i may have predicted accurately that business x will be a great success but if manage takes those profits and goes all in on business y without giving me a chance to cash out that may have results

first some general advice that i think you should consider a good rule of thumb on home buying is to wait to buy until you expect to live in the same place for at least 5 years this period of time is meant to reduce the impact of closing costs which can be 1 5 of your total buying selling price if you bought and sold in the same year for example then you might need to pay over 5 of the value of your home to realtors lawyers this means that for many people it is unwise to buy a home expecting it to be your starter home if you already are thinking about what your next presumably bigger home will look like if you buy a townhouse expecting to sell it in 3 years to buy a house you are partially gambling on the chance that increases in your 's value will offset the closing costs mortgage interest paid increases in home value are not a sure thing in many areas the total costs of home ownership are about equivalent to the total costs of renting when you factor in maintenance i notice you do n't even mention renting as an option make sure you at least consider it before deciding to buy also do n't buy a house expecting your life situation to make up the difference in your budget if you 're expecting your girlfriend to move in with you in a year that implies that you are n't living together now and maybe have n't talked about it even if she says now that she would move in within a year there 's no guarantee that things work out that way taking on a mortgage is a commitment that you need to take on yourself no one else will be liable for the payments as for whether a townhouse or a detached house helps you meet your needs better do n't get caught up in terminology there are few differences between houses that are universal are cheaper smaller and have condo associations with monthly fees to pay for maintenance on joint property but that is something that differs on a case by case basis do n't get tricked into buying a 1,100 sq ft house with a restrictive hoa instead of a 1,400 sq ft free hold townhouse just because townhouses have a certain reputation the only true difference between a house and a townhouse is that 1 or both of your walls are shared with a neighbor everything else is flexible

i think you 're really underestimating the degree of that occurs in hiring and just how much youth is in the job markets experience costs more and it depreciates quickly in most case employers   will prefer someone less experienced who comes across as mature and less expensive than someone who is more experienced but has been our of the industry for a year or more the attitude of you ca n't teach an old job new tricks rules your 30s represent the ideal sweet spot you are still young and you have some experience if you 're not in full preparing for retirement mode by 40 or 45 you 're going to have a bad time have lost most of their sweet spot and if the recovery does n't happen they will have lost all of it    yes millenials have it pretty bad too no one is disputing that but genx was screwed from the start we have larger generations on either side of us we are a transitional generation that started out before computers went mainstream but ended after so we have a hard time competing with millenials who have lived with technology all their life the whole structure of the world changed right under us i.e. the end of the cold war and this change significantly increased available labour even before 2008 the talk was all about how screwed the where because of the power of boomers and the dominance of the millenials we already had our backs up against the wall then 2008 struck   also i 'd much rather be 28 and looking for a job than 40 + and looking for one it 's so much easier to jump industries or cites or countries when younger and you do n't have children to look after the 28 year old is not locked a career path and has lost a ton of political capital and credibility for having lost their job the 40 + year old will always have to face questions why was n't he she one of the one the company kept during the layoffs will he she be able to learn and adapt to the new job will he she be comfortable reporting to someone younger will he she be will to sacrifice time away from kids to work longer hours to compete with younger employees

this is a common occurrence when somebody has multiple jobs in one year the employer ca n't know if you have reached the annual limit they know to stop when you have hit the maximum for their company but do n't have information on the other jobs in fact the irs does n't let them factor in the other jobs they have to keep making their payment until you hit the max for their company when you fill out the 1040 there will be a line that checks that the total social security amount for each person was not over the annual limit the extra will be refunded when you file your taxes in the future if this happens again you can adjust your withholding to minimize the overage for the example given in the question to get the 4 k extra sooner increase the number of allowances on the w-4   you can under withhold federal income tax because you will over withhold social security tax

tl;dr please please please do the conversion first joetaxpayer 's answer is correct but i am of the opposite opinion first there 's just about no reason to have post tax dollars in a traditional ira   you 'll eventually have to pay tax on the earnings those dollars generate so it 's essentially the same as having that money in a regular taxable account   meanwhile if you roll those dollars into a roth ira you get to earn tax free money on them for the rest of your life and even after your death second even if you did have some reason for keeping those post tax dollars where they are the last thing you ever want to do is mix them with pre tax dollars from say your 401k   as soon as you mix them all the dollars become subject to pro rata taxation as joe mentioned so any future decision you were planning to make about what to do with just your post tax dollars is moot you have given away your right to think separately about your pre- and post tax dollars as an example let 's say the accounts you want to combine look like this in the future you decide you want to move $ 2,000 from the above account into a roth   because you mixed the money the irs insists that your rollover consists of so now you owe tax and it 's regular income tax i believe not even capital gains tax on $ 1,500   that was money that you away specifically to avoid taxes and now you 've gone and paid taxes on it   now there are valid arguments for intentionally moving pre tax dollars from a traditional to a roth like this but the point is that you should n't even have to be having that argument you have post tax dollars in your traditional ira that almost certainly belong in a roth   by mixing your 401k into your traditional ira you can no longer do anything with just the post tax dollars   the irs will forever insist that you do these pro rated calculations say in the future you suddenly realize that a roth is much better for your financial situation than a traditional ira   or you might still prefer a traditional ira but as explained in the next sentence it 's not available to you   unfortunately because you 're covered by a new 401k or maybe because you earn too much money to contribute pre tax dollars to either a traditional or roth ira you 're out of luck   you 're simply not allowed to contribute to a roth most people in this situation can make use of what 's called a back door roth   they contribute up to the maximum amount per year $ 5,500 or whatever it is now post tax to a traditional ira and then immediately roll it over to their roth   you can still try this but guess what   yep because you 're mixing these new post tax dollars with pre tax money in your traditional ira every year your rollover will be tainted with that pre tax money diluting the whole point of the back door roth   you 'll be paying taxes on money you never wanted to pay taxes on and you 'll be leaving post tax money behind in your traditional ira if it sounds like i 'm annoyed about this situation from personal experience it 's because i am by doing the conversion first you never mix pre- and post tax money and your money goes where you want it of course assuming you eventually do roll over your 401(k into a traditional ira the really annoying consequence above will still plague you but at least you 'll have cleanly converted that first post tax amount

i have done this for years and have been quite successful at it two reason i even need to do this desire to pay for engagement ring and pay for 150 person wedding without using my nest egg savings   you need to keep a document that details when the free aprs run out and you need to setup automatic payments of the minimum balance from your checking account so you ensure you do not miss a payment   you need to understand when you are going to need to make big purchases of homes apartments cars so that you can ensure you are n't doing this right before your credit score is being checked need to leave 12 months without opening new accounts before doing this   i have been able to finance about $ 60,000 worth of unsecured debt paying between 3 5 interest per year we have an unsecured credit line with citibank that charges 14 and is capped at $ 10,000 and discover personal loans charge around 14 as well in pre paid interest   i would say all things considering that this is a great deal if you do n't have a secured line of credit with a low interest rate   it is something however that if you are n't diligent can get away from you from my experience i would rather pay a small amount of interest while allowing my savings and retirement to grow interest hopefully greater than 3 5 than pay the huge expense and start from zero but if you miss a single payment on a 0 apr balance transfer they charge you all back interest concessions plus charge you a penalty rate   like many of the other posts you need discipline to make this work

in addition to those who are wealthy not the same as high income there are also a certain number of people whose professional livelihood is enhanced by projecting wealth income they may or may not have for example some consultants lawyers financial advisors or other salespeople the same is true of luxury homes for industries where entertaining clients and associates is expected these people are essentially making an educated bet that the additional sales they expect to make will outweigh the additional expense of the luxury items similar to purchasing advertising but in many cases people are either living beyond their current income or living beyond their long term income by failing to save for when they are too old sick to work additionally many car brands that we traditionally associate with luxury have created mid priced lines in the $ 30 40 k range recently so it is possible that some of the cars you are seeing are not as expensive as you might expect

the statistics are misleading the german do not make $ that is basically a $ 140k job back in 2009 some sensationalist articles said that the average worker made $ sitting in the jobs bank that is taking the total labor cost and dividing it by the number of existing employees the most obvious example of why this number is so lopsided is through health care benefits and pensions you get the illusion that the auto worker gets paid very high when labor cost per employee is very high but the labor cost actually includes the current worker 's cost as well as some past worker 's costs so it gets double counted   so yes gm went bankrupt because labor costs were $ no the auto worker did not make $ 75 per hour and yes labor costs for the german workforce is a lot higher than the us workforce but no they do n't actually get paid 2 3x more

gt;despite nothing dishonest about it you are doing nothing but splitting hairs here why is beyond me   you are generalizing because it helps your narrative that 's why i am specifically explaining to you why vice is more serious than what you 're diminishing it to   gt;if that was the case you would been able to refute it you yet to been able to do so all you have done is make claims of my logic being faulty which you have totally and utterly failed to show   i did refute it i the validity of your underlying premise by criticizing it as being fallacious based on faulty reasoning i cited the fallacy which your argument is a quintessential example of without some sort of counter argument that undermines the validity of my challenging argument your argument is refuted you 're just denying it and acting like a denial is as good as being logically sound   gt;lol what mistake you act like you are this logical and yet i have successfully taking down your logic while you totally failed to destruct mine all you are doing now argument wise is but but but but but you do n't realize what vice releases on their website is representative of all of their content claiming they have good content when their content is on the level of buzzfeed is outright laughable to say the least you claim your well verse in your media readings but yet you continue to defend vice as being quality content tooth and nail despite agreeing with me that the article was crap i highly doubt you can link me an article you think is high quality from vice   you made a sweeping generalization you never refuted it you denied it and ignored it and failed to address it you cited a promo for an episode of a entertainment show as an investigative reporting story from vice news a sister channel and now you 're doubling down suggesting that a tv show promo is somehow representative of a separate entity 's investigative reporting that 's like saying a promo for 's 1995 captain planet and the is representative of cnn reporting laughing so hard at you right now article reports suggest body cameras are only effective when cops turn them off article the of weed child porn and a on a plane and story exclusive tried to tell nsa about his concerns

call the credit card company you used to fund the account and file claims against each transaction used to top up the entropay account   file it either as merchandise not received or in your case it sounds like unauthorized transaction would be appropriate as well   your real credit card company will lodge the dispute and get your money back usually will credit your account back within a couple of days   be sure to follow up with your credit card company as they usually send you some forms to fill out and sign before they finalize the claim

i am perfectly qualified to not use an accountant   i am a business professor and my work crosses over into accounting quite a bit   i would certainly find a cpa that is reputable and hire them for advice before starting   i know a physicist who did n't do that and found they ended up with $ in fines   there are a number of specific things an accountant might provide that quickbooks will not   first and foremost they are an outsider 's set of eyes   if they are good they will find a polite way to say you want to do what   if they are good they wo n't fall out of their chair their jaw wo n't drop to the floor and they wo n't until they get home a good accountant has seen around a hundred successful and unsuccessful businesses   they have seen everything you may have thought of   intelligence is learning from your own mistakes wisdom is learning from the mistakes of others   accountants are the of wisdom an accountant can point out weaknesses in your plan and help you shore it up   they can provide information about the local market that you may not be aware of   they can assist you with understanding the long run consequences of the legal form that you choose   they can assist you in understanding the trade offs of different funding models   they can also do tasks that you are not talented at and which will take a lot of time if you do it and little time if they do it there is a reason that accountants are required to have 160 semester hours to sit for the cpa   they also have to have a few thousand field hours before they can sit for it as well there is one thing you may want to keep in mind though   an accountant will often do what you ask them to do so think about what you want before you visit the accountant   also remember to ask the question is there a question i should have asked but did n't

i am not a lawyer nor a tax accountant so if such in here i 'll gladly defer but my understanding is   if you 're involved and living together you 're considered a household and thus your finances are deemed shared for tax purposes any money your partner gives you toward paying the bills is not considered rent but her contribution to household expenses i do n't know the but i 'll call your partner her for convenience this is not income and is not taxed on the off chance that the irs actually investigated your arrangement do n't call any money she gives you rent call it her contribution to living expenses if you were two or more random people sharing a condo purely for economic reasons i.e. you are not a family in any sense but each of you would have trouble affording a place on your own it 's common for all the room mates to share the rent or mortgage utilities etc but for one person to collect all the money and write one check to the landlord etc tax law does not see this as the person who writes the check collecting rent from the others it 's just a book keeping convenience and so there is no taxable transaction of course the landlord owes taxes on the rental income but that 's not your problem in that case it likely would be different if one person outright owned the place and really was charging the others rent but then he could claim deductions for all the expenses of maintaining it including depreciation so if it really was a case of room mates sharing expenses the taxable income would likely be just about zero anyway so short answer if you really are a couple there are no taxable transactions here if the irs should actually question it do n't refer to it as collecting rent or any other words that imply this is a business arrangement describe it as a couple sharing expenses people sometimes have created tax problems for themselves by their choice of words in an audit but the chance that you would ever be audited over something like this is probably remote i suppose that if at some point you break up but you continue to live together for financial reasons or whatever reasons that could transform this into a business relationship and that would change my answer

i completely agree we 're a specialized company that focuses on doing things right not just throwing up a web page we see high conversion rate increases trust me we 're not a one and done shop we know what we 're doing and we know that the value of our work is $ 2500 baseline sure we can install wordpress and a stock theme while throwing up content for the person while installing some standard seo plugins for $ 1000   and landing pages are something we never recommend doing without our clients knowing that they are n't cheap landing pages need to be combined with other marketing tasks they wo n't convert people who do n't go to them and it 's ridiculous to think that you 've optimized conversion right away we always strongly recommend a b testing at the start of a marketing campaign for at least two weeks   plus all of that testing on the first landing page we do results in direct knowledge for any future ones resulting in lower cost and a much much much higher roi for our clients   so yeah i agree with you on the most designers comment but i would argue that is n't necessarily a good idea to do you get what you pay for i suppose

you want to know if you should pay cash or use a credit card like cash there are so many benefits to the card like purchase protection cash back and postponed payments that there needs to be a really good reason to pay cash   if you are concerned about the 10 threshold ask your credit card company to raise your limit   if you are indifferent let the merchant decide for you by asking for a discount if you pay cash   the biggest reason is that credit cards when handled make your money work for you by keeping it in less liquid higher interest investments like inflation adjusted t bills you will still be able to access it by using the credit card to float large expenses without liquidating at a loss investment accounts like schwab one are great for this since you can borrow cash at a low interest rate against your securities until your security sale clears

i strongly urge you against this despite the fact that you may enjoy lucrative interest rates in the short run considering the reckless usage of deposits and other public monies to build buildings just to claim that gdp is high they count the cost of real estate as investment not their final sales as the rest of the world does all depositors in chinese banks stand to lose or at least have their funds frozen since all credit funding the real estate building comes from the banks and taxes land to a lesser degree china 's reckless building east asian crisis chapters 11 12 this can be prolonged if they open their financial system to outside funding but that will also amplify the effect

you should start by making a written complaint to the insurance company itself you have two angles of attack what was discussed when she was sold the policy make sure you set out exactly what you believe you were told and highlight that they did n't ask about commuting assuming that 's the case ask them to preserve any recordings they have of the call and to send you a copy the nature of the journey where the accident happened from the description unless it was part of a journey to and from work there 's no good reason for them to classify it as commuting make sure you make good written notes now of anything that happened verbally phone calls etc and keep doing this as the process goes along if that written complaint does n't work your next step is to go to the financial ombudsman who are a neutral service if the ombudsman does n't support your case you could go to court directly but it 'll be expensive and a lot of effort and by this stage it 'd be unlikely you would win the ombudsman 's rejection would n't count against you directly but it 'd be a strong indication that your case is weak see for a more detailed walk through

easiest thing ever in fact 99 of people are loosing money if you perform worse then 10 annually in cash average over 5 10 years then you better never even think about trading investing most people are sitting at -5 annually they win some loose some and are being by inflation and commissions in fact fall of market is not a big deal stock indexes are often jump back in a few months if you rebalance properly it is mitigated your much bigger enemy is inflation if you think inflation is small look at gold price over past 20 years some people winners at first grow to + 10 get too relaxed and start to grow already lost position that one loose trade eats 10 of their portfolio only there that people realize they should cut it off when they already lost their profits and they start again with + 0 this is hard thing to accept but most of people are not made for that type of business even worse they think if i had bigger budget i would perform better which is kind of self lie

the statistic you cited comes from the federal reserve board 's survey of consumer finances a survey that they do every three years most recently in 2013   this was reported in the september 2014 issue of the federal reserve bulletin   they list the percentage of americans with any type of debt as in 2013 down slightly from in 2010 the bulletin also has a table with a breakdown of the types of debt that people have and primary residence mortgages are at the top of the list   so the answer is yes the 75 statistic includes americans with home mortgages the bigger question is are you really in debt if you have a home mortgage   the answer to that is also yes   when you take out a mortgage you really do own the house   you decide who lives there you decide what changes you are going to make to it and you are responsible for the upkeep   but the mortgage debt you have is secured by the house   this means that if you refuse to pay the bank is allowed to take possession of the house   they do n't even get the whole house though they will sell it to recoup their losses and give you back whatever equity you had in the house after the loan is satisfied is it good debt   many people think that if you are borrowing money to purchase an appreciating asset the debt is acceptable   with this definition a car loan is bad credit card debt is very bad and a home mortgage might be okay   even dave ramsey radio host and champion of the debt free lifestyle is not opposed to home mortgages   home mortgages allow people to purchase a home that they would otherwise be unable to afford interestingly according to the bulletin credit card balances were only included as debt for the survey purposes if there was a balance after the most recent bill was paid not including purchases made after the bill   so people that do not carry a balance on their credit card were not considered in debt in this statistic

i know your pain oh so much   i literally have a 14 gallon container full of i have received   even worse for profit fundraising companies send most of those mailings they take the money and deduct their expenses rigged to consume all your gift   some companies have been caught passing as little as 9 to the charity   first let 's talk about a few issues   authentication   is that outfit really a tax deductible charity    address    is this their genuine address or is it the dropbox of a scammer or one of those evil for profit fundraising companies   acknowledgement    for gifts over a certain size you need a thank you letter from them to show the irs that you really donated   will you get it   the limit is $ 250 no letter deduction rejected but as a practical thing it helps in an audit to show as many donation letters as possible   charities can not issue them retroactively but can issue you second copies of ones they sent previously if the charity drops the ball you lose   obviously enough you go to the post office and spend $ 1 on a money order      this does not authenticate them as a charity it does not assure it goes to their real address   you can do both these things yourself by checking their data on the irs website or on you do n't get an acknowledgement   i mention these because donation websites work much the same way require a higher one time commitment but are much simpler and more efficient after that if you are planning to give $ 5000 in a single year save it up and open a donor advised fund account   a daf is itself a charity    you donate to the daf and take the tax deduction for charitable   then you tell the daf to donate it to other charities on your behalf or anonymously    their concept is you use the daf as a buffer so you can easily make the tax deductible donation when you need to for tax purposes then at your leisure research charities and support them   however i asked my daf most people donate and then immediately re donate the money leaving the fund at zero balance   my daf does n't mind that at all and they charge zero fees for this    its expenses are paid by those of us who leave money sitting around in the daf   mine charges 0.6 a year   this money can be invested sort of like in a 401 k and each investment also has an expense ratio such as 0.18 a year in my chosen index fund   websites like will take any amount of your money and re donate it to the charity you select    they deduct 3 5 for their expenses notably paper stamps and the 2 3 it costs them to process your credit card

i would n't like to say either way what you should do not being an financial advisor or lawyer but i did find an interesting article on walk away from your mortgage   that you might also find helpful to frame your decision it has some interesting information on defaults it says this mortgage holders do sign a promissory note which is a promise to pay but the contract explicitly details the penalty for nonpayment surrender of the property the borrower is n’t escaping the consequences he is suffering them in some states lenders also have recourse to the assets like their car and savings accounts a study by the federal reserve bank of richmond found that defaults are lower in such states apparently because lenders threaten the borrowers with judgments against their assets but actual lawsuits are rare and given that nearly a quarter of mortgages are underwater and that 10 percent of mortgages are delinquent white of the university of arizona is surprised that more people have n’t walked he thinks the desire to avoid shame is a factor as are overblown fears of harm to credit ratings probably homeowners also labor under a delusion that their homes will quickly return to value white has argued that the government should stop default scare stories and indeed should encourage borrowers to default when it ’s in their economic interest this would correct a prevailing imbalance homeowners operate under a powerful moral constraint while lenders are trying to maximize profits more important it might get the system if lenders feared an avalanche of strategic defaults they would have an incentive to renegotiate loan terms in theory this could produce a wave of loan modifications the very goal the treasury has been pursuing to end the crisis

ach transfers are the evolution of paper check clearing houses transactions are conducted in bulk and do not immediately settle the drawer and still retain liability for a period of days or weeks after the transaction date i 'd suggest looking to the legal definition of a check or draft to understand this better a for fee wire transfer still goes through an intermediary but settle immediately and irrevocably wire transfers are analogous to handing cash to someone   in the us the various federal reserve banks are involved because they are the central banks of the the united states   in the past bank panics were started or exacerbated when banks would refuse to honor drafts drawn on other banks of questionable stability imagine what would happen today if your electric company refused to accept bank of america or citibank 's check ach transactions would n't you get withdraw every penny you could from boa during the 1907 banking panic many solvent banks collapsed when the system of bank subscriptions ie arrangements where small town banks would subscribe to large commercial banks for check clearing etc broke down farmers small business people and individuals lost everything all because the larger banks would not or could not risk holding drafts checks from the smaller banks

in my experience no cash transactions are the best deal take your portuguese credit card get some cash $ 60 for emergencies only pay with your credit card it 's much cheaper because it 's all virtual   the best would be to set up an american bank account and transfer the money there you can also get paypal account they offer credit cards too the virtual banks credit unions are the best option because they do n't charge you for transactions they do n't have expenses with keeping actual money find some credit union that accepts foreigners and take it from there you can exchange your money on the airport because it 's in tax free zone i recommend the country of the currency since they sell you their and you are buying dollars not selling euros make sure to find out what is the best deal

you can think of a free cash flow as dividends from operations fcf = cash from operations investment in operations the present value of these cash flows into the future is the value of the firm dcf is very much like the dividend discount model    now why does a dcf produce enterprise value and not equity value because a dcf values the firm 's operating assets to find the equity value you use the accounting relation assets = liabilities + equity or in financial terms net operating assets = net financial obligations + common stockholders equity this means you take away net debt from the value produced by the dcf to find equity   now all your excess cash is netted off against your financial obligations debt to find the net debt cash used for day to day operations is an operating asset and should be treated as such operating cash should not deducted from value of assets when finding the value of equity   at least that 's what they 're teaching at university now i 'm a uni student who 's just finished my business valuation subject

your business can be promoted by its buy instagram followers pendant but the question is how can you make authentic instagram pendant for business for example if you join instagram and only have 100 followers it is not enough because another company offers services similar to the ones you join and you have thousands of followers it can be pushed aside as people tend to move with companies with a large successor base they are moving into a business where a great class of people are spinning therefore to get organic trailers you need to have more trailers   if you promote the business based in the united states then you need to search all the companies online with the key instagram buyers name the country and you will see a lot of prestigious companies that can help you buy real instagram trailers

a distribution is typically a return of capital in other words you 're getting money back that you 've contributed previously and thus would have been taxed upon in previous years when those funds were first to you distributions are nontaxable so they do not represent income from capital gains but do effect your cost basis when determining the capital gain loss once that capital gain loss is realized as an example publicly traded real estate investment trusts reits generally distribute a return of capital back to shareholders throughout the year as a distribution this is a return of a portion of the shareholder 's original capital investment not a share of the reits profits so it is simply getting a portion of your original investment back and thus is not income being received i like to refer to it as new income to differentiate however the return of capital does change the cost basis of the original investment so if one were to then sell the shares of the reit in this example the basis of the original investment has to be adjusted by the distributions received over the course of ownership in other words the cost basis will be reduced when the shares are sold i 'm wondering if the op could give us some additional information about his her s corp what type of business is it in the course of its business and trade activity does it buy and sell securities stocks etc does it sell assets or business property does it own interests in other corporations or partnerships sales of those interests are one form of capital gain long term capital gains are taxed at rates lower than ordinary income but the irs has very specific rules as to what constitutes a capital gain loss i hate to answer a question with a question but we need a little more information before we can weigh in on whether you have actual capital gains or losses in the course of your s corporation trade

with all due respect to the david the $ 1000 is best put against 20%+ debt no sitting in checking as part of some emergency fund   i 'd agree with the decision to pay off the lower rate card why because we can do the math and can see the cost in doing so low enough that other factors come in namely a freed up card that card can function as the emergency one in the short term long term once these high rate cards are paid off you 'll build your proper emergency fund but the cost is too high right now   the $ 4000 is a nice start but the most important thing is to get your budget under control only you can decide how much you can cut back and go after this debt as if it were life or death

just like pete for me a simple budget is good my budget is probably more complicated than some but for medical expenses i only have one budget item titled medical   however if you 've already been breaking it out further than that and you are happy with it there is no need to change now   something you can do is to separate your budget categories from your money accounts here 's what i mean let 's say that last year at this time before the fsa you had $ 500 total allocated to your various medical budget categories this year you can do the same the only difference is that $ 300 of that just happens to be in your fsa and $ 200 is in whatever account you kept your medical money in last year then when you have your next medical expense you 'll subtract it from one of your medical budget categories which tells you how much you have left to spend on medical expenses and you 'll also subtract it from whichever account you actually spent the money so you know your current account balances you 'll want to spend your fsa money first since it 's use it or lose it if that seems like a lot of work a good budgeting software program such as ynab everydollar or mvelopes will do most of the accounting for you separating your budget category balances from your bank balances they allow you to split up your money without having to worry about which account you are paying from

here in the u.s. a realtor can act as a seller 's agent or a buyer 's agent i think what you are calling a broker in the u.s. we call a buyer 's agent and this may just be a difference in terminology from your post it sounds like the concept is the same i am answering from a u.s. perspective please let me know if something does n't make sense in the israeli context here each typically gets 3 to 3.5 of the sale price at least in my part of the country so yes the buyer 's agent has an incentive to get a higher price even though this is contrary to the interests of the person he is supposed to represent on the other hand the buyer 's agent has a strong incentive to find a house at a price that you consider acceptable if the absolute most you are willing to pay is say and he keeps showing you houses that cost he 's just wasting his time he 's wasting your time too of course but let 's assume he does n't care about that i do n't know what housing prices are in israel today just making up numbers suppose he has two houses that he can show you one in your price range and one not if he shows you the first you may buy it and we will very quickly get his commission if he shows you the second you probably wo n't buy it and he 'll get zero if he keeps showing you houses above your price range he 's doing a bunch of work for which he will never be paid the worst case from your point of view is if you 're thinking that you 're expecting and prepared to pay say to and you tell the broker that his incentive is to concentrate on the upper end maybe even push it a little but still if he shows a house that 's well within your range so you 'll quickly buy he can get today versus trying to push you to go higher so he can maybe get in a few months is the extra worth several months of extra work probably not personally i 've never had a problem with a realtor trying to push me to buy a house more expensive than i said i was prepared to pay at least not that i noticed maybe they were very skillful at it and i did n't realize they were doing it like showing me houses that were totally run down dumps until i decided i was willing to pay more as to your specific suggestion i do n't know if a realtor would be willing to negotiate an alternative deal from their standard contract i 've never tried to do such a thing yes this would give him an incentive to find the lowest possible price arguably this would create a perverse incentive to show you houses of very low quality just because they 're cheap and there would be the problem that he 'd have no incentive to show you houses at or just over your stated maximum as his commission would be zero negative if it goes over slightly what i did on my last house was tell the realtor i want to start by looking at houses costing under if i ca n't find anything i like i 'll go a little higher by not telling the realtor my maximum i discouraged her from immediately going for the maximum at least that was my theory

if you are looking for an advisor to just build a portfolio and then manage it a robo advisor can be beneficial especially if the alternative is doing it your self assuming that you are not well versed in the markets the primary risk with one is that it does not build a portfolio that accurately represents your needs and risk tolerance some firms base the number of questions they ask you on sign up based not on what is needed to get a good profile but on how many before people decide that it is too much hassle and bail that usually results in poorer profiles also a live advisor may be better at really getting at your risk tolerance many of day our risk tolerance is one thing but in reality we are not so risk tolerant   once the profile is built the algorithms maintain your portfolio on a day by day basis if rebalancing opportunities occur they take advantage of it   the primary benefit of a robo advisor is lower fees or smaller minimum account balances the downside is the lack of human interaction and financial advise outside of putting together a portfolio

citizens of india who are not residents to india have nri status are not entitled to have ordinary   savings accounts in india if you have such accounts e.g. left them behind to support your family while you are abroad they need to be converted to nro nonresident ordinary accounts as soon as possible your bank will have forms for completion of this process   any interest that these accounts earn will be taxable income to you in india and possibly in the u.k. too though tax treaties or double taxation avoidance agreements generally allow you to claim credit for taxes paid to other countries now with regard to your question nris are entitled to make deposits into nro accounts as well as nre nonresident external accounts the differences are that money deposited into an nre account though converted to indian rupees can be converted back very easily to foreign currency if need be however the re conversion is at the exchange rate then in effect and you may well lose that 10 interest earned because of a change in exchange rate   devaluation of the indian rupee as occurred several times in the past 70 years   once upon a time it was essentially impossible to take money in an nro account and convert it to foreign currency but under the new recently introduced schemes money in an nro account can also be converted to foreign currencies but it needs certification by a ca and various forms to be filled out and thus is more hassle interest earned by the money in an nre account is not taxable income in india but is taxable income in the u.k. there is no taxable event neither in u.k. nor in india when you change an ordinary savings account held in india into an nro account or when you deposit money from abroad into an nre or nro account in an indian bank what is taxable is the interest that you receive from the indian bank in the case of an nro account what is deposited into your nro account is the interest earned less the indian income tax usually 20 deducted at the source tds and sent to the income tax authority on your behalf in the case of an nre account the full amount of interest earned is deposited into the nre account no tds whatsoever   it is your responsibility to declare these amounts to the u.k. income tax authority hm revenue and pay any taxes due finally you say that you recently moved to the u.k. for a job if this is a temporary job and you might be back in india very soon all the above might not be applicable to you since you would not be classified as an nri at all

i may be underestimating your knowledge of how exchanges work if so i apologize   if not then i believe the answer is relatively straightforward lets say price of a stock at time t1 is 15 $   there are many types of price that an exchange reports to the public as discussed below let 's say that you 're referring to the most recent trade price   that is the last time a trade executed between a willing buyer and a willing seller was at $ 15.00 lets say a significant buy order of 1 m shares came in to the market here i believe might be a misunderstanding on your part   i think you 're assuming that the buy order must necessarily be requesting a price of $ 15.00 because that was the last published price at time t1   in fact orders can request any price they want   it 's totally okay for someone to request to buy at $ 10.00   presumably nobody will want to sell to him but it 's still a perfectly valid buy order but let 's continue under the assumptions that at t1 this makes the bid $ and the ask $ 15.00   nyse also publishes these prices there are n't enough people selling that stock it 's quite rare in major us equities for anyone to place a buy order that exceeds the total available shares listed for sale at all prices   what i think you mean is that 1 m is larger than the amount of currently listed sell requests at the ask of $ 15.00 so say of the 1 m only 100,000 had a matching sell order and others are waiting so this means that there were exactly 100,000 shares waiting to be sold at the ask of $ 15.00 and that all other sellers currently in the market told nyse they were only willing to sell for a price of $ 15.01 or higher   if there had been more shares available at $ 15.00 then nyse would have matched them this would be a trigger to the automated system to start increasing the price here is another point of misunderstanding i think   nyse 's automated system does not invent a new higher price to publish at this point   instead it simply reports the last trade price still $ 15.00 and now that all of the willing sellers at $ 15.00 have been matched nyse also publishes the new ask price of $ 15.01   it 's not that nyse has decided $ 15.01 is the new price for the stock it 's that $ 15.01 is now the lowest price at which anyone known to nyse is willing to sell   if nobody happened to be interested in selling at $ 15.01 at t1 but there were people interested in selling at $ then the new published ask would be $ instead of $ 15.01 not because nyse decided it but just because those happened to be the facts at the time similarly the new bid is most likely now $ 15.00 assuming the person who placed the order for 1 m shares did not cancel the remaining unmatched 900,000 shares of his her order   that is $ 15.00 is now the highest price at which anyone known to nyse is willing to buy how much time does the automated system wait to increment the price the frequency of the price change and by what percentage to increment etc so i think the answer to all these questions is that the automated system does none of these things   it merely publishes information about a the last trade price b the price that is currently the lowest price at which anyone has expressed a willingness to sell and c the price that is currently the highest price at which anyone has expressed a willingness to buy edit oh i forgot to answer your primary question can we estimate the impact of a large buy order on the share price not only can we estimate the impact but we can know it explicitly   because the exchange publishes information on all the orders it knows about anyone tracking that information can deduce that in this example there were exactly 100,000 shares waiting to be purchased at $ 15.00   so if a large buy order of 1 m shares comes in at $ 15.00 then we know that all of the people waiting to sell at $ 15.00 will be matched and the new lowest ask price will be $ 15.01 or whatever was the next lowest sell price that the exchange had previously published

as a follow up i was able to find a bank that gave me a loan i just called several banks listed on yelp and one ended up working with me it is also possible that the previous banks misunderstood me and assumed i was 1099 and not w2 i made it very clear to this guy that i was w2 and there was absolutely no problem also it turned out the recruiter i work for has special paperwork their employees can give to lenders to verify w2 employment so i have been in my condo since january and the condo was a little under $ 250k. anyway i still think it 's absolutely ridiculous that banks would not give a loan to a web developer who is in super high demand and making well over 100k year even if i am 1099 i have never ever in my life been late on a single payment for anything and i have an 800 credit score to even question that i could not make payments is ludicrous whenever i put my resume on just one web site i receive about 20 phone calls daily and i am not exaggerating even slightly

this is most likely protecting square 's relationship with visa mastercard amex etc credit card companies typically charge their customers a much higher interest rate with no grace period on cash advances withdrawals made from an atm using a credit card if you use square to generate something that looks like a merchandise transaction but instead just hand over a wad of banknotes you 're forcing the credit card company to apply their cheaper purchases interest rate on the transaction plus award any applicable cashback etc square would absolutely profit off of this but since it would result in less revenue for the partner credit card companies that would quickly sour the relationship and could even result in them terminating their agreements with square altogether this is the kind of activity they are trying to prevent   1 bill yourself $ 5,000 for merchandise but instead give yourself cash   2 earn 1.5 cashback $ 75   3 use $ of the cash and a $ 75 statement credit to pay your credit card statement   4 pocket the difference   5 repeat note the fees involved probably negate any potential gain shown in this example but i 'm sure with enough creative thinking someone would figure out a way to game the system if it was n't expressly forbidden in the terms of service

someone asked this over in /r they were asking how to profit off nv specifically but here 's what i wrote there i 'd be curious what you guys think   gt go back in time about 6 mo case the medical scene for movers and write some proposals to help them expand traditional banks wo n't touch financing these guys with a 10 ft stick right now the fed has told them straight up they will lose fdic membership if they touch drug money cough cough tobacco and alcohol do n't count cough cough if you do n't have a time machine either come up with a way to be a bank to these guys without going to a fed lockup or go finance expansion in the next state which it 's gon na be a while until these guys get integrated with the regular money system to the point they have stocks and such or maybe the fed freezing them out as they make a fortune will just push forward crypto currency and the collapse of the current money oligarchy who knows   there was also some comments about shipping from nv to home states which is probably a bad idea for many reasons i did however feel i can offer some insight on a legal president for this kind of behavior   but exactly how legal to avoid direct shipping of a purchase to a state is i mean once it 's your proper legal property and you 're just shipping it to yourself that does seem legal right or if it would get the same blind eye when done with pot are huge unknowns   gt;i'm sure the feds will not see a problem with sending drugs to yourself across state lines actually funny enough i live in the wine region of ca and there is a whole business here of wine storage and shipping places it 's up to the states to decide how or if they allow alcohol to be shipped into their state from others and a bunch of state have very complex rules or just do n't allow it so if you come out here for tourism drink some wine at a like it and ask if you can have some shipped home the answer is about 50/50 to be no and if you 're a average income that 's your answer if you 're some rich dude however you can say ah gotcha pesky laws well here 's the address of my storage and shipping place send the 2 cases there then nobody bats an eye and off the cases go guy goes home calls up the shipping place and says hey pull those cases my personal property and ship them to me and somehow magically this is now legal i have no idea who 's taking on the liability here if the shipping place has them sign off we will ship wherever you ask it 's not our job to verify the legality of your request then i guess it 's on the consumer but if you have an entire business built around circumventing state law it would seem to me that this should be a legal problem but wine is a high end commodity rich people make their own rules and if ca turns a blind eye to this practice they get to collect the sales tax as it 's sold in ca and shipped to a location in ca whereas fighting it would hurt their tourism and also send the tax income to the states being shipped to baby   re reading this now i 'm not even sure if there is a liability here they bought the property in ca paid tax in ca and had it sent to a mailing address in ca what they do after that with their personal property is not the states business right i 'd imagine this would be drastically different if shipping for resale similarly i think this all only works if you complete the transaction while physically in the state so at most this might turn on some weed tourism   the big difference in all of this is that the fed is fine with alcohol but not weed so while i suspect someone will form such a weed storage and shipping place at some point i do n't really want to be first in line to see how this and if it lands you in trouble with the fed

i do n't know whether you 'd consider buying a single bond instead of a fund strips are treasuries where the coupons have been stripped to produce debt instruments with a fixed maturity date they pay zero interest their value comes from the fact that you buy them at a price less than 100 and they are worth exactly 100 at some point in the future you can buy them with any year month that you wish they are backed by the federal government and are considered to have no default risk like most bonds the price is actually a percentage and they mature at a 100 the one that expires costs and returns 100 on the expiration date the price list is here there 's more information about them here first of all they are still t bonds in all but the most    sense which means they are the safest most risk free investment    possible the u.s. federal government has stellar credit and a record    of never defaulting these bonds have no call features so the timing and distribution of    bond payments can not be altered by any foreseeable occurrence they are sold at a known and generally deep discount off a known    face value that can be redeemed at a known date so buyers know    exactly how much they will earn from an investment in strips

the absolute best advice i ever received was this   you will need three categories of savings in your life 1 retirement savings   this is money you put away in and iras for the time in your life when you can no longer earn enough income to support yourself you do not borrow against it nor do you withdraw from it in emergencies or to buy a house   2 savings   this is money you put back in case of serious events events like prolonged job loss extended illness loss of home severe and significant loss of transportation very large loss or damage you do not take trips to the bahamas or buy diamond rings with this money   3 urgent relatively small   need savings this is the savings you can use from time to time use it for bills that arise unexpectedly unforseen shortfalls in your budget needed repairs such as car repairs and small appliance repairs surprising fines fees and bills   put 10 of your income into each category of savings 10 intro retirement savings another separate 10 intro savings and yet another 10 intro urgent small need savings   so as you can see already 30 of your income is already spoken for divide up the remaining 70 intro fixed i recommend 50 toward fixed expenses and variable expenses fixed includes those things that you pay once every month such as housing utilities car payment debt repayment etc variable includes discretionary things like eating out gifts and     most importantly partner with someone who is your opposite if you are a saver at heart partner with a spender if you are a spender partner with a saver   there are three rules to live by regarding the budget a no one spends any money unless it is in the budget b the budget only includes those things to which both the saver and the spender agree c the budget can and will be modified as the pay period   a budget is a plan not a means to beat the other person up plans change as new information arises a budget must be flexible the urgent use savings will help to make   the budget flexible   edit due to comments perhaps you do not have children living with you i am a saver my wife is a spender when it came time to do the budget i would forget things like the birthdays of my children school fees due next pay period shopping for christmas gifts needed new clothes and shoes for the children broken small appliances that needed to be fixed or replaced special non reoccurring house like steam cleaning the carpet gifts to relatives and friends exceptional assistance to relatives etc   as my wife was the spender she would remind me of these things perhaps   you do not have these events in your life i am glad to have these events in my life as that means that i have people in my life that i care about   what good is a fat savings account if i have no loved ones that benefit from it

the number one difference is that bank savings accounts or money market accounts allow limited checking six non atm withdrawals per month max else possible fees have fdic insurance up to $ 250,000   however do n't put that much in allow some room for interest so you never go over the $ 250,000   money market mutual funds do not enjoy fdic insurance   there may be some insurance generally against brokerage failure though but its coverage is questionable search out those details and if they apply to anything besides actual cash held at the brokerage   if the money market mutual fund is strictly invested in us treasury securities like t bills or other short term us treasury instruments it enjoys the full faith and credit of the us government fwiw but many invest in corporate instruments   if the fund has any pricing issues there might be a delay in getting paid off   extremely unlikely       number two and more importantly bank savings accounts or pay way more   you can get a bit over 1 apy now many paying 0.90 apy or higher   no money market mutual funds are close to that generally yielding a small fraction of that almost zero for us treasury mmm funds   sure 1.05 ai n't too exciting but you may as well get the most you can if holding cash and fully insured to boot

to fairly compare a comp only job to a job that offers insurance get a quote for health insurance call your local insurance broker and find out what it would cost because if you are n't getting insurance from your employer you 'll have to get it elsewhere if you get a quote on an hsa do n't forget to add in the annual deductible as part of the cost on the espp i 'd count it as zero the rationale being that so much of your financial status is tied to your employer that you do n't really want to tie up too much more in company stock i.e. company hits hard times stock tanks and then they lay you off double whammy both your assets and income but given that i 've only been employed by companies that no longer exist in their original form my perspective may be warped

cryptocurrency is undoubtedly at the peak of gartner hype cycle but it very well could the way we use currency for our daily needs in the future   stay with me on this at present cryptocurrency appears no more than a speculation that is sugar coated by individuals who have vested interest in it however if we overlook this excitement the actual use of cryptocurrency is mind boggling    suppose you had a mid life crisis and went on a journey to the middle of the earth to find where humans supposedly originated from and you met and connected with a local coffee farmer named in a very remote part of ethiopia he invited you for an evening coffee and you obliged and six months later you for this same coffee whilst you were having another wave of existential thoughts in your that overlooked the urban jungle   suddenly you remembered that had a cheap but functional smartphone with a bitcoin wallet and afterwards you communicated with him on whatsapp and decided to enter in a transaction with him is delighted with this technology but mainly because he does not have to travel 100 km to and fro the nearest city where his bank is located and he is also happy that he can send a sack of coffee beans to his friend who lives in a land and all he needs to do is hand over the coffee sack to delivery truck en route the shipping port ultimately saving lot of his precious time and resources   now use this one example and multiply it by hundreds of millions of people around the world who have a very remote access to a but have an access to a basic smartphone imagine the possibility of connecting people like to the world and having a seamless cross border trade finance transaction using currency that is not controlled by any government   like many others i am keen to see the developments of cryptocurrency in the coming years but for now i remain that said i am more interest in the countless opportunities that will be unlocked by the very technology that is fundamental to all the cryptocurrencies the blockchain   is one branch of blockchain technology which has proved useful there are million other possibilities which i 'm sure will benefit many industries in the coming decade and i for one am very excited

so the key factor here imho is the amount we are talking about   $ 2 k is just not a lot of money   if you lose every penny you can recover   on the other hand it is unlikely to make you wealthy   so if i was you i would buy in more for the fun of it all now if it was a large amount of money that we were talking about it would be about a percentage of my net worth   for example lets say the minimum was 20 k and you really believed in the company   if i had a net worth of less than 200 k i would not do it   if i had a larger net worth i would consider it unless i was near retirement so if i was 30 hand a net worth of 300 k i would probably invest as even if i did lose it all i could recover     having said all that it does not sound like you completely agree that the company will be profitable   so in that case do n't buy also i have the opportunity to buy my own company 's stock at a discount   however i do not for two reasons   the first is i do n't like investing in the company i work for   secondly they require you to hold the stock for a year

my wife and i have done a good job teaching our daughter now 15 that one does the right thing simply because it 's the right thing to do this may not work for every child but it did for us her motivation was never punishment we explained that if she did the wrong thing it 's awful to have to live with that   on one hand 's answer is correct the stick the irs is the audit and fines i suppose from a legal standpoint we comply with laws to avoid punishment i find this to be unfortunate to get back on topic i started with an answer more appropriate to parenting because i have a very child for whom i addressed this question a decade ago the latter portion of my response helps to give tangible benefits which have value even if less than the tax you might be paying

for the future never buy a car based on the payment   when dealers start negotiating they always try to have you focus on the monthly payment   this allows them to change the numbers for your trade the price they are selling the car for etc so that they maximize the amount of money they can get   to combat this you need to educate yourself on how much total money you are willing to spend for the vehicle then if you need financing figure out what that actually works out to on a monthly basis never take out a 6 year loan   especially on a used car   if you ca n't afford a used car with at most a 3 year note paying cash is much better then you ca n't really afford that car   the longer the note term the more money you are throwing away in interest   you could have simply bought a much cheaper car drove it for a couple years then paid cash for a one with the money you saved    now as to the amount you are upside down and that you are looking at new cars   $ 1400 is n't really that bad   note yes you were taken to the cleaners   someone mentioned that banks will sometimes loan up to 20 above msrp   this is true depending on your credit but it 's a very bad idea because you are purposely putting yourself in the exact same position worse actually    however you should n't need to worry about that   it is trivial to negotiate such that you pay less than sticker for a new car while trading yours in even with that deficit   markup on vehicles is pretty insane   when i sold it was usually around 20 for foreign and up to 30 for domestic that leaves a lot of wiggle room when buying a used car most dealers ask for at least $ 3k more than what they bought them for sometimes much more than that depending on blue book loan value or what they managed to talk the previous owner out of    either way a purchase can swallow that $ 1400 without making it worse   buy accordingly

gt in many cases we are actually wasting energy by first burning coal to generate electricity only to convert it back to heat again   yes and no   you are correct in some cases   what we gain nowadays with electricity generation is lower distribution costs and flexibility   the value of that far exceeds the cost of any losses   if it did n't we would n't be using it quite as extensively

update 2013 this product is no longer available as of december 1 2010 travelex announced a product the travelex cash passport which is chip and pin protected you can buy it in the us and then load it up with either euros or british pounds there are a few things to know about this right now it is not available online at the travelex website you must purchase it in person at participating travelex retail locations i bought mine right downstairs from the stack overflow world headquarters the fees that travelex charges for foreign currency transactions will take your breath away i purchased a £ 300 card for $ which comes out to a 15 service charge travelex will give you better rates if you purchase larger amounts there is a further 3 fee if you use a credit card i used a debit card to avoid this think long and hard about whether to load it with pounds or euros they charged me 5.5 above the interbank exchange rate to spend my pound card in euros you get two cards which is very convenient you can refill the card on the web due to the high fees the chip and pin cash passport is not a good idea for everyday transactions for getting cash from an atm and certainly not for paying for big ticket items like hotels you 're going to want to reserve it for purchasing things from those automated kiosks in europe especially gas stations ticket machines in train stations and toll booths that will not work with a standard magnetic stripe card the card worked perfectly buying tickets on the tube in london i have n't had a chance to check it out in other countries

if you are looking for money to speculate in the capital markets then your brokers will already lend to you at a much more favorable rate than an outside party will for instance with $ 4,000 you could easily control $ 40,000 with many brokers at a 1 interest rate this is 10:1 leverage much like how us banks operate every dollar that you deposit with them they speculate with 10x as much interactive brokers will do this for you with your current credit score they are very reputable and clear through goldman sachs so although reputable is subjective in the investment banking world you wo n't have to worry the federal government raiding them or anything if you are investing in currencies than you can easily do 50:1 leverage as an american or as anyone else this means with only $ 400 dollars you can control $ 40,000 account if you are investing in the futures market then there are many many ways to double and triple and quadruple your leverage at the lowest interests rates any contract you enter into is a loan from the market you have to understand that if you did happen to have $ 40,000 of your own money then you could get $ account size for speculating at 1 interest again these are quick ways to lose your money and owe a lot more so i 'd really advise against it a margin call in the futures market can destroy you i advise you to just think more efficiently until you come up with a way to earn that much money initially and then speculate

forget the math 's specifics for a moment here 's some principles additional housing for a renter gives you returns in the form of money additional housing for yourself pays its returns in the form of here is a nice house live in it which do you need more of   if you do n't need the money get a nicer house for yourself if you need or want the money get a modest house for yourself and either use the other house as a rental property or invest the proceeds of its sale in the stock market but under normal circumstances + + do n't expect that buying more house for yourself is a good way to increase how much money you have it 's not + + the exception being during situations where land housing value rises quickly and when that rise is not part of a housing bubble which later collapses generally long term housing values tend to be relatively stable the real returns are from the rent or what economists call imputed rent when you 're occupying it yourself

there are some great answers on this site similar to what you asked with either a non or a us centric focus i would read those answers as well to give yourself more points of view on early investing there are a few differences between canada and the us from an investing perspective that you should also then consider namely tax rules healthcare and education i 'll get healthcare and education out of the way quickly just note the difference in perspective in canada of having government healthcare putting money into health savings plans or focusing on insurance as a workplace benefit is not a key motivating factor but more a nice to have for education it is more common in canada for a student to either pay for school while working summer part time jobs or at least taking on manageable levels of debt because it is typically not quite as expensive as private colleges in the us there is still somewhat of a culture of saving for your child 's education here but it is not as much of a necessity as it may be in the us from an investing perspective i will quickly note some common though not universal general advice before getting canadian specific i have blatantly stolen the meat of this section from ben miller 's great answer here oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing once you have a solid financial footing some of canadian investing are below for all the tax specific plans i 'm about to mention note that the banks do a very good job here of tricking you into believing they are complex and that you need your hand to be held i have gotten some criminally bad tax advice from banking reps so at the risk of sounding i recommend that you learn everything you can beforehand and only go into your bank when you already know the right answer the account types themselves just involve a few pages of paperwork to open and the banks will often do that for free they make up their fees in offering investment types that earn them management fees once the accounts are created be sure to separate the investments stocks vs bonds etc vs the investment vehicles canada has tax free savings accounts where you can contribute a certain amount of money every year and invest in just about anything you want from bonds to stocks to mutual funds any income you earn in this account is completely tax free you can withdraw these investments any time you want but you ca n't re contribute until january 1st of next year ie you invest $ 5k today in stocks held in a tfsa and they grow to $ 6k you withdraw $ 6k in july no tax is involved on january 1st next year you can re contribute a new $ 6 k and also any additional amounts added to your total limit annually tfsa 's are good for short term liquid investments if you do n't know for sure when you 'll need the money putting it in a tfsa saves you some tax but does n't commit you to any specific plan of action registered retirement savings plans allow you to contribute money based on your employment income accrued over your lifetime in canada the contributions are deducted from your taxable income in the year you make them when you withdraw money from your rrsp the amount you withdraw gets added as additional income in that year ie you invest $ 5k today in stocks held in an rrsp and get a $ 5k deduction from your taxable income this year the investments grow to $ 6k you withdraw $ 6k next year your taxable income increases by $ 6k note that if the investments were held normally outside of an rrsp you would have a taxable gain of only 50 of the total gain but withdrawing the amount from your rrsp makes the gain 100 taxable on january 1st next year you cannot this amount once withdrawn it can not be except for below items rrsp 's are good for long term investing for retirement there are a few factors at play here 1 you get an immediate tax deduction thus increasing the original size of investment by deferring tax to the withdrawal date 2 your investments compound tax free you only pay tax at the end when you withdraw not annually on earnings and 3 many people expect that they will have a lower tax rate when they retire than they do today some warnings about rrsp 's 1 they are less liquid than tfsa 's you ca n't put money in take it out and put it in again in general when you take it out it 's out and therefore useless unless you leave it in for a long time 2 income gets re characterized to be fully taxable no dividend tax credits no reduced capital gains tax rate and 3 there is no guarantee that your tax rate on retirement will be less than today if you contribute only when your tax rate is in the top bracket then this is a good bet but even still in 30 years tax rates might rise by 20 who knows meaning you could end up paying more tax on the back end than you saved in the short term home buyer plan rrsp withdrawals my single favourite piece of advice for young canadians is this if you contribute to an rrsp at least 3 months before you make a down payment on your first house you can withdraw up to $ 25k from your rrsp without paying tax to use for the down payment then over the next ~10 years you need to money back to your rrsp and you will ultimately be taxed when you finally take the money out at retirement this means that contributing up to 25k to an rrsp can multiply your savings available for a down payment by the amount of your tax rate so if you make you 'll save on your 25k deposited turning your down payment into $ getting immediate access to the tax savings while also having access to the cash for a downpayment makes the home buyer plan a solid way to make the most out of your rrsp as long as one of your near term goals is to own your own home registered pension plans are even less liquid than rrsps tax wise they basically work the same you get a deduction in the year you contribute and are taxed when you withdraw the big difference is that there are rules on when you are allowed to withdraw only in retirement barring specific circumstances typically your employer 's matching program if you have one will be inside of an note that 's and rrsp 's reduce your taxes on your employment immediately if you contribute through a work program that means you get the tax savings during the year instead of all at once a year later on april 30th note that i have attempted at all times to keep my advice current with applicable tax legislation but i do not guarantee accuracy research these things yourself because i may have missed something relevant to your situation i may be just plain wrong and tax law may have changed since i wrote this to when you read it

the implied intent is that balance transfers are for your balances not someone else 's   however i bet it would be not only allowed but also encouraged   why   because the goal of a teaser rate is to get you to borrow typically there is a balance transfer fee that allows the offering company to break even   in the unlikely event that a person does pay off the balance in the specified time frame the account and is then closed then nothing really lost its hard to find past articles i 've read as all the search engines are trying to get me to enroll in a balance transfer   however about 75 of 0 balance result in converting to a interest being accrued   if you are familiar with the amount of household credit card debt we carry as a nation that figure is very believable to answer your question i would assume they would allow it   however i would call and check and get their answer in writing   why   because if they change their mind or the representative tells you incorrectly and they find out they will convert your 0 credit card to an 18 or higher interest rate for violating the terms   same as if a payment was missed from the credit card company 's perspective they would be really smart to allow you to do this   the likelihood that your family member will pay the bill beyond two months is close to zero   the likelihood that a payment will be missed or late allowing them to convert to a higher rate is very high   this then might lead to you being overextended which would mean just more interest rates and fees   credit card company wins   i would not be surprised if they beg you to follow through on your plan from your perspective it would be a really dumb idea but as you said you knew that faced with the same situation i would just pay off one or more of the debts for the family member if i thought it would actually help them   i would also require them to have some financial accountability    its funny that once you require financial accountability for handouts most of those seeking a donation go elsewhere

new car loans used car loans and refinances have different rates because they have different risks associated with them different levels of ability to recoup losses if there is a default and different customer profiles   i 'm assuming third party lender for all of these questions not financing the dealer arranges as that has other considerations built into it a new car loan is both safer to some extent as the car is a known risk having no risk of damage etc prior to purchase but also harder to recoup losses because new cars immediately devalue significantly while used cars keep more of their value   thus the aprs are a little different in general for the same amount a new car will be a bit lower apr but of course used car loans are typically lower amounts refinance is also different customer profile wise the customer who is refinancing in these times is likely someone who is a higher risk as why are they asking for a loan when they 're mostly paid off their car   otherwise it 's fairly similar to a used car though probably a bit newer than the average used car

directors can be held responsible for the liabilities of the corporation see this wikipedia article and especially if it was clear that was the reason for the arrangement you might well find this happening that said i know a canadian who sold his house to a corporation he already owned he was doing consulting work through it at the in his opinion ridiculously high amount it had been assessed for property tax purposes the company paid and claimed any and all expenses including paying for the lawn to be and the house to be painted he lived in it at a reduced rent this rent was then income to the company in exchange for looking after it he was very happy with the arrangement he was losing the no income tax when you sell your primary residence benefit we have here but since he expected to never be able to sell it for more than the amount the company had paid he was n't worried if the company exists for no reason other than to shelter income hide you from liability and reduce your taxes then i would expect it would get you some unwanted attention and possibly some rulings you did n't like if the company exists for a real purpose and has income and expenses that outweigh whatever games you 're playing with cars and homes you might be able to achieve this you need to work out what the benefits other than liabilities would be and whether they are worth the hassle

there is no strict need to do that you can consider yourself to be consulting a 10 of your payment will be withheld and paid as tax by the company you can deduct up to 60 of your income as expenses and pay tax on the rest factoring the tax deducted at source in another approach you could register for service tax and charge service tax on your invoice and pay to the service tax department the tax calculations are similar to above it will be good if you speak to a chartered accountant and get more clarity as for business card you could print it with your name and qualification there are no restrictions on that

theoretically this concept makes sense   however as recent numbers have shown i do not have the source handy but one can simply obtain this information via the ecb 's website banks have tapped this something in the likes of 500 billion or so and instead of buying sovereign debt they instead prefer to park this money with the ecb paying something like 25 bps on deposits   so instead of using this money to buy sovereigns or perhaps lend to other banks easing the strain on libor banks have just parked this money back with the ecb as the ecb has seen its deposits once again reach record amounts again see the ecb website for proof   just this speaks volumes about the carry trade and how it is evidently not going to achieve its long term goal of bringing spreads down in europe   perhaps in the short run yes but if you look at the fundamentals eurusd the eur basis swap and the libor spread they show how the situation in europe is far from over and the is nothing close to a long term and stable solution

this is what this sounds like to me also selling a personal item at a loss is generally not a taxable event you can not report it as a loss and the irs ca n't tax a transaction like that if you really want to include these as sales as part of your llc you 'll probably have to pay tax if you list it as income i 'm just confused as to why you 'd want to do that if you know that you 're selling these particular items at a loss and you also know that you have no documentation for them i just would n't report anything you sold at a loss and treat it as garage sale items separate from your business

i wo n't answer in a detailed manner because most people at this site like answers with certain bias on these questions like pool resources always relative to which partner is asking   if you follow the above advice you are hoping things work out   great   what if they do n't   it will be very messy   unlike most of my peers i did not follow the above advice and had a very clean exit with both of us feeling very good and no lawyers got involved either win win for both of us with all the money we saved one assumption people make is the person with the lowest income has the strictest limits   this is not always true i grew up in poverty but have a very high income and financial waste   i can live on about € 12,000 a year and even though my partner made a little less my partner liked to spend    counter intuitive right   i was supposed to be the spender because i had a large income but i was n't   also think about an example with food sharing expenses   is it fair for one partner to split protein if one partner consumes it but the other does n't answer in my view no my advice based on your questions balance the frugal vs. mentality rather than income ratios   if you 're both frugal then focus on income ratios but one may be more frugal than the other and the thought of spending € 300 a month on housing is just insane to a person like me whereas to most it 's too little   are you both exactly the same with this mentality and be honest common costs that you both agree on can be easily split 50 50 and you can often benefit from economies of scale like internet cell phone both of us feel very strongly about being financially independent and if possible we both do n't want to take money from each other this is so healthy for a relationship   my partner and i split and we both still really love each other   we 're headed in different directions but we did not want to end   what you wrote is part of why we ended so well we both were very independent financially    kids are going to be a challenge because they come with expenses that partners do n't always agree on   what do you and her think of childcare for instance   you really want to know all this upfront again a frugal vs. mindset could cause some big tensions

etfs offer the flexibility of stocks while retaining many of the benefits of mutual funds since an etf is an actual fund it has the diversification of its potentially many underlying securities you can find etfs with stocks at various market caps and style categories you can have bond or mixed etfs you can even get etfs with equal or fundamental weighting in short all the variety benefits of mutual funds etfs are typically much less expensive than mutual funds both in terms of management fees expense ratio and taxable gains most of them are not actively managed instead they follow an index and therefore have a low turnover a mutual fund may actively trade and if not balanced with a loss will generate capital gains that you pay taxes on an etf will produce gains only when shifting to keep inline with the index or you yourself sell as a reminder while expense ratio always matters capital gains and dividends do n't matter if the etf or mutual fund is in a tax advantaged account etfs have no load fees instead because you trade it like a stock you will pay a commission commissions are straight up front and perfectly clear much easier to understand than the various ways funds might charge you there are no account minimums to entry with etfs but you will need to buy complete shares only a few places allow partial shares it is generally harder to dollar cost average into an etf with regular automated investments also like trading stocks you can do those fancy things like selling short buying on margin options etc and you can pay attention to the price fluctuations throughout the day if you really want to things to make you pause if you buy no load mutual funds through the parent company you 'll get them at no commission many brokerages have no transaction fee ntf agreements with companies so that you can buy many funds for free still look out for that expense ratio though which is probably paying for that ntf advantage as sort of a middle ground index funds can have very low expense ratios track the same index as an etf can be tax efficient or tax managed free to purchase easy to dollar cost average and easier to automate understand further reading

you 've never saved money   have you ever bought anything   there probably was a small window of time that you had to pool some cash to buy something     in my experience if you make it more interesting by allocating money for specific purposes you 'll have better results than just arbitrarily saving for a rainy day     allocate your money for different things new car emergency travel or starting a new business by isolating your money into different places   your new car allocation could be in a savings account at your bank    your emergency allocation can be in cash under your bed    your new business allocation could be in an investment vehicle like a stocks where it could potentially see significant gains by the time you are ready to use it     the traditional concept of savings is gone   there is very little money to be earned in a savings account and any gains will be most certainly wiped out by inflation anyway   allocate your money allocate more with new income and then use it to buy real things and fund new adventures when the time is right

the author makes a quick jump here conflating walker 's efforts against public sector unions and the long term decline in private sector unions   these two are politically and perhaps even morally distinct   he then makes a correlation argument union membership has declined and conditions for the worker have gotten worse   he does n't substantiate the latter point nor does he draw a causal link between the two   there are decent explanations for the secular decline of union membership sectoral shifts in the economy away from labor intensive manufacturing and toward technology information and service sectors in which unions are traditionally not present nor as necessary   gt the weakening of unions has had a huge political effect as well the of the white working class since the exit polls have shown that unionized blue collar whites vote democratic at a rate 20 to 30 percent higher than their counterparts the decline in union membership has weakened democrats in such heavily white increasingly states as west virginia and wisconsin   the author is placing the cart before the horse here   white working class voters do n't think that democrats represent their interests so why would they continue to financially support unions that guarantee that their dues will go to politicians who do n't represent them   white working class voters are going to voluntarily join associations that support their own interests and identities and that 's apparently not unions   if the white working class thought that the democrats represented their interests union membership would probably not have declined to such a degree in these regions

etf creation and redemption process notes the process while etf trading occurs on an exchange like stocks the process by    which their shares are created is significantly different unless a    company decides to issue more shares the supply of shares of an    individual stock trading in the marketplace is finite when demand    increases for shares of an etf however authorized participants aps    have the ability to create additional shares on demand through an in kind transfer mechanism aps create etf units in the    primary market by delivering a basket of securities to the fund equal    to the current holdings of the etf in return they receive a large    block of etf shares typically 50,000 which are then available for    trading in the secondary market this etf creation and redemption    process helps keep etf supply and demand in continual balance and    provides a hidden layer of liquidity not evident by looking at    trading volumes alone this process also works in reverse if an investor wants to sell a    large block of shares of an etf even if there seems to be limited    liquidity in the secondary market aps can readily redeem a block of    etf shares by gathering enough shares of the etf to form a creation    unit and then exchanging the creation unit for the underlying    securities thus the in kind swap to the underlying securities is only done by aps so the outflow would be these individuals taking a large block of the etf and swapping it for the underlying securities   the aps would be taking advantage of the difference between what the etf 's trading value and the value of the underlying securities

first your references are only tangentially related to your claim   gt if you have twice the generation capacity in renewables wind solar and can store 20 of your yearly consumption then you are fine   right if you do that you 're fine to run your hospital off grid with no backup generators without significant risk of the life support systems going offline   the requirements for a grid connected single family home are much lower generating 100 of your power needs and having one for half a day of storage will drastically reduce your electricity demand    home solar does n't need to completely replace grid power a 70 reduction in demand would be sufficient to reduce generation requirements to only existing hydro wind nuclear plants

dividend prices are per share so the amount that you get for a dividend is determined by the number of shares that you own and the amount of the dividend per share that 's all people like to look at dividend yield because it lets them compare different investments that 's done by dividing the dividend by the value of the stock however determined that 's the percentage that the question mentions a dividend of $ 1 per share when the share price is $ 10 gives a 10 dividend yield a dividend of $ 2 per share when the share price is $ 40 gives a 5 dividend yield if you 're choosing an investment the dividend yield gives you more information than the amount of the dividend

holding pure cash is a problem for 401 k companies because they would then have follow banking rules because they would be holding your cash on their balance sheets they do n't want to be in that business instead they should offer at least one option as a cash equivalent a money market fund this way the money is held by the fund not by 401 k administrator money market funds invest in ultra short term paper such as overnight loans between banks and other debt instruments that mature in a matter of days so it is all extremely liquid as close to money as you can get without actually being money   it is extremely rare for a money market fund to lose value or break the buck during the crisis of 2008 only one or two funds broke the buck and it did n't last long they had gotten greedy and their short term investments were a little more aggressive as they were trying to get extra returns in short your money is safe in a money market fund and your 401 k plan should offer one as the cash option or at least it should offer a short term bond fund if you feel strongly that your money should be in actual cash you can always stop contributing to the 401 k and put the money in the bank this is not a good idea though unless you 're close to retirement you 'll be much better off investing in a well diversified portfolio even through the ups and downs of the market

i wrote this in another thread but is also applicable here in general people make some key mistakes with property not factoring in depreciation properly houses are perpetually falling down and if you are renting them perpetually being trashed by the tenants as well particularly in bad areas accurate depreciation costs can often run in the 5 20 range per year depending on the property area add insurance to this as well or be prepared to lose the whole thing in a disaster related to 1 they take the index price of house price rises as something they can achieve when in reality a lot of the house price rise is just everyone having to spend a lot of money keeping them standing up no investor can actually track a house price graph due to 1 so be careful to make reasonable assumptions about actual achievable future growth in your example they could well be lagging inflation barely growing if you are not pricing in upkeep and depreciation properly failure to price in the huge transaction costs often per sale and capital gains other taxes depends on the exact tax structure where you are these add up very fast if you are buying and selling at all frequently costs in either time or fees to real estate rental agents having to fill check evict fix and maintain rental properties is a lot more work than most people realise and you either have to pay this in your own time or someone else ’s again has to be factored in liquidity issues selling houses in down markets is very very hard they are not like stocks where they can be moved quickly houses can often sit on the market for years before sale if you are not prepared to take low prices as the bank owns your house if you fail to pay the mortgage rents collapse loss of job etc they can force you to fire sale it leaving you in a whole world of pain depending on the exact legal system negative equity etc these factors are generally correlated if you work in the same cities you are buying in so quite a lot of potential long tail risk if the regional economy collapses finally if you ’re young they can tie you to areas where your earnings potential is limited renting can be immensely beneficial early on in a career as it gives you huge freedom to up sticks and leave fast when new opportunities arise locking yourself into 20 contracts landlord activities when young can be hugely inhibiting to your earnings potential without more details on the exact legal framework area house type etc it ’s hard to give more specific advise but in general you need a very large margin of safety with property due to all of the above so if the numbers you ’re running are coming out close and they are here it ’s probably not worth it and you ’re better of sticking with more hands off investments like stocks and bonds

of course the rationale is exactly the same as always profit is taxed the fact that you use intermediate barter to make that profit is irrelevant to clarify as it seems that you think it makes a difference that no money changed hands consider this situation so far your cost is $ 10000 how will the tax authority address this they will look at the fair market value of the barter you got gold worth of $ 20000 so from their perspective you got $ 20000 and immediately exchanged it into gold what does it mean for you that you 're taxed on the $ 10000 gain you made on your product x the $ 20000 worth of barter that you received minus the $ 10000 worth of work material expenses that you spend on producing the merchandise and that you have $ 20000 basis in the gold that you now own if in a year when you plan to sell the gold its price drops you can deduct investment losses if its price goes up you 'll have investment gain but for the gain you 're making on your product x you will pay taxes now because that 's when you realized it sold the and received in return something else of a value

assuming you were in math with your cs degree the book a non random walk down wall street by andrew lo is a very interesting book about the random walk hypothesis and it 's application to financial markets and how efficient markets might not necessarily imply complete randomness     lots of higher level concepts in the book but it 's an interesting topic if you are trying to branch out into the quant world   the book is n't very specific towards algorithmic trading but it 's good for concept and ideas   especially for general finance that will give you a good run down about markets and the way we tackle modern finance     a random walk down wall street which the book above is named after by burton malkiel is also supposed to be a good read and many have suggested reading it before the one i listed above but there really is n't a need to do so     for investing specifically many mention the intelligent investor by benjamin graham who is the role model for the infamous warren buffet   it 's an older book and really dry and i think kind of out dated but mostly still relevant   it 's more specifically about individual trading rather than markets as a whole or general markets   it sounds like you want to learn more about markets and finance rather than simply trading or buying stocks   so i 'd stick to the andrew lo book first       also since you might not know it would be a good idea to understand the capital asset pricing model free cash flow models and maybe some dividend discount models the last of which is n't so much relevant but good foundations for your finance knowledge   they are models using various financial concepts tvm is almost used in every case and utilizing them in various ways to model certain concepts   you 'd most likely be in many of these topics by reading a math oriented finance book   try to stay away from those penny stock trading books i do n't think i need to tell a math major who is probably much smarter than i am that you do n't need to be engaging in penny stocks but do your dd and come to a conclusion yourself if you 'd like   i 'm not sure what career path you 're trying to go down personal trading quant firm analyst regular analyst etc etc but it sounds like you have the credentials to be doing quant trading       check out   it 's a website with a python engine that has all the necessary libraries installed into the website which means you do n't have to go through the trouble yourself and yes it is fucking trouble you need a very outdated os to run one of the libraries   it has a lot of resources to get into algorithmic trading and you can begin coding immediately   you 'd need to learn a little bit of python to get into this but most of it will be using or some other library and its own personal syntax learning about alpha factors and the pipeline api is also moderately difficult to get down but entirely possible within a short amount of dedicated time      also if you want to get into algorithmic trading check out on youtube   he 's a python programmer who does a lot of videos on this very topic and has his own tool on quantopian called sentiment analyzer or something like that which basically sentiment around any given security using web to scrape various news and media outlets   crazy cool stuff being developed over there and if you 're good you can even be partnered with investors at quantopian and share in profits     you can also deploy your algorithms through the website onto various trading platforms such as robinhood and another broker and run your algorithms yourself     lots of cool stuff being developed in the finance sector right now   modern corporate finance and investment knowledge is built on quite old and insights so expect a lot of things to change in today 's world     with a math degree finance should be like algebra i back in the day   you just got ta get familiar with all of the different rules and ideas and concepts   there is n't that much difficult math until you begin getting into higher level finance and theory which mostly deals with statistics anyways like covariance and regression and other statistic related concepts   any other math is simple arithmetic

some of the other answers mention this but i want to highlight it with a personal anecdote i have a property in a mid sized college town in the us its current worth about what we paid for it 9 years ago but i do n't care at all because i will likely never sell it that house is worth about $ 110,000 but rents for $ 1500 per month it is a good investment if you take rental income and the increase in equity from paying down the mortgage subtracting maintenance the return on the down payment is very good i have n't mentioned the paper losses involved in depreciation as that 's fairly us specific the laws are different in other jurisdictions but for at least the first two years we showed losses while making money so there are tax advantages as well at least currently those laws also change over time there is a large difference between investing in a property for appreciation and investing for income even in those categories there are niches that can vary widely commercial vs residential trendy vacation tourist areas etc each has their place but ensure that you do n't confuse a truism meant for one type of real estate investing as being applicable to real estate investing in general

banks can not survive without the government   once people lose faith in the the banking system will fail   the banking system failing is a symptom of the issue not a cause   the banks protects the general populace and prevents runs which will actually destroy the banking system   the burden shifts from the banks to the government   but a is not an actual payment   the banks still operate as normal without any cash from the government but with the knowledge that if they are over extended the government will take on their debt   the government lowers the rates that the banks pay to raise debt to continue to operate   so let 's say piigs fully bail out their banking system paying off all debt that 's worse case   where does the money come from    revenues aka taxes   if the gov't takes on the bank debt and has revenue no problem a little less hand outs but the country as a whole benefits from having a functioning banking system   if revenues are poor or negative however it 's just adding to the deficit   gov't can print money do n't forget    but if revenues are poor and there 's no hope to see them improve boom all hell breaks loose and you get europe

total capital this is a very old fashioned term that really is mostly only used in the finance industry today like when everyone was obsessed with bank capital total capital = preferred equity + common equity + liabilities true blue preferred shares are almost only used by financial companies banks specifically   the more modern ones that convert to common are used by all other companies notes payable this is another old fashioned term that now carries a different meaning in generally accepted account principles gaap the oldest definition of a note or a promissory note is a promise to pay a fixed amount of money on a specific date    this has been modified to resemble more a bond and evolved into the zero coupon bond a bond that makes no cash interest payments but makes one final payment that includes principal interest    a bank note like a one dollar bill is a note that pays something in this case one dollar never technically the repayment date is simply not specified in the contract   while it pays one dollar it never pays it back so it has a constant value of one dollar   the constant nature inflation notwithstanding is what makes bank notes the preferred medium of exchange gaap has taken its own definition to mean any debt payable within 12 months as it is a current < 12 months liability

basically in any financial system that features fractional reserve banking the monetary supply expands during times of prosperity stable low inflation of 2 4 keeps capital available while keeping the value of money stable it also discourages hoarding of wealth banks are n't vaults they take deposits and make an explicit promise to repay the depositor on demand since most depositors do n't need to withdraw money regularly the lend out the money you deposited and maintain a reserve sufficient to meet daily cash needs when times are good banks lend to people and businesses who need capital who in turn do things that add value to the overall economy when times are bad people and businesses either can not get capital or pay more for it which reduces the number of times that money changes hands and has a negative impact on the wider economy people who are trying to sell you commodities or who have a naive view of how the economy actually works decry the current monetary system and throw around scary words like fiat currency and inflation is theft what these people do n't realize is that before the present system where the value of money is based on promises to repay the gold and silver backed systems also experienced inflation with gold silver based money inflation was driven by discoveries of gold and silver deposits

the response to this question will be different depending which of the investment you are using   value investors look at the situation the company is in and try to determine what the company is worth and what it will be worth in the future then they look at the current stock price and decide whether or not the stock is priced at a good deal or not if the stock price is priced lower than they believe the company is worth they would want to buy stock and if the price rises above what they believe to be the true value they would sell these types of investors are not looking at the history or trend of what the price has done in the past only what the current price is and where they believe the price should be in the future   technical analysis investors do something different it is their belief that as stock prices go up and down they generally follow patterns by looking at a chart of what a stock price has been in the past they try to predict where it is headed and buy or sell based on that prediction   in general value investors are longer term investors and technical analysis investors are short term investors   the advice you are considering makes a lot of sense if you are using technical analysis if you have a stock that is trending down your strategy probably tells you to sell buying more in the hopes of turning things around would be seen as a mistake it is like the gambler in vegas who keeps playing a game he is losing hoping that his luck changes   however for the value investor the historical price of a stock and even the amount you currently have gained or lost in the stock are essentially ignored all that matters is whether or not the stock price is above or below the true value determined by the investor for him if the stock price falls and he believes the company still has a high value it could be a signal to buy more the above advice does n't really apply for them   many investors do n't follow either of these strategies they believe that it is too difficult and risky to try to predict the future price of an individual stock instead they invest in many companies all at once using index mutual funds believing that the stock market as a whole always heads up over a long time frame those investors do n't care at all if the prices of stock are going up or down they simply keep investing each month and hold until they have another use for the money the above advice is n't useful for them at all   no matter which kind of investing you are doing the most important thing is to pick a strategy you believe in and follow the plan without emotion emotions can cause investors to make mistakes and start buying when their strategy tells them to sell   instead of trying to follow fortune cookie advice like do n't throw good money after bad choose an investment strategy make a plan test it and follow it cautiously after all it may be a bad plan for what it is worth i am the third type of investor listed above i do n't buy individual stocks and i do n't look at the stock prices when investing more each month your description of your own strategy as buy and hold suggests you might prefer the same approach

what he said was   term returns show fat tails in their distribution   this means that in the short run rare events in the stock market like huge up and downswings happen much more often than you would expect given the circumstances   term returns converge towards a gaussian distribution    this means that long term changes in stock prices show about the level of swings you would expect to see   gt;the authors think there 's a connection between this and the long memory of i.e. that the of absolute volatilities also has a fat tail   auto correlation is the idea that an event is closely related or depends upon a previous event   it should n't be a surprise that prices can depend on previous prices   contrast this with a coin toss   each time you toss the coin the result is independent of any previous result   normally you would use an estimate of auto correlation to test the randomness of your time series   unless you have good reason to do otherwise you use the standard normal or gaussian distribution to do so   some previous study or perhaps this one may have found that the distribution of their auto correlation estimates for volatility change in prices   is not normally distributed but rather that extreme values happen more often than would be expected fat tail   these guys find a correlation between the short term return fat tails the normally   distributed long term returns and a previous finding that the auto correlation of volatility may have fat tails and they think that these things could be more than simply coincidence

i think what you 're asking is   can i buy 1000 shares of the stock at $ 1   for $ 1000    it goes up to $ 2 then sell 500 shares of the stock with proceeds of $ 1000 now    having my original $ 1000 out of it and still owning 500 shares     and that not create a taxable event since all i    did was take my cost basis back out and did n't collect any gains    and then i want to repeat that over and over nope not in the usa anyway    each sale is a separate taxable event the first sale will have proceeds of $ 1000 and a cost basis of $ 500 with $ 500 of capital gains and taxes owed at the time of that sale the remaining stock will have a cost basis of $ 500 and proceeds of whatever you sell it for in the future the next batch of stock will have a cost basis of whatever you pay for it    the only thing that works anything like the way you 're thinking is a roth ira    you can put your cost basis in pull it back out and put it back in again all tax free    but every time your cost basis cycles in that counts your contribution limits unless you do it fast enough to call it a rollover

1   you ignore dividends you can hold your 10 million shares and never sell them and still get cash to live on if the security pays dividends mcdonalds stock pays 3 in dividends a year if you owned 10 million shares of mcdonalds you would get 75,000 every three months i am sure you could live on 25,000 a month   2   enron was an energy company they sold energy and made a profit or rather were supposed to enron did n't make their money by selling stock mcdonalds makes their money by selling hamburgers and other food the income of a company comes from their customers not from selling stock   3   if you sold all of your 10 million shares within a short time frame it likely would drive the price of the stock down but you do not need a billion dollars to live on if you sold 1000 shares each month you would have plenty for buying cars and pizza selling 1000 shares may drive the price of the stock down for a minute or two but the rest of the transactions for that security made the same day would quickly obscure the effect you had on the stock   4   when you buy stock your money does not go to the company if i were to buy 100 shares of mcdonalds mcdonalds would not get $ money is usually paid to a market maker who in turn will use the cash to buy mcd from other individual shareholders presumably for less than a share

as joetaxpayer notes in his comment answers to this are really just opinions so here 's mine for what it 's worth if your risk tolerance is 5 out of 5 you should n't have anything in treasuries   those are basically the most conservative of all investments   this would probably mean no tips as well   if you 're more like 4.5 out of 5 you could have some but just a little a 30 allocation to government securities is quite conservative   if you want to diversify across different asset classes you could consider a bond fund like for instance vbmfx the vanguard total bond market index fund   your portfolio does n't currently contain any non government bonds which is something to consider 20 seems like quite a large allocation to reits   most sample portfolios i 've seen allocate no more than 10 to reits often no more than 5   there are some that have more like the 20 you 're but you might want to ponder that a bit more especially in light of your concerns about reits being at an all time high as for your question about all time highs it 's reasonable to think about but i think waiting for 30 50 off all time highs is unrealistic   looking at a chart of vfinx essentially the s&p 500 i see that at the of the recent downturn in early 2009 the market was at about 50 of its pre crash all time high   at the of the dot com bust the market was about 45 off its pre crash high   if you 're waiting for it to be 50 off it 's all time high you 're not just waiting for a good time to invest you 're waiting for a major crash it could certainly make sense not to immediately put everything into us stocks but that does n't mean you should put nothing in   as commented you could put some of the money in and then gradually add the rest over time reducing the risk of buying at the peak   this can also reduce the psychological of worrying about whether you 're doing the right thing which is worth taking into account   also note that if you get rid of the treasuries you eliminate a good chunk of the stuff that you thought was too close to the peak anyway your two basic points asset allocation and low cost funds have a strong boglehead flavor   you may already have looked at the bogleheads wiki if not you should take a look   if you are comfortable with that philosophy and i think it 's a sound one you should remember that part of that philosophy is not worrying about timing the market   you pursue a buy and hold strategy if you believe the market will go up in the long term and do n't care much about what it does in the short term   that said as mentioned above you might want to ease in your investment over time rather than buying all at once if only to avoid tearing your hair out if the market goes down in the short term incidentally your proposed portfolio is similar to this one that they mention although as i said above i think this is too conservative if you are 30 years old and consider yourself a 5 out of 5 in terms of risk tolerance   i 'm not sure if you already saw that in your research but since that portfolio apparently has a name and is known you might be able to find information about its risks and benefits by searching for discussion of it by name

good point   maybe someone should invent a trust system similar to the one that many new companies in the shared economy sector use like airbnb uber etc where users rate the state of the vehicle when it arrives   those users that leave it in a bad condition will get bad ratings and will quickly find that either they have to pay a cleaning penalty and/or the cost of the next vehicle hire increases and/or they are declined from using the service in the future   whereas those that consistently look after the vehicle will be incentivized with bonuses and/or discounts   if a user does find the vehicle to be then they would record this fact on their smart device and be offered a replacement vehicle and/or discounts etc

your premise is flawed so i 'm going to say you have no clue what you 're talking about    apple is a hardware company first and foremost always has been and likely always will be so when they see the market they see software as something to give away because software sells hardware   they make their bread and butter selling computers and device not mobile me accounts or os x or upgrades    microsoft is a software company through and through when they see the market they see a world full of computers that can run their software for a fee    but that well is drying up manufacturers are leaving so what does msft do get in the hardware game themselves because hardware sells software that 's the one and only rational they were willing to drop billions upon billions of dollars into xbox and make it into an ecosystem    sony 's problem is that they grew so big they 're too big most people only see the surface consumer stuff anchored by fancy tvs or ps3 but they do so much more within b2c and    hell sony makes produces sells distributes plays stores transfers enhances media content on various levels but they 're not best of class anymore on any level and the groups do n't work hand in hand    the company is melting down the same way america is melting down weak central leadership competing ideology how can a company that makes movies sell movie players and exponential levels of complexity    throw in the multinational field sony operates in versus the much fewer countries apple and microsoft operate in and it 's a gigantic mess    i have a head for systems and big orgs but i do not envy the man that has to push that beast along

a tax return is a document you sign and file with the government to self report your tax obligations a tax refund is the payment you receive from the government if your payments into the tax system exceeded your obligations   as others have mentioned if an extra $ 2 k in income generated $ 5 k in taxes chances are your return was prepared incorrectly the selection of an appropriate entity type for your business depends a lot on what you expect to see over the next several years in terms of income and expenses and the extent to which you want or need to pay for fringe benefits or make pretax retirement contributions from your business income there are four basic flavors of entity which are available to you sole proprietorship this is the simplest option in terms of tax reporting and paperwork required for ongoing operations your net gross minus expenses income is added to your wage income and you 'll pay tax on the total if your wage income is less than approximately $ 100 k you 'll also owe self employment tax of approximately 15 in addition to income tax on your business income if your business runs at a loss you can deduct the loss from your other income in calculating your taxable income though you wo n't be able to run at a loss indefinitely you are liable for all of the debts and obligations of the business to the extent of all of your personal assets partnership you will need at least two participants humans or entities to form a partnership individual items of income and expense are identified on a partnership tax return and each partner 's proportionate share is then reported on the individual partners tax returns general partners who actively participate in the business also must pay self employment tax on their earnings below approximately $ 100k. each general partner is responsible for all of the debts and obligations of the business to the extent of their personal assets a general partnership can be created informally or with an oral agreement although that 's not a good idea corporation business entities can be taxed as s or c corporations either way the corporation is created by filing articles of incorporation with a state government does n't have to be the state where you live and corporations are typically required to file yearly entity statements with the state where they were formed as well as all states where they do business shareholders are only liable for the debts and obligations of the corporation to the extent of their investment in the corporation an s corporation files an information only return similar to a partnership which reports items of income and expense but those items are actually taken into account on the individual tax returns of the shareholders if an s corporation runs at a loss the losses are deductible against the shareholders other income   a c corporation files a tax return more similar to an individual 's a c corporation calculates and pays its own tax at the corporate level payments from the c corporation to individuals are typically taxable as wages from a tax point of view it 's the same as having a second job or as dividends depending on how and why the payments are made if they 're in exchange for effort and work they 're probably wages if they 're payments of business profits to the business owners they 're probably dividends if a c corporation runs at a loss the loss is not deductible against the shareholders other income   fringe benefits such as health insurance for business owners are not deductible as business expenses on the business returns for s corps partnerships or sole proprietorships c corporations can deduct expenses for providing fringe benefits   llcs do n't have a predefined tax treatment the members or managers of the llc choose when the llc is formed if they would like to be taxed as a partnership an s corporation or as a c corporation if an llc is owned by a single person it can be considered a disregarded entity and treated for tax purposes as a sole proprietorship this option is not available if the llc has multiple owners   the asset protection provided by the use of an entity depends quite a bit on the source of the claim if a creditor plaintiff has a claim based on a contract signed on behalf of the entity then they likely will not be able to pierce the veil and collect the entity 's debts from the individual owners on the other hand if a creditor plaintiff has a claim based on negligence or another tort like action such as sexual harassment then it 's very likely that the involved will also be sued as individuals which takes away a lot of the effectiveness of the purported asset protection the entity based asset protection is also often unavailable even for contract claims because sophisticated creditors like banks and landlords will often insist the the business owners sign a personal guarantee putting their own assets at risk in the event that the business fails to honor its obligations   there 's no particular type of entity which will allow you to entirely avoid tax most tax planning revolves around income and expense items in the most favorable ways possible or around controlling the timing of the appearance of those items on the tax return

the stores track the individual items for inventory planning and marketing purposes having worked in the transaction processing business for a time writing one i can say with confidence that the credit debit card companies do not receive an itemized list of the items involved in the transaction there is usually a description field in the information transmitted to the processor which may or may not contain useful information but it is not big enough to contain an itemized grocery list of any size and it is not standardized in any way that would facilitate reliable parsing there may be an amount of about the transaction that would indicate the types of products involved in the transaction which they can also infer from the merchant reporting the transaction there are efforts to increase the amount of data reported but they are not widely used yet due to the overwhelming numbers of banks that would need to be upgraded these efforts are rolling out only in specific and limited uses where the banks involved are willing to upgrade software and equipment for now the best way to know what you bought is to keep your receipts from the store work great for this so do smartphone cameras and a folder on your hard drive there are also mobile apps that track receipts for you and may even try to ocr the data for you

if you 're exchanging cash then the rule of thumb is generally that it 's better to buy currency in the country that issues the currency   in your case that would mean buy inr in india and buy usd in the u.s.   the rationale is that supply of foreign currency is generally smaller so you get a little better price if you 're holding the foreign currency   there are of course exceptions like if you 're going to a country with little foreign trade that would n't seem to apply to the u.s. or india if you are doing an electronic transfer through a bank however i doubt that it matters which end initiates the transfer   you 're going to get their wholesale exchange rate plus fees   it seems more likely to matter what fees are charged and that may vary more by bank than by country

my understanding of muslim finance is that you may not lend money at interest including investing in in things that pay interest however you may still make investments it just has to be in places where you get a share of profit rather than a fixed rate of return you would be better asking the muslim community specifically for more details the benefits of compound interest apply more or less to other non fixed interest investments if you invest $ 1000 in a business and get a 10 rate of return you have $ 1100 to invest in your next venture which means it will be more profitable and so on that 's why the growth happens not specifically because it is interest stocks do not pay interest and the magic applies to them too the fact that you might lose as well as win complicates things but does n't change the principle

look at a broader diversification something like for physical gold i 'd look at a mix of gold coins and bullion study the pricing model for coins you 'll probably find that the spreads on small coins make them too expensive there are a few levels of risk with storing in a vault the practical risk is that your government will close banks in the event of a panic and your money will be inaccessible you need to balance that risk with the risk to your personal security that comes with having lots of gold or cash in your home my recommendation is to avoid wasting time on the mad max scenarios if the world economy collapses into utter ruin we 're all screwed a few gold coins wo n't do much for you

in the course of one 's spending it 's not tough to find things that are going to be that expensive   a median income is in the $ 50 k range in the us the diamond folk advertise that one should spend 3 month 's salary on an engagement ring even with a decent income i spent zero my wife was practical not interested in jewelry and wanted a big house the money went to the downpayment the house cost 2.5 years salary at that time   a car even used will cost some month 's salary   if that $ 50 k earner is saving has an emergency account and is on track with their financial long term goals a week 's pay can buy a nice sized tv   a nice vacation can cost a week 's pay to a month 's pay   your question is great although it shows a concern that 's typical very early on in one 's career there are related question here about how can i spend more they tend to come from someone living on a student budget that now has an adult 's income from a desirable job the answer is to sit down list your monthly spending properly budget a decent portion for savings and see how much you have for frivolous spending keep in mind it 's easier to sock it away now no house no kids etc when we were first married we lived on my wife 's income in effect and mine away the house tightened the budget as did the kid   in the end the ps4 is less about the $ 400 than it is about the rest of your finances

to add to what others have said installment credit is a stronger factor when building credit an installment credit is essentially a loan with a fixed repay amount such as a student loan and a car loan banks when it comes to buying your first home want to see that you are financially able to repay a big debt car loan but be careful if you can not pay cash you can not afford it my rule of thumb is that when i 'm charging something to my cc i must pay it off when it posts to my account i just became debt free paid off about 15k in cc and student loan debt in 18 months and i love it

assuming you are being charged sales tax it all depends on where you take possession of the shipment are your suppliers shipping to a us address say your freight from where you handle the ongoing shipment or directly to you in south america if the latter per michael pryor 's answer you should not be charged sales tax if the former if the address is in a state in which your supplier has a physical location they will have to charge sales tax that said your freight should be able to furnish your supplier with a letter stating that the goods have been exported with a copy of the relevant bill of which will allow your supplier to refund you the taxes a company i was at before would allow refunds up to two years past the date of sale per various tax regulations alternatively you could see if just a letter of intent from your freight is enough to not charge you in the first place but that 's technically not proof of you might be able to get a refund or an exception from the state 's tax department directly but i would recommend going through your supplier much less hassle

who are the losers going to be if you can tell me for certain which firms will do worst in a bear market and can time it so that this information is not already priced into the market then you can make money if not do n't try in a bull market stocks tend to act normally with established patterns such as correlations acting as expected and stocks more or less pricing to their fundamentals in a bear market fear tends to overrule all of those things you get large drops on relatively minor bad news and modest rallies on even the best news which results in stocks being undervalued against their fundamentals in the crash itself it is quite easy to make money shorting in an environment where stocks are undervalued such as a bear market you run the risk that your short no matter how sure you are that the stock will fall is seen as being undervalued and will rise in fact your selling of a losing stock might cause it to hit levels where value investors already have limits set this could bring a lot of buyers into the market due to the fact that correlations break down creating portfolios with the correct risk level which is what funds are required to do not only by their contracts but also by law to an extent is extremely difficult risk management keeping all kinds to within certain bounds is one of the most difficult parts of a manager 's job and is even difficult in abnormal market conditions in the long run definitions may vary stock prices in general go up for those companies who are n't bankrupted at least so shorting in a bear market is not a long term strategy either and will not produce long term returns on capital in addition to this risk you run the risk that your counterparty such as lehman brothers will file for bankruptcy and you wo n't be able to cover the position before the lender wants you to repay their stock to them landing you in even more problems

there are normally three key factors that define different kinds of loans these factors affect the risk that the lender takes on and so the interest rate the interest rate on any loan is linked to market interest rates the lender should n't be able to receive a higher rate of interest for lending the money at no risk and the level of risk that the lender believes the borrower to have the three features of a particular loan are these reduce the risk of complete or total non payment default of the principal or any missed interest payments taken in order here some of the monthly payment pays a proportion of the underlying principal of the loan this reduces the amount outstanding and so reduces the capacity for default on the full principal as part of the principal has already been paid security in a secured loan there is an asset such as a car house boat gold shares etc that has a value on resale that is held against the loan the lender may repossess the security if the borrower defaults and recover their money that way this also acts as a stick using the loss of property to convince the borrower that it is better to keep paying the interest the future value of the security will be taken into account when deciding how much this reduces the interest rate guarantor a guarantor to a loan guarantees that the borrower will repay the loan and interest in full and if the borrower does not fulfil that obligation the lender is able to seek legal from the guarantor for the borrower 's debts each of these reduce the risk of the loan as detailed and so reduce the interest rate the interest rate then is made up of three parts the market interest rate m plus the interest rate premium for the borrower 's own credit worthiness c minus the value of the features of the loan that help to reduce risk l the interest rate of the loan r is as r = m + c l. credit ratings themselves are an science and even when two lenders are looking at the same credit score for the same person they will give a different interest rate premium this is mostly for business reasons and the shape of their loan book that are too tedious to go through here all in all the different types of loan give flexibility at the cost of a different interest rate if you do n't want the chance of your car being repossessed you do n't take a secured loan if you have a family member who can help and does n't mind taking on your risk take a guaranteed loan

as the other answers indicate if you look only at the clear mathematical formulas regarding your debts and their interest rates then you 'll see that it 's better less expensive to pay off your student debt first   however you must also take into account the value of your car as it is an asset the older your car gets the less it 's worth the more your car gets used and worn out the less it 's worth cars depreciate at about 15 per year on average however you 're continuing to pay the same amount of money to keep a valuable asset now you also have to include the fact that you may be required to carry full coverage car insurance versus liability insurance this can represent an increase in spending if you 'd prefer to have liability only with insurance in the picture you should also be thinking about the possibility that something could happen to your vehicle that causes it to be worth less than you owe or just worthless if such an event happens then you may have more difficulty acquiring a replacement vehicle i personally do n't find the increase in total interest paid on student loans to offset the other consideration regarding the value of a car i 'm in a similar situation as you except your values are all about double what mine are the peace of mind i gain from being able to pay off the car more quickly and use that money towards loans or whatever i want is worth the interest i 'll earn by not putting that money into the student loans instead i also prefer the idea of being able to more easily use my vehicle as a trade in in case i need to get a different vehicle to better suit my family size

this answer should be taken as a counterpoint to s 's excellent answer i have comprehensive insurance on my vehicle that is if i crashed it and wrote it off my insurance would cover the replacement costs now if this happened i would be able to deal with the replacement costs myself even without insurance it would not significantly impact my lifestyle and would not put my emergency funds at risk though obviously i would n't be happy about this as the insurance company is planning on making money off of me it 's clearly not in my financial best interests to carry this insurance statistically speaking it 's a cost to me and a profit for the insurance company so why do i do it because i find it easy to pay a small amount of money every month for the peace of mind that if i crash my car i will not have to cover the large expense i am perhaps irrationally risk averse i 'm happier paying a small amount of money in exchange for a guarantee that i will not have to pay a large amount of money i mitigate a potentially larger cost albeit with low likelihood for the certainty of a smaller cost my monthly insurance payments this is separate from the mandatory public liability public damage insurance that i am required to cover that insurance fits into 's definition of a devastating event

it is important to remember that the stock price in principle reflects the value of the company so the market cap should drop upon issuance of the the dividend however the above reasoning neglects to consider taxes which make the question a bit more interesting the key fact is that different investors are going to get taxed on the dividend to varying degrees ranging from 20 for qualified dividends in the usa for a high income individual in a taxable account and even worse for non qualified dividends to 0 for tax exempt nonprofits retirement accounts and low income individuals the high tax investors are going to be a bit averse to paying tax on that dividend whereas the tax free investors are not hence in a tax rational market the tax free investors are going to be the ones buying right before a dividend and the tax paying investors will be buying right afterwards tax exempt investors could in principle make some amount of money buying dividends to keep them off the tax paying investors books   of course the strategy could backfire if too many people did it all at once that said the tax payers have the tax disincentive to prevent them from fully exploiting the opposite strategy of selling just before a dividend   in particular they are subject to capital gains tax when they sell at a profit unless they have enough compensating capital losses and it is to their after tax profit to defer taxation by not trading that said the stock market has well known irrationality when it comes to considering tax consequences so logic based on assumed rationality of the market does not always apply to the extent one would expect    the foremost example of tax irrationality is the so called dividend paradox which basically states that corporations should favor stock buybacks or perhaps loan repayment to the complete exclusion of dividends because capital gains are taxed less harshly than dividends in a variety of ways some of which are subtle 1 historically although not currently in the usa for qualified dividends the tax rate was higher for dividends   in canada for example dividends are taxed at twice the rate of capital gains 2 if you die holding appreciated stock then you meaning your heirs completely escape us the capital gains tax on the accrual during your lifetime 3 capital gains tax can be deferred by simply not selling   in comparison to dividends this is roughly equivalent to getting a tax free loan from the government which is invested for profit and paid at a later date after inflation has eaten away at the real value of the loan   for example if all your stock investments increase by but you sell every year in a high tax bracket situation you 're total after tax return will be only 8 per year   in contrast if you hold the same investments for many many years and then sell your total return will be nearly 10 per year because you only pay 20 once at the end 4 a capital gain can often be by a capital loss in another stock so that no tax results   if you loose money on a stock that is paying dividends you 're still going to have to pay tax on that dividend   there are companies that borrow money to pay out that taxable dividend each quarter which seems like gross tax malpractice on the part of the cfo if the dividend paradox does n't make sense first consider the case that you owned all the shares of a company   it would n't matter to you at all on a pre tax basis whether you got a $ 1000 company buyback or a $ 1000 dividend because after the buyback dividend you 'd still own the entire company and $ 1000   the number of shares would be reduced but that you owned fewer shares after the buyback would be like saying you have become shorter if your height is measured in inches rather than of course in the case of many shareholders you can get burned by failing to sell into the buyback when the share price is too high but that is another matter

i have an idea let 's make home loans for people who traditionally would n't have been able to afford them package them up into large packages of many loans then sell as a super safe investment a portion of that package designed to absorb the least of the default risk   the big investors will have a safe place to put their money people will get houses they could n't otherwise afford and we 'll get management fees from the former and high returns from the latter paying back their high interest mortgages satisfying the more risky portion of the mortgage package that we 're not selling assuming not too many of them default but that 's unlikely given that the housing market can only go up from here everyone wins

i disagree sponsorship is the problem or more specifically where it comes from with of advertising what happens is that any small player with a keyboard can become a news source lowering the bar on what we consider news though this goes for all content really in turn this makes good content providers have far more competition and essentially lowers the bar for all sources because most people will not pay a premium for great content in the case of news how does a news agency with researchers fact checkers and overhead compete with a guy in his bedroom if clicks and eyeballs are the only source of comparison    the buying of content or native advertising as its being called is a direct byproduct of this slippery slope and the ultimate desire of each person or entity to be successful which in some cases means offering new this is nothing new but has just grown exponentially as the barriers to entry have all but been removed   at the end of the day this goes back to trust if consumers put a premium on trusted content and channels because they want something like facts vs. and echo chamber to reinforce a particular mindset then it would be a different situation free is what everyone one wants but they forget one important thing if your not paying for something then your not the consumer your probably the product obviously this in turn means it ’s less important to get the reader real content vs. content that will keep them on site just a little longer than their competitors for which they are rewarded   so going back to the millennials good for them for apparently being among the first group to collectively realize that they need to question everything and rely on their own research they are natives of the misinformation age

why do we reward failure so greatly i understand the parachutes may be needed in execs you bring in to save a failing company that has little hope but a profitable business should not be giving out parachutes if you take over a company and run it into the ground that 's your fault you do n't deserve a reward

given the current low interest rates let 's assume 4 this might be a viable option for a lot of people   let 's also assume that your actual interest rate after figuring in tax considerations ends up at around 3   i think i am being pretty fair with the numbers now every dollar that you save each month based on the savings and invest with a higher net return of greater than 3 will in fact be free money   you are basically betting on your ability to invest over the 3   even if using a conservative historical rate of return on the market you should net far better than 3   this money would be significant after 10 years    let 's say you earn an average of 8 on your money over the 10 years   well you would have an extra $ 77 k by doing interest only if you were paying on average of $ 500 a month towards interest on a conventional loan   that is a pretty average house in the us   who does n't want $ 77 k more than you would have compared to just principal   so after 10 years you have the same amount in principal plus $ given that you take all of the saved money and invest it at the constraints above i would suggest that people take interest only if they are willing to put away the money as they had a conventional loan   another scenario would be a wealthier home owner that may be able to pay off house at any time to reap the tax breaks and cheap money to invest pros cons   if people ask how viable is this   well i have done this for 8 years   i have earned an extra   i have smaller than $ 500 i put away each month since my house is about 30 owned but have earned almost 14 on average over the last 8 years   my money gets put into an e trade account automatically each month from there i funnel it into different funds diversified by sector and region   i literally spend a few minutes a month on this and i truly act like the money is n't there   what is also nice is that the bank will account for about half of this as being a liquid asset when i have to renegotiate another loan

i think the right way to approach this is for your personal books and your business 's books to be completely separate you would need to really think of them as separate things such that rather than being disappointed that there 's no cross transactions between files you think of it as in my personal account i invested in a new business like any other investment with a transfer from your personal account to a stock or other investment account in your company and this business received some additional capital which one handles with a transfer probably from equity to its checking account or the like yes you do n't get the built in checks that you entered the same dollar amount in each but 1 you need to reconcile your books against reality anyway occasionally so errors should get caught and 2 the transactions really are separate things from each entity 's perspective the main way to hack it would be to have separate top level placeholder accounts for the business 's equity income expenses and assets liabilities that is your top level accounts would be personal equity business equity personal income business income and so on you can combine assets and liabilities within a single top level account if you want which may help you with that outlook of my business value you 're looking for in fact in my personal books i have in the current assets account both normal things like my checking account but also my credit cards because once i spend the money on my credit card i want to think of the money as being gone since it is obviously this is n't standard accounting in any way but it works well for what i use it for you could also just have within each normal top level placeholder account a placeholder account for both personal and my business to at least have a consistent structure depending on how your business is getting taxed in your jurisdiction this may even be closer to how your taxing authorities treat things if for instance the business income all goes on your personal tax return but on a separate form regardless of how you set up the accounts you can then create reports and filter them to include just that set of business accounts i can see how just looking at the account list and transaction registers can be useful for many things but the reporting does let you look at everything you need and handles much better when you want to look through a filter to just part of your financial picture once you set up the reporting and you can report on lists of account balances as well as transaction lists and lots of other things you can save them as custom reports and then open them up whenever you want you can even just leave a report tab or several open and switch to it refreshing it if needed just like you might switch to the main account list tab i suspect once you got it set up and tried it for a while you 'd find it quite satisfactory

i have not come across any studies that address this specifically personally i would want 5 years of stability to compare to an equal period prior to 2008 and i am not convinced that we have that i would envision such an outcome however as a result of belt tightening in light of the recession carrying over as business as usual afterwards the pace of progress makes it difficult to make one to one comparisons but were i to draft a question for consideration it would probably be does salary of job description x e.g. software engineer earn an amount equal to the same position during 2002 2007 in adjusted dollars some controls would most likely be necessary

another thing to consider however is the deductibility of business expenses   let 's assume that the employer can legitimately hire you as a 1099 contractor   would you be able to would you have a high degree of control over when you worked and when you did n't   these factors also affect whether you 're a true independent 1099 contractor or not   as a legit 1099 contractor you 're able to deduct certain business expenses directly from your income you can find a list of the rules at irs.gov   as a w2 employee by contrast can deduct only business expenses that exceed 2 of the your agi adjusted gross income   so you also have to consider your personal circumstances in making the calculus and comparing whether a legitimate 1099 contractor job is or is not good for you   it 's not just a comparison of what they 'd pay w2 employees versus what they 'd pay 1099 contractors

it 's good to ask this question because this is one of the fundamental in market at any time t for each product on a typical exchange there are two well defined prices at time t there is literally no person in the market who wants to sell below the ask so all the people who are waiting to buy at the bid or below could very well be waiting there forever   there 's simply no guarantee that any seller will ever want to part with their product for a lesser price than they think it 's worth so if you want to buy the product at time t you have a tough choice to make you get in line at the bid price where there 's no guarantee that your request will ever be filled and you might never get your hands on the product you decide that owning the product right now is more valuable to you than ask bid quantity so you tell the exchange that you 're willing to buy at the ask price and the exchange matches you with whichever seller is first in line now if you 're in the market for the long term the above choice is completely immaterial to you   who cares if you pay $ 10.00 1000 shares or $ 10.01 1000 shares when you plan to sell 30 years from now at $ 200 or $ but if you 're a day trader or anyone else with a very short time horizon then this choice is extremely important if the price is about to go up several cents and you got in line at the bid and never got filled then you missed out on some profit if you cross the spread to buy at the ask and then the price does n't go up or worse goes down you 're screwed   in order to get out of the position you 'll have to cross the spread again and sell at at most the bid meaning you 've now paid the spread twice plus transaction fees and regulatory fees for nothing all of the above also applies in reverse for selling at the ask versus selling at the bid but most people like to learn in terms of buying rather than selling

as others have said this opinion is predicated on an assumption that early in your life you have no need to actually use the money so you are able to take advantage of compounding interest because the money is going to be there for many many years and you are far more tolerant of loss because you can simply wait for the markets to recover this is absolutely true of a pension pot which is locked away for a great many years but it is absolutely not true of general investments someone in the to is very likely to want to spend that money on say buying a house in which case losing 10 of your deposit 3 months before you start looking for a house could potentially be a disaster in your if your child 's school college fund goes up in smoke that 's a big deal it is a very commonly espoused theory but i think it is also fundamentally flawed in many scenarios

it is true that all else being equal you will pay a lower amount of total interest by paying down your highest interest rate debts first   however all else is not always equal   i 'm going to try to come up with some reasons why it might be better in some circumstances to pay your debts in a different order   and i 'll try to use as much math as possible   let 's say that your goal is to eliminate all of your debt as fast as possible   the faster you do this the lower the total interest that you will pay   now let 's consider the different methods that you could take to get there you could pay the highest interest first you could pay the lowest interest first or you could pay something in the middle first   no matter which path you choose the quicker you pay everything off the lower total interest you will pay   in addition to that the quicker you pay everything off the difference in total interest paid between the most optimal method and the least optimal method will be less   to put this in mathematical notation = 0 given that anything we can do to speed up the time it takes to get to debt free is to our advantage when paying large amounts of debt as fast as possible sacrifice is needed   and this means that psychology comes into play   i do n't know about you but for me the system makes everything easier   after all is what gets us to write answers here on se one way to do this is to eliminate individual debts as quickly as possible   for example let 's say that i 've got 10 debts   5 of them are for $ 1k each   3 of them are for $ 5k each 1 is a $ 20k car loan and 1 is a $ 100k mortgage   each one has a monthly payment let 's say that i 've got $ 3k sitting in the bank that i want to use to my debt reduction   i could pay all $ 3k toward one of my larger loans or i could immediately pay off 3 of my 10 loans   ignore interest for the moment and let 's say that we are going to pay off the smallest loans first   when i eliminate these three loans three of my monthly payments are also gone   now let 's say that with the money i was paying toward these eliminated debts and some other money i was able to scrape together $ 500 a month that i want to use toward debt reduction   in four months i 've eliminated the last two $ 1k debts and i 'm down to 5 debts instead of 10   achievement unlocked instead of this strategy i could have paid toward my largest interest rate   let 's say that was one of the $ 5k loans   i paid the $ 3k toward the bank to it and because i still had all the monthly payments after that i was only able to scrape together $ 400 a month extra toward debt reduction   in four months i still have 10 debts now let 's say that after these four months i have a bad month and some unexpected expenses come up   if i 've eliminated 5 of my debts my monthly payments are less and i 'll have an easier month then i would have had if i still had 10 monthly payments to deal with each time i eliminate a debt the amount extra i have each month to tackle the remaining debts gets bigger   and if your goal is eliminating debt quickly these early wins can really help motivate you on   it really feels like you are getting somewhere when your monthly bills go down   it also helps you with the debt free mindset   you start to see a future where you are n't sending payments to the banks each month   this method of paying your smaller debts first has been popularized in recent years by dave ramsey and he calls it the debt snowball method there might be other reasons why you would pick one debt over another to pay first   for example let 's say that one of your loans is with a bank that has terrible customer service   they do n't send you bills on time they process your payment late their website stinks they are a constant source of stress and you are getting sick of them   that would be a great reason to pay that debt first and never set foot in that bank again in conclusion if you have a constant amount of extra cash each month that you are going to use to reduce your debt and this will never change then yes you will save money over the long run by paying the highest interest debt first   however if you are trying to eliminate your debt as fast as possible and you are sacrificing in your budget sending every extra penny you can scrape together toward debt reduction the snowball method of knocking out the small debts first can help motivate you to continue to sacrifice toward your goal and can also ease the cash flow situation in difficult months when you find yourself with less extra to send in
