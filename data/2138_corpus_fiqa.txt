there are two methods of doing this pulling out the money and paying the penalty if any and going on your way having the roth ira own the business and being an employee if you go with the second choice you should read more about it on this question

chris 's answer is a great start keep in mind that when you withdraw from a roth ira you shrink the size of the ira i.e. if the start up you ca n't put the $ 10k you withdrew back as you 're limited to in contributions per year you may want to consider funding your startup with a credit card ideally a balance transfer of $ 10k at 0 interest   if you need to you can always pay your card off with your roth balance but if the startup takes off your ira is on a side note i would n't feel comfortable quitting my job to do a startup with only $ 10k in savings but to each his own

yes it is possible to withdraw money from your roth ira before retirement but i would n't necessarily advise you to do so   here 's the good news and the bad news the good news unlike a traditional ira money contributed to a roth ira is done so on an after tax basis meaning you do n't benefit from a tax deduction on contributions so the money you withdraw from your roth ira will not be taxed entirely as ordinary income in fact you are allowed to withdraw the amount of your original contributions also known as basis without any taxes or penalties let 's imagine you originally deposited $ 9000 of that current $ 10 k total value then in such a case $ 9000 could be withdrawn tax and penalty free the bad news when it comes to the investment earnings the other $ 1000 in my example   it 's a different story   since you would n't be age 59 1/2 at the time of withdrawal any money taken out beyond your original contributions would be considered a non qualified withdrawal and subject to both ordinary income taxes plus a 10 early withdrawal penalty   ouch perhaps you might want to restrict your withdrawal to your original contributions   i would imagine if you 've had the account for such a short period of time that much or all of your account value is original contributions anyway a good article about the rules for early ira withdrawals is about.com 's tax penalty for early distribution of retirement funds note if your roth ira funds were the result of a rollover from another account type other rules may apply see roth ira wikipedia for more detail search for rollover regarding the withdrawal process itself and the timing you should check with your account custodian on how to proceed

the company released its 2nd quarter revenue of $ a couple days ago however the stock did not move up in any way why if the company is making money should n't the stock go up but that result does n't indicate that the company is making money   the word for making money is profit not revenue   profit equals revenue minus costs   an increasing revenue could mean decreasing profits   for example marketing expenses could eat up the entirety of the new revenue    this is one of the most basic aspects of researching stocks   if you are having trouble with this you might find yourself better suited to invest in mutual funds where they do this research for you   in particular the safest kind of mutual funds for an inexperienced investor are index funds that track a major index like the s&p 500    another issue is that stock prices are n't based on historical results but on expected future results   many a company has reported smaller than expected profits and had their price fall even though profits increased from previous results    looking at it long term would it hurt me in anyway to buy shares which right now would run be about $ 24 including to fee and sit on it it would cost you $ 24   you might get a return some day   or you might waste your money   given the comparatively large upside the consensus seems to be that you will probably waste your money   that said it 's not a lot of money to waste   so it wo n't hurt you that much   the most likely result remains that the company will go bankrupt leaving your stock worthless

defined benefit pensions are generally seen as valuable and hard to replace by investing on your own so my default assumption would be to keep that pension unless you think there 's a significant risk the pension fund will become insolvent in which case the earlier you can get out the better obviously you need to look at the numbers what is a realistic return you could get by investing that 115 k to compare like with like what real investment returns after subtracting inflation are needed for it to provide you with $ income year after age 60 also consider that the defined benefit insulates you from multiple kinds of risk remember that most of your assets are outside the pension and subject to all these risks already do you want to add to that risk by taking this money out of your pension one intermediate strategy to look at again for the purposes of comparison is to take the money now invest it for 10 years without withdrawing anything then buy an annuity at age 60 if you 're single canadian annuity rates for age 60 appear to be between 4 5 without index linking it may not even be possible to get an index linked annuity even without the index linking you 'd need to grow the $ 115 k to about $ 240 k in 10 years implying taking enough risks to get a return of 7.6 per year and you would n't have index linking so your income would gradually drop in real terms

i 've given up on trying to understand how the allowances correspond to my number of dependents    what i do instead to achieve the same end goal of having the right amount of money withheld is using a paycheck calculator if i get paid 24 times a year twice a month and i figure i 'm going to owe about $ 6,000 of taxes then every paycheck needs to have $ 250 of federal tax withheld from it to make sure i am covered go to the paycheck calculator and play with the allowance numbers until you get $ 250 as the federal tax withheld and then submit a new w4 to your employer this is the only reliable way i 've found to figure this out on my own   because my calculations are done in dollars instead of exemptions etc and my taxes do not wildly fluctuate year to year this works well for me

assuming a person knows how to use and invest their money wisely would it still be a bad idea to entirely disregard a 401k plan yes a 401k like an ira is a qualified plan and as such enjoys certain legal protections   for a roth 401k the taxes are paid now and the interest accumulates tax free and withdrawals will be tax free doing it on your own means that your own savings will have interest taxed as you earn it   for a traditional 401k current savings are deducted from current earnings and the withdrawals will be taxed doing it on your own loses the deferral of tax at this time    generally 401ks and iras are highly resistant to judgements in civil lawsuits if you file for bankruptcy protection at any time in your working career the assets in these accounts are immune in most states from being used to pay off your creditors if you do it on your own that savings account will be emptied to pay off creditors in bankruptcy and also will be assets that can be taken from you in civil judgements for example you get in a car accident and they sue you you might never be sued nor file bankruptcy in your entire life but you are unnecessarily exposing yourself to risks anything might happen in the next 50 years what you will lose in such circumstances far outweighs any perceived benefits you could possibly earn by rolling your own if you are the sort of person who can max out your 401k and ira contributions each year and still have a significant sum to set aside for savings you should contact an investment advisor and attorney to see about protecting your assets

it 's called leverage here 's an example from real estate the underlying appreciation on a house in certain parts of america is something like 7 a year so if you bought the house all cash your return would be something like 7 a year actually a little more because of the rent you would be collecting or saving if you were the renter suppose you buy the same house 20 down 80 mortgage the rent pays for your mortgage taxes insurance etc like it is supposed to the house goes up the same 7 each year but now your rate of return is 35 that is your down payment you get the whole appreciation but put up only 20 of the money the bank and your renter did the rest

the employer most likely has already sent that money that was withheld to the irs therefore they can not refund you any money instead you need to get the money back from the irs you do this by filing a tax return   your will show that taxes were withheld i.e. that you paid taxes the rest of the return will show that no taxes were due and therefore you are entitled to have your money refunded if you have already filed for that tax you you just need to file an amended return with the new data that amendment will show that you are to be refunded the extra money then just wait several weeks for the payment from the irs   as pointed out if it is medicare and social security taxes that have been withheld in error then you need to file a different set of forms with irs it would be nice if refunding fica also occurred via the tax return

the satisfaction from gains packs less of an emotional impact than the fear of loss it 's very difficult for many people to overcome this fear so when prices begin to fall many investors sell to minimize their potential loss this causes a further drop which can lead to more selling as other investors reach their emotional threshold for loss this emotion based selling keeps the market inefficient in the short term if there are n't enough value investors waiting to scoop up the stock at the new discount it can stay undervalued for a long time

that 's a broad question but i can throw some thoughts at you from personal experience   i 'm actually an australian who has worked in a couple of companies but across multiple countries and i 've found out first hand that you have a wealth of opportunities that other people do n't have but you also have a lot of problems that other people wo n't have first up asset classes real estate is a popular asset class but unless you plan on being in each of these countries for a minimum of one to two years it would be seriously risky to invest in rental residential or commercial real estate this is because it takes a long time to figure out each country 's particular set of laws around real estate plus it will take a long time to get credit from the local bank institutions and to understand the local markets well enough to select a good location this leaves you with the classics of stocks and bonds you can buy stocks and bonds in any country typically so you could have some stocks in a german company a bond fund in france and maybe a mutual fund in japan this makes for interesting diversification so if one country tanks you can potentially be hedged in another you also get to both benefit and be punished by foreign exchange movements you might have made a killing on that stock you bought in tokyo but it turns out the yen just fell by 15 and to top this off you are almost certainly going to end up filling out tax returns in each country you have made money in this can get horribly complicated very quickly as a person who has been dealing with the us tax system i can tell you that this is painful and the us in particular tries to get a cut of your worldwide income that said keep in mind each country has different tax rates so you could potentially benefit from that as well my advice choose one country you suspect you 'll spend most of your life in and keep most of your assets there make a few purchases in other places but minimize it ultimately most ex move back to their country of origin as friends family and shared culture bring them home

source see if you have access to it convertible notes are often used by angel investors who wish to fund businesses without establishing an explicit valuation of the company in which they are investing     when an investor purchases equity in a startup the purchase price of the equity implies a company valuation   for example if an investor purchases a 10 per cent ownership stake in a company and pay $ 1 m for that stake this implies that the company is worth $ 10 m some early stage investors may wish to avoid placing a value on the company in this way because this in turn will affect the terms under which later stage investors will invest in the company   convertible notes are structured as loans at the time the investment is made   the outstanding balance of the loan is automatically converted to equity when a later equity investor appears under terms that are governed by the terms set by the later stage equity investor   an equity investor is someone who purchases equity in a company suppose an angel investor invests $ 100,000 using a convertible note   later an equity investor invests $ 1 m and receives 10 of the company 's shares   in the simplest possible case the initial angel investor 's convertible note would convert to 1/10th of the equity investor 's claim   depending on the exact structure of the convertible note however the angel investor may also receive extra shares to compensate them for the additional risk associated with being an earlier investor the worst case scenario would be if the issuing company initially performed well meaning that the debt would be converted into shares and subsequently went bankrupt the converted shares would become worthless but the holder of the note would no longer have any recourse will twitter have to sell their offices and liquidate staff to close this debt this depends on the of the debt debt is serviced according to seniority the higher seniority debts will be paid off first and then only the lower seniority debts be serviced this will all be in the agreements when you enter into a transaction when you say liquidate staff you mean sell off their assets and not sell their staff into slavery

i live in one of the highest cost of living areas in my country   for the cost of less than half the down payment my spouse and i have saved up for a house we could easily buy a home in most of the lower cost of living areas and several homes in say detroit as for the rest of your question though we 've chosen not to live that way   because like all high cost of living areas ours is near a city there are more free and inexpensive things to do than you would think at first   while others in our area think a great time is pre gaming drinks at a nice bar an expensive restaurant then some more drinks we 've taught ourselves how to make great meals from scratch using sale and inexpensive ingredients from the grocery store and often do that on weekends topped off by a movie from the that we promptly return the next day   we have chosen friends who will hang out with us over dinners and board games instead of out on the town   on weekend days we visit free do hikes wander around downtown strips or play at the local parks   our groceries as i mentioned are sale items or use coupons and we go for less expensive meats and produce   we visit our local farmer 's market for fun not to buy the expensive produce   we might find ourselves wandering through the mall to window shop but when it comes time to actually buy clothing or goods for the apartment we shop around for up to months to find a good deal plenty of our friends have money enough to spend and the most debt they are usually in is a big car payment no consumer debt   at the same time i have trouble imagining some of them buying a house any time soon because they simply ca n't be saving all that much since i know their incomes   they may eventually be able to afford a condo and ride rising housing prices to a and then a house it 's what lots of people do around here loosing buckets money in realtor fees and closing costs along the way   even with these choices it 's hard to view my friends as selfish knowing that most of them give around 10 of their income to charity there are probably plenty of people around here swimming in debt somebody recently asked in a q&a with the local paper editors how she could stop going to the city 's most expensive restaurants and start living within her means when she only liked expensive places but lots of folks can stretch themselves and afford to get by while wasting a lot of money   it 's not what my spouse and i have chosen to do because we want to be able to live very responsibly and plan for a rainy day but the longer you live with and around the money that tends to high cost of living areas the more it will seem normal to you also if it 's really $ 1000/mo for a 2 br apartment your cost of living is still lower than mine is if i were you i would n't try to myself to the habits of your surroundings   instead i 'd find friends who are frugal and work on maintaining your good financial habits   if you ever want one of those $ 4 $ 5 or $ 6 k plus houses you 're going to need them

on form line 20 you can list utilities paid for the home office you have two choices 1 you can list the entire amount under column b as an indirect expense you will then get a deduction for the fraction of the amount based on what fraction of your home is an office this makes sense if the service equally benefits your entire home 2 you can compute the portion of the expense reasonably attributable to the business office and list that amount under column a this entire amount will be deducted which option you choose depends on how well you think you can allocate the expense between your office and the rest of your home for example i have had to do this with electricity but i specifically measured the electricity used by my office if you think you can defend allocating a larger portion to the office use option 2 if you would have paid the same amount even if you did n't have an office it 's hard to justify allocating more of the expense to the office than its portion of the home if you opted for a more expensive service or otherwise incurred additional costs it makes sense to allocate a higher fraction to the office and to calculate that yourself

my super fund and i would say many other funds give you one free switch of strategies per year   some suggest you should change from high growth option to a more balance option once you are say about 10 to 15 years from retirement and then change to a more capital guaranteed option a few years from retirement this is a more passive approach and has benefits as well as disadvantages the benefit is that there is not much work involved you just change your investment option based on your life stage 2 to 3 times during your lifetime this allows you to take more risk when you are young to aim for higher returns take a balanced approach with moderate risk and returns during the middle part of your working life and take less risk with lower returns above inflation during the latter part of your working life a possible disadvantage of this strategy is you may be in the higher higher growth option during a market correction and then change to a more balanced option just when the market starts to pick up again so your funds will be hit with large losses whilst the market is in retreat and just when things look to be getting better you change to a more balanced portfolio and miss out on the big gains a second more active approach would be to track the market and change investment option as the market changes one approach which should n't take much time is to track the index such as the asx200 if you investment option is mainly invested in the australian stock market with a 200 day simple moving average sma the concept is that if the index crosses above the 200 day sma the market is bullish and if it crosses below it is bearish see the chart below   this strategy will work well when the market is trending up or down but not very well when the market is going sideways as you will be changing from aggressive to balanced and back too often possibly a more appropriate option would be a combination of the two use the first passive approach to change investment option from aggressive to balanced to capital guaranteed with your life stages however use the second active approach to time the change for example if you were say in your late 40s now and were looking to change from aggressive to balanced in the near future you could wait until the asx200 crosses below the 200 day sma before making the change this way you could capture the majority of the uptrend which could go on for years before changing from the high growth aggressive option to the balanced option if you where after more control over your superannuation assets another option open to you is to start a smsf however i would recommend having at least $ 300 k to $ 400 k in assets before starting a smsf or else the annual costs would be too high as a percentage of your total super assets

first congratulations on the paycheck   on the holds is it possible that by allowing your account balance to go negative into overdraft that you triggered such treatment of your account   perhaps the bank is being more cautious with your account since that happened   just how long did you have their $ 150 on hold   or perhaps it 's not you specifically but the bank is being more cautious due to credit conditions that have been prevalent these last years   consider allowing you to cash a check immediately when it technically has n't cleared yet is a form of credit   maybe it is n't you they do n't trust well enough yet but the company that issued the check   checks bounce and not by fault of the depositor i once had a new account years ago and discovered a 5 day hold on deposits   the irony was it was a check drawn on the same bank   i called my banker and asked about it and suggested i 'd take my business back to my old bank   i was in the process of applying for a mortgage with the new bank   holds were removed but you may have some trouble with the i 'll walk technique given the climate and your recent overdraft situation and no leverage or if you do have some leverage consider using it but before you assume anything i would as johnfx suggested ask your bank about it   pay your branch a visit in person and talk to the manager   phone calls to customer service may be less successful   if it 's not a big issue and more a minor technical policy one the bank may remove the holds   if they wo n't the manager ought to tell you why and what you can do to solve it eventually

citizens of india who are not residents to india have nri status are not entitled to have ordinary   savings accounts in india if you have such accounts e.g. left them behind to support your family while you are abroad they need to be converted to nro nonresident ordinary accounts as soon as possible your bank will have forms for completion of this process   any interest that these accounts earn will be taxable income to you in india and possibly in the u.k. too though tax treaties or double taxation avoidance agreements generally allow you to claim credit for taxes paid to other countries now with regard to your question nris are entitled to make deposits into nro accounts as well as nre nonresident external accounts the differences are that money deposited into an nre account though converted to indian rupees can be converted back very easily to foreign currency if need be however the re conversion is at the exchange rate then in effect and you may well lose that 10 interest earned because of a change in exchange rate   devaluation of the indian rupee as occurred several times in the past 70 years   once upon a time it was essentially impossible to take money in an nro account and convert it to foreign currency but under the new recently introduced schemes money in an nro account can also be converted to foreign currencies but it needs certification by a ca and various forms to be filled out and thus is more hassle interest earned by the money in an nre account is not taxable income in india but is taxable income in the u.k. there is no taxable event neither in u.k. nor in india when you change an ordinary savings account held in india into an nro account or when you deposit money from abroad into an nre or nro account in an indian bank what is taxable is the interest that you receive from the indian bank in the case of an nro account what is deposited into your nro account is the interest earned less the indian income tax usually 20 deducted at the source tds and sent to the income tax authority on your behalf in the case of an nre account the full amount of interest earned is deposited into the nre account no tds whatsoever   it is your responsibility to declare these amounts to the u.k. income tax authority hm revenue and pay any taxes due finally you say that you recently moved to the u.k. for a job if this is a temporary job and you might be back in india very soon all the above might not be applicable to you since you would not be classified as an nri at all

when you invest in a single index security you are completely exposed to the risk of that security diversification means spreading the investments so the losses on one side can be compensated by the gains on the other side what you are talking about is one thing called risk more formally known as risk tolerance risk tolerance is the degree of variability in investment returns that an investor is willing to withstand emphasis added this means that you are willing to accept some losses in order to get a potential bigger return fidelity has this graph   as you can see in the table above the higher the risk tolerance the bigger the difference between the best and worst values that is the variability the right most pie can be one example of an agressive diversified portfolio but this does not mean you should go and buy exactly that security high risk means playing with fire unless you are a professional playing with fire usually leaves people burnt in a financial context this usually means the money is gone recommended reading investopedia risk and diversification the risk reward tradeoff investopedia how to construct a high risk portfolio fidelity guide to diversification kpmg understanding and risk appetite pdf

you raise a good point about the higher marginal rates for 401 k but things will be different in retirement than they are for you now   first off you are going to have a boat load of money   like probably a multi millionaire   also your ability to invest will probably increase greater than the maximum allowable to invest   for this money you might choose to invest in real estate debt payoff or non qualified mutual funds    so fast forward to retirement time   you have a few million in your 401 k you own your house and outright and maybe a couple of rental properties   for one your expenses are much lower   you do n't have to invest pay social security taxes or service debt   clothing gas dry cleaning are all lower as well    you will draw some income off of non qualified plans   this might include rental real estate business income or equity investments   you can also draw social security income   for most of us social security will provide sustenance living   enough for food medical transportation etc   add in some non qualified income and the fact that you are debt free or nearly so and you might not need to draw on your 401k.    plus if you do need to withdraw you can cherry pick when and what amount you withdraw   compare that to now your employer pays you your salary   most of us do not have the ability to defer our compensation   with a 401 k you can for example lets say you want a new car where you need to withdraw from your 401 k to pay for it    in retirement you can withdraw the full amount and pay cash   part of this money will be taxed at the lowest rate part at higher rates   car price dependent in retirement you can take a low interest or free loan and only withdraw enough to make the payments this year   presumably this will be at the lowest rate now you only have one choice   using your top marginal rate to pay for the car   it does n't matter if you have a loan or not

i answered a similar question before essentially you should n't trust a site you find on the internet merely because it looks professional and real   before signing up with any new service provider you found online you should verify the authenticity of both the organization itself and their web site address even if the name displayed by a web site represents a legitimate brokerage firm any site you happen to come across on the internet could be an elaborate of a real company intended to capture your personal details or worse first to check if a brokerage firm is in fact registered to trade securities in the united states you can consult finra 's online service   this might be the first of many checks you should undertake after you convince yourself that finra is legitimate   a meta problem then if you want to know if the web site address is authentic one way is to contact that broker offline using the contact information found from a trusted source such as the finra details   unfortunately those details do not currently appear to contain the broker 's web site url   else that could be useful another thing to look at is the site 's login or sign up page for a valid ssl certificate that is both issued to the correct legal name of the brokerage firm as well as has been signed by a well known certificate authority e.g. for a financial services firm of any kind you should look for and expect to see an extended validation certificate   any other kind of certificate might only assert that the certificate was issued to the domain name owner and not necessarily to an organization with the registered legal name   yes anybody can register a domain with a similar name and then acquire a basic ssl certificate for that domain fwiw scottrade and sharebuilder are both legitimate brokers i was aware already of each but i also just checked in the finra tool and the urls currently linked to by the question are legitimate web site addresses for each   also you can see their ev certificates in action on secured pages here and here as to whether your investments with those brokers would be safe in the event of the broker failing e.g. goes bankrupt you 'll want to know that they are members of the securities investor protection corporation wikipedia   of course this kind of protection does n't protect you if your investments simply go down in value but do your own due diligence always

any publicly traded financial instrument can be sold short in theory   there are however many regulations associated with short sales of us equities that may prevent certain stocks from being sold short at certain times or through certain brokers some examples the most basic requirement this is n't a regulation it 's just the definition of a short sale is that you or your broker must have access to someone willing to loan you his her shares   if you are interested in shorting a security with few shares outstanding or low trade volume there may simply not be enough people in the world willing to loan you theirs   alternatively there may be a shareholder willing to loan shares but your broker may not have a relationship with the clearing house that shareholder is using   a larger better different broker might be able to help threshold securities list since 2005 each day certain securities are not allowed to be sold short based on their recent history of liquidity   basically if a certain number of transactions in a security have not been correctly settled over the past few days then the sec has reason to believe that short sales which require extra transactions are at higher risk of falling through circuit breaker a.k.a alternative uptick since 2011 during certain market conditions exchanges are now required to reject short sales for certain securities in order to prevent market crashes market abuse

sales tax and luxury tax is what you will have to pay tax wise and they are non refundable in most cases but the rules vary area to area   this really tripped up some friends of mine i had come from england   the rules are complicated and regional   sales tax is anywhere from 0 to and are not usually applied to raw foods   luxury taxes are usually state level and only apply to things most people consider a large purchase jewelry cars houses etc not things your likely to buy small normal jewelry usually does n't count diamond covered clock probably has a luxury tax for sales tax it can change a lot do n't be afraid to ask people ask all the time it 's normal i personally add 10 to what i buy sales tax in my city is 7 county is 6.5 state is 6 so you can get different rates depending on what side of the street you shop on some times   under normal circumstances you do not get a refund on these taxes some states do give refunds usually however the trouble of getting that refund is n't worth it unless making a large purchase   you are not exempt from paying sales tax depending on where you go you may get asked business are exempt if they are purchasing things to re sell only the end customer pays sales tax   depending on where you go online purchases may not be subject to sales tax though they might that again depends on city county and state laws normally you will have to pay sales tax at the register it will be calculated into your total and show as a line item on your receipt also some products have other non refundable taxes rental car taxes fuel taxes and road taxes are all likely taxes you will have to pay   areas that have a lot of tourists usually but not always have more of these kinds of taxes   friendly note don't buy dvds here they wo n't work when you get home i know you did n't ask but this catches a lot of people same for electronics in many cases specially optical drives and wireless

and the fact that if notes trade up high enough they tend to get taken out with lower yielding notes pending the call schedule so in theory there is more limited upside in high yield whereas equity could theoretically trade to infinity   the positives for high yield is that they generate monthly cash flow via coupon payments and have less down side relative to equities naturally this lower down side comes at the expense of lower up side as well

justkt 's answer lays out the opportunity costs aspect of your question pretty well   but if i were in your position extra payments on principal for a home i was n't planning to retire in is n't the way i 'd invest the money   housing prices are awful hence the great deal on what you just bought and given the number of foreclosures outstanding and the existing uncertainty over the legality of some of them they 're likely to remain awful for years   depending on the size of your monthly mortgage payment if you 've got that much free cash after expenses each month i 'd consider the following options instead you could go with a non qualified no tax deferral benefit account for the cash emergency fund so you could put any amount above and beyond 3 6 months of living expenses into stocks index funds mutual funds etc all of these options have the advantage of being more likely to provide a positive return in the 5 7 year time frame   the cash emergency fund option has the additional advantage of being more liquid than housing regardless of the current economic environment

my revised bottom line advice offer to send a 2nd payment preferably in the form of money order or cashier 's check for the difference you are agreeing to pay i can not imagine any reason why they would object to this there is no fee to cash a check there 's less risk of error and less work involved alternatively offer to send a new check only once the other has been returned do n't issue one more full amount check while the other is still outstanding there is a good reason not to accept partial payment by them which is that accepting a partial payment of a debt comes with a varieties of strings attached depending on the nature of the debt such as with court processes may need to be etc they likely want to avoid such a situation but this does not provide any support for why they ca n't just take a second payment and then cash it all at once as a single full settlement of the debt in a perfect world you could skip all the non sense by simply having your bank put a stop payment on the old check before sending a new one unfortunately this might not work with 100 accuracy but in your case if the partial payment is a significant amount of money to you i 'd go ahead and spend the $ 20 40 to put in the order now as an extra safety on them not doing what they claim if for some incredibly stupid reason you ca n't handle this with a 2nd payment instead of one single full one it turns out banks have lots of surprising and stupid rules like stop payments on a check expiring in 6 months and they may even cash stale checks over a year old no guarantee of a stop being successful etc the real rule is they might cash the check unless you close the account sigh this is one of many reasons i never ever use checks i am not aware of any law that requires a check to be physically returned if requested or proof or destruction provided or anything like that it 's a large part of the reason why we have the ability to stop payment on a check and so void it through the bank without having any physical access to the check but this process is spotty and imperfect and can not be relied upon you can request them to do whatever you like like void it and send it back or destroy it and they can just refuse or say they 'll do it and then just not do it and you have no real useful recourse the main goal should be to avoid losing money if someone accidentally or intentionally cashes both checks so you can ask or demand refuse to pay until they return the check etc and they can respond more or less any way they want as a final piece of future advice consider no longer using checks for purposes like this switch to using something like a cashier 's check or money order offered by your bank which by their very nature takes the money out of your account immediately all ongoing connection to your bank account and is effectively like cash with the added benefit of a paper trail keep the stub and and receipt from the cashier 's check money order in case it is lost or they claim they did n't get the money

it would be better for you to sell yourself and pay capital gains tax than to transfer to your parents and pay the gift tax also sham transfer you transfer to your mother only so that she could sell and transfer back to you without you paying taxes will be probably categorized as tax evasion which is a criminal offense that could lead to your what the us should or should not claim you can take to your congressman but the fact is that the us does claim tax on capital gains even if you bought the asset before becoming us tax resident and that 's the current law

yes it is common for investors to make equity investments in technology companies pre ipo   there are technology like y that exist to make angel investments which are early stage equity investments in private technology companies these investments are sometimes in notes that are convertible to equity but are very similar to a stock investment   wealthy individuals can also make angel investments e.g. peter thiel made a $ 500 k investment in facebook in 2004 for of the company   additionally venture capital firms exist to make equity investments in private companies   in the us you need to be an accredited investor to make private equity investments income greater than $ 200 k or net worth greater than $ 1 million but you probably need a lot more money than the minimum and connections to get in on these deals in reality

this is going to vary from insurer to insurer and likely year to year   typically an insurer will set what it calls the guaranteed rate of return for whole life policies and will allow you to take loans against the cash value of your policy at some adjustment to that rate   also typically you pay the interest back to yourself less some small administrative fee some insurers have whole life policies called something along the lines of an accelerated cash value policy or a high early cash value policy stick to these ones   the commission structure is less favorable to the agent broker but much more of your premium is recognized as cash value earlier the benefit for lack of a better word to taking a loan against your own cash value over taking a loan from a bank is the severely reduced process   there 's no underwriting for your loan like there would be from a bank   if you 're laid off maybe you ca n't get a loan from a bank but you can scoop some money out of your policy on a loan basis or alternatively you can just surrender the policy and take the accrued cash value many people will poo poo the value of whole life but fact of the matter is your underwriting status can change in the course of your life and it 's possible that in the future you wo n't be able to buy any life insurance   there 's nothing wrong with having something permanent to supplement your larger term policies personally i view diversification as having money in a lot of different places   this strategy is probably not as efficient as it could but i do n't like the idea of having all my eggs in one basket   i have cash in a lock box at home cash savings cds a personal loan portfolio bitcoins index funds individual stocks commodity etfs and bond funds spread in traditional 401(k roth ira and regular taxable accounts spread out to 6 different institutions   i do n't personally own any whole life but i 'll probably buy a small policy before my next 6-month birthday i might as well put some money there too   all of this is to say do not put all of your money in a whole life policy and do not buy all of your life insurance needs via whole life

aside of do n't lend money to friends a good idea is to have a written contract that states the sum the due date the interest if any having the loan on paper makes it more real and harder to forget the third party is not necessary anyone can have a bank loan for more than $ 10 k by signing a contract with a bank without any third party

saving for college you have a couple of options   529 plans are probably the best bet for most people wanting to save for their kids college education you can put a lot of money away and you may get a state tax deduction the downside is if you 're kid does n't go to college you may end up eating the 10 penalty state specific prepaid tuition plans the upside is you know roughly the return you are going to get on your money the downside is your kid has to go to a state school in the state you prepaid or there are likely withdrawal penalties for the most part these really are n't that great of a deal any more   are also an option but they only allow you to contribute $ 2k year but you have more investment options than with the 529 plans traditional and roth ira accounts can also be used to pay for higher education i would n't recommend this route in general but if you maxed out your 401k and were n't using your ira contribution limits you could put extra money here and get more or really different flexibility than you can with a 529 account i doubt ira 's will ever be asked for on a fafsa which might be helpful another option is to save the money in a regular brokerage account you would have more flexibility but lower returns after taxes one advantage to this route is if you think your kid might be borderline for financial aid a year or two before he starts college you could move this money into another investment that does n't matter for financial aid purposes a few words of caution make sure you save for retirement before saving for your kids college he can always get loans to pay for school but no one is going to give you a loan to pay for your retirement also be cautious with the amount of money you give your adult child studies have shown that the more money that parents give their adult children the less successful they are compared to their peers

the good debt bad debt paradigm only applies if you are considering this as a pure investment situation and not factoring in a house is something you live in and a car is something you use for transportation these are not substitutes for each other while you can live in your car in a pinch you ca n't take your house to the shops looking at the car i will simplify it to 3 options you can now make a list of pros and cons for each one and decide the value you place on each of them e.g. public transport will add travel time per week $ x per hour how much you value your leisure time an expensive car will make me feel good and i value that at $ y. for each option put all the benefits together this is the value of that option to you then put all of the costs together this is what the option costs you then make a decision on which is the best value for you   once you have decided which option is best for you then you can consider how you will fund it

if you are just trying to curb impulse spending i 'd suggest the following   1 set up a separate bank account for your savings do not order checks or a debit card for this account 2 get your employer to split your paycheck to put the saving amount in the new account most employers will do this the trick to avoid impulse spending is to make it a chore to get at the money with the above arrangement you would have to physically go to the bank fill out a withdrawal slip and get cash this way you still can access the money in an emergency but it forces you to plan things out better

suddenly its not just comparing the current price to the price of the contract or is it sure it is   suppose you bought 100 option contracts each for 100 shares and paid a $ 1 per share premium $ 10,000 total   now those options are trading for $ 1.50 per share   you have an unrealized $ 0.50 gain per share or $ 5,000 the $ 10,000 in options you bought are now worth $ 15,000   it holds whether they were bought to open or close a position or whether they are puts or calls   the only difference is whether you bought or sold the options the arithmetic is just reversed for selling an option but lets say we have an option where the payoff is k where ct is the market price what do you do then your current unrealized p&l is different than the payoff   the payoff only happens at maturity   the current p&l is based on current market prices just like stock   option prices all have a time premium making them worth more than their payoff intrinsic value prior to maturity

in addition to the answer from cqm let me answer your am i missing anything question then i 'll talk about how your approach of simplifying this is making it both harder and easier for you last i 'll show what my model for this would look like but if you are n't capable of stacking this up yourself then you really should n't be borrowing 10,000 to try to make money on the margin am i missing anything yes you 're forgetting 1 taxes specifically income tax and 2 sales fees   on the first you have not considered anything in your financial model for taxes you should include at least 25 of your expected returns going to taxes because anything that you buy and then sell within 12 months is taxed as income not capital gains on the second you will incur sales commissions and/or transaction fees depending on the brokerage you are using for your plan these tend to vary widely but i would expect to spend at least $ 25 per sale so if i were building out this model i would think that your break even would have to at least cover monthly interest + monthly principal payment income tax when sold commissions and broker 's fees every time you sell holdings on over simplifying you have the right idea with thinking about both interest and principal in trying to sketch this out but as i mentioned above you 're making this both harder and easier for yourself you are making it harder because you are doing the math wrong the actual payment for this loan assuming it is a normal loan can be found most easily with the pmt function in excel = nper pv fv = 24 0 that returns a monthly payment   of principal + interest of   so you actually are over calculating the payment by $ with your ballpark approach however you did n't actually have all the factors in the model to begin with so that does n't matter much   you are making it artificially easier because you have not thought about the impact of repaying principal what i mean is this in your question you indicate   i 'm guessing the necessary profit is just the total interest on this loan = = $ 720 usd so i 'll break even on this loan if and only if i make $ 720 from stocks over 24 months so the rate of return is + 720 = this sounds all you need is a total return across two years but assuming this is a normal loan and not an interest only loan you have to get rid of your capital a little bit at a time to pay back the loan in essence you will pay back 1/3 of your principal the first year and then you have to keep making the same fixed interest + principal payments out of a smaller base of capital   so for the first few months you can cover the interest easily but by the end you have to be making phenomenal returns to cover it   here is how i would build a model for it i actually did and your breakeven is about per month at that outstanding annual return you would be earning a whopping $ 4 at least as far as the variables are concerned you need to be considering your current capital balance because month 1 you may have $ 10,000 but month 2 you have just after paying back some principal   your rate of return if you do this in excel you can play with it some but you should save the time and just invest somewhere else your actual return that month rate of return existing capital balance   loan payment = for the parameters you gave earlier   income tax = actual return .25 with this kind of loan you 're not actually making enough to preserve the 10,000 capital and you 're selling everything you 've gained each month   commission = $ 25 per month assuming that covers your trade fees and broker commissions i guarantee you that this is not the deal breaker in the model so do n't get excited if you think i 'm over estimating this and you realize that scottrade or somewhere will let you have trades at $ each    monthly ending balance = = next month 's starting capital balance   stack it all up in excel for 24 months and see for yourself if you like the key thing you left out is that you 're repaying each month out of capital that you 'd like to use to invest with this makes you need much higher returns   even if your initial description was n't clear and this is an interest only loan you 're still looking at a rate of about 7.6 annually that you need to hit in order to just break even on the costs of holding the loan and transferring your gains into cash

obviously you ca n't predict the future too much but it 's not too hard to figure out what is going to happen to mortgage rates in the short term mortgage rates are heavily influenced by 10 year treasury yields   you can find the daily 10 year rates here   it 's easy to see the direction they 've been moving recently   it usually takes a few days for mortgage rates to follow if the 10 year treasury yield is dropping although if it 's going up mortgage rates will go up faster than they will fall here 's a sample of all the 10 year treasury yields for the past 10 years   looks like a good time to get a mortgage or refinance you can also take a look at movements in mortgage backed securities here you can find a chart for fannie mae 3.0 mortgages   as the price goes up mortgage rates go down   think of it this way right now people are will to pay $ 103 for $ 100 worth of 3.0 mortgages that does n't really make sense because i could just loan you $ 100 at 3.0 and turn around and sell it for $ 103 immediately pocketing the $ 3 profit   the reason is because right now no one would willingly borrow money at 3.0 rates have fallen so much that if a bank has a customer paying them 3.0 on a mortgage other people are willing to pay a premium on that mortgage new mortgages are probably being written for 2.0 there is no current mortgage backed security for 2.0 fannie because rates have never been this low before

invest because you are young and have lots of time i recommend opening an investment account and putting most 1000 £ or all in something like an s&p 500 index fund or etf start building   your savings now because compound growth over time will build significant wealth you can still invest the other in something a bit less volatile if you think you 'll need the money in < 5 years if you expect your income to continue to grow and you expect to have extra cash every month for the foreseeable future i 'd just put it all in an index fund you can weather any temporary market swings and in the worst case scenario you can always sell a few shares if you need the cash the advantage of an index fund is that it has very low fees and it 's an invest and forget approach you do n't have to watch the market every day because your money will simply match the market and in the long term the market does much better than most managed funds or etfs

like a lot of businesses they win on the averages which means lucrative customers subsidize the money losers   this is par for the course   it 's the health club model   the people who show up everyday are subsidized by the people who never show but are too guilty to cancel when i sent 2 dvds a day to netflix they lost their shirt on me and made it up on the customers who do n't in those free to play actually 95 99 of the players never pay and are carried by the 1 5 who spend significantly   in business thinking the overall marketing cost of acquiring a new customer is pretty big $ 50 to $ 500 on the other side of the credit card they pay $ 600 bounty for new merchant customers there are salesmen who live on converting 2 3 merchants a month    that 's because as a rule customers tend to lock in   that 's why dot lose millions for years giving you a free service   eventually they figure out a revenue model and you stay with it despite the new ads because changing is inconvenient when you want to do a banking transaction they must provide the means to do that   normal banks have the staggering cost of a huge network of branch offices where you can walk in and hand a check to a teller   the whole point of an atm is to reduce the cost of that   chase has 3 staffed locations in my and 6 atms   schwab has 3 locations in my greater metro which contains over 400 if you 're in a one horse town like french lick or detroit no schwab for miles   so for schwab a $ 3 atm fee is n't expensive it 's cheap compared to the cost of serving you any other way there may also be behind the scenes agreements where the bank that charged you $ 3 refunds some of it to schwab after they refund you   it does n't really cost $ 3 to do a foreign atm transaction   most debit cards have a visa or mastercard logo   many places will let you run it as an atm card with a pin entry   however everyone who takes visa mc must take it as a credit card using a signature in that case the merchant pays 2 10 depending on several factors of this about 1.4 goes to the issuing bank   this is meant to cover the bank 's risk of credit card defaults but drawing from a bank account where they can decline if the money is n't there that risk is low so it 's mostly gravy you may find schwab is doing ok on that alone   also do n't use debit cards at any but the most trusted shops unless you fully understand how in fraud situations credit cards and debit cards compare and are comfortable with the increased risks      there are literally dozens of micro fees depending on their volume swipe vs chip atm vs credit rewards cards fixed vs online vs mobile etc home depot does ok the food vendor at the renaissance faire gets slaughtered this kind of is why small vendor services like square are becoming hugely popular they flat rate everything at around 2.7 yay

you probably have a ugma account while the money in that account belongs to you as long as you 're a minor which is until the age of 18 in california you can not directly access it instead your or or any other trustee manages that account for you with your best interests in mind while you may want to spend that money or give it away to your boyfriend or whoever else it is very likely not in your best interest to do that that is why your dad refuses he has a legal responsibility which is called fiduciary duty to ensure the money is spent in a way that is best for you if the fiduciary just lets you spend the money away you could later when you 're no longer a minor sue that person for the breach of trust when you 're older and a bit more mature you 'll be able to make your own decisions and do whatever you want with that money but as long as your parents have the responsibility to act in your best interests it is likely that your boyfriend will stay in pennsylvania for a while

since you are not paying the full balance off each month you are carrying a balance from month to month that balance is being charged some interest rate x. with a balance transfer the new credit card pays off that balance as a result you now have a balance of the same amount plus any processing charges on the new credit card hence the balance has transferred from the old to the new and you now pay the new credit card ideally you do this because the new credit card is offering a reduced interest rate saving you money though be warned often that transfer rate is a limited time deal and any left over after the window expires will be charged the higher rate

first you should understand the basics of how insurance companies make money in a simple scenario assume 1,000 have car insurance assume that on average 100 people have accidents per year and that each accident costs $ 10,000 so we can expect total costs to be $ 1,000,000 per year some of those costs will be paid by the drivers who have some sort of deductible that is the insurance company will only cover costs after the driver has paid some initial amount something like the first $ 1,000 of repairs is paid by the driver so now the insurance company expects to have to pay out $ 900,000 in total claims this year if they want to pay those claims and also pay their administrative costs and earn a profit they might want to have $ in revenue across 1,000 people that would be $ 1,250 year in insurance premiums of course the big question for the insurance company is how much will they really need to pay out in insurance claims each year the better they can predict that number the more profitable they can be because they can charge a much more accurate amount which can earn them new customers and gives them insurance pun that each new customer is actually profitable to them on average so the insurance company spends a lot of time and money trying to predict your likelihood of a car accident they use a lot of metrics to do this some might be statistical that they charge you because they feel they can if every insurance company charges you extra for driving a instead of a then they all will and some might be based in reality so they attempt to correlate all of the items in your list to see if any of those items indicates that you should be charged more or less for your insurance this is equal parts art and science and a lot of it comes down to how they market themselves ie if an insurance company gives a discount for being in college is that because college drivers are better drivers or is it because they want to increase the number of young customers they have so they can keep those customers for life therefore how each metric factors into your calculation will be based on the company using it it would basically be impossible to come up with the same answer as the insurance company by having the information you provided because of how heavily dependant that answer is on statistics + marketing as for how your state matters some states may have different accident rates and different payout systems for example is hawaii driving more dangerous because of all the tourists driving rented cars faster than they should is new york less expensive to insure because better public health care means less cost is borne by the insurance company in the event of an accident i have no idea if either of these things are the case they are purely for hypothetical discussion purposes   in short make sure you get quotes from multiple providers and understand that it is n't just the cost that changes check changes in coverage and deductibles as well ie if one company charges you $ 100 month when everyone else charges $ 200 month make sure that the cheaper company does n't limit its coverage in ways that matter to you

unfortunately it 's not unusual enough   if you 're looking for a popular car and the dealer wants to make sure they are n't holding onto inventory without a guarantee for sale then it 's a not completely unreasonable request   you 'll want to make sure that the deposit is on credit card not cash or check so you can dispute if an issue arises    really though most dealers do n't do this requiring a deposit pre sale is usually one of those negotiating tactics where the dealer you into a deal even if they do n't have a good deal to make   dealers may tell you that you ca n't get your deposit back even if they do n't have the car you agreed on or the deal they agreed to   you do have a right for your deposit back if you have n't completed the transaction but it can be difficult if they do n't want to give you your money back   the dealer does n't ever not know if they have that specific vehicle in stock   the dealer keeps comprehensive searchable records for every vehicle it 's good for sales and it 's required for tax records   even when they did n't use computers for all this the entire inventory is a log book or phone call away in my opinion i would never exchange anything with the dealer without a car actually attached to the deal   i 'd put down a deposit on a car transfer if i were handed a vin and verified that it had all the exact options that we agreed upon and even then i 'd be very cautious about the condition

the put vs call assignment risk is actually the reverse in the money calls are more likely to be exercised early than puts exercising a call locks in profit for the option holder because they can buy the shares at below market price and immediately sell them at the higher market price if there are dividends due the risk is even higher by contrast exercising an in the money put locks in a loss for the holder so it 's less common

i was going to ask do you feel lucky punk but then it occurred to me that the film this quote came from dirty harry is 43 years old   and yet the question remains the stock market as measured by the s&p has returned   compounded over the last 100 years but with a standard deviation just under 20 there are years when you 'll do better and years you 'll lose and i 'd not ignore the last decade which was pretty bad a loss for the decade   there are clearly two schools of thought one says that no one ever lost sleep over not having a mortgage payment the other school states that at the very beginning you have a long investing horizon and the chances are very good that the 30 years to come will bring a return north of 6 the two decades prior to the last were so good that these past 30 years were still pretty good compounded   there is no right or wrong here my gut says fund your retirement accounts to the maximum build your emergency fund you see if you pay down your mortgage but lose your job you 'll still need to make those payments once you build your security think of the mortgage as the cash side of your investing i.e. focus less on the relatively low rate of return 4.3 and more on the eventual result once paid your cash flow goes up nicely    edit in light of the extra information you provided your profile reads that you have a high risk tolerance low overhead no dependents and secure employment combine to lead me to this conclusion at 23 i 'd not be investing at 4.3 i 'd learn how to invest in a way i was comfortable with and take it from there   disclosure updated i am older and am semi retired i still have some time left on the mortgage but it does n't bother me not at 3.5 i also have a 16 year old to put through college but her college account i fully funded

in 1929 the dow jones industrial average peaked at roughly 390 just prior to the great depression it did not return to that level again until 25 years later in 25 years is a long time to go without any returns especially if you are a retiree there is no easy answer with investing trying to time the tops and bottoms is widely regarded as a foolhardy endeavor but whenever you invest you expose yourself to the possibility of this scenario the only thing i highly recommend is not to base your decision on the historical returns from 1975 to 2000 that the other answers have presented these returns can be explained by policy changes that many are coming to understand are unsustainable the growth of our debt income inequality and monetary manipulation by central banks are all reasons to be skeptical of future returns

mutual funds buy and sell shares in companies in accordance with   the policies set forth in their prospectus not according to the   individual needs of an investor that is when you invest money in or withdraw money from a mutual fund   the manager buys or sells whatever shares that in the manager 's judgement   will be the most appropriate ones consistent with the investment policies thus a large cap mutual fund manager will not buy the latest hot small cap stock that will likely be hugely profitable he she must choose only between various large capitalization companies some exchange traded funds are fixed baskets of stocks suppose you will not invest in a company x as a matter of principle unless a mutual fund prospectus says that it will not invest in x you may well end up having an investment in x at some time because the fund manager bought shares in x. with such an etf   you know what is in the basket and if the basket does not include stock in x   now it will not own stock in x at a later date some exchange traded funds are constructed based on some index and track the index as a matter of policy thus you will not be investing in x unless x becomes part of the index because standard or poor or russell or somebody changed their minds and the etf buys x in order to track the index finally some etfs are exactly like general mutual funds except that you can buy or sell etf shares at any time at the price at the instant that your order is executed whereas with mutual funds the price of the mutual fund shares that you have bought or sold is the nav of the mutual fund shares for that day which is established based on the closing prices at the end of the trading day of the stocks bonds etc that the fund owns   so you might end up owning stock in x at any time based on what the fund manager thinks about x.

a paper ee series us savings bond is what is called a zero coupon bond you buy it at a discount from the face value 50 discount for us savings bonds and it earns interest though you do n't get the interest as cash that you could invest elsewhere instead the interest earned increases the   redemption value of the bond the money that you will receive if you take the bond to your bank to cash it in before the maturity date when the bond finally matures its redemption value has increased to the full face value   the maturity date for paper ee series us savings bonds issued in may 1995 is 17 years now with zero coupon bonds in general the irs requires that the interest earned each year be reported as interest income even though you did not receive any cash income and tax is due on the interest unless it is a tax free municipal bond or the bond is held in a tax deferred investment such as an ira or 401(k plan however there is a special exemption for ee series us savings bonds in that the owner has the option of not declaring the interest each year but instead reporting all the accumulated interest as interest income in the year of redemption most people choose this option it is not capital gains as you would like to be    so if your grandfather paid $ for ee series us savings bonds in may 1995 the face value of the bonds he received was $ 22 k and assuming that your grandfather followed typical practice the bonds were worth $ 22 k in may 2012 and $ 11 k interest income needed to be declared that year   this matches up pretty well with the amount the irs told him was interest income on which he had to pay income tax though the year is off by 3   now your grandfather died in 2008 and what happened to the bonds depends on in whose the bonds were registered e.g. was your father named as the survivor on the bond or if your grandfather was the sole owner how your grandfather 's estate was handled the interest accrued till your grandfather died belonged to the estate note also that ee series bonds continue to earn interest in years 18 through 30 after they mature but at maturity the interest rate is reset by the treasury usually to the long term interest rate which has been very small over the past many years so the interest earned in 2012 2015 when your father effectively redeemed the bond is small enough that the approximately $ 11 k could be construed as covering $ k consisting of $ 11 k of interest before maturity and $ 300 interest at about 1 per annum over the three year post maturity period the $ 100 interest earned by you for the current year sounds about right too all in all it might be the case that your grandfather bought the bonds in his name your father 's name and your name were you very young in 1995 your father and you inherited the bonds in 2008 and then your father removed your grandfather 's name from the bonds in 2015 thus transferring the bonds to his name and yours in 2015 and soon thereafter removed his name transferring the bonds into your name alone as to why 2015 and not 2008 when your grandfather passed away did you turn 21 in 2015 twenty years after the bonds were bought

just saw the video i think there will be less incentive for businesses and governments to allow automation to reach a point where the majority of the population is out of work it 's not hard to imagine why any economic system that puts automation above everything can end up in disarray excess automation will trigger the law of diminishing returns to kick in in end the system will have to regulate itself to survive    example pro automation and businesses increase investment in automation margins increase which leads to more spending and investment more workers are laid off the standard of living increases in the short run as more workers are getting laid off aggregate demand decreases and spending decreases leading to a recession    the glut of production the market further standard of living decreases income disparities between workers and sponsors of automation increase anti automation movements commence social conflict ensures production grinds to a near halt as unrest increases    now two things are possible either pro automation gives in to the pressure and introduce labor reforms full automation to allow job creation or they are ousted in a social revolution and an anti automation takes over automation is kept in check

a sure fire way to make money   hell no there are tonnes of scams and money grabs out there not to mention the fact that most icos are based on projects that are going nowhere having said that there are many icos each month that will do very well in the future   the best thing to do is to a number of projects you like the sound of and then sit down and research each of them   some of the key things to look out for aside from whether you think the idea is a good one are the team   do they have a proven track record   are they reputable   is what they claim provable   google team member names and check to see if they have a legit linkedin profile the whitepaper   is it clearly worded without spelling and grammar mistakes   does it have a well defined with provable achievements to date the ico format   how much are they looking to raise and is it a realistic figure   are unsold tokens burnt   is there a maximum contribution limit per investor what does the competition look like if they are first to market then this will make the startup way more attractive the above are probably the most important things to consider though there are many other things to investigate i have written a fairly comprehensive guide to all the things i look out for when analyzing the of an ico you might want to check it out before firing out your bitcoin and eth into dubious projects

if you know you will have a big bill like braces and you fully expect to hit the deductible then it can make sense the deductible can trip some people up because if they put too much into the limited purpose fsa and do n't hit the deductible for the regular insurance policy they ca n't get to all the money in the fsa because you have the ability to spend the potential money in the fsa before all the money has been contributed it can allow you to make that payment for the braces in january i did this the first year we had the hsa i knew i needed to pay a dental bill early in the year but the hsa would only have a few hundred dollars at that time so i used the limited purpose fsa to be able to make that payment this could also work if you spent a lot of money in the previous year because you have the ability to adjust how much money goes into the hsa each each pay period this idea does keep the option open to fully fund the hsa if your finances improve regarding the deductible   the law limits what you can use the limited purpose fsa for dental and vision only there is an exception if you hit the deductible for the high deductible insurance policy then you can use the funds in the limited purpose fsa for any medical reason   when i did this a few years ago i needed to send extensive paperwork to the company holding the funds before they would release the funds for dental once i sent them proof that i had met the deductible then any medical expense after that date could use the fsa with minimal paperwork if you fully fund the fsa beyond the cost of the braces and then have a light year medical expense wise you might not be able to spend all money in the fsa by the deadline regarding state taxes   i saw no difference in my states virginia treatment of the funds the state taxable income number was exactly the same as the federal taxable income number it did not treat the money in the fsa differently than the money in the hsa

you are expecting that if you pay off a 30 mortgage after 16 years you should be charged the same amount of interest as someone who had a 16 year mortgage for the same amount and with the same interest rate this is n't correct and here 's why the person with the 16 year mortgage paid it off faster than you they paid more each month and the size of their loan shrunk faster than yours after 15 years they had paid off a lot more than you you paid a lump sum after 16 years but at this point the extra money which they had paid had been in the banks hands for a long time you caught up with them then but you had been behind them for all of the previous years on the other hand you owed the same amount in each of those years as the person who took out a 30 year mortgage and did n't prepay therefore you paid the same amount of interest as this person not the first person if you could arrange in advance a loan where you made the same payment as you did for 16 years then paid the balance in a lump sum then you would have paid exactly what you did

i have a friend who had went on a seminar with the company that has than merrill as ceo he told me that one of the things taught in that seminar was how to find funding for the property that you want to flip one of the things he mentioned was that there are so called hard money lenders who are willing to lend you the money for the property in exchange for getting their name on the property title last time i checked it looked like here in florida we had at least capital and commercial lending that were in that business these hard money lenders get their investment back when the house is sold so there is some underlying expectation that the house can be sold with some profit to reimburse both the lender and you for your work that friend of mine did tell me that he had flipped a house once but that he did not receive the funding to that from a lender but from an in law however it was through a similar arrangement

you must mean the current debt ceiling debacle the meaning of it is us government is constantly borrowing money by issuing treasury bonds and constantly repaying some of the bonds that come to maturity and also has other obligations it has to meet by law all the time such as social security checks bonds interest federal employees salaries and pensions etc by law total amount of money that can be borrowed at the same time is capped that means there can be situation where the government needs to borrow money to pay say interest on existing bonds but can not since the limit is reached such situation is called a default since the government promised to pay the interest but is unable to do so that does not mean the government has no money at all and will completely collapse or could n't raise money on the market if it were permitted by law to do so currently the market is completely willing to buy the debt issued by us government and with interest that is not very high though of course that may change it also does not mean the economy ceases to function dollars cease to have value or banks instantly go bankrupt but if the government breaks its promises to investors it has various consequences such as raising the costs of borrowing in the future breaking promises to other people like social security recipients would also look bad and probably hurt many of them going back to your bank account most probably nothing would happen to the money you store there even if the bank had invested 100 of the money in us treasury bonds which does n't really happen they still can be sold on the open market even if with some discount in the event of credit rating downgrade so most probably your account would not be affected as stated in another answer even if the fallout of all these causes a bank to fail there 's fdic and if your money is under insured maximums you 'll be getting your money back but if your bank is one of the big ones nothing of the sort would happen anyway as we have seen in the past years government would do practically anything to not allow any big bank failures

there are a couple of different things that could be referenced by cheap money the money supply itself this is the federal reserve printing more money which could devalue the existing us dollars and thus make the dollars even cheaper since there would be more of them interest rates currently in the us interest rates are rather low which means that borrowers could possibly get good rates on that money thus making it relatively cheap   compare current interest rates to the early 1980s and there is a major difference in terms of implications on the stock market there are a couple that come to my mind investment options with low interest rates cash and bonds are n't necessarily yielding that much and thus some people may be more likely to invest elsewhere with stocks being an option   thus there may be some people that would rather invest in stocks than hold their investments in lower yielding options corporate spending if rates stay low then for companies with good financial track records they could borrow money to expand operations rather than sell more stock and thus there may be companies that borrow to grow so that they take advantage of these interest rates

some questions will you need a car after 18 months   what are you going to do then how likely are you able to go over the mileage granted paying $ 300 per month seems somewhat attractive as a fixed cost   however lease are notorious for forcing people into making bad decisions   if your car is over miles or there is some slight damage even normal wear and tear or you customize your car such as window the dealer can demand extra dollars or force you to purchase the car for more than it is actually worth    the bottom line is leasing is one of the most expensive ways to own a vehicle and while you have a great income you have a poor net worth   so yes i would say it is somewhat irresponsible for you to own a vehicle if i was in your shoes i would cut my gym expenses cut my retirement contributions to the match and buy another used car   i understand you may have some over your last car but it is the best mathematical choice having said all that you have a great income and you can absorb a lot of less than efficient decisions   you will probably be okay leasing the car   i would suggest going for a longer term or cutting something to pay off the student loans earlier   this way there is some cushion between when the lease ends and the student loan ends    this way when lease turn in comes you will have some room in your budget to pay some fees as you wo n't have your student loan payment assuming around that you can then pay to the dealer

in that case he was not arrested for being unable to pay his bill he received a summons to court failed to appear and so a warrant was issued for his arrest the $ 350 was his bail amount which is funds that must be provided to the court in order to be released while pending trial you get this money back once you appear before court he also was n't convicted of a crime and sentenced to jail in this case just arrested he would be kept by the courts if he could n't post bail until his court date as a way of being forced to appear if a judgement was awarded against him it still does n't always mean he has to pay if someone refuses to pay a judgement but did show up to court then typically their wages are garnished which means the court orders that a certain amount of money be withheld from income tax refunds etc until the judgement is paid however if the person ordered to pay can prove that they would not be able to have sufficient money to survive if they are garnished i 'm not a lawyer so i am unclear as to the exact process standards then there is a chance that nothing will be garnished at all   so in short no there is no such thing as debtor 's prison in the usa there is definitely such a thing as being arrested put in jail for court orders and i 'm sure if you took out loans while knowing you have no ability to repay them that you might be able to be charged with some sort of fraud but just not being able to pay your bills does n't mean you can go to jail of course there is very little protecting you from simply running out of money and becoming homeless but that 's not your question

would it make sense to set up multiple bank accounts to avoid going above their thresholds   quite yes but you need to pay attention to the fine print i do n't know what the situation is in poland but in the uk accounts that pay high interest often have strings attached for example the santander 123 current account pays very good interest but it has an account fee and some other requirements that are difficult to meet if you are not using it as your main current account   you need to read the terms carefully if you go over the threshold does the lower rate only apply to money over the threshold or does it apply to all the money in the account are there any other restrictions on how you use the account also i do n't know if poland has any provisions for limited tax advantaged savings like the isa scheme we have in the uk if it does then that can add further complications how to calculate how to maximize the profit here well in theory you would get the best account you can and fill it to the threshold then the next best account and so on you would move any interest paid in an account that was already full to the threshold to the best non full account or if the account strongly going over perhaps move an ammount of money to the interest just before the interest is paid in practice that is a lot of work so if the rates on the different accounts are similar you may want to leave some margin for interest or in the case of an account that pays the lower rate on the overage while still paying the higher rate on money below the threshold accepting that some of your money will earn slightly less than idea another option some accounts may offer is just to pay the interest to another account avoiding the need to move it yourself finally you should check out your government 's limits for compensation in the event of banks going bust as a general rule you do n't want to put more than that ammount in a single bank even if doing so would get you the best interest

unfortunately not directly   for iras and hsas we have an annual maximum contribution limit what you can do which does n't initially seed it is to put the money aside in a savings account that you want to contribute to your hsa or ira and then put it in the ira or hsa when the timing is right for you   the key here though is that the contribution can not exceed the maximum limit for the year another way around this which really is n't because it just means that you 'll have a new higher limit is to become self employed see this from the irs about contribute as much as 25 of your net earnings from self employment    not including contributions for yourself up to $ for 2013    $ for 2014 still none of these methods are pre an account as the maximum contribution limit is never exceeded

to be completely honest i think that a target of 10 15 is very high and if there were an easy way to attain it everyone would do it if you want to have such a high return you 'll always have the risk of losing the same amount of money option 1 i personally think that you can make the highest return if you invest in real estate and actively manage your if you do this well with short term rental and/or airbnb i think you can make healthy returns but it will cost a lot of time and effort which may diminish its appeal think about talking to your estate agent to find renters or always ensuring your airbnb place is in good nick so you get a high rating and keep getting good customers if you 're looking for passive income i do n't think this is a good choice also make sure you take note of 's point of costs no matter what you plan for your costs will always be higher than you think think about water damage a tenant that breaks things doesn't take care of stuff etc option 2 i think taking a loan is unnecessarily risky if you 're in good financial shape as it seems unless you 're gon na buy a house with a mortgage and live in it option 3 i think your best option is to buy bonds and shares you can follow 's 100 minus your age rule which seems very reasonable personally i invest all my money in shares because that 's how my father brought me up but it 's really a matter of taste both can be risky though bonds are usually safer i think i should note that you can not expect a return of 10 or more because as everyone always says if there were a way to guarantee it everyone would do it you say you do n't have any idea how this works so i 'd go to my bank and ask them you probably have access to private banking so that should mean someone will be able to sit you down and talk you through also look at other banks that have better rates and/or pretend you 're leaving your bank to negotiate a better deal if i were you i 'd invest in blue chips big international companies listed on the main dax ftse 100 dow jones or passively managed mutual funds etfs that track these just remember to diversify by country and industry a bit note i would not buy the vehicles plans that my bank no matter what they promise and they promise a lot suggest because if you do that then the bank always takes a cut off your money tldr do nt expect to make 10 15 on a passive investment and do what a lot of others do shares and bonds also make sure you get a lot of peoples opinions

buffett is a value investor his goal is to buy good companies when the market is overly worried and prices them below intrinsic value when the market is highly priced it is much more difficult for him to find things that he thinks are at an attractive price when people are very worried and the market has crashed stocks are then priced below their intrinsic value and he can use the cash he keeps in the company to make attractive purchases remember that buffett is not concerned with the ups and downs of the price of berkshire hathaway stock he is concerned with the economic value of the assets that the company owns so if all stock prices crash and he can buy things that are at bargain prices he is happy no matter what berkshire stock price does in the short run one consequence of value investing is that because you are buying assets at bargain prices the total value of your assets drops less in a bear market than the highly priced stuff that drives the major indexes

this is supply side nonsense the primary driver of growth is demand if demand is growing then lower taxes will allow the company to meet growing demand faster however if demand is stable and currently being met by the company reducing taxes will only enrich shareholders at the expense of society at large unless there is growing demand a corporation will always choose to allocate profit via tax cuts to shareholders rather than to employees in the form of jobs or raises

honing in on your last question is there a better way   i think there is but it would require you to change the way you handle your spending and that may not be of interest to you   right now you have a lot of manual work keeping track of expenditures and then entering the every day the great thing about switching to a habit where you pay for everything using a debit or credit card is that you can skip the manual entry by importing your transactions from your bank you mention that your bank does n't allow for exporting there 's still a chance that your bank can connect with a solution like wave accounting which is free and made for small business accounting full disclosure i represent wave if your current bank does n't permit export or connections with wave it may be worth switching to a different bank it 's a bit of a pain to make the switch i know but you really will save a massive amount of time and effort over the course of the year as well as minimize the risk of human error compared to entering your receipts on a daily basis in wave you can still enter all of your cash receipts manually if you want to continue with your current practice of cash payments one important thing to mention too if you 're looking for a better way of doing things make sure it includes proper backup there would be nothing worse than entering all that data onto a spreadsheet and then something happening to your computer and you lose it all   wave accounting is backed up hourly and uses bank level security to keep your information safe one last thing as i mention above wave accounting is free   so if it is a good match for your small business accounting needs it will also be a nice fit for your wallet

thirty thousand in credit card debt is a big elephant to eat so to speak   but you do it by taking a bite at a time   one positive is that you do not want to borrow from your 401k.   doing so is a horrible idea the first question you have to ask yourself and understand is how you accumulated 30 k in credit card debt in the first place   most people get there by running up a relatively small amount say 5 k and playing the zero transfer game a few times   then add in a late payment and a negative event or two like the car breaking down or a trip to the emergency room and poof a large amount of credit card debt    obviously i have no idea if this is how you got there and providing some insight might help    also your age approximate income and other debts might also help provide more insight   i assume you are still working and under age 59.5 as you are talking about borrowing from your 401k. where i come from is that my wife then girlfriend found ourselves under stifling debt a few years ago   when we married we became very intentional and focused on ourselves of debt and now sit completely debt free including the house   during our debt payoff time we lived off of less than 25 of our salary   we both took extra jobs when we were able   intensity was our key      if i were you i would not refi the house   there are costs associated with this and why would you put more debt on your home i might cash out the annuity provided that there are no negative tax consequences and depending on how much you can get for it   numbers are the key here   however i feel like doing so will not retire this debt the first thing you need to do is get on a written budget   a game plan for spending and stick to it   if you are married your spouse has to be part of this process   the budget has to be fresh each month and each month you and your wife should meet   to deviate from the budget you will also need to have a meeting   my wife and i still do this despite being debt free and enjoying very healthy incomes secondly it is about cutting expenses   cable off   no eating out or vacations   cut back on cell phone plans only basic clothing   gift giving is of the $ 5 variety and only for those very close to you   forget lattes etc   depending on your income i would cut 401 k contributions to zero or only up to the company match if your household income is above 150k year third it is about earning more   ebay deliver pizzas cut grass overtime whatever    all extra dollars go to credit card balance reduction   at a minimum you should find an extra $ 1000/month however i would shoot for   if you can find 2 k you will be done with this in 13 months   i know the math does n't work out for that but once you get momentum you find more how good will it feel to be out from under this oppression next march   i know you can do this without cashing in the annuity or refinancing   do you believe it

no danger you can get in a car accident break your leg or otherwise wind up in the hospital like anyone else   you can also get the money back with a tax penalty but you probably will never need to if you are responsible and live within your means do you need a wake up call about what things can cost   i knew a college student who broke his leg and did n't buy the health insurance    he had to have a rod put in his leg and it was   obviously he did n't have the money and the hospital agreed to put him on some kind of payment plan   i suppose bankruptcy was an alternative but either way not a great way to start out in life    any time you can defer payment of tax for decades or buy something with pre income tax money it is like instantly earning 20 or more on your money   i believe you can pay for and dental out of an hsa as well   so i would n't go overboard on an hsa or ira if you have big credit card debts if you do have room for savings it is dumb not to be putting money in the hsa and ira/401k take a look at hsa bank for a low fee home for your money they pay interest on over $ 3,000 but like most banks not much   the fees for being under $ 3k are currently around $ 2 a month   do n't worry about investing the hsa money until you have like $ 10,000 in there which will be a while

the first thing that strikes me is is this a time limited offer because if you can expect the offer to still be valid in a few weeks why not just wait that month which will earn you the money and buy the car then the second thing you need to consider is obviously the risk that in the interim there will be an actual emergency which would require the money that you no longer have the third thing to consider is whether you need the car now do you require a car to get around and your current one is breaking down perhaps even to the point that repairing it would cost you more than buying a new car and it is currently not safe to drive if so compare the cost of repairing to the cost of buying if the difference is small and the new car would be more likely to be reliable than the old car after spending the money then it can make sense to buy a new car and perhaps sell the old one in its current condition to someone who likes to tinker even if you only recover a few hundreds of dollars that 's still money that perhaps you would n't otherwise have the fourth thing i would consider especially given the time frame involved is can you get a loan to buy the new car even if the interest rate is high one month 's worth of interest expense wo n't set you back very far and it will keep the money in your emergency fund for if there is an actual emergency in the weeks ahead doing so might be a better choice than to take the money out of the emergency fund if you have the opportunity save the emergency fund for when that opportunity does not exist and of course without knowing how much you earn take care to not end up with a car that is no more reliable than what you have now without knowing how much you earn and what the car you have in mind would cost it 's hard to say anything for certain but if the car you have in mind costs less than a month 's worth of net pay for you consider whether it 's likely to be reliable maybe you are making an absolutely stellar pay and the car will be perfectly fine but there 's that risk running the car by a mechanic to have it briefly checked out before buying it may be a wise move just to make sure that you do n't end up with a large car repair expense in a few months when the transmission gives up for example

i do n't understand the op 's desire i 'd love to have a few hundred dollars coming in each month until i really get the hang of things   when growing your wealth so that it will be large enough in retirement to throw off enough profits to live on you must not touch the profits generated along the way   you must reinvest them to earn even more profits   the profits you earn need not show up as cash   most investments also grow in re sale value this growth is called capital gains and is just as more important than cash flows like interest income or dividends     when evaluating investing choices you think of your returns as a percent of your total savings at any time   so expecting $ 100/month equals $ would require a $ 12,000 investment to earn 10%/yr from the sounds of it the op 's principal is not near that amount and an average 10 should not be expected by an investment with reasonable risk i would conclude that there is no free lunch   you need to continually save and add to your principal   you must invest to expect a reasonable return less than 10 and you must reinvest all profits whether cash or capital gains or else start a business which can not be compared to passive investing

the government pays interest on its debts just like anyone else but since it 's already the government and already taking advantage of credit your money loaned to it through the bonds it does n't need the extra benefit of taxing the interest it pays it 's better off just issuing bonds at a lower interest rate and letting you keep all the interest instead of a higher interest rate which will have some amount taxed and returned to it anyway the government wants a cut of private loan interest just like any other income which is why interest on private bonds loans is taxable   edit what about municipal bonds would n't the federal government benefit from taxing interest on municipal bonds    municipal bonds are issued to support public infrastructure amp services such as construction of water supply infrastructure since the goal is to improve facilities for the public benefit and government programs ostensibly aim to provide public benefits as well it allows the full proceeds of the bonds to go to the designated projects at the lowest possible interest rate and the public pays the interest through city rates taxing municipal bonds would result in a higher cost to the public for the same end result because of higher interest rates with the net interest going to the federal amp state governments via income tax on the interest

it appears that usury has always been a bit of a sticking point for the catholic church ever since the first council of it was officially the position of the church that charging usury was a sin it was n't until the rise of napoleon and his implementation of the code that moved usury into wider acceptance pope essentially said that usury was now in the realm of the state and not a concern of the church however the church itself was unable to invest in interest bearing securities until the code of canon law was updated in 1917 to allow the church to engage in interest bearing investments however there seems to be a renewed push within the holy see essentially the governing body for to push back against some tenets of capitalism so it 's not so much that the church has ever the use usury but just let it kind of slide into a grey area some religions like islam still forbid the use usury which leads to a special type of banking called islamic banking   source

the fed is trying to keep the money supply growing at a rate just slightly faster than the increase in the total production in the economy if this year we produced say 3 more goods and services than last year than they try to make the money supply grow by maybe 4 or 5 that way there should be a small rate of inflation they are trying to prevent high inflation rates on one hand or deflation on the other when the interest rate on t bills is low banks will borrow more money as the fed creates this money out of thin air when banks buy a t bill this adds money to the economy when the interest rate on t bills is high banks will borrow little or nothing as they 'll be repaying older t bills this will result in less growth in the money supply or even contraction so the feds change the rate when they see that economic growth is accelerating or or that the inflation rate is getting too high or too low

i 've found that the most effective way to get things done is to communicate directly in person or over the phone if the former is not possible then to follow up with an immediate email per our conversation etc   this allows the natural conversations to occur connecting you with you team members and direct reports while also holding everyone accountable in writing   accountability is n't about being able to say i told you so nor is it about waiting for an opportunity to make someone look bad accountability is about ensuring that no one falls behind or lets the team down in the first place through preventative measures   this comes back full circle to my point on communication the most effective method of management in my experience is simply leading by example when you lead by example you never need to threaten employees with discipline or accountability you simply do what you do and if people respect you for the way you work they will look up to you as a role model your team members will do everything they can to support the team 's objectives on their own accord   source i learned this through a former manager he motivated me to be more committed to the team 's objectives and now i get to pay that forward to my direct reports   edit typos on mobile

it depends on the seller   if the seller wants they can collect the information from you and send it to the payment gateway   in that case they of course have everything that you provide at some point   they are not supposed to keep the security code and there are rules about keeping the credit card number safe    the first four digits of the credit card number often indicate the bank although smaller banks may share   but for example a capital one card would indicate the bank    other sellers work through a payment gateway that collects the information   even there the seller may collect most of the information first and send it to the gateway   in particular the seller may collect name email phone and address information   and in general the gateway will reveal that kind of information   they will not give the seller credit card info other than the name on the card expiration date and possible last four digits   they may report if the address matches the card 's billing address addresses may mean fraud    buying through someone like paypal can provide the least information   for a digital good paypal can only expose the buyer 's name which may be a business name and email associated with the payment account   however paypal still has the other information and may expose it under legal action e.g. if the credit card transaction is reversed or the good sold is illegal   and even paypal will expose the shipping address for physical goods that require shipping

growth in a 401k taxes which means more of the gains get reinvested effectively it 's a boosted return rate like any investment a 401k can lose value during the period before retirement lower stock and bond prices actually help you buy more shares than you could if prices were high so the real question is what the funds are doing at the time you start pulling money back out that concern is why investors generally not just 401k investors should change their investment mix over time to balance risk against time to recover and possible reward   and if your employer matches 401k contributions to any degree that too improves your effective gains and buffers you against some of risk hence the general advice that if you do n't fund your 401k at least enough to max out the company match you 're leaving free money on the table

in theory you can buy shares directly from someone else who owns them in practise if the stock is listed on an exchange they are unlikely to own them directly they are likely to own them through an intermediary you will have to pay fees to that intermediary to transfer the shares to your name there are thousands of small companies owned by the guy who started it and a few other investors you can buy stock in that kind of company directly from the existing owners as long as they are willing to sell you some it 's a super high risk investment strategy though this is the kind of deal that happens on dragons den

the location that you are purchasing from is not really relevant   if you use either a visa or mastercard to make a payment in a foreign currency of any kind then your payment will automatically use visa mastercard 's fx platform whilst fees can vary between issuers the fee is generally fixed at 2.5 there are occasionally credit card issuers who have special deals to remove these fees but they tend to come and go and availability will depend on your country of residence the only real way to avoid the fee is to get access to a debit or credit card denominated in the currency you wish to use for your purchase   this is often achievable for usd or eur but much harder for smaller currencies   you would have to try contacting a bank in that country to see if they would open an account for you or attempting to purchase a pre paid credit card online

once wealth accumulates in the hands of a few they 're less likely to spend it as opposed to when there 's smaller amounts of wealth in the hands of many that 's one of the primary arguments for more economic equality   you then also have the case of that wealth being used to generate more wealth without really adding anything of value employing hedge fund managers bankers lawyers and accountants to manage large amounts of that wealth in order to use it to generate more wealth sometimes in ways that does n't benefit society at all and sometimes even to its detriment toxic assets tax evasion etc    overall this has the effect of weakening the economy at the very least inhibiting its growth and i do n't possibly see how you could argue that a weaker economy benefits anyone especially those in the best position to take advantage of the goods produced by a stronger economy the wealthy a stronger economy means more and better goods on the market that the rich can then benefit from i do n't think the luxury goods market would go anywhere either and may even allow it to grow because of the people who are just under the wealthiest would get richer with more equality remember it 's only the top 10 who benefit from the current massive inequality

all transactions within an ira are irrelevant as far as the taxation of the   distributions from the ira are concerned you can only take cash from an ira and a cash distribution from a traditional ira is taxable as ordinary income same as interest from a bank say without the advantage of any of the special tax rates for long term capital gains or qualified dividends even if that cash was generated within the ira from sales of stock etc in short just as with what is alleged to occur with respect to las vegas what happens within the ira stays within the ira note some ira custodians are willing to make a distribution of stock or mutual fund shares to you so that ownership of the 100 shares of ge say that you hold within your ira is transferred to you in your personal non ira brokerage account but as far as the irs is concerned your ira custodian sold the stock as the closing price on the day of the distribution gave you the cash and you promptly bought the 100 shares at the closing price in your personal brokerage account with the cash that you received from the ira it is just that your custodian saved the transaction fees involved in selling 100 shares of ge stock inside the ira and you saved the transaction fee for buying 100 shares of ge stock in your personal brokerage account your basis in the 100 shares of ge stock is the cash that you received as a distribution from the ira so that when you sell the shares at some future time your capital gains or losses will be with respect to this basis the capital gains that occurred within the ira when the shares were sold by your ira custodian remain within the ira and you do n't get to pay taxes on that at capital gains rates that being said i would like to add to what told you in his answer your mother passed away in 2011 and you are now 60 years old so 54 or 55 in 2011 it is likely that your mother was over 70.5 years old when she passed away and so she likely had started taking required minimum distributions from her ira before her death so you should have been taking rmds from the inherited ira starting with year 2012 the rmd for 2011 if not taken already by your mother before    she passed away should have been taken by her estate and distributed to her heirs in accordance with her will or if she died in accordance with state law and/or probate court there would    not have been any 10 penalty tax due on the rmds taken by you on the grounds that you were not 59.5 years old as yet that rule applies to owners your mom in this case and not to beneficiaries you in this case so have you taken the rmds for 2012 2016 or were you waiting to turn 59.5 before taking distributions in the mistaken belief that you would have to pay a 10 penalty for early   the penalty for not taking a rmd is 50 of the amount not distributed yes 50 if you did n't take rmds from the inherited ira for years 2012 2016 i recommend that you consult a cpa with expertise in tax law ask the cpa if he she is an enrolled agent with the irs enrolled agents have to pass an exam administered by the irs to show that they really understand tax law and are not just blowing smoke and can represent you in front of the irs in cases of audit etc

as others have pointed out it 's all about a fixed small cost versus the potential of a large cost if you have insurance you know you will pay a fixed amount per month there is a 100 probability that you will have to pay this premium if you do n't have insurance there is a large chance that you will have no cost in any given month and a small chance that you will have a large cost like my home owners insurance costs me about $ 50 per month if i did n't have insurance and my house burned down i would be out something like $ 100,000 what 's the chance that my house will burn down this month very small but i 'd rather pay $ 50 and not have to worry about it on the other hand i just bought a filing cabinet for $ 160 and the store offered me an extended warranty for something like $ 20 a year what 's the probability that some accident will happen that damages my filing cabinet pretty small even if it did i think i could handle shelling out $ 160 i can imagine my stomach in knots and lying awake at nights worrying about the possibility of losing $ 100,000 or finding myself homeless i ca n't imagine lying awake at nights worrying about losing $ 160 or being force to stuff my files under the bed i 'll take my chances when i was young and had even less money than i have now i bought cars that cost me a thousand dollars or even poor as i was i knew that if the car was totaled i could dig up the cash to buy another it was n't worth paying the insurance premium these days i 'm driving a car that cost me $ 6,000 i have collision and comprehensive insurance but i think it 's debatable i bought the car with cash to begin with and if i had to i could scrape up the cash to replace it especially considering that my last payment for my daughter 's college tuition is due next month and then that expense is gone

to calculate any daily return all one need do is divide the final value by the initial value subtract 1 and multiply by 100 this can be applied to either the futures alone the investments used as margin collateral alone or all together margin collateral as a factor of a derivative 's return collateral can take many forms many suggest that cost and revenue for a derivative trade should also take into account margin requirements   this can become problematic if a futures position moved against the trader yet the margin was secured with equities at the maximum and the equities moved with the trader the futures trade could be interpreted as less of a loss because the collateral which is probably totally with the futures position increased in value then again if a futures position moved with the trader yet the margin collateral moved against the trader then taken together the futures trade would look less profitable furthermore most likely the result of a futures position and its collateral would never produce the same result so would become ever more difficult for ease of analysis a position 's cost and revenue should be from another unless if those positions are meant to hedge each other   margin is not a cost but it is a liability so margin will affect the balance sheet of a futures trade but not its income statement again unless if the collateral is also used to hedge such futures position

oil adds to the costs because it takes man hours to pump and refine that oil materials add to the costs because someone has to put the hours to mine them bad weather adds to the costs because someones job is now more difficult and it takes more hours it forms a kind of net and at the end of the day everything is just man hours + some percentage as profit taxes   land is probably the only exception here as it 's quite purely priced by supply and demand and there are no labor involved in producing it actually it 's kind of ridiculous that it 's possible to own land against just renting it from government   buy land they 're not making it anymore mark

because you 've sold something you 've received cash or at least an entry on your brokerage statement to say you 've got cash so you should record that as a credit in your brokerage account in gnucash the other side of the entry should go into another account that you create called something like open positions and is usually marked as a liability account type if you need to mark it as such if you want to keep an accurate daily tally of your net worth you can add a new entry to your open positions account and offset that against income which will be either negative or positive depending on how the position has moved for against you you can also do this at a lower frequency or not at all and just put an entry in when your position closes out because you bought it back or it expired or it was exercised my preferred method is to have a single entry in the open positions account with an arbitrary date near when i expect it to be closed and each time i edit that value daily or weekly so i only have the initial entry and the current adjust to look at which reduces the number of entries and confusion if there are too many

a $ 1 note and four quarters are both real money but how and when they become real money is different the important thing is that the fed 's stockpile of cash that it gets from the bureau of engraving and printing is n't real money i.e. yet that cash is only used for fulfilling withdrawals from reserve accounts you ca n't use it to buy a car or a house or to pay janet yellen 's salary no one not even janet can use even a single dollar to buy a diet coke in other words it 's not really an asset or a liability or anything but a stack of paper in the fed 's vaults that looks astonishingly like money but is n't the upside to this is that when the makes a delivery of fresh bills to the fed or when the fed destroys old bills that are n't usable anymore the fed 's balance sheet does n't change that 's good those are practical considerations not financial ones the downside is that there 's nothing on the asset side of the sheet to explain how the fed 's liability to a bank is reduced when the bank makes a cash withdrawal from its reserve account so the fed balances it 's balance sheet by recording an increase in a different liability the cash in circulation kinda like transferring the balance on a credit card you 're paying down one liability by increasing another one it looks a bit silly but less silly than recording the destruction of old bills as an expense of the face value of the bills coins on the other hand become money as soon as the treasury gets them from the mint if they wanted to they could pay their employees salaries by ordering coins from the mint for cheap giving them to their employees at face value and reaping fat profits as a result in fact that 's pretty much exactly what they do when someone wants quarters the treasury mints them at less than face value and then sells them at face value in practice the fed does all of this buying and then distributes the coins according to demand the important thing is that this bunch of coins is not like the fed 's stockpile of bills it 's already real money and therefore shows up as an asset not much if the fed bought coins at the cheaper price from the mint instead them like they stockpile bills then distributed them as usual the extra profit just goes to the treasury anyway like all the fed 's profit does however as things are the fed 's purchases of coins are recorded on the fed 's balance sheet at face value which is kinda silly

i assume you 're talking about a sell order not a buy order when you place a limit sell order your order is guaranteed to be placed at that price or higher   if the market is currently trading much higher than the price of your sell order then your mistakenly low limit order will be essentially a market order and will be filled at   the current bid price so the only way this is a problem is if you want to place a limit sell that is much higher than the current market but mistakenly place a limit lower than the current market

if you are looking to go long buy you would use bid prices as this is what you will be matched against for your order to be executed and a trade to go through if you are looking to go short sell you would use the ask prices as this is what you will be matched against for your order to be executed and a trade go through in your analysis you could use either this convention or the midpoint of the two prices as fx is very liquid the bid and ask prices would be quite close to each other so the easiest way to do your analysis is to use the convention i listed above

when interest rates rise the price of bonds fall because bonds have a fixed coupon rate and since the interest rate has risen the bond 's rate is now lower than what you can get on the market so it 's price falls because it 's now less valuable bonds diversify your portfolio as they are considered safer than stocks and less volatile however they also provide less potential for gains although diversification is a good idea for the individual investor it is far too complicated and incurs too much transaction costs not to mention that rebalancing would have to be done on a regular basis in your case where you have mutual funds already it is probably a good idea to keep investing in mutual funds with a theme which you understand the industry 's role in the economy today rather than investing in some special bonds which you can not relate to the benefit of having a mutual fund is to have a professional manage your money and that includes diversification as well so that you do n't have to do that

if the price has gone up from what it was when the person bought he may sell to collect his profit and spend the money if someone intends to keep his money in the market the trick is that you do n't know when the price of a given stock will peak if you could tell the future sure you 'd buy when the stock was at its lowest point just before it started up and then sell at the highest point just before it started down but no one knows for sure what those points are if a stockholder really knows that demand is increasing and the price will go up sure it would be foolish to sell but you can never know that or if you have some way that you do know that please call me and share your knowledge

according to what little information is available currently this fund is most akin to an actively managed exchange traded fund rather than an investment trust an investment trust is an actively managed closed end fund that is tradeable on the stock market   closed end means that there are a fixed number of shares available for trading so if you wish to buy or sell shares in a closed end fund you need to find someone willing to sell or buy shares   actively managed means that the assets are selected by the fund managers in the belief that they will perform well   this is in contrast to a passively managed fund which simply tracks an underlying index    the closed end nature of investment trusts means that the share price is not well correlated to the value of the underlying assets   indeed almost all uk investment trusts trade at a significant discount to their net asset value   this reflects their historic poor performance and relatively weak liquidity   of course there are some exceptions to this examples of open end funds are unit trust us = mutual funds and etfs exchange traded funds   they are open end funds in the sense that the number of shares units available will change according to demand   most importantly the price of a share unit will be strongly correlated to the net asset value of the underlying portfolio   in general for an open end fund if the net asset value of the fund is x and there are y shares units outstanding then the price of a share unit will be x y.   historic data shows that passively managed funds index trackers always outperform actively managed funds in the long term   one of the big issues with actively managed funds is they have relatively high management fees   the peoples trust will be charging about 1 with a promise that this should come down over time   compare this to a fee of 0.05 on a large major market index tracking etf   further the 1 headline fee being touted by peoples trust is a somewhat misleading since they are paying their employees bonuses with shares in the fund   this will cause dilution of the net asset value per share and can be read as addition management fees by proxy   since competent fund managers will demand high incomes bonus shares could easily double the management fees depending on the size of the fund in summary history has shown that the promises of active fund managers rarely if ever come to fruition personally i would not consider this to be an attractive investment and would look more towards a passively managed major market index etf with low management fees

i believe the answer to your question boils down to a discussion of tax strategies and personal situation both now and in the future   as a result it 's pretty hard to give a concrete example to the question as asked right now for example if your tax rate now is likely to be higher than your tax rate at retirement it is for most people than putting the higher growth etf in a retirement fund makes some sense   but even then there are other considerations however if the opposite is true which could happen if your income is growing so fast that your retirement income looks like it will be higher than your current income than you might want the flexibility of holding all your etfs in your non tax advantaged brokerage account so that if you do incur capital gains they are paid at prevailing presumably lower tax rates    i assume you meant a brokerage account rather than a savings account since you usually ca n't hold etfs in a savings account i also want to mention that a holding in a corp account is n't necessarily taxed twice   it depends on the corporation type and the type of distribution   for example s corps pay no federal income tax themselves instead the owners pay taxes when money is distributed to them as personal income   which means you could trickle out the earnings from an holdings there such that it keeps you under any given federal tax bracket assuming it 's your only personal income    this might come in handy when retired for example    also distribution of the holdings as dividends would incur cap gains tax rates rather than personal income tax rates one thing i would definitely say any holdings in a roth account ira 401k will have no future taxes on earnings or distributions unless the gov't changes its mind   thus putting your highest total return etf there would always be the right move

i d like to start by saying you re still doing this yourself and i do nt actually have all the info required anyway do nt send it but   descriptive statistical measures provide a thorough discussion of the meaning and interpretation of the four descriptive measures required in your analysis 1 arithmetic mean 2 variance 3 standard deviation and 4 coefficient of for example how are these measures related to each other in order to develop this discussion you may want to chapters 2 and 3 of your textbook this topic is an important part of your report can be easily interpreted i m guessing the mean is simply just the observed and then projected stock price for future models the standard deviation determines the interval in which the stock price fluctuates so you have like a curve and then on this curve theirs a bunch of normal distributions modeling the variance of the price plotted against the month   also the coefficient of variation is just so just read up on that and relate it to the meaning of it to the numbers you have   actually my stats are pretty rusty so make sure you really check into these things   but otherwise the formulas for part 4 is simple too you can compare means of a certain month using certain equations but there are different ones for certain situations   you can test for significance by comparing the differences of the means and if its outside of your alpha level then it probably means your company is significantly different from the sp index take mu of sp mu of   you can also find more info on interpreting the two different coefficients your given if you look up comparing means of linear regression models or something

when volatility is higher the option is more likely to end up in the money moreover when it ends up in the money it is likely to be over the strike price by a greater amount consider a call option with high volatility moves in the stock price are big both up moves and down moves if the stock moves up by a lot the call option holder will benefit greatly on the other hand when the stock moves down below a certain point the option holder does not care how big a down move the stock has his downside is limited hence the value of the option is increased by high volatility i know everyone who searches this is looking for this answer bump so people are able to get this concept instead of looking all over the web for it

to answer length validity and security implications of draft checks issued and negotiated within the united states i am heavily addressing the common erroneous assumptions of where the funds sit while they 're in a draft check and how to get them out tl;dr the existing answers are incomplete and in some ways dangerously misleading jerry can still be potentially defrauded by tom and even if the check is legitimately drawn and negotiable jerry may still experience delayed access to the funds the funds sit in an account held by the issuing bank as long as the bank has sufficient funds the check does however there are significantly more factors that go into whether a check will be returned unpaid bounce if i hand you $ 5000 in cash will you give me $ 5000 in cash probably and you 'd probably be pretty safe how about i give you a $ 5000 draft check will you give me $ 5000 in cash without doing anything except looking at it to verify the check i hope not cash america sure would n't but people sell expensive goods with the same as cash attitude remember the only non cash form of payment which can not somehow be held reversed or returned unpaid in the u.s. without consent of the receiving party is a payment order a.k.a wire transfer the draft check is as good as cash in the sense that the money for a draft check is withdrawn from your account before the check is negotiated deposited this does not mean that a draft check will not bounce so jerry is not as secure in handing the goods to tom as if tom had handed him cash as it is still a check jerry 's bank will not receive the funds for tom 's draft check for an average 3 to 5 business days same as a personal check jerry will probably have access to the first $ 5000 within two business days provided that he deposits the draft check in person at his bank 's branch or in a bank owned atm in the united states regulation cc governs funds availability regarding official draft or tellers checks if the customer desires next day availability of funds from these checks your bank may require use of a special deposit slip   mobile deposit availability in the u.s. is not regulated in this way and will likely be subject to a longer hold on more if not all of the check draft checks do n't as a habit bounce in the sense of returned for insufficient funds this is because they are prepaid and drawn upon a financial institution 's account banks are insolvent far less frequently than other businesses or individuals draft checks tellers checks official checks bank checks etc can however be returned unpaid if one of the following is true as an aside an institution is not obligated to honor a stale dated check but may do so at its discretion if you have a personal check outstanding for over 6 months it may still clear and potentially overdraw your account in this case contact your bank asap to process a reversal the depositing bank mis scans the check and the issuing bank refuses the resulting data i have seen systems mis read which data field is which or its contents also there is the possibility the image if the check will be to the issuing bank the draft check has been cancelled stop paid this can happen if   a the check was fraudulently bought from the issuing bank using tom 's account   b tom has completed an agreement that the check was lost or otherwise not used for its intended purpose without fraud having occurred against tom c the draft check is paid to the state as unclaimed property this case is a subset of case 1 but will lead to a different return reason stamped on the image replacement document of the check the draft check was never any good in the first place because of the perception that draft checks are as good as cash they 're not but are a lot better than personal checks forgery and attempted fraud is shockingly common these are n't actually underwritten by a real bank even if they appear to be the only money in them is what the fraudster can get out of you jerry did not properly endorse the check before presenting it for deposit or otherwise negotiating it in my time in banking i most commonly saw cases 3 and 4 unlike most counterfeit cash case 3 will fool jerry and jerry 's teller tom gets an immediate payout a car a wire transfer a payday loan etc and jerry 's bank does n't know the check is n't valid until they call the alleged issuing bank to verify its or in the case of smaller checks into lower risk accounts it is simply returned unpaid as fraudulently drawn to conclude call the alleged issuing bank 's verification line before handing over the goods always properly endorse your deposits and address what happens if one does not receive or collect on prompt payment in your contracts

the plumber will apply for and receive a refund of the amount of vat he paid on the purchase amount   that 's the cornerstone of how vat works as opposed to a sales tax   so for example rounded approximate amounts for simplicity now at each point the amount between original cost vat and new vat is refunded   so by the end a total of £ 3 vat is paid on the pipe not £ 6.2 and at each point the business adding value at that stage pays that much   the material company adds £ 1 value the producer adds £ 4 value the supplier adds £ 5 value the plumber adds £ 5 value    each pays some amount of vat on that amount typically 20 unless it 's zero reduced rated   so the pipe supplier pays £ 1 but gets a £ 0.2 refund so truly pays £ 0.8   the plumber pays £ 3 from your payment but gets a £ 2 refund    so at each level somebody paid a bit and then that bit is then refunded to the next person up the ladder with the final person in the chain paying the full amount   the £ 0.2 is refunded to the producer the £ 1 is refunded to the supplier the £ 2 is refunded to the plumber

yes there are some real dangers in having your money locked into an investment those dangers are well worth thinking about and planning for where you are going off the rails is acting like those are the only dangers to your money and perhaps having an exaggerated idea of the size of the dangers it is an excellent idea to keep an emergency fund with a few months living expenses in a readily accessible savings or checking account however a standard retail savings account is always going to pay less in interest then you are loosing through inflation we 're living in a low inflation period but it 's still continuously eating away at the value of your savings it makes sense to accept the danger of inflation for your emergency fund but probably not for your retirement savings to reduce the hazards of inflation you need to find an investment that has some chance of paying more than the inflation rate this is inevitably going to mean locking up your money for some period of time or accepting some other type of risk there is no guaranteed safe path in the world you can only do your best to understand the risks you are running as an example you could put your savings in a cd rather than a vanilla savings account a cd these days wo n't pay much in interest but it will be more than a savings account however you have to commit to a term for the cd if you take your money out early you will have to pay a penalty how much of a penalty in the worse case it could be in the neighborhood of 4 of the amount you withdraw so yeah if you deposit $ 10,000 in a 5-year cd and end up needing it all back the very next day you could end up paying the bank $ 400   if you withdraw money from a 401k before you are 59 1/2 you will pay a 10 penalty and you will have to have income tax withheld on the amount you withdraw on the other hand if your employer matches 100 of your 401k contributions you could be throwing away 50 of your possible retirement savings because of your fear of the possibility of a 10 loss in addition 401k plans do have some exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty there are provisions for medical emergencies and home purchases for example however the qualifications are not entirely straight forward and you should read up on them before enrolling the real answer to your fears is planning figure out your living expenses figure out how much you want in an emergency fund figure out when you will be wanting to buy a house have a child or go back to school set aside the savings you 'll need for all those and then for the remainder of your money you can consider long term investments with some confidence that you probably wo n't need to face the early withdrawal penalties

in general economic theory there are always two markets created based on a need for a good a spot market where people who need something now can go outbid other people who need the same thing and a futures market where people who know they will need something later can agree to buy it for a pre approved price even if the good in question does n't exist yet like a grain crop options exist as a natural extension of the futures market in a traditional future you 're obligated by buying the contract to execute it for good or ill if it turns out that you could have gotten a lower price when buying or a higher price when selling that 's tough you gave up the ability to say no in return for knowing a month or three months or even a year in advance the price you 'll get to buy or sell this good that you know you need futures thus give both sides the ability to plan based on a known price but that 's their only risk reduction mechanism enter the option you 're the coors brewing company and you want to buy 50 tons of barley grain for delivery in december in order to brew up for the super bowl and other sports parties a co op up to close the deal but since you 're coors you compete on price with budweiser and miller and if you end up paying more than the grain 's really worth perhaps because of a mild wet fall and a bumper crop that the predicts then you 're going to have a real bad time of it in january you ask for the right to say no when the contract falls due if the price you negotiate now is too high based on the spot price the co op now has a choice for such a large shipment if coors decided to leave them holding the bag on the contract and instead bought it from them anyway on a depressed spot market they could lose big if they were counting on getting the contract price and bought equipment or facilities on credit against it to mitigate those losses the co op asks for an option price basically this is insurance on the contract and the co op will in return for this fee exactly how and when it 's paid is also negotiable agree to eat any future realized losses if coors were to back out of the contract   like any insurance premium the option price is nominally based on an simple formula the probability of coors exercising their option times the losses the co op would incur if that happened long term if these two figures are accurate the co op will break even by offering this price and coors either taking the contract or exercising the option however coming up with accurate predictions of these two figures such that the co op or anyone offering such a position would indeed break even at least is the stuff that keeps actuaries in business and awake at night

it is barely possible that this is citi 's fault but it sounds more like it is on the costco end    the way that this is supposed to work is that they your card for the necessary amount   that reserves the payment removing the money from your credit line   on delivery they are supposed to capture the preauthorization   that causes the money to transfer to them   until that point they 've reserved your payment but not actually received it   if you cancel then they do n't have to pay processing fees    the capture should allow for a larger sale so as to provide for tips and unanticipated taxes and fees    in this case instead of capturing the preauthorization they seem to have simply generated a new transaction   citi could be doing something wrong and processing the capture incorrectly   or costco could be doing a purchase when they should be doing a capture   from outside we ca n't really say    the thirty days would seem to be how long costco can schedule in advance   so the preauthorization can last that long for them    costco should also have the ability to cancel a preauthorization   however they may not know how to trigger that   with smaller merchants they usually have an interface where they can view and capture or cancel them   costco may have those messages sent automatically from their system    note that a common use for this pattern is with things like gasoline or delivery purchases   if this has been citi costco both times i 'd try ordering a pizza or some other delivery food and see if they do it correctly   if it was citi both times and a different merchant the other time then it 's probably a citi problem rather than a merchant problem

ianal but as you note when you open a new account they give you temporary checks that are usually blank in the upper left i 've used such checks and the bank has honored them therefore i conclude that there must not be any legal requirement for anything to appear there nor does the bank require it businesses are often reluctant to accept such temporary checks for the obvious reason that anyone could go to the bank open an account with $ 10 write checks for thousands of dollars and disappear at least if they 've waited long enough to get the permanent checks in there 's some reason to believe that they plan to stick around   in any case it 's not clear what you are trying to accomplish you want to hand write either your business name or your personal name depending on whether the check is for personal or business purposes i do n't see what that gains you could always use a personal check for business purposes if you 're afraid someone will say hey that does n't look very professional what kind of fly by night company is this that uses personal checks surely a hand written company name would look even less professional why not just open a business account and have your personal checks printed with your personal name and your business checks with your business name i do n't know where you live but i have a business account on which i pay zero fees the only cost is getting checks printed there 's the small hassle of having to make one trip to the bank to open the account well the biggest hassle i have is that the bank wo n't let me transfer money between my personal and business accounts over the internet so i have to either go to the bank to move money back and forth or i have to write a check from one account to the other and deposit through an atm

we measure the value of gold by comparing it to other things sorry but there is no better answer than that there is no gold standard pun intended by which objects can be measured in value because value is a subjective term it would be comparable to asking how funny is an object different objects are funny to different people even if we gathered all the really funny object together there is no guaranty those objects would be funny next year unless we all agreed they were as part of a social contract which is basically what we do with currency while gold does not need a social contract in order for it to retain its value this is only because it is has been 1 very useful and 2 rare if either of these two factors change the value of gold will change which it has on several occasions rant about intrinsic value of gold below gold has no intrinsic value none whatsoever   intrinsic value makes just as much sense as a cat dog animal dog and cat are referring to two mutually exclusive animals therefore a cat dog is a nonsensical term intrinsic value the actual value of a company or an asset based on an underlying perception of its true value intrinsic value is perceived which means it is worth whatever you or a group of people think it is intrinsic value has nothing i repeat absolutely nothing to do with reality   the most obvious example of this is the purchase of a copy right you are assigning an intrinsic value to a copy right by purchasing it however when you purchase a copy right you are not buying ink on a page you are purchasing an idea someone 's that for all intensive purposes does n't even exist in reality by definition things that do not exist do not have intrinsic properties because things that do n't exist do n't have any natural properties at all intrinsic according to dictionary   belonging to the essential nature or constitution of a thing the intrinsic of a star an intrinsic property of an object is something we know that exists because it is a natural property of that object emit light we know this because we can measure the light coming from it it is not subjective intrinsic value by definition is the opposite of intrinsic

i 'm pretty sure it 's easy to tell in hindsight if they were leaving   just look at the companies who started outsourcing   not just to mexico but the world over     it was roughly a 30 tariff that was a barrier   if i made 100 k a year off of my manufacturing business that is n't so bad   but then i notice that the average mexican in manufacturing today makes slightly over $ 2 an hour on average   i can pay one american $ 8 an hour or i can pay 4 mexicans $ 8 an hour combined   assuming i have the capital tools i can go south quadruple my production cut my labor cost and still come out ahead with this tariff   if 1 person makes 10 widgets sold for $ 10 each an hour i can settle for either 10 widgets with one american for $ 8 or i can have 40 widgets with 4 mexicans for $ 8   by my math 1 hour of american widgets makes me $ 100 minus 8 for the american wage   1 hour of mexican widgets makes me $ 280 minus 2.9 for mexicans wage after tariffs     a 30 tariff is nothing   anyone that thinks that was standing in the way of anyone leaving is foolish   it is true that it may make people second guess up until the point they look at how much more profit they will return   and of course it makes it easier for them when there is no tariff but it is also true you are ultimately better off as a consumer when there are no tariffs

value slip below vs equal a bank savings account ’s safety there is no conflict   the first author states that money market funds may lose value precisely due to duration risk   the second author states that money market funds is as safe as a bank account   safety in the sense of a bond loan credit mostly about default risk for example people can say that a 30-year u.s. treasury bond is safe because the united states can not default as said in the constitution amendments and the s&p moody 's credit rating is the top special safety is about whether it can default ex experience a -100 return   safety does not directly imply riskiness in the example of t bond it is ultra safe but it is also ultra risky the volatility of 30-year t bond could be higher than s&p 500   back to money market funds   a money market fund could hold deposits with a dozen of banks or hold short term investment grade debt those instruments are safe as in there is minimal risk of default but they do carry duration risk because the average duration of the instrument the fund holds is not 0   a money market fund must maintain a weighted average maturity of 60 days or less and not invest more than 5 in any one issuer except for government securities and repurchase agreements   if you have $ 10,000,000 a money market fund is definitely safer than a savings account   1 savings account at one institution with amount exceeding fdic terms is less safe than a money market fund which holds instruments issued by 20 different banks   duration risk your savings account does n't lose money as a result of interest rate change because the rate is set by the bank daily and accumulated daily though paid monthly   the pricing of short term bond is based on market expectation of the interest rates in the future the most likely cause of money market funds losing money is unexpected change in expectation of future interest rates   the drawdown max loss is usually limited in terms of percentage and time through examining historical returns   the rule of thumb is that if your hold a fund for 6 months and that fund has a weighted average time to maturity of 6 months you might lose money during the 6 months but you are unlikely to lose money at the end of 6 months this is not a definitive fact   using mint and as an example or short duration funds the maximum loss in the past 3 years is 0.4 and they always recover to the previous peak within 3 months had 1.3 per year return somewhat similar to savings accounts in the us

the appropriate structure for an organization depends largely on the size of the firm smaller firms can employ some non traditional more easily i.e. flat design whereas the same structures are more difficult to use in mid size and large companies the most important pieces of any corporate structure are 1 clarity of roles 2 accountability and 3 ease of communication   firstly everyone in the organization must have clarity of their own role and how it fits into the bigger picture that means a structure that is easy to understand and a comprehension of how all the roles tie in to each other    secondly a good structure will enable and empower leadership to hold the team accountable and be held accountable in turn what is often misunderstood about accountability is that people often assume that it simply means punishing poor behavior when something breaks down in reality that 's holding people responsible not accountable accountability is something that is self driven and is a product of sound relationships and transparency as an example one of the most common breakdowns in accountability is found in passive non this is when you may reach out to a business partner for help or an update but they simply do not reply as in email text or    thirdly the structure should be such that it is easy for individuals to communicate across and up down the chain this does n't mean that if you send an email communication is easy rather who do i reach out to for this problem what are the best practices or agreed upon methodologies for a certain practice and how does the team know this some of this should be codified in the form of standard operating procedures which can be referenced at any time many companies use a playbook which is a high level reference guide on how to operate the business an example is found here a playbook can be anything from a pdf to an interactive website like the aforementioned link it should always have the most up to date information   most companies will change their structure over time as their environment both internal and external change and they need to adapt for example a small firm may not need an hr department but as it employs more and more people a need to have someone or an entire team focused on human capital management rises quickly an owner operator can handle only so much before it is time to scale up   the most important thing to consider is who you hire people are the largest expense to an organization and having the right people in the right roles is the best way to avoid unnecessary incremental costs resulting from inefficiency fraud or risky behavior always look for the personality traits that make a good employee relative to the role i.e. customer service finance integrity operations teamwork   one of the most obvious parts of a business as it scales up is specialization you want to find a balance though for example hr handles all human relations issues while legal handles all internal claims suits and patents there is an overlap that occurs here as internal claims often start as human relations issues which means you must have healthy communication and clear accountability for an appropriate hand off so legal takes a claim at the right point in time while this example may be a little obvious many times the edges are blurred and clarity of role can be difficult   i hope that helps reach out with any follow up questions

in such a situation is it really safe to give financial info to a person who does not encrypt it encryption only helps to an extent i.e. during transmission of data or during brute force makes it more difficult to get the real data however you concern is more of staff using this data which encryption will not help much as they would be able to and see the data in what ways could it be misused this depends on the type of data the financial data can be used to hack into your accounts if other bits of info are known i.e. most of the times on telephone requests say putting card on hold requesting balance on account etc only your address mother name last few transaction details are asked some critical requests need more id proofs so generally not of concern the other misuse would be selling this to marketing companies so that you can be bombarded with sales pitch for anything and everything the pan and other id documents are becoming more prone to mis use i.e. give a copy of pan to open fraudulent accounts etc a good practise would be to mark every copy of id proof you give with the purpose as to why its given and a date this would make the id proof stale to an extent if she is not going to encrypt it should i ask her to delete all my old data and then create a new profile for my communication with her the new profile not being my name but a fake name the regulations would not allow her to create fake accounts and may lead to issues and as such any recognised financial advisor would not allow this to be done quite a few countries have regulations for financial advisor 's that need to be to

oops i had been meaning to come back to this q. sooner just saw my reminder so here goes shortly before this question was asked i actually read a good blog post on the subject of disability insurance at evolution of wealth 7 ways your group disability will fail   i know the op does n't have group disability and hence the question but the reason i 'm highlighting it is even somebody with a group disability policy from their employer may want to consider it with an individual policy that has better coverage in my case the reason i opted for an individual policy was due to point 6 from the post ways that group disability coverage will fail you     etc    6 you can go work somewhere else    with disability insurance there is a    feature called own occupation   this    means that you are unable to perform    the duties of your specific occupation    even if you are able to work in an    other occupation   good group    disability coverage will cover your    own occupation for a period of 2 years    after that if you can work anywhere    yes even mcdonald ’s then you    receive no more benefits   notice i    said coverage a lot of    policies do n’t even have the    own occupation benefit i made sure my own individual ltd policy included coverage of own occupation until age 65   so do pay attention to the specific features and limitations of ltd policies when shopping for one

bonds are valued based on all of this using the concept of the time value of money simply stated money now is worth more than money later because of what you can do with money between now and later case in point let 's say the par value of a bond is $ 100 and will mature 10 years from this date these are common terms for most bonds though the u.s. treasury has a variety of bonds with varying par values and maturation periods with a 0 coupon rate nothing 's paid out prior to maturity if the company or government issuing the bonds needs one million dollars and the people buying the bonds are expecting a 5 rate of return on their investment then each bond would only sell for about $ 62 and the bond issuer would have to sell a par value of $ million in bonds to get its $ 1 m now these numbers are based on equations that calculate the future value of an investment made now and conversely the present value of a future return back to that time value of money concept money now that you 're paying to buy the bond is worth more than money later that you 'll get back at maturity so you will expect to be returned more than you invested to account for this time difference the percentage of rate of return is known as the yield or the discount rate depending on what you 're calculating what else you take into consideration when defining the rate like inflation and whom you talk to now that $ m in par value may be hard for the bond issuer to swallow the issuer is effectively paying interest on interest over the lifetime of the bond instead many issuers choose to issue coupon bonds which have a coupon rate determining the amount of a coupon payment this can be equated pretty closely with you making interest only payments on a credit card balance each period in which interest is compounded you pay the amount of interest that has accrued to avoid this compounding effect   from an accounting standpoint the coupon rate lowers the amount of real monies paid the same $ 1 m in bonds maturing in 10 years with a 5 expected rate of return but with a 5 coupon rate now only requires payments totalling $ 1.5 m and that half million in interest is paid $ 50k at a time annually or $ 25k semi annually but from a finance standpoint because the payments made in the first few years are worth more than the payments made closer to and at maturity the present value of all these coupon payments plus the maturity payout is higher than if the full payout happened at maturity and so the future value of the total investment is higher   coupon rates on bonds thus allow a bond issuer to plan a bond package in less complicated terms if you as a small business need $ 1 m for a project which you will repay in 10 years and during that time you are willing to tolerate a 5 interest rate on the outstanding money then that 's exactly how you issue the bonds $ 1 million worth to mature in 10 years and a 5 coupon rate now whether the market is willing to accept that rate is up to the market right now they 'd be over the moon with that rate and would be willing to buy the bonds for more than their face value because the present value would then match the yield they 're willing to accept as in any market system you as the seller will sell to the highest bidder to get the best price available if however they think you are a bad bet they 'll want an even higher rate of return and so the present value of all coupon and maturity payments will be less than the par value and so will the purchase price

here we go again why oh why would someone just open a bank account in your name with that much money for no good reason   unless there 's a very rich relative in your family tree this can not come to a good ending   besides if this was money being left to you by someone as part of an inheritance you 'd hear from attorneys from the estate notwithstanding everything posted about the details of what makes it suspicious ask yourself why a banker would contact you by email about an account with this much money in it   the bank would at the very least send you a registered certified letter on official    so what happens here is when you give them your banking information whoever it is that 's doing this will clean out your account and that 's for starters    they will ask for enough information to steal your identity too and if you have good credit that 'll be gone in a heartbeat the best scams meaning the most successful ones always appeal to peoples greed using large amounts of money that just miraculously belong to the victim if only they 'd give a little information to transfer the money    worse yet most of these scams will come up with some kind of fee tax or other expense that you have to pre pay in order to make the transfer happen so this just adds insult to injury when you find out the hard way you 've been scammed do not reply to the email you received or if you already have do n't send any more responses   if they think they may have you on the hook then they wo n't stop trying and it will become very messy very quickly this is not real money   it is n't yours it does n't really exist and all it will do is come to no good end if you go any further with it stay safe my friend

banks and energy are fundamental requirements for modern and there are plenty of both who contribute a great deal to society 's well being but i do know where you are coming from   the nature of the system we have is that the largest organisations tend to attract the most ruthless leaders who are prepared to screw over people and the environment in pursuit of their own selfish interest sociopaths enough to not get caught out are rewarded and those who social benefits over the growth of their organisation are out competed and make themselves less relevant in theory that should be kept in check by culture of social responsibility a strong free press and good government but those things have been eroding for a long time   there are mutual funds who seek to invest only in ethical companies ethics are subjective so there 's always the possibility that you 'd disagree with their choices or they make errors of judgement but it 's a better option than a fund that only considers returns you 've got a better chance that it is run by people who think ethics are important so they might not see their clients as to be fleeced like goldman sachs apparently does   alternatively you could invest in a fund that contributes to growing a developing nation 's economy or only invests in renewable energy or agriculture or whatever you consider important

yea i agree with this but i do think that amazon benefits a lot more from   economies of scale than uber both are platform models where you get more profits by having more users however its a lot more difficult to compete with amazon because of their warehouses inventory delivery speed etc etc than it is to compete with uber essentially has no inventory of its own there is a cap to how much uber can charge on either side before it is profitable to enter the market and compete with uber furthermore uber has completely lost countries such as china so there is a limit to their top line also uber still has to fight its never ending stream of litigation and that not just adds risk to the buisness but is a huge cost on uber when it comes down to it besides from the convenience of booking a ride from your phone uber saves money by going around the fact that the drivers in uber do not need taxi licences and that directly cuts into government revenue so far there has nt been too much resistance but it is hard to say if it will remain the case in the future

it is perfectly legitimate to adjust your 1099-b income by broker 's fees   publication 17 p 116 specifically instructs taxpayers to adjust their schedule d reporting by broker 's fees form 1099-b transactions    if you sold property such as stocks bonds or certain commodities through a broker you should receive form 1099-b or substitute statement from the broker use the form 1099-b or the substitute statement to complete form 8949 if you sold a covered security in 2013 your broker should send you a form 1099-b or substitute statement that shows your basis this will help you complete form 8949 generally a covered security is a security you acquired after 2010 report the gross proceeds shown in box 2a of form 1099-b as the sales price in column d of either part i or part ii of form 8949 whichever applies however if the broker advises you in box 2a of form 1099-b that gross proceeds sales price less commissions and option premiums were reported to the irs enter that net sales price in column d of either part i or part ii of form 8949 whichever applies include in column g any expense of sale such as broker 's fees commissions state and local transfer taxes and option premiums unless you reported the net sales price in column d if you include an expense of sale in column g enter e in column f you can rely on your own records and judgment if you feel comfortable doing so   brokers often make incomplete tax reporting   this may have been simpler from their perspective if the broker fees were variable or integrated or unknown for a number of clients party to a transaction   if a taxpayer has documentation of the expenses that justify an adjustment then it 's perfectly appropriate to include that in the calculations it is not necessary to report the discrepancy and it may increase scrutiny to include a written addendum   the schedule d form 8949 and form 1099-b will probably together adequately explain the source of the deduction

your employer pays the expected but estimated taxes for you so the chances are you do n't own more but that might be different if you have other sources of income that he does n't know about interest on savings or a side job or whatever also you could have deductions that reduce the taxes you owe which he again does n't know so you overpay if you do n't file you do n't get them back most tax software companies offer free usage of their tool for standard filings and you can use it to find out your tax situation and then buy the tool only when you want to file if you use one of those you can type in all your data and depending on the result decide to buy it and file right away note that if it turns out you owe taxes you must file and pay but of course you can do it manually instead of buying the tool if it turns out you get money back it is your decision to file you probably do n't care for a small amount but if you get 1000 $ back you might want to file again buying the software of doing it manually

your question boils down to saving for a house or saving for retirement why not do both if you invest in a roth 401k or roth ira you can withdraw any contributions that are at least 5 years old without penalty assuming you 're willing to put off purchasing a little longer than your original 2 3 years if you qualify as a first time home buyer i.e. you have n't owned a home in at least 2 years you can withdraw investment earnings as well if your distribution is earmarked towards the down payment and is no more than $ 10000 although you wo n't be penalized for using investment earnings for a down payment you will still have to pay taxes on them so this may be more appealing to someone that has enough contributions to avoid dipping into the investment earnings the only other downside is that contributions to a roth investment are not tax deductible like traditional ira and 401k contributions are instead they grow tax free and distributions are tax free when you reach retirement age

the first loan looks like it did not have its interest subsidized while you were in school so interest was accruing you did n't have to start making payments on it yet with the $ 73 payment you made the bank is allocating the funds in a pre determined split that is in their best interest not yours while you do need to pay them down and eventually off at the current rate it will take months with no more interest accruing to do so most likely with interest continuing to accrue you 're looking more in the neighborhood of 17 years rather than 14 these are back of the envelope numbers the payoff balance listed is the current principle plus interest that will accrue before the next processing date so it is usually a little higher than the actual balance because the interest is accruing daily albeit in very small percentages of the loan 's percentage

i usually recommend along these lines   if you are going to drive the same car for many years then buy your almost always better to buy and then drive a car for 10 years than to lease and replace it every 2 years if you want a new car every two years then lease you 're usually better off leasing if you 're going to replace the car before the auto loan is paid off or shortly there after also you can get more car for the same monthly money via leasing i honestly would advise you to either buy out your lease or buy a barely used car then drive it for as long as you can take the extra money you would spend and spend it on an awesome vacation or something   also if you 're only driving 15 miles a day then get a cheap but solid car again just my advice

what you did is called a strangle it 's rather unlikely that both will be exercised on the same day but yes it can happen   that is if the market is very volatile on a given day so that the stock hits 13 in the morning the put gets exercised and then hits 15 later in the day so the call gets exercised or vice versa more to the point the prices are close enough that one might be hit on one day and the other on a different day in either case if one side gets hit you need to reevaluate your position in the other but basically any open position you have can be hit at any time the only way to avoid this risk is not to have positions
