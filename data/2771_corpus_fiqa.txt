us bank deposits over $ 10 k only need to be reported to fincen financial crimes enforcement a bureau of the us department of treasury if the deposits are made in cash or other money instruments where the source can not be traced money orders traveler checks etc regular checks and wires do n't need to be reported because there is a clear bank trail of where the money came from if your family member is giving you money personally not from a business from a bank account which is outside of the us then you only need to report it if the amount is over $ 100k. note you would need to report that regardless of whether the money was deposited into your us bank account or paid directly to your credit cards on your behalf and there are stiff penalties if you play games to try to avoid reporting requirements neither deposit method would trigger any taxable income for the scenario you described

buy and hope is a common investment strategy it 's also one that will keep you poor instead of thinking about saving money to put against a credit card or line of credit using your own job and hard earned dollars why not use someone else 's money if you have enough of a down payment for a property of your own consider a duplex or where you live in one of the units since you will be living there you only need 5 down as opposed to 20 down if you do not live there this arrangement gives you a place to live while you have other people paying your mortgage and other debts if done properly you can find a place that is cash flow positive so you basically live rent free   this all assumes you have a down payment and a bank that will work with you your best bet is to discuss your situation with a mortgage broker they know all the rules and which banks have the best deal for you a mortgage broker works on your behalf and is paid by the lending institution not you there are various caveats with this strategy and they all revolve around knowing what to do and how to execute the plan i suggest googling robert kiyosaki and reading rich dad poor dad before taking this journey he offers a number of free and paid seminars that teach people how to purchase real estate and make it pay i have taken the free evening seminar and the $ 500 weekend seminar on how to purchase properties and make money with them note that i have no affiliation with kiyosaki and i do find his methods to work

long ago a friend of mine shared with me the rule which can be used for managing one 's spending   1/3rd save 1/3rd donate 1/3rd survival survival refers to primary needs like food clothing shelter medicine family and priority needs like travel the word comes from the language and is often used to denote money wealth or its meaning is to perceive understand objective observe to know etc as per ancient thought leaders wealth is to be used wisely and with great care and misuse of it means havoc not only in one 's own life but also on a community level rather than seeing money as a source of one 's own happiness it should be used as tool for the larger good this will give proper fulfillment in life and helps one shy away from spending on those little things which only give temporary happiness having a deeper perspective to our everyday actions and situations can help develop beneficial habits that easily helps control one 's impulsive and distractions

the simplest way to consolidate the funds your old 401(k plans is by doing what 's called a direct rollover whereby the funds go directly into the new plan and skips you completely from each of the old plans into either an ira that you establish with a provider of your choice or even into your current employer 's 401(k plan if that is available that way the funds are in one central account and available to invest plus it eliminates the mandatory 20 withholding if the rollover is indirect and is sent to you first before the deposit into the new plan it is important to bear in mind that you have 60 calendar days from the date of distribution to get the full amount into the new plan and a rollover is considered a tax reportable but not necessarily a taxable event provided you deposit the funds within the time frame allotted

good answers here i would like to add one more less obvious way to save look for houses that are for sale by owner fsbo owner 's who are selling without an agent do not have to pay a seller 's agent fee the closing cost savings here are actually on the seller 's side of the transaction however since you know the seller is saving money you may be able to negotiate a lower overall selling price with them or it may be priced lower than comps already because of this factor fsbo houses maybe trickier to find than those listed by an agent because they will not appear on the national mls used by realtors to find advertise houses that are n't being sold by their own clients you may need to physically walk the streets of the neighborhood you 're interested in moving to to look for fsbo yard signs fsbo sellers may also advertise in local newspapers

concerning the general problem of short selling and the need to borrow shares to complete the transaction selling short is a cash transaction   unlike a futures contract where a short seller is entering into a legal agreement to sell something in the future in the case of short selling a share the buyer of the share is taking immediate delivery and is therefore entitled to all of the benefits and rights that come with share ownership   in particular the buyer of the shares is entitled to any dividends payable and where applicable to vote on motions at   if the short seller has not borrowed the shares to sell then buyer of non existent shares will have none of the rights associated with ownership the cash market is based on the idea of matching buyers and sellers   it does not accommodate people making promises consider that to allow short sellers to sell shares they have not borrowed opens up the possibility of the aggregate market selling more shares than actually exist   this would lead to all sorts of problematic consequences such as heavily distorting the price of the underlying share   if everyone is selling shares they have not borrowed willy nilly then it will drive the price of the share down much to the disadvantage of existing share holders in this case short sellers who have sold shares they have not already borrowed would be paying out more in dividends to the buyers than the total dividends being paid out by the underlying company there are instruments that allow for short selling of shares on a futures basis   one example is a cfd = contract for difference   in the case of cfds sellers are obliged to pay dividends to buyers as well as other   costs related to financing edit regarding your comment note that borrowing shares is not a market transaction   your account does not show you buying a share and then selling it   it simply shows you selling a share short   the borrowing is the result of an agreement between yourself and the lender and this agreement is off market   you do not actually pay the lender for the shares but you do pay financing costs for the borrowing so long as you maintain your short position edit i realise that i have not actually read your question correctly   you are not actually talking about naked short selling   you are talking about selling shares you already own in a hope of maintaining both a long and short position gross   the problem with this approach is that you must deliver the shares to the buyer   otherwise ask yourself what shares is the buyer actually buying if you want the bought shares to remain in your account if you are not going to deliver your long position shares then you will need to borrow the shares you are selling short for the reasons i have outlined above

you will need to check the language of your sales contract most of the time it will be written that the pro rated property taxes will be part of closing costs in general if you 've already paid taxes then the buyer will pay you the pro rated portion of that from the closing date through the end of the year if you have n't then you would usually be charged the pro rated amount to be held in the buyer 's mortgage company escrow account with the remainder being collected from the buyer at a later date for your income tax purposes you can deduct that tiny amount of the paid property taxes from your income assuming itemized deductions doing some research on property tax for the state of georgia brings up this interesting note if you owned property on january 1 you are responsible for the ad tax for the entire year even if you sell the property on january 2   georgia law does not allow a refund for partial year residents this leads me to believe that your sales contract would have it written in that the buyer paid you almost the entire year 's property taxes in anticipation that you would be responsible for the property taxes as you owned the property on january 1st again you should consult with the settlement attorney and review your contract

fees liabilities yes the first problem is that liabilities are being improperly booked if the fee you charge is fixed upon deposit then the fee should credit revenue the fee charged to you should be booked by crediting cash and then debiting expenses and the remaining should be booked as a liability if the fee is fixed upon withdrawal then this will become more complex because of the fact that a change in the fee can occur before it can be applied   in this case the current fee should be credited as revenue and some allowance for fee increase should also be credited   the amount owed to the should be booked as a liability as before multiple currency bookings i will assume that this is for a cryptocurrency service of some sort considering the comments in your question and your presence on accounting can become very dangerous when mixing denominations   this is why all major accounting standards mandate books be maintained single currency in your case if the deposit is in usd for example and the liability is in btc then two books must be maintained one for each to account for your operation properly using single currency accounts the denominations must be exchanged internally and balanced across the two sets of books for a deposit of btc depository of usd the operation would be the same as described above but then the cash should be credited away and the liabilities debited away from the usd books with simultaneous cash debits and liability credits on the btc books considering the extreme volatility of cryptocurrency exchange rates accounts on the wrong set of books will quickly lead to insolvency or loss from improper accounting or both from revenue to income revenue can be construed as a liability since it could theoretically exist on the balance sheet i mention this because all books despite their name and quarter are really simply long t accounts like a blockchain   a blockchain could be into users individual income statements balance sheets as the reverse of this concept revenues are credited expenses are debited   the difference net income is debited away with a credit to owners equity

another way to look at this is that pure insider trading is an activity with the aim to use secret information to make personal profit or let others make personal profit at the expense of the company shareholders or investors in buybacks it is not company managers to get personal gain in this would be insider trading the end winners in this case are the shareholders so there is nothing inherently bad in buying back stock moreover it is a general practice to buy shares back as opposed to paying dividends when the company sees its shares being undervalued of course provided that it has the cash borrowing ability to implement this since it creates shareholders value thereby maximising shareholder wealth which is one of the primary tasks of the company managers

to summarize there are three basic ways 3 is the truly dangerous one if there is a lot of short interest in a stock but for some reason the stock goes up suddenly a lot of people will be scrambling to buy that stock to cover their short position which will drive the price up even further making the problem worse   pretty soon a bunch of smart rich guys will be poor guys who are suddenly very aware that they are n't as smart as they thought they were   eight years ago such a short squeeze as it 's called made the price of vw quadruple in two days   you could hear the from to there are ways to protect yourself of course   you can go short but also buy a call at a much higher price thereby limiting your exposure a strategy called a straddle but you also reduce your profit if you guessed right it comes down to as it always does do you want to eat well or to sleep well

i think this can be answered by answering the question who buys 10 year old cars   generally speaking those buyers are very price conscious   they are looking to save money on transportation rather than following the herd of people participating in the car payments merry go round    the cost of parts repairs and gasoline for those cars do not go down over time   remember that many of those cars require the use of premium gasoline   this drastically reduces demand for those vehicles thus lowers the price luckily i have a really good and reasonable mechanic near me and i can float repairs and the higher gas   i love driving my 1999 mercedes and it is one of the least expensive cars that i have owned while also being one of the most comfortable

i did sort of the same thing as you after a some time in consulting the biggest annoyance for me was how poorly i thought the most basic obvious bullshit through figure out how you 'll bill for travel when do you fly vs. drive what 's your mileage rate etc get your proposal template looking razor sharp and have a standardized invoice ready do n't say net 30 or 45 or whatever some clients wo n't understand what you 're talking about and there 's no way to explain it without sounding like a douche be prepared to negotiate heavily at first until you start to get a steady client base people are going to lowball you perhaps rightfully so consider the consequences of establishing yourself at a low rate or being considered unreasonable and inflexible    also since you 're working with a partner figure out how you 're going to register your business by considering your financial situations or preferably hiring an accountant i also strongly recommend working with your partner and an attorney to draft an operating agreement i 've seen so many horror stories with people who either did n't have one made their own shitty one or otherwise got screwed on technicalities

hey no worries at all like any business practice there are proper uses and abuses first and foremost companies should engage in allocation of capital that best serves their uses given prospects of returns in a broad sense this could very well include employee remuneration after that all excess funds should be distributed through buybacks or dividends    there is without a doubt going on i.e. buybacks preceding prudent capex or other investments to boost c suite pay in other cases it is actually used to hide declining performance altogether declining earnings compensated by decreasing outstanding shares this is simply poor management using these tools they would have most likely used others were these not made available to them e.g underpaying    it 's an investors job to allocate capital that rewards good management practice the problem is that this is an ideal made harder by obfuscation on the part of management lack of governance and even the rise of passive management among others    i 'm in private equity myself with a strong focus on prudence and longevity of companies so these are considerations that go without saying i 'm sometimes quite what public companies get away with but you ca n't blame tools for being used poorly or being available

i would open a taxable account with the same custodian that manages your roth ira e.g. vanguard fidelity etc then within the taxable account i would invest the extra money in low cost broad market index funds that are tax efficient unlike in your 401(k and roth ira you will now have tax implications if your funds produce dividends or realize a capital gain that is why tax efficient funds are important to minimize this as much as possible   the portfolio is a popular choice for taxable accounts because of simplicity and the tax efficiency of broad market index funds that are part of the three fund portfolio the portfolio normally consists of depending on your tax bracket you may want to consider municipal bonds in your taxable instead of taxable bonds if your tax bracket is 25 or higher   another option is to forgo bonds altogether in the taxable account and just hold bonds in retirement accounts while keeping tax efficient domestic and international funds in your taxable account then adjust the bond portion upward in your retirement accounts to account for the additional stocks in your taxable accounts this will maintain the asset allocation that you 've already chosen that is appropriate for your age and goals

to focus on your question pay it off then trade in the reason is because say you just have 14k laying around and buy a car for 14k you must pay 14k plus tax if you are in one of the states that allows the tax break then trading the 14k valued vehicle in for a 14k vehicle will your sales tax as per your question if you traded the car in at 7k you would then owe 7k plus tax you only have 7k so how would you pay for the tax and why would you want to pay off the car and you 'll have 14k of tax free off any car

yes but what qualifications are they asking for here 's one reasoning for why they keep podcast at work tech careers why bad no to good workers essentially it sums up to the companies not wanting to pay market price for talent essentially they set the price and expect people to sell at that price when there are plenty of buyers the companies not wanting to spend the money training and the companies want people who can start on the ground running instead of taking a little time to get a feel for the job   most of the engineers i graduated with knew that they would need more on the job training because the degrees were so general it 's almost impossible to make the degrees fit perfectly to the parameters that the companies want so the universities provide a good engineering foundation that businesses could build upon if the businesses were willing to spend the time training people there would n't be a problem

your approach sounds solid to me   alternatively if as appears to be the case then you might want to consider your tax advantaged accounts to tax inefficient investments such as reits and high yield bond funds   that way your investments that generate non capital gain i.e. tax expensive income are safe from the irs until retirement or forever   and your investments that generate only capital gains income are safe until you sell them and then they 're tax cheap anyway of course since there are n't really that many tax expensive investment vehicles especially not for a young person you may still have room in your retirement accounts after allocating all the money you feel comfortable putting into reits and junk bonds   in that case the article i linked above ranks investment types by tax efficiency so you can figure out the next best thing to put into your ira then the next etc

in that case he was not arrested for being unable to pay his bill he received a summons to court failed to appear and so a warrant was issued for his arrest the $ 350 was his bail amount which is funds that must be provided to the court in order to be released while pending trial you get this money back once you appear before court he also was n't convicted of a crime and sentenced to jail in this case just arrested he would be kept by the courts if he could n't post bail until his court date as a way of being forced to appear if a judgement was awarded against him it still does n't always mean he has to pay if someone refuses to pay a judgement but did show up to court then typically their wages are garnished which means the court orders that a certain amount of money be withheld from income tax refunds etc until the judgement is paid however if the person ordered to pay can prove that they would not be able to have sufficient money to survive if they are garnished i 'm not a lawyer so i am unclear as to the exact process standards then there is a chance that nothing will be garnished at all   so in short no there is no such thing as debtor 's prison in the usa there is definitely such a thing as being arrested put in jail for court orders and i 'm sure if you took out loans while knowing you have no ability to repay them that you might be able to be charged with some sort of fraud but just not being able to pay your bills does n't mean you can go to jail of course there is very little protecting you from simply running out of money and becoming homeless but that 's not your question

prices can go up or down for a variety of reasons if interest rates decline typically every stock goes up and vice versa ultimately there are two main value related factors to a price of a stock the dividends the company may issue or the payoff in the event the company is bought by someone else any dividend paid will give concrete value to a stock for example imagine a company has shares selling at $ 1.00 and they announce that they will pay a dividend at the end of the year of $ 1.00 per share if their claim is believable then the stock is practically free at $ 1.00 a share so in all likelihood the stock will go up a lot just on the basis of the dividend alone if a company is bought by another they need to buy at least a majority of the shares and in some cases all the shares since the price the buyer will be willing to pay for the company is related to its potential future income for the buyer the more profitable the company is the more a buyer will be willing to pay and hence the greater the value of the stock

i think a lot of people in this thread seem to be conflating worker workplace rights with union membership if your employers are the fire exits shut they 'd arrested while once it was requisite to have a union to protect against employers violating basic worker safety requirements i think that is no longer the purpose of unionizing    i think my primary is why should a union be a requirement of a living wage and healthcare if i work for a small business where unionizing would be much more difficult should i not also have those things   most of the worker protections people are discussing either have been or should be codified into law not provided by unions

when the index is altered to include new players exclude old ones the fund also adjusts the largest and i would say most important index funds are whole market funds like all world ex us or vt total world stock or all japan   and similarly for bonds reits etc   so companies do n't leave or enter these indexes very often and when they do by an initial offering or bankruptcy it is often at a pretty small value some older indices like the djia are a bit more arbitrary but these are generally not things that index funds would try to match more narrow sector or country indices can have more of this effect and i believe some investors have made a living from index arbitrage   however well run index funds do n't need to just blindly play along with this you need to remember that an index fund does n't need to hold precisely every company in the index they just need to sample such that they will perform very similarly to the index   the largest company in the s&p 500 is not likely to have all that much of an effect on the overall performance of the index and it 's likely to be fairly correlated to other companies in similar sectors which are also covered by the index   so if there is a bit of churn around the bottom of the index it does n't necessarily mean the fund needs to be buying and selling on each transition   if i recall correctly it 's been shown that holding about 250 stocks gives you a very good match with the entire us stock market

building out infrastructure is time consuming and labor intensive you also have no guarantee that because you put fiber to every house in a neighborhood that every person will sign up for your service building out infrastructure requires permits from the municipality and underground wiring on new poles on existing poles etc it requires tying into existing networks more infrastructure permitting and commercial contracts   if you want to offer telephone services that requires more network and permitting and has additional requirements as phone service has legacy legal requirements if you want to offer tv services you need more infrastructure and commercial contracts with the tv channels   in many municipalities existing providers ie comcast twc have exclusive contracts with the city that say no one else can come in and build a network   tldr legal contracts commercial contracts and the expense of building out the actual infrastructure make it pretty much impossible to create your own isp unless you have regular money like google does

thanks for your reply i had heard of utilitarian principles used to justify slavery and felt like a dick so i spent some time on wikipedia myself with it before replying   following quotes are from wikipedia unless stated otherwise   link gt is a theory in ethics holding that the proper course of action is the one that maximizes overall happiness   sounds reasonable   seems there are two schools of thought    maintains that an action is right if it utility   maintains that an action is right if it conforms to a rule that utility   it is something that has been criticized by both karl marx as well as pope john paul ii so it ca n't be all bad   and rule differ in how they treat human rights themselves under rule a human right can easily be considered a moral rule act on the other hand do not accept human rights as moral principles in and of themselves but that does not mean that they reject them altogether first most act as explained above would agree that acts such as and genocide always cause great and very little happiness second human rights could be considered rules of thumb so that although torture might be acceptable under some circumstances as a rule it is immoral and finally act often support human rights in a legal sense because support laws that cause more good than harm   i think the above means i would be a rule utilitarian if i was one   however the page linked to something else which is what i use in my decisions most of the time     theory in economics psychology philosophy mathematics and statistics is concerned with identifying the values uncertainties and other issues relevant in a given decision its rationality and the resulting optimal decision it is closely related to the field of game theory as to interactions of agents with at least partially conflicting interests whose decisions affect each other   however you brought up an excellent point if every relation is reduced to a balance sheet the world would be a sad place indeed i will think more deeply about the moral consequences of my thinking especially on the topic of healthcare since obviously i have not thought enough   your comment deeply appreciated

historically the advice was to buy the best policy possible not cheapest at the lowest price with the highest benefit   the cost relative to the benefit is very cheap and your much more likely to use disability than life insurance for instance   it is usually cheaper to pay for it with after tax dollars than to buy more insurance in theory you want to buy enough disability to replace 100 of your after tax income or more since there is no inflation protection built into most policies   insurance companies often will not sell this due to moral hazard although you may be able to combine policies to reach 80 or so    keep in mind that you will need to continue to save invest if you are on long term disability since most policies cease payment at 65 or when your eligible for social security   in addition your expenses often rise due to the increased medical expenditures possibly needing cobra private health insurance etc

i 'm sorry to hear you 've made a mistake having read the contract of sale we signed i do not see any remedy to your current situation   however i 'm interested in making sure i do not take advantage of you   as such i 'll return the vehicle you can return my money plus the bank fees i paid for the cashiers check tax title and registration and i will look at buying a vehicle from another dealership    this seems to be the most fair resolution   if i were to pay for your mistake at a price i did not agree to it would not be fair to me   if you were to allow this vehicle to go to me at the price we agreed to it would n't be fair to you   if i were to return the car and begin negotiations again or find a different car in your lot it would be difficult for us to know that you were not going to make a similar mistake again at this point i consider the sale final but if you 'd prefer to have the vehicle back as is returning to us the money we gave you as well as the additional costs incurred by the sale then we will do so in order to set things right chances are good you will see them back down   perhaps they will just cut the additional payment in half and say well it 's our mistake so we will eat half the cost or similar but this is merely another way to get you to pay more money    stand firm   i appreciate the thought but i can not accept that offer when will you have payment ready so we can return the car if you are firm that the only two solutions is to keep the car or return it for a full refund plus associated costs i 'd guess they 'd rather you keep the car trust me they still made a profit but if they decide to have it returned do so and make sure they pay you in full plus other costs   bring all your receipts etc and do n't hand over the keys until you have the check in hand then go gladly to another dealership that does n't abuse its customers so badly if you do end up keeping the car do n't plan on going back to that dealership   use another dealership for warranty work and find a good mechanic for non warranty work note that this solution is n't legally required in most jurisdictions read your contract and all documentation they provided at the time of sale to be sure but it 's unlikely that you are legally required to make another payment for a vehicle after the sale is finalized   even if they have n't cashed the check the sale has already been finalized what this solution does though is put you back in the driver 's seat in negotiating   right now they are treating it as though you owe them something and thus you might feel an obligation toward them   re asserting your relationship with them as a customer rather than a debtor is very important regardless of how you proceed you are n't legally culpable and so making sure they understand you are n't will ultimately help you further dealerships operate on negotiation the primary power the customer has in the dealership is the power to walk away from a deal they 've set the situation up as though you no longer have the power to walk away   they did n't threaten with re possession because they ca n't the sale is final they presented as a one path situation you pay   period you do have many options though and they are very familiar with the walk away option   present that as your chosen option either they stick with the original deal or you walk away and they will have to look at getting another car off the lot which is often more important than making a profit for a dealership or selling a slightly used car if they 've correctly pushed the title transfer through or you if that 's your task in your state then your brief ownership will show up on and similar reports and instantly reduces the car 's worth   having the title transfer immediately back to the dealership does n't look good to future buyers so the dealership does n't want the car back   they are just trying to extract more money and probably illegally depending on the laws in your jurisdiction your position as customer and decide now that you 'll be fine if you have to return it and walk away then when you communicate that to them chances are good they 'll simply cave and let the sale stand as is

am i getting it right that in india in terms of short selling in f&o market its what in the rest of the world is called naked short and you actually make promise to depositary that you will deliver that security you sold on settlement without actually owning the security or going through mechanism in future and options there is no concept of short selling you buy a future for a security index on the settlement day the exchange determines the settlement price the trade is closed in cash i.e. based on the settlement price you and the other party will either get money other party looses money or you loose money other party gets the money similarly for options on expiry the all in money or at money options are settled in cash and you are credit with funds the option writer is debited with funds if the option is out of money it expires and you loose the premium you paid to exercise the option

as the owner of the s corp it is far easier for you to move money in out of the company as contributions and distributions rather than making loans to the company loans require interest payments 1099-int forms and have tax consequences whereas the distributions do n't need to be reported because you pay taxes on net profits regardless of whether the money was distributed if you were paid interest disregard this answer i do n't know if or how you could re categorize the loan once there 's a 1099-int involved if no interest was ever paid you just need to account for it properly if the company did n't pay you any interest and never issued you a 1099-int form i.e. you wrote a check to the company no promissory note no tax forms no payments no interest etc then you can categorize that money as a capital contribution you can likewise take that money back out of the company as a capital distribution and neither of these events are taxable nor do they need to be reported to the irs in quickbooks create the following equity accounts one for each shareholder making capital contributions and distributions when putting money into the company deposit into your corporate bank account and use the capital contribution equity account when taking money out of the company write yourself a check and use the distributions account at the end of every tax year you can close out your contributions and distributions to retained earnings by making a general journal entry for example debit retained earnings and credit distributions on dec 31 every year to zero out the distributions account for contributions do the reverse and credit retained earnings there are other ways of recording these transactions for example i think some people just use a member capital equity account instead of separate accounts for contributions and distributions and qb might warn you about posting journal entries to the special retained earnings account at the end of the year in any case this is how my cpa set up my books and it 's been working well enough for many years still never a bad idea to get a second opinion from your cpa be sure to pay yourself a reasonable salary you ca n't get out of payroll taxes and just distribute profits that 's a big red flag that can trigger an audit if you 're simply distributing back the money you already put into the company that should be fine

in china people are using litecoin and bitcoin to circumvent capital controls are the biggest exchanges of smart money disclaimer this is not advice this is the answer on a question and answer site the exchange rate of smart money is very volatile you will experience very brief exposure to those networks although litecoin is popular for speculation in china bitcoin gives you and your trading partners the most flexibility as the united states does not have robust and liquid exchanges for litecoin only bitcoin you buy smart money on one of the exchanges in china you send all of it to an exchange in the united states you sell all of it on that exchange for usd if it is n't clear smart money 's flexibility comes the fact that it does n't use banks to work exist and can be transferred to valid addresses over the internet   current regulated liquid and fdic insured us exchanges are coinbase and circle other exchanges use private insurance such as and   so in the course of 30 minutes you should have converted all of your funds from yuan back to stable us dollars in a regulated and insured us banking account to make it for goods and services you need to transfer it out of the exchange to a us bank account this has very little exposure to the bitcoin or litecoin network you do n't need any friends or mules for this the chinese government has issued many many on smart money such as litecoin and bitcoin so it is hard to keep up because they have made half efforts to prevent banks from directly servicing those networks while retaining the legality of their operations within china party members have been waiting for ways to get their wealth out of the country too without risk of blowback so you will need to see what hoops you need to jump through to move your funds to one of those exchanges to begin with this is faster and only uses one transaction instead of broken up ones and there are no tax consequences for sending money to yourself

your question is rather direct but i think there is some underlying issues that are worth addressing   one how to save and purchase ~$500 worth items this one is the easy one since we confront it often enough   never ever ever buy anything on credit the only exception might be your first house but that 's it simply redirect the money you would spend in non necessities pleasure and entertainment to your big purchase fund the ps4 in this case when you get the target amount simply purchase it   when you get your salary use it to pay for the monthly actual necessities rent groceries etc and go through the list the money flow should be like this two how to evaluate if a purchase is appropriate it seems that you may be reluctant to spend a rather amount of money on a single item let me try to you expensive is not defined by price alone but by utility to compare the price of items you should take into account their utility let 's compare your prized ps4 to a soda can   is a soda can expensive it your thirst and fills you with sugar tap water will take your thirst away without damaging your health and for a fraction of the price so yes soda is ridiculously expensive whenever water is available is a game console expensive sure but it all boils down to how much do you end up using it if you are sure you will end up playing for years to come then it 's probably good value for your money   an example of   wrongly spent money on entertainment my friends and i went to the cinema to see a movie without checking the reviews beforehand   it was so awful that it hurt even with the discount price we got ultimately we all ended up remembering that time and laughing about how wrong it went so it was somehow well spent since i got a nice memory from that evening   a purchase is appropriate if you get your money 's worth of utility pleasure three console and computer gaming and of the latter there are few arguments for buying a console instead of upgrading your current computer if needed except for playing console it seems unlikely that a handful of exclusive games can justify purchasing a non platform unless you can actually get many hours from said games   previous arguments to prefer consoles instead of computers are that they work out of the box capability to easily connect to the tv controller support have been superseded by now besides pc games can usually be acquired for a lower price through frequent sales more about personal finance and investment

if the company is non public your hands are tied most startups have a stock option plan with specific rules on the shares in almost all cases they have a clause preventing transfers of options and shares unless approved by the company who would almost always say no additionally they usually have a right of first refusal which states that if shares are going to be transferred the company gets the chance to buy it first in your case the company may argue your friend would sell you the shares for free and the company would exercise their and buy back the shares for free there is not much you can do in this case you may be able to write up a contract between your friend and you but it would be costly and possibly not worth the effort you may be better off asking for a lump sum or some other sort of compensation additionally your friend might want to be careful with this idea you could potentially gain access to sensitive company tools documents which could get them in a lot of trouble

the gordon equation does not use inflation adjusted numbers it uses nominal returns dividends and growth rates it really says nothing anyone would not already know   everyone knows that your total return equals the sum of the income return plus capital gains    gordon simply assumes perfectly that capital gains will be driven by the growth of earnings and that the dividends paid will likewise increase at the same rate so he used the dividend growth rate as a proxy for the earnings growth rate or capital gains rate you can not use inflation removed estimates of equity rates of return because those returns do not change with inflation   if anything they move in opposite directions   eg in the 1970 's inflation the high market rates caused people to discount equity values at larger rates driving their values down creating losses

i know folks who considered retiring to another country their conclusion was that while base cost of living was lower the cost of the things that they enjoy doing not to mention the cost of spending time with friends they did n't want to give up would be sufficiently higher to erase most of the advantages those of us who grew up in or close to cities feel much the same way about moving out to less populated and less expensive parts of our own country   basically when cost of living is high it tends to be because there are more people who want to live there and are competing for resources and driving prices up low cost of living is generally tied to less desired locations for the same reasons if you can find a location that appeals to you and if you can get the resources there which your preferred lifestyle requires this may make sense for a while there were a number of professional writers moving from the us to ireland in part because the irish tax structure heavily favored writers and other creative artists spent several years living in a renovated irish castle i 'm not sure how many have stayed there after the novelty wore off

i suggest you have a professional assist you with this audit if the issue comes into questioning it might be that it would n't there are several different options to deal with such situation and each can be attacked by the irs you 'll need to figure out the following have you paid taxes on the reimbursement most likely you have n't but if you had it simplifies the issue for you is the program qualified under the employers plan and the only reason you 're not qualified for reimbursement is that you decided to quit your job if so you might not be able to deduct it at all because you ca n't take tax benefits on something you can be reimbursed for but chose not to irs might claim that you quitting your job is choosing not to get reimbursement you would otherwise get i could n't find from my brief search any examples of what happened after such a decision you can claim it was a loan but i doubt the irs will agree the employer most likely reported it as an expense if the irs do n't contest based on what i described in 2 and you have n't paid taxes on the reimbursement 1 i 'd say what you did was reasonable and should be accepted assuming of course you otherwise qualify for all the benefits you 're asking for i would suggest getting a professional advice talk to a ea or a a cpa in your area this answer was not intended or written to be used and it can not be used by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer

quick answer when it comes to fixed income assets whether rental real estate or government bonds it 's unusual for highly leveraged assets to yield less than the same asset unleveraged or lowly leveraged   this is especially so in countries where interest costs are tax deductible if we exclude capital losses i.e. the property sells in future at a price less than it was purchased or net rental income that does n't keep up with maintenance regulatory taxation inflation and or other costs there is one primary scenario where higher leverage results in lower yields compared to lower leverage even if rental income keeps up with non funding costs   this occurs when variable rate financing is used and rates substantially increase explanation borrowers and lenders in different countries have different mortgage rate customs   some are more likely to have long term fixed rates some prefer variable rates and others are a hybrid i.e. fixed for a few years and then become variable if variable rates are used for a mortgage and the reference rates increase substantially as they did in the us during the 1970s the borrower can easily become upside down i.e. owe more on the mortgage than the property is then worth and have mortgage service costs that exceed the net rental income   some of those costs are n't easy to pass along to renters even when there are periodic lease or base rent increases referencing inflation rates   central banks set policies for what would be the lowest short term rates in a country that has such a bank   private sector rates are established broadly by supply and demand for credit and can thus diverge markedly from central bank rates over time the higher finance carrying cost to net rental income ratio should as 1 rental market prices change to reflect the costs and 2 the landlord can reinvest his net rental income at a higher rate   in the short term though this can result in the landlord having to eat the costs making his yield on his leveraged fixed income asset less than what he would have without leverage even if the property was later sold at same price regardless of financing method = = = = = = = = = = interestingly and on the flip side this is one of the quirks in finance where an accounting liability can become at least in part an economic asset   if a landlord borrows at a high loan to value ratio for a fixed interest rate for the life of the mortgage and rates variable and fixed were to increase substantially the difference between his original rate and the present rates accrues to him if he 's able to sell the property with the loan attached which is not uncommon for commercial industrial and sometimes municipal real estate the buyer will be assuming a liability with a lower carrying cost than his present alternatives and will hence pay a higher price for the property than if it were unleveraged with long term rates in many economically advanced countries at historic lows if a borrower today were to take a long term fixed rate loan and rates shortly after increased substantially he may have an instant profit in this scenario even if his property has n't increased in value

there s some major logic missing from this report it did nt mention how technology is disrupting how everything is being distributed as businesses become more efficient with technological advances and less dependent on human capital then so must humans become more efficient and less dependent upon an expected level of income what s the demand to keep a human alive and well versus the demand for needing a well paid human laborer if you are easily then your value to the company is simply cheap labor best example is walmart the wealthiest family the largest employer whose many employees require gov assistance to live due to low wages the only way this business could even exist is with from the goverment to support its workers so where do these tax subsidies come from the article responded with a great point there will never be piles and piles of valuable goods laying around with no one to enjoy them whoever said that has never been to walmart with no money i suppose there will always be someone around to enjoy them but will there also be less and less people who can afford to enjoy such things walmart has already shown what happens this article points out the old ways of doing things economically but ignores the fact technology creates abundance not scarcity were not currently using that abundance to directly improve humanity on a large scale level but rather the opposite to control supply or scarcity aka profits when the demand to maintain amp control financial power the desire to care amp provide for your neighbor then the rise of inequality and options appear this buying power is the component of influence to being able to survive very well or simply even remain alive if my daily wage does nt provide for my daily needs then how can i use technology to stay alive how efficient can we all become before we start to share in the abundance of life together

there 's a lot of hype about hft it involves computers doing things that people do n't really understand and making a bunch of rich guys a bunch of money and there was a crisis and so we hate rich wall street guys this year and so it 's a hot button issue meh there 's some reason for concern about the safety of the markets but i think there 's also a lot more of people trying to sell you a newspaper remember that while hft may mean there are a lot of trades the buying and the selling add up to the same thing meanwhile people who buy stock to hold on to it for significant periods of time will still affect the quantity of stock out there on the market applying pressure to the price buying and selling at the prices that they think the security is worth   as a result it 's unlikely that high frequency trading moves the stock price very far from the price that the rest of the market would determine for very long if it did the lower frequency traders could take advantage of it buying if it 's too low and selling if it 's too high how long do you plan to hold a stock if you 're trying to do day trading you might have some trouble these people are competing with you to do the same thing and have significant resources at their disposal if you 're holding onto your stock for years on end like you probably should be doing with most stock then a trivial premium or discount on the price probably is n't going to be a big deal for you

i know some derivative markets work like this so maybe similar with futures   a futures contract commits two parties to a buy sell of the underlying securities but with a futures contract you also create leverage because generally the margin you post on your futures contract is not sufficient to pay for the collateral in the underlying contract the person buying the future is essentially borrowing money while the person selling the future is essentially lending money the future you enter into is generally a short term contract so a perfectly hedged lender of funds should expect to receive something that approaches the fed funds rate in the us today that would be essentially nothing

i think you are mixing up forward looking statements with the actual results the funds objective    the fund invests primarily in stocks that tend to offer current dividends it focuses on high quality companies that have prospects for long term total returns as a result of their ability to grow earnings and their willingness to increase dividends over time obviously in 1993 quite a few companies paid the dividends and hence was able to give dividends over the period of years in some years its given more and in some years less for example the year 2000 it gave $ 1999 it gave $ and in 1998 it gave $ the current economic conditions are such that companies are not making huge and the one 's that are making prefer not to distribute dividends and hold on to cash as it would help survive the current economic conditions so just to clarify this particular funds objective is to invest in companies that would give dividends which is then passed on to fund holders this fund does not sell appreciated stocks to convert it into dividends

in the uk using a credit card adds a layer of protection for consumers if something goes wrong or you bought something that was actually a scam if you inform the credit card company with the necessary documents they   will typically clear the balance for that purchase essentially the burden of debt is passed to them and they themselves will have to chase up the necessary people section 75 of the consumer credit act   i personally use my credit card when buying anything one would consider as   consumer spending tvs furniture ect i then pay off the credit card immediately this gives me the normal benefits of the credit card if you get cashback or points plus the additional consumer credit protection on all my purchases   this in my opinion is the most effective way of using your credit card

as far as i agree to everyone saying that you should stop borrowing etc i see a lot of sense of getting balance transfer cards if you are actually paying it off considering a scenario you have a cc with balance of $ 5000 on each at roughly interest which results in interest per year your minimum due is where you are paying $ 100 mo for only interest and ~$10 mo to cover your balance if minimum is all you can pay with your current cash flow yes do a balance transfer assuming your transfer cost is 3 and 0 interest for 21 months as many ccs do now your cost will be $ 150 but paying off $ 110 month for 21 months you will pay off roughly $ 2000 off your balance instead of if you were paying only your minimum due after 21 months you 'll have a balance of instead of $ 4800 and then you can repeat if your cash flow gets better please make as many more bigger payments any time you can to reduce the balance and you 'll pay off sooner

the rule that i know is six months of income stored in readily accessible savings e.g. a savings or money market account    others have argued that it should be six months of expenses which is of course easier to achieve   i would recommend against that partially because it is easier to achieve   the other issue is that people are more prone to underestimate their expenses than their income   finally if you base it on your current expenses then budget for savings and have money left over you often increase your expenses   sometimes obviously e.g. a new car and sometimes not e.g. more restaurants or clubs   income increases are rarer and easier to see    either way you can make that six months shorter or longer   six months is both feasible and capable of handling difficult emergencies   six years would n't be feasible   one month would n't get you through a major emergency    examples of emergencies    your savings can be in any of multiple forms   for example someone was talking about buying real estate and renting it   that 's a form of savings but it can be difficult to do withdrawals   stocks and bonds are better but what if your emergency happens when the market is down   part of how emergency funds operate is that they are readily accessible    another issue is that a main goal of savings is to cover retirement   so people put them in tax privileged retirement accounts   the downside of that is that the money is not then available for emergencies without paying penalties   you get benefits from retirement accounts but that 's in exchange for limitations    it 's much easier to spend money than to save it   there are many options and the world makes it easy to do   emergency funds make people really think about that portion of savings   and thinking about saving before spending helps avoid situations where you savings    let 's pretend that retirement accounts do n't exist perhaps they do n't in your country   your savings is some mix of stocks and bonds   you have a mortgaged house   you 've budgeted enough into stocks and bonds to cover retirement   now you have a major emergency    as i understand your proposal you would then take that money out of the stocks and bonds for retirement   but then you no longer have enough for retirement   going forward you will have to scrimp to get back on track    an emergency fund says that you should do that early   because if you 're used to spending any level of money cutting that is painful   but if you 've only ever spent a certain level not increasing it is much easier   the longer you delay optional expenses the less important they seem    beforehand also helps avoid the situation where the emergency happens at the end of your career   it 's one thing to scrimp for fifteen years at fifty   what 's your plan if you would have an emergency at sixty five   or later   then you 're reducing your living standard at retirement    now maybe you save more than necessary   it 's not unknown   but it 's not typical either   it is far more common to encounter someone who is n't saving enough than too much

you are at the point that many millions of people are at and where i used to be you have no idea where your money is going you just spend spend spend until there 's nothing left and/or you borrow more to keep going   there are general rules of thumb on how much house and car you can afford but there is a great deal of personal variation housing and utility costs vary greatly from location to location city dwellers can use public transit instead of buying and maintaining a car how much other debt do you have that you need to pay off do you have expenses that are not common e.g. medical bills a more personal approach would be to figure out your own budget the first step is creating a written budget figure out how much you can spend in total i.e. your take home pay and the start allocating that money to expenses until you run out i started by looking backwards   look back at how much you spent on each category each month list them in order of priority e.g. food health housing utilities transportation entertainment everything else if the money runs out you either stop spending or reduce spending in another category e.g. can you cook a few extra meals at home instead of going out can you take lunch to work instead of a drive through the amount you have left over now indicates how much more house and car you can afford once you get to a point where you can budget comfortably then you can start looking at saving for retirement and other long term goals this worked for me and highlighted some areas where i overspent because i had good categorized records ironically because i used credit cards which i mostly stopped once i created a budget if you do n't have good records then you have to estimate   how much do you think you spend on food gas etc each month   then set aside that much and once it 's gone do n't spend anymore   now obviously you 're not going to stop eating but the idea is to plan ahead and realize i have only $ 20 left to spend on food this month maybe i should n't go to the movies it takes lots of practice and you wo n't get it right very often if you have enough left over you can set aside some as a cushion in case you do go over your budget but if you want true financial discipline you should start by reducing other categories first this is not easy by any means it will take of practice and trial and error to get to a point that you 're comfortable with the lifestyle that you can afford    so in the end there are only two variables in your equation income and outflow   do you want more house either spend less on other things or increase your income

from hmrc note that the rule is when a person becomes entitled to payment of earnings this is not necessarily the same as the date on which an employee acquires a right to be paid for example an employee 's terms of service may provide for the employee to receive a bonus for the year to 31 december 2004 payable on 30 june 2005 if the employee is still in the service of the employer on 31 december 2004 if the condition is satisfied the employee becomes entitled to a payment on 31 december 2004 but is only entitled to payment of it on 30 june 2005 so paye applies to it on 30 june 2005 and it is for the date that matters is the date the employee is entitled to be paid the bonus   but why are you worried about paying tax that is your employer 's responsibility and they will do it for you ask you firm 's finance department also for further clarification hmrc are not an organization to mess with they will tie up your life in knots

the reason is that although the american economy is functioning normally mortgage rates are stupid low and are below a prudent expectation of long term 30 year rates of return in the market    i manage endowments so i say prudent in the context of endowment investment which is the picture of caution and subject to law the p being prudent     what 's more there are tax benefits   yes you pay 15 long term capital gains tax on investment income   but your mortgage interest is tax deductible at your tax bracket rate of 25 28 or 33 this being the tax you would pay on your next dollar of earned income   and in the early years of a mortgage mortgage payments are nearly 100 interest   so even if it 's a wash you gain $ 10k in the market but pay $ 10k in mortgage interest you pay $ 1500 tax on the gains but the interest deduction tax by $ 2800 so you are still $ 1300 ahead    tldr the government pays us to do this

a falling $ aud would be beneficial to exporters and thus overall good for the economy if the economy improves and exporters start growing profits that means they will start to employ more people and employment will increase and with higher employment employees will become more confident to make purchases including purchasing property i feel the falling $ aud will be beneficial for the economy and the housing market however what you should consider is that with an improving economy and a rising property market it will only be a matter of time before interest rates start rising with a lower $ aud the will be more confident in starting to increase interest rates and increasing interest rates will have a effect on the housing market you are looking to buy a property to live in so how long do you intend to live in and hold the property i would assume at least for the medium to long term if this is your intention then why are you getting cold feet what you should be concerned about is that you do not on your borrowings make sure you allow a buffer of 2 to 3 above current interest rates so that if rates do go up you can still afford the repayments and if you get a fixed rate then you should allow the buffer in case variable rates are higher when your fixed period is over regarding the telling you that property prices are going to crash well they were saying that in 2008 then again in 2010 then again in 2012 i do n't know about you but i have seen no crash sure when interest rates have gone up property prices have off and maybe gone down by 10 to 15 in some areas but as soon as interest rates start falling again property prices start increasing again it 's all part of the property cycle   i actually find it is a better time to buy when interest rates are higher and you can negotiate a better bargain and lower price then when interest rates start falling you benefit from lower repayments and increasing property prices the only way there will be a property crash in australia is if there was a dramatic economic downturn and unemployment rates rose to 10 or higher but with good economic conditions an increasing population and low supplies of newly build housing in australia i see no dramatic crashes in the foreseeable future yes we may get periods of weakness when interest rates increase with falls up to 15 in some areas but no crash of 40 plus as i said above these periods of weakness actually provide opportunities to buy properties at a bit of a discount edit in your comments you say you intend to buy with a monthly mortgage repayment of $ 2500 in place of your current monthly rent of $ 1800 that means your loan amount would be somewhere around $ to $ you also mention you would be taking on a 5 year fixed rate and look to sell in about 2 years time if you can break even i assume that is break even on the price you bought at in 2 years you would have paid $ 16,800 more on your mortgage than you would have in rent so here are the facts a better strategy

i recently paid off a line of credit on an investment property that i own   i had some surplus cash and decided to pay off the line of credit rather than to make a principal payment on the primary mortgage with a higher interest rate   the interest rate on the line of credit was tiny and the balance was also pretty low my reasoning was that by paying off the line of credit i would be done with that account and would have one less bill to pay each month one less risk of something going wrong and a late payment hurting my credit one less statement to reconcile each month and one less bookkeeping core to manage   i could have grown my net worth by few couple of dollars each month had i kept the line of credit and made a principal payment on the primary loan i judged that it was n't worth the hassle and risks

in all probability having lower coverage levels will result in higher premiums as my insurance agent explained to me the higher your coverages the lower the insurance company believes your risk to be because you think about insurance smartly you 're less likely to make spurious claims i have my coverages run at various levels every 18 24 months and it is almost always true that higher coverages result in lower premiums also there is no guarantee you 'll still be employed by the same company if an injury happens or that they 'll continue to offer the same plans every year insurance is a calculated risk on the part of the insurer and a means of sharing risk at a cost known as your premium on the part of the insured even if your premiums are slightly higher on the order of a couple dollars per month for example do you really want to save a couple dollars and then be surprised when your health insurance company does n't want to cover something

your friends are overlooking a couple of problems with house prices and salaries being out of whack home equity is a paper gain unless you realize it by selling the house if you do n't but use the home atm all you 're doing is piling up more debt that 's secured on an asset that has downside risk ask anybody who 's refinanced their house to buy a new boat or suv in in other words you 're remortgaging the chickens before the eggs of course they 're also forgetting that all this debt will have to be paid back at some point and that usually takes income not equity in a certain sense the housing market is a pyramid scheme that requires an influx of new buyers to maintain prices very simply if you ca n't sell your house to buy a bigger one because the first time buyer you 're trying to sell it to ca n't afford the down payment or the payment on the mortgage then you ca n't sell your house to buy a bigger better nicer one and the next person in the chain ca n't sell his hers cue the domino effect house prices are only sustainable if people actually can afford to buy houses and if there 's a massive disconnect between house prices and salaries then house prices will fall eventually it might just take a little longer depending on the amount of creative financing options that will eventually dry up

below i will try to explain two most common binomial option pricing models used first of all splits time to expiry into n equal sub periods and assumes that in each period the underlying security price may rise or fall by a known proportion so the value of an option in any sub period is a function of its possible values in the following sub period therefore the current value of an option is found by working backwards from expiry date through sub periods to current time there is not enough information in the question from your textbook so we may assume that what you are asked to do is to find a value of a call option using just a single period here are two ways of doing this first of all let 's summarize your information current share price vs = $ 70 strike or exercise price x = $ 60 risk free rate r = 5.5 or time to maturity t = 12 months downward movement in share price for the period d = $ 65 $ 70 = upward movement in share price for the period u = = = u can be translated to $ multiplying by vs = > $ 70 = $ which is the maximum probable share price in 12 months time if you need more clarification here the minimum and maximum future share prices are calculated from stocks past volatility which is a measure of risk but because your textbook question does not seem to be asking this you probably do n't have to bother too much about it yet intrinsic value just in case someone reading this is unclear the value of an option on maturity is the difference between the exercise strike price and the value of a share at the time of the option maturity this is also called an intrinsic value   note that american option can be exercised prior to it 's maturity in this case the intrinsic value it simply the between strike price and the underlying share price at the time of an exercise but the value of an option at period 0 also called option price is a price you would normally pay in order to buy it so say with a strike of $ 60 and share price of $ 70 the intrinsic value is $ 10 whereas if share price was $ 50 the intrinsic value would be $ 0 the option price or the value of a call option in both cases would be fixed   so we also need to find intrinsic option values when price falls to the lowest probable and rises to the maximum probable and respectively = $ = $ 5 remember if strike was $ 70 then would be $ 0 because nobody would exercise an option that is out of the money = $ = $ 1 setting up a hedge ratio   h = h = 5 = 1 that means we have to write sell 1 option for each share purchased in order to hedge the risks you can make a simple calculation to check this but i 'm not going to go into too much detail here as the is not about hedging because this position is risk free in equilibrium it should pay a risk free rate 5.5 then the formula to price an option vc using the hedging approach is vs where vc is the value of the call option h is the hedge ratio vs current share price highest probable share price r risk free rate t time in years value of a call option on maturity at the highest probable share price therefore solving for vc 70 = 1 = > = 60 = > = = > vc = 70   which is similar to the formula given in your textbook so i must assume that using would be simply a very close approximation of the formula above then it is easy to find that vc = ~ $ 2 risk neutral valuation another way to calculate vc is using a risk neutral approach we first introduce a variable p which is a risk neutral probability of an increase in share price p = d so in your case p = = therefore using p the vc would be equal vc = = > vc = = > vc = ~ $ as you can see it is very close to the hedging approach i hope this answers your questions also bear in mind that there is much more to the option pricing than this the most important topics to cover are multi period accounting for dividends black scholes merton option pricing model

there contracts called an fx forwards where you can get a feel for what the market thinks an exchange rate will be in the future   now exchange rates are notoriously uncertain but it is worth noting that at current prices market believes your will be worth only euro less three years from now than it is worth now so if you are considering taking money out of your investments and converting it to euro and missing out on three years of dividends and hopefully capital gains its certainly possible this may work out for you but this is unlikely   if you are at all uncertain that you will actually move this is an even worse idea as paying to convert money twice would be an additional expense on top of the missed returns there are fx financial products futures and forwards where you can get exposure to fx without having to put the full amount down   this could help hedge your house value but this can be extremely expensive over time for individual investors and would almost certainly not work in your favor something that could help reduce your risk a bit would be to invest more heavily in european even irish and british stocks which will move along with the currency and economy   you can lose some diversification doing this but it can help a little

the first issue you 'll find is that if you are n't going to immediately live in the house as a primary residence this property counts as a second home or investment property you 'll generally pay a higher interest rate have a larger down payment and qualify for less government backed programs incentives subsidies than you would otherwise the lending criteria on such properties is always more strict and generally more costly than an equivalent primary residence lenders wo n't really care that in 10 years you or your parents plan to move in you ca n't be held to that so they 'll generally ignore that plan entirely on a related note you should be aware that insurance for the property will also generally cost more but you 'd need to get quotes to determine if that is at all significant in your situation you 'll need to talk with a few potential lenders but from a first read it sounds like it would be best like so you and your parents want to buy a 2nd home or vacation home which you 'll share the use of vacations etc and being converted to a primary residence later it 'll need to be clear what plan to use the property for if you intend to rent out the home in the interim years then instead make that clear and state it will be an investment home if it is what you are planning it might make it easier as expected rent for the property will be considered saying you want a mortgage for a home no one will live in for a decade probably is n't a good idea as a general plan anyway either way this can be called a joint mortgage when i was a loan officer we did n't use that term but it 's basically just a mortgage application with multiple people on it all of whom are combined together to qualify for the loan everyone 's income debts assets and credit get included which can work or one person 's situation can cause the whole thing to collapse from your description i think this could work for you and one option is to set it up where only one of the parents is on the application if the other parent has problematic credit situation note that his possibility is often restricted by local law so it may not be an option for you in your jurisdiction but worth being aware of an alternative is you just buy the property and the parents gift you the down payment and you list them as beneficiaries in will trust in case something happens to you before they retire but i do n't know if that would make any sense in your situation this is a single applicant mortgage and it means only you are considered as buying it which sometimes is the only option depending on your parents current financial situation it 's usually something you try if the other option does n't work but it 's a fallback plan some lenders will allow co signers in us parlance but this will vary by lender and locale often what they actually want is a joint mortgage not really a guarantor cosigner finally you 'll need to plan for what happens if things do n't go as planned regardless of what happens what if your income changes if either of your parents become deceased in advance of retirement if they get a divorced from each other or if either both become ill or disabled and need assisted care planning for such unpleasant possibilities even if they seem crazy and not going to happen in your mind right now can save you all a tremendous amount of heart later on when the unexpected including things i did n't mention pops up

so far buying of own by own companies like apple is concerned it will surely raise the price of the script at some level the share prices are a factor of supply and demand at a given price apple being a very demanded script its supply in the market goes down with the buy back after a while this will surely make the script price rise it also depends at what price the buy back is affected if the buy back is done at a right price it will help the existing shareholder if a very high price is paid it will erode shareholders wealth   hence each buy back needs to be studies separately there are several and at times complex variables which determines if the buy back is good for continuing shareholders or not

there are a few different kinds of implied volatility they are all based on the ivs obtained from the option pricing model you use 1 basically given a few different values current stock price time until expiration right of option exercise style strike of the option interest rates dividends etc you can obtain the iv for a given option price if you look at the bid of an option you can calculate the iv for that bid if you look at the ask there 's a different iv for the ask you can then look at the mid price then you have a different iv and so on and so on and that 's for each strike in each expiration cycle so you have a ton of different ivs 2 in many option trading platforms you 'll see another kind of iv the iv for each specific expiration cycle that 's calculated based on some of the ivs i mentioned on topic 1 some kind of aggregation more on this later 3 finally people often talk about the iv of stock xyz that 's again an aggregation calculated from many of the ivs mentioned on topic 1 now your question seems to be which ivs from which options from which months with which weight are part of the expiration cycle iv or for the iv of the stock itself it really depends on the trading platform you are talking about but very frequently people will use a calculation similar to how the cboe calculates the vix basically the vix is just like the iv described on topic 3 above but specifically for spx the s&p 500 index the very detailed procedure and formulas to calculate the vix ie iv of spx is described here if you apply the same or a similar methodology to other stocks you 'll get what you could call the iv of stock xyz

this is largely a cultural issue i would be appalled at the very idea that my parents would charge me interest for lending me money just as they would be appalled if i were to do so if lending them money i find the idea of attempting to make money off of your children fundamentally wrong   i realize that you only want to do this to teach them that you have their best interests in mind and not your own profit nevertheless what will actually happen were you to charge them interest is that you would accrue a monetary gain at the expense of your children is that really something you would be comfortable with now as i stated at the beginning this is clearly a cultural issue based on the other answers here many cultures probably including your own find nothing wrong with this i 've even heard of people charging their adult children rent when they come home for the holidays something that is completely baffling to me   the point i am trying to make is that asking other people 's opinions on whether you should do this is not very useful unless those people share your own cultural background my family and culture are such that the idea of charging interest to one 's family members seems downright immoral to me given that you are asking here it seems like you might be on the fence about it yourself however i freely admit that my answer is colored by my own cultural and may very well not be applicable to you   still ask yourself is a relatively small amount of money in the grand scheme of things or for that matter an entire fortune worth your relationship with your children do you really believe that having their parents retroactively charge them interest for a loan will somehow teach them something about the real world that your already adult children do n't know one of the main reasons they came to you and did n't go to a bank is precisely that they expected the loan to be interest free   so sure tell them that you wo n't lend any more until they repay what they owe even better sit them down and have an honest adult conversation explaining that the absence of the money they owe is making itself felt in your household and work out a way they can repay you   what in my opinion you most certainly should n't do is treat your relationship with your children as a regular business transaction it is n't and i am sure you do n't want it to be

using fundamental and technical analysis together is actually a good idea for longer term trading of up to 6 months or longer   the whole idea behind trading with technical analysis is to increase the probabilities of a trade going in the desired direction by using uncorrelated indicators that produce the same signal to buy or sell at the same time for example you might use a moving average ma as a buy signal when the price falls for a few days hits the ma and then reverses and starts moving back up if however you also include a stochastic oscillator so to indicate when the stock is oversold under 20 and if the price rebounds from the ma average at the same time as the stochastic is crossing over in the oversold position then this may be a higher probability trade if you also only trade stocks that are fundamentally healthy as fundamentally good stocks are more likely to go up than fundamentally bad stocks then this might increase the probabilities again then if you only buy when the market as a whole is moving up then this will increase your chances again a few weeks ago at a seminar the the men in the room to be 76 and the women in the room to be 8 he then asked what will most likely be the next person to walk in the room a man or a woman the statistics are on the side of a wan walking in next this is what we try to do with technical analysis increase our chances when we take a trade of course a woman could be the next person to walk in the room just like any trade can go against you and this is why we use money management and risk management and take a small loss when a trade does go against you lets look at an example where you could incorporate fa with ta to increase your chances of profits   above is a candlestick chart of select harvest the green line above the price is the perceived value the pink line is the 40 day ma the blue line is the eps and the white lines is the stochastic oscillator above 80 being overbought and below 20 is oversold from feb 2015 to start of aug 2015 the stock was uptrending since then the price reversed and started to downtrend the stock was determined to be fundamentally good early in 2015 with the perceived value gradually increasing and greater than the share price and the eps starting to increase regularly from mid april thus as the stock is seen as fundamentally healthy any price reversal in the vicinity of the ma could be seen as a buy opportunity in fact there where 2 such opportunities on 31st march and 11th june where price had reversed and rebounded off the ma the so crossed over in or near the oversold area the price did reverse and then rebounded off the ma again on 9th july however the so was not in or near the oversold area on this occasion so not as high in probability terms the price still rebounded and went up again however another momentum indicator not shown here shows some bearish divergence in this case so another reason to possibly keep away at this point in time a good signal to get out of the trade that is your stop loss has not already taken you out is when the price breaks and closes below the ma line this occurred on 7th august so if we had bought on the first signal on 31st march for $ and sold when the priced broke through the ma on 7th august for $ we would have made a profit of approx 59 in just over 4 months if bought on the second signal on 11th june for $ 9.98 and again sold on 7th august for $ we would have made about 18 in under 2 months so the fundamentals the price in relation to ma and the so where all lining up to provide two high probability trades of course you would need to incorporate you risk management including stops in case the price did not continue upwards after you bought if the market is also moving up on the day of the signal this will further increase your chances   unless you day trade which i would avoid a good way to enter your trades after a signal is to enter a stop buy order after market close to buy if the price moves above the high of the signal day that way if the market and the stock open and move lower during the day after the signal you avoid entering the trade altogether this can be incorporated as part of your risk management and trading rules after the price broke down through the ma we can see that a downtrend which is still current today in fact i just took a short trade on this stock yesterday we can also see that the perceived value whilst still above the price has reached a peak and is currently moving downwards and the eps after being flat for a few months has just moved down for the first time in 10 months so maybe the fundamentals are starting to a bit on this stock it may be a good stock to continue shorting into the future so basically you can continue using fundamental analysis to select which stocks to buy place them in a watch list and then use technical analysis to determine when these stocks are starting to uptrend and use a combination of uncorrelated indicators to produce higher probability signals for when to enter your trades

the rich pay more in taxes it would be hard to cut taxes in a way that did nt help the rich i 'm more concerned with what it does for the middle and lower classes i do n't care that much if it helps the rich   edit okay so let 's say you give the top third of the population by income a 1 income tax cut the middle third got a 5 cut and the bottom third got a 10 cut in dollar value the rich are still getting a larger cut simply by virtue of how much they pay in taxes   someone made a point about property tax speaking very generally poor people rent and rich people own so a property tax inherently benefits the wealthy because they own more property certainly any kind of corporate or capital gains cut would benefit the wealthy since they own the corporations and are more heavily invested even a sales tax cut would benefit the wealthy more than the non wealthy simply because they spend more money   but what frustrates me is how hung up people get on the fact that something is good for the wealthy such as with the headline of ops article as if we should actively try to avoid helping anyone rich as i stated above i do n't care that it helps the rich as long as it 's helping the rest of us too and if the rich are getting a bigger benefit than i am by virtue of being rich i 'm not bothered because i can do math

first to mention one thing better analysis calls for analyzing a range of outcomes not just one assigning a probability on each and comparing the expected values then the choice based on risk tolerance but now just look at the outcome or scenario of 3 and time frame of 2 days let 's assume your investable capital is exactly $ 1000 multiply everything by 5 for $ 5,000 etc a. buy stock the value goes to 103 your investment goes to $ net return is $ 30 minus let 's say $ 20 commission you should compare these between brokers i use one that charges 9.99 plus a trivial government fee b. buy an call option at 100 for $ 0.40 per share with an expiration 30 days away december 23 this is a more complicated to evaluate this you need to estimate the movement of the value of a 100 call $ 0 in and out of the money 30 days remaining to the value of a 100 call $ 3 in the money 28 days remaining that movement will vary based on the volatility of the underlying stock an advanced topic but there are techniques to estimate that which become simple to use after you get the hang of it at any rate let 's say that the expected movement of the option price in this scenario is from $ 0.40 to $ 3.20 since you bought 2500 share options for $ 1000 the gain would be 2500 times 2.8 = 7000 c. buy an call option at 102 for $ per share with an expiration 30 days away december 23 to evaluate this you need to estimate the movement of the value of a 102 call $ 2 out of the money 30 days remaining to the value of a 102 call $ 1 in the money 28 days remaining that movement will vary based on the volatility of the underlying stock an advanced topic but there are techniques to estimate that which become simple to use after you get the hang of it at any rate let 's say that the expected movement of the option price in this scenario is from $ to $ 1.50 since you bought 8000 share options for $ 1000 the gain would be 8000 times = d. same thing but starting with a 98 call e. same thing but starting with a 101 call expiring 60 days out f. etc other option choices again getting the numbers right for the above is an advanced topic one reason why brokerages warn you that options are risky if you do your math wrong you can lose even doing that math right with a bad outcome loses anyway you need to score as many options as needed to find the optimal point but back to the first paragraph you should then run the whole analysis on a 2 gain or 5 or 5 in 4 days instead of 2 days do as many as are fruitful assess then pull the trigger and buy it try these techniques in simulation before diving in please one last point you do n't have to understand how to evaluate projected option price movements if you have software that   does that for you i 'll on that process except to mention it get the general idea edit p.s. i forgot to mention that brokers need love for handling options too check those commission rates in your analysis as well

you want the net expense of the surcharge minus the rewards to be no more than the interest that you would pay otherwise    where t is the compounding period for the rate d expressed as a fraction of the overall period for d.   so if d is an annual rate not the apr the simple rate it would be expressed as something like if compounded daily   that is the number of years in the compounding period   if a monthly rate or weekly compounding that would change    and p is the number of such time periods in the grace period   so if the grace period were one month this might be 30    other variables are as used in the question all expressed as percentages which is why i 'm dividing by 100   the d rate should be the simple rate like 6 not the apr of or whatever    note that i 'm saying < =   when equal there is no financial advantage or disadvantage   you could choose either method for the same cost   now one method may be more annoying to implement in which case you might add a fee for it on one side or the other of the equation   or simply change the less than or equal to be just less than    i may be missing something that you should consider but i do n't know   the problem is generic enough that pertinent details might be hidden   but hopefully this at least gives you a framework under which to consider it

household budgeting is about giving a job to your money before you spend it   having it zero sum means that you 've assigned all your money coming in to whatever tasks you 've decided align with your financial priorities that means that if you start with money in the bank then that money needs to be assigned jobs as well it 's likely that if it 's savings then its job will be to wait around until needed for things like car repair home repair vacation etc

it 's also not really anything new    for a several decades a huge percentage of the population has been essentially living paycheck to paycheck and with essentially zero cash savings to cover emergencies   it 's possible that it is slightly worse now in the sense that with the pervasive use of credit amp debit cards etc few people deal in cash or change very often and so they do n't even have the old proverbial piggy banks or jars bottles filled with end of day pocket change that they can raid for $ 50 or $ 100   oh and that really has nothing to do with bubbles     edit plus another thought just the other day there was an article about how millennials are saving for retirement in higher amounts and at earlier ages than prior generations if that is true then a likely corollary would be that they are not engaged in plain old savings at the same rate i.e. what money they are stashing away is all heading to wall street and is difficult to access in an emergency and if they did access 401k savings it would likely be as a loan rather than paying the early withdrawal penalties amp taxes

the biggest reason why one might want to leave 401k money invested in an ex employer 's plan is that the plan offers some superior investment opportunities that are not available elsewhere e.g. some mutual funds that are not open to individual investors such as s&p index funds for institutional investors these have expense ratios even smaller than the already low expense ratios of good s&p index funds or hot funds that are usually temporarily closed to new investors etc the biggest reason to roll over 401k money from an ex employer 's plan to the 401k plan of a new employer is essentially the same the new employer 's plan offers superior investment opportunities that are not available elsewhere of course the new employer 's   401k plan must accept such roll overs i do not believe that it is a requirement that a 401k plan must accept rollovers but rather an option that a plan can be set up to allow   for or not   another reason to roll over 401k money from one plan to another   rather than into an ira is to keep it safe from creditors if you are   sued and found liable for damages in a court proceeding the plaintiff can come after ira assets but not after 401k money   also you can take a loan from the 401k money subject to various rules about how much can be borrowed payment requirements etc which you can not from an ira that being said the benefits of keeping 401k money as 401k money must be weighed against the usually higher administrative costs and usually poorer and more limited choices of investment opportunities   available in most 401k plans as muro has said already

first your question contains a couple of false premises options in the u.s. do not trade on the nyse which is a stock exchange   you must have been looking at a listing from an options exchange there are a handful of options exchanges in the u.s. and while two of these have nyse in the name referring to nyse by itself still refers to the stock exchange companies typically do n't decide themselves whether options will trade for their stock   the exchange and other market participants market makers decide whether to create a market for them the toronto stock exchange tsx is also a stock exchange   it does n't list any options   if you want to see canadian listed options on equities you 're looking in the wrong place next yes does have listed options in canada here are some   did you know about the montreal exchange mx   the mx is part of the group which owns both the toronto stock exchange tsx and the montreal exchange you 'll find lots of canadian equity and index options trading at the mx   if you have an options trading account with a decent canadian broker you should have access to trade options at the mx finally even considering the existence of the mx you 'll still find that a lot of canadian companies do n't have any options listed   simply smaller and/or less liquid stocks do n't have enough demand for options so the options exchange market makers do n't offer any it is n't cost effective for them to create a market where there will be very few participants

the quickest way to approach this question is to first understand that it compares flows vs. levels market size is usually stated as an annual or other period figure e.g. the market size of will be $ in 2019   this is a flow figure market capitalization is a level figure at any given point in time e.g. the market cap of the company was $ 20 million at the end of its last fiscal quarter confusion sometimes occurs when levels and flows are used loosely for comparisons   it is common for media to make statements such as joe billionaire is worth more than the gdp of   that is comparing a current level net worth with an annual flow gdp with this in mind there are a variety of conditions where a company 's equity market value will exceed its market size   the most extreme example is an innovating development stage enterprise say a biotech company developing a new market for a new product the current market size may be nil while the enterprise is worth something greater the primary reason however for situations where a company 's equity market cap is greater than its market size is usually that the financial market expects the enterprise and oftentimes its market though this is n't necessary to grow substantially over time and hence the discounted value of the company may be greater than the current or near future market size a final example   us annual gdp which comprises of much more than corporate incomes and profits for 2014 was about $ while the nation 's total equity market value in 2014 was $ both according to the world bank   that latter figure also does n't include the trillions of corporate debts these companies have issued so the total market cap of us inc. is substantially greater than $

hmm well there are several ways to do that go to any bank or at the very least major ones they can assist you with buying and/or selling stocks shares of any company on the financial market they keep your shares safe at the bank and take care of them the downside is that they will calculate fees for every single thing they do with your money or shares or whatever go to any financial broker trader that deals with the stock market open an account and tell them to buy shares from company x and keep them meaning they wo n't trade with them if this is what you want do the same as point 2 but on your own find a suitable broker with decent transaction fees open an account find the company 's stock code and purchase the stocks via the platform the broker uses

you 've got the right idea except that the stated interest rate is normalized for a 1-year investment   hence if you buy a bill you 're getting something closer to of what you 've computed in your question   more precisely the treasury uses a 360 day year for these calculations so you multiply the stated rate by number of days until to get the actual rate of return

all the other answers are spot on but look at it this way really all you mean when you say building equity is accumulating wealth   if that is the goal then having her invest the money in a brokerage e.g. ira account makes a lot more sense   if you ca n't afford the apartment without her then you ca n't afford to pay out her portion of the equity in the future   which means she is not building equity you are just borrowing money from her   the safest and simplest thing for you to do is to agree on a number that does not include equity to be really safe you might want to both sign something in writing that says she will never have an equity stake unless you agree to it in writing   it does n't have to be anything fancy in fact the shorter the better i am thinking about 3 sentences should do the trick if you feel you absolutely have to borrow money from her on a monthly basis to afford your mortgage then i recommend you make it an unsecured loan   just be sure to specify the interest rate even if it is zero and the repayment terms and ideally late payment penalties again nothing fancy 10 sentences maybe   e.g. john doe will borrow x$ per month until jane doe the apartment after such time john doe will begin repaying the loan at per month that said borrowing money from friends and family almost never turns out well at the very least you need to save up a few months of rent so that if you do break up you have time to find another roommate disclaimer i do not have any state issued professional licenses

until you read about someone mentioning one of the main reasons main street took those losses was because of the municipalities state and federal pensions invested into those cdss    credit default swaps were the insurance scams that 's different   municipalities purchased cdos and not   someone correct me if i am wrong   the cds 's were also a problem but of a different sort   cds allowed people to take out insurance on a competing product   imagine me taking out a fire insurance on your house   things like that   cdo = debt obligation this is the paper which represents hundreds of mortgage slices mixed and matched by some bullshit software algorithm that promised to predict risk accurately   cds = credit default swap this is an insurance paper which is not regulated like all the other normal and legitimate insurance that insures the cdo garbage above so if your or even your competitor 's cdo goes into the shitter you can collect on your cds bullshit so the cds was supposed to be a hedge against the cdo failure

you do n't state where you are so any answers to this will by necessity be very general in nature how many bank accounts should i have and what kinds you should have one transaction account and one savings account you can get by with just a single transaction account but i really do n't recommend that these are referred to with different names in different jurisdictions but the basic idea is that you have one account where money is going in and out the transaction account and one where money goes in and stays the savings account you can then later on as you discover various needs build on top of that basic foundation for example i have separate accounts for each source of money that comes into my personal finances which makes things much easier when i sit down to fill out the tax forms up to almost a year and a half later but also adds a bit of complexity for me that simplicity at tax time is worth the additional complexity for someone just starting out it might not be and of course it is completely unnecessary if you have only one source of taxable income and no other specific reason to separate income streams how much percentage wise of my income should i put into each one with a single transaction account your entire income will be going into that account having a single account to pay money into will also make life easier for your employer you will then have to work out a budget that says how much you plan to spend on food shelter savings and so on how do i portion them out into budgets and savings if you have no idea where to start but have an appropriate financial history as opposed to just now moving into a household of your own bring out some old account statements and categorize each line item in a way that makes sense to you do n't be too specific four or five categories will probably be plenty these are categories like living expenses rent electricity utilities food and eating out everything you put in your mouth savings do n't forget to subtract what you take out of savings and so on this will be your initial budget if you have no financial history you are probably quite young and just moving out from living with your parents ask them how much might be reasonable in your area to spend on basic food a place to live and so on use those numbers as a starting point for a budget of your own but do n't take them as absolute truths always have a miscellaneous expenses or other line in your budget there will always be expenses that you did n't plan for and/or which do n't neatly fall into any other category allocate a reasonable sum of money to this category this should be where you take money from during a normal month when you in some budget category your savings should be a last resort not something you tap into on a regular basis if you find yourself needing to tap into your savings on a regular basis adjust your budget accordingly figure out based on your projected expenses and income how much you can reasonably set aside and not touch it 's impossible for us to say exactly how much this will be some people have trouble setting aside 5 of their income on a regular basis without touching it others easily manage to save over 50 of their income do n't worry if this turns out a small amount at first get in touch with your bank and set up an automatic transfer from your transaction account to the savings account set to recur each and every time you get paid you may want to allow a day or two of margin to ensure that the money has arrived in your account before it gets taken out of the amount you determined that you can save on a regular basis then try to forget that this money ever makes it into your finances this is often referred to as the pay yourself first principle you wo n't hit your budget exactly every month nobody does in fact it 's more likely that no month will have you hit the budget exactly try to stay under your budgeted expenses and when you get your next pay unless you have a large bill coming up soon transfer whatever remains into your savings account spend some time at the end of each month looking back at how well you managed to match your budget and make any necessary adjustments if you do this regularly it wo n't take very long and it will greatly increase the value of the budget you have made should i use credit cards for spending to reap benefits only if you would have made those purchases anyway and have the money on hand to pay the bill in full when it comes due using credit cards to pay for things is a great convenience in many cases using credit cards to pay for things that you could n't pay for using cash instead is a recipe for financial disaster people have also mentioned investment accounts brokerage accounts etc this is good to have in mind but in my opinion the exact savings vehicle type of place where you put the money is a lot less important than getting into the habit of saving regularly and not touching that money that is why i recommend just a savings account if you forgot a large bill coming up or for any other good reason need access to the money it wo n't be at a time when the investment has dropped 15 in value and you face a large penalty for withdrawing from your retirement savings once you have a good understanding of how much you are able to save reliably you can divert a portion of that into other savings vehicles including retirement savings in fact at that point you probably should also i suggest making a list of every single bill you pay regularly its amount when you paid it last time and when you expect the next one to be due some bills are easy to predict $ rent is due the 1st of every month and some are more difficult the electricity bill is due on the 15th of the month after i use the electricity but the amount due varies greatly from month to month this is n't to know exactly how much you will have to pay but to ensure that you are n't surprised by a bill that you did n't expect

to play devil ’s advocate to much of what has been written before it 's also worth noting that this is quite an important quote for a sort of reverse reason to what has been discussed before us that of that fact that virtually every economic situation is different as it 's such a problem each and every set of exact circumstances is always different from before technology radically changes monetary policy and economic thinking shift social needs and market expectations change and thus change the very fabric of markets as they do it 's only in its most basic miss projections of growth that economics repeats and much like warfare has constant shifts that radically change the core assumptions about it and do create completely new circumstances that we have to struggle to deal with predicting people betting on the endless large scale warfare between western powers continuing post nuclear weapons would have been very very wrong for example that time it actually was different and this actually happens with surprisingly often in finance in ways people quickly bury in the memories and adopt to the new norm remember when public ownership of stock was n't a thing when bonds did n't exist no mortgages pre insurance these are all inventions and changes that did change the world forever and were genuinely different and have been ever since creating huge structural changes in economies growth rates and societies interactions   as the endless aim of the game is predicting growth well we often see people groups over extend on one new thing and/or under extend on another as they struggle to model these shifts and step changes   talking as if the fact that people do this consistently as if it is some kind of obvious thing we can easily learn from or easily take advantage of in the context of such a vague and complex problem could be argued to be highly naïve and largely useless this time it is different last time it was too

fixed rate mortgage is supposed to give you security you are not going to get the best possible rate but it is safe and predictable your argument is the same as complaining that you are paying for home insurance and your home has n't burnt down   switching to a variable rate mortgage right now seems a bad idea because there is some expectations that rates are going up if you can overpay that is probably what you should do unless you can invest with better return after tax than your mortgage interest it does n't just shorten the time of your mortgage every time you overpay £ 500 your mortgage principal is down by £ 500 and you pay interest on £ 500 less   and if the interest rate goes up over the next five years as you seem to hope that just means you will pay higher interest when your mortgage needs renewing   you ca n't hope to always make the optimal decision you made a decision with very low risk as with any decision you do n't know what 's in the future a decision that is low risk if the risk could lead to fatal results is not unwise you could have picked a variable rate mortgage and could be paying twice as much interest today

some lenders want to discourage the borrower from making these additional payments because they want to sell this as a service they might set this up for you or they have a contract with a 3rd party to set it up these services generally charge you to initiate the process and may have a recurring fee they take 1/2 a payment every 2 weeks then forward the money on the first of the month to the lender once a year they will send in the 13th monthly payment this gives them control of up to a months payment per account   there is no law that says they have to accept early payments so check the documents to make sure it is allowed for that mortgage then send in a test payment directing that the excess funds go to pay down principal verify online that the extra funds were credited correctly even it works once the borrower will have to keep checking to make sure it is handled correctly each month

for corporate finance you probably do n't need it you say you want to have a year of job experience after you get your degree but instead i would recommend getting an internship next summer before your senior year that would be a lot more helpful and if you do a good job it is likely whatever company you intern for will offer you a full time job after graduation    the cfa is more for people who want to work on wallstreet and such if you still want to take it my recommendation would be to try and take the first level test in college and try to find scholarships and help for it i had a friend who had the test and all the study material paid for by the university of arizona

first pay off the highest interest first   if you have 80 pay it first    paying off a card loan with a lower rate but a lower payment or a lower balance can help your mental capacity by having fewer things to pay   but this should be a decision where things are similar such as 20 25 not 20 80    what about any actual loans   any loans with a fixed payment and a fixed amount    if you must continue to use cc while paying them off use the one with the lowest interest rate    call all of your debtors and ask for reduction in interest rate    this is not the option to take first   this is a strategic possibility and will cause credit score issues if you are considering bankruptcy or not paying back some then you have even more negotiation power   consider calling them all and telling them that you only have a little bit of money and would like to negotiate a settlement with them   i have only a limited amount of money and lots of debt   i will pay back whomever gives me the best deal   see what they say   they may not negotiate until you stop paying them for a few months   it is not uncommon to get them to reduce interest even to 0 and/or take a reduction in the amount due up to 25 cents on the dollar   to do this you might need to pay the amount all at once so look into loans from sources like retirement home equity life insurance family    also cut out all expenses   cut them hard cut until it hurts   cut out the cell phone get a pre paid plan and/or budget $ 10 cut out all things like alcohol tobacco firearms lottery tattoos cable tv steak eating out some people would suggest that you consider pets and finding them a new home   no games no trips no movies no new clothes   cut out soft drinks candy and junk food    take precautions to stay healthy do n't wear shoes in the house brush your teeth take a multi vitamin get exercise eat healthy this is not expensive organic stuff just regular groceries    consider other ways to save like moving in with family or friends   having family or friends live with you and pay rent   analyze costs like daycare vs. job income   apply for assistance there are lots of levels and some do n't rely on others such as daycare    consider making more money new job 2nd job overtime new career    consider commute walk bike take the bus   work 's      make a list of every expense and prioritize them   only keep things which are really necessary    good luck

the dow jones industrial average djia is a price weighted index   that means that the index is calculated by adding up the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing by a constant the dow divisor   the value of the dow divisor is adjusted from time to time to maintain continuity when there are splits or changes in the   this has the curious effect of giving a member of the index influence proportional to its share price   that is if a stock costing $ 100 per share goes up by 1 that will change the index by 10 times as much as if a stock costing $ 10 per share goes up by the same 1 now look at the price of google   it 's currently trading at just a under $ 700 per share   most of the other stocks in the index trade somewhere between $ 30 and $ 150 so if google were included in the index it would contribute between 5 and 20 times the weight of any other stock in the index   that means that relatively small in google 's price would completely dominate the index on any given day   until june of 2014 apple was in the same boat with its stock trading at about $ 700 per share   at that time apple split its stock and after that its stock price was a little under $ 100 per share   so post split apple might be a candidate to be included in the dow the next time they change up the components of the index   since the dow is fixed at 30 stocks and since they try to keep a balance between different sectors this probably would n't happen until they drop another technology company from the lineup for some reason   correction apple is in the djia and has been for a little over a year now   mea the dow 's price weighting is unusual as stock indices go   most indices are weighted by market capitalization   that means the influence of a single company is proportional to its total value   this causes large companies like apple to have a lot of influence on those indices but since market capitalization is n't as arbitrary as stock price most people see that as ok   also notice that i said company and not stock   when a company has multiple classes of share as google does market cap weighted indices include all of the share classes while the dow has no provision for such situations which is another albeit less important reason why google is n't in the dow   keep this in mind the next time someone offers you a bar bet on how many stocks are in the s&p 500   the answer is currently 505 finally you might be wondering why the dow uses such an odd weighting in its calculations   the answer is that the dow averages go back to 1896 when charles dow used to calculate the averages by hand   if your only tools are a pencil and paper then a price weighted index with only 30 stocks in it is a lot easier to calculate than a market cap weighted index with hundreds of constituents about the dow jones averages dow constituents and prices apple 's stock price chart the split in 2014 is marked   note that prices before the split are retroactively adjusted to show a continuous curve

i did n't mean to imply that bankruptcy is a magical process i was using that to clarify my use of conservative vs. aggressive to be fair i guess it can vary depending on your perspective if you 're taking the perspective of the debt laden company then yes on the side of a higher value could be defined as aggressive if you 're taking the perspective of someone looking to acquire business i would say on the side of a higher value is conservative    if the debt is trading at say $ 0.20 on the dollar then yes i can agree that the market value of the debt is likely more representative of the book value i guess i was n't thinking of that type of extreme example a more common scenario i 'd encounter would be a the debt trading at maybe $ 0.95 on the dollar and b taking the perspective of someone looking to invest in the equity which is why i 'd say that it 's more conservative to use the higher value which is the book value   so i 'm persuaded that using market value of the debt can make sense in some cases but i would still argue that the book value might make more sense in other cases

the pension is indeed the clear winner and you have n't missed anything it 's easiest to just compare everything in current numbers as you 've done and ignore investment opportunities given you expect to pay off your student loan in full you should consider the repayment as a benefit for you too so the balance is between £ 580 after tax and £ in your pension as you say under the current tax regime you 'd probably end up with £ in your pocket from the pension some harder to value considerations you might consider there 's political risk associated with the pension as laws may change over the years but the government has so far not shown any inclination to penalise people who have already saved under one set of assumptions so hopefully it 's reasonably safe i 'm certainly taking that view with my own money paying more towards your student loan or your mortgage is equivalent to investing at that interest rate guaranteed if you do the typical thing of investing your pension in the stock market the investment returns are likely higher but more risky in today 's interest rate environment you 'd struggle to get a safe return that 's anywhere near the mortgage rate so if you 're very risk averse that would tilt the balance against the pension but i doubt it would be enough to change the decision your pension might eventually hit the lifetime allowance of £ 1mn after contributions and investment growth if that 's a possibility you should think carefully about the plan for your contributions if you do go over the penalties are calibrated to cancel out the difference between higher rate and basic rate tax i.e. cancelling out the tax benefits you outlined but not the national insurance benefits but if you do go over the amount of money you 'd have mean that you might also find yourself paying higher rate tax on some of your pension income at which point you could lose out the lifetime allowance is really complicated there 's a about it here if you want to understand more

1 do n't trade individual stocks you expose yourself to unnecessary risk 2 pick a fund with low expenses that pays a dividend reinvest the dividend back into the fund   to quote einstein the greatest power on earth is compound interest   something is wrong with the software of the site it will not allow me to answer mark with another comment so i have to edit this answer to be able to answer him   no i am not hoping the price will go up the price is only relevant in comparison to the dividend it is the dividend that is important not the price the price is irrelevant if you never sell dividend paying securities are what you buy and hold then you reinvest the dividend and buy more of the security as i am buying the security with the dividend i am actually surprised when the price goes down when the price goes down but the dividend remains the same i am able to buy more shares of the security that dividend so if the price goes down and the dividend remains the same it is a good thing   again the site will not allow me to add another comment i profit from my investment without selling by receiving the dividend i used to be a speculator trying to get ahead of the market by buy low sell high but all that did was make money for the broker i lost as much as i gained trying to do that the broker made money on each transaction regardless if i did or not it took me decades to learn the lesson that buy and hold of dividend paying securities is the way to go do n't make my mistake i now get at least 5.5 yeald on my investment look at pgf which forms the backbone of my investments that is almost 0.5 per month each month that dividend is reinvested into pgf with no commission you ca n't beat that with a stick

one way to value companies is to use a dividend discount model in substance it consists in estimating future dividends and calculating their present value so it is a methodology which considers that an equity is similar to a bond and estimates its current value based on future cash flows a company may not be paying dividends now but because its future earnings prospects are good may pay some in the future in that case the model will give a non zero value to that stock if on the other hand you think a company wo n't ever make any profits and therefore never pay any dividends then it 's probably worth 0 take microsoft as an example it currently pays ~3 dividend per annum the stock has been listed since 1986 and yet it did not pay any dividends until 2003 but the stock has been rising regularly since the beginning because people had priced in the fact that there was a high chance that the company would become very profitable which proved true in the long term + 60,000 including dividends since the ipo

just like pete for me a simple budget is good my budget is probably more complicated than some but for medical expenses i only have one budget item titled medical   however if you 've already been breaking it out further than that and you are happy with it there is no need to change now   something you can do is to separate your budget categories from your money accounts here 's what i mean let 's say that last year at this time before the fsa you had $ 500 total allocated to your various medical budget categories this year you can do the same the only difference is that $ 300 of that just happens to be in your fsa and $ 200 is in whatever account you kept your medical money in last year then when you have your next medical expense you 'll subtract it from one of your medical budget categories which tells you how much you have left to spend on medical expenses and you 'll also subtract it from whichever account you actually spent the money so you know your current account balances you 'll want to spend your fsa money first since it 's use it or lose it if that seems like a lot of work a good budgeting software program such as ynab everydollar or mvelopes will do most of the accounting for you separating your budget category balances from your bank balances they allow you to split up your money without having to worry about which account you are paying from

ethically you and your landlord should always report both income and expense as there technically exists a service and a rent so it is subject to taxation on the other hand it can be considered an exchange of a simple favour and if it does n't involve a money exchange or any profits i am assuming that you are not selling what you or your landlord produce on the market no value can be calculated thus no taxation can be applied this changes though if a contract is involved as a legal value can be estimated caution these subjects can vary on an extreme level of of what can and can not be claimed as income and expense which can vary per country state province and even per judge as well as the nature and sector of the work also if you intend to formalize this relationship the type of contract and reporting forms do vary per state as well so it might be best to confirm it with a local legal advisor to avoid unfortunate surprises

the absolute best advice i ever received was this   you will need three categories of savings in your life 1 retirement savings   this is money you put away in and iras for the time in your life when you can no longer earn enough income to support yourself you do not borrow against it nor do you withdraw from it in emergencies or to buy a house   2 savings   this is money you put back in case of serious events events like prolonged job loss extended illness loss of home severe and significant loss of transportation very large loss or damage you do not take trips to the bahamas or buy diamond rings with this money   3 urgent relatively small   need savings this is the savings you can use from time to time use it for bills that arise unexpectedly unforseen shortfalls in your budget needed repairs such as car repairs and small appliance repairs surprising fines fees and bills   put 10 of your income into each category of savings 10 intro retirement savings another separate 10 intro savings and yet another 10 intro urgent small need savings   so as you can see already 30 of your income is already spoken for divide up the remaining 70 intro fixed i recommend 50 toward fixed expenses and variable expenses fixed includes those things that you pay once every month such as housing utilities car payment debt repayment etc variable includes discretionary things like eating out gifts and     most importantly partner with someone who is your opposite if you are a saver at heart partner with a spender if you are a spender partner with a saver   there are three rules to live by regarding the budget a no one spends any money unless it is in the budget b the budget only includes those things to which both the saver and the spender agree c the budget can and will be modified as the pay period   a budget is a plan not a means to beat the other person up plans change as new information arises a budget must be flexible the urgent use savings will help to make   the budget flexible   edit due to comments perhaps you do not have children living with you i am a saver my wife is a spender when it came time to do the budget i would forget things like the birthdays of my children school fees due next pay period shopping for christmas gifts needed new clothes and shoes for the children broken small appliances that needed to be fixed or replaced special non reoccurring house like steam cleaning the carpet gifts to relatives and friends exceptional assistance to relatives etc   as my wife was the spender she would remind me of these things perhaps   you do not have these events in your life i am glad to have these events in my life as that means that i have people in my life that i care about   what good is a fat savings account if i have no loved ones that benefit from it

think of options as insurance an insurance company makes money by selling the policies at a rate slightly higher than the average payout   most options expire worthless this is because most options are purchased by hedge funds to hedge means taking out insurance in case your position goes against you so the sellers of options obtain a price that covers their averaged losses plus provides them with a profit for their trouble   an option has an amount that it declines in value each day called theta at the expiration date the option is worth zero if it is out of the money so it is option writers that typically make money in the options market as they are the sellers of insurance if they did n't make money selling options they would not sell them   for example the february call option on spy strike 200 traded at on since then it has in value to 0.14 the option writer currently stands to make a huge profit   so just as with insurance you generally never make money by buying insurance but the sellers of insurance tend to make money as do the writers of options   edit theta investopedia

i believe you are confusing sales tax with income tax the tax holidays in the us are only for sales tax consumers purchasing certain goods during the tax holiday do not have to pay sales tax like they normally would effectively the price is slightly lower during those days with the purpose of giving people an extra reason to shop at that time during the tax holiday the stores make the exact same profit that they normally do but they may experience a bump in sales simply because more people will shop during that time income tax for both consumers and the businesses is not affected by this although new york state was the first state to implement a tax holiday 20 years ago they no longer have one today though they do have certain goods which have a lower tax rate year round

you should total the items first to get $ 3.00 then add the tax then round up down accordingly   your two examples above do n't offer this option even though your second example arrives at the same result   in your first example a number of items taxed one at a time might result in many results which would round to .01 a long enough list of items would result in an error of many cents depending how many items there are totaling first then applying tax results in your saving or losing cents maximum due to rounding   see a guide to sales and use tax which is a document put out by the massachusetts dept of revenue in the chart for tax it shows that $ is taxed at five cents but at 5 it would be so at least for this state i believe i correctly stated the rounding process

the federal reserve is not the only way that money can be printed every bank does fractional reserve banking thereby increasing the money supply every time they make a new loan there 's a number called the reserve requirement which limits how much money each bank can create lowering the reserve requirement allows banks to create more money raising it will destroy money but banks can also destroy money by calling in loans or being less willing to make new loans   so when you look at the number of banks in the us and the number of loans they all have it 's impossible to figure out exactly how much the money supply is expanding or contracting

i 'm a bit skeptical of some of the views the author states in particular   gt the likelihood of executing a trade at the best price depends on the length of the queue to buy or sell and the incentives to trade longer queues lead to longer delays to execute a trade delays typically lead to worse outcomes quite simply it makes no sense to wait on a longer line to receive a worse execution   why would this be the case if anything i 'd think that forcing through too many orders at once risks price slippage created by excess supply or demand he argues that waiting in queue may impair price performance but i 'd think that possible favourable or adverse shifts in the price will average to zero over time   if this is the case and they do average to zero then i think funds are doing the savvy thing by putting relatively small low priority trades in to the flow at a rate that saves the most money on average i can see why day traders may not be too thrilled with this but that is such a small slice of the mutual fund brokerage clientele   in the broader picture funds and brokerages are being squeezed so tightly on expense ratios that i 'd think any cost saving rebates they do get probably filter back to customers in the form of reduced fees take robinhood as an example they use their trading rebates to provide an extremely low cost trading platform for retail investors that hardly seems unfair to me   any traders care to comment this is all just speculation on my part and i 've not looked at any time series data yet

yes you must file north carolina and south carolina income tax if you live in one state and work in another the income is potentially taxed twice most states give a credit for taxes paid to the other state often you pay the tax in the state where you worked and then if the tax rate in the state where you live is higher you pay the difference but the details depend on the tax laws of the two states involved i 'm not an expert on either carolina 's tax laws start by getting the forms and instructions from both states and see what they say or if you 're using tax software see if it handles this case if someone else on here knows the specifics of the tax laws for the i gladly yield many states establish reciprocity agreements with other states usually the neighboring states that generally say that if the state you live in and the state you work in are both party to the agreement then you only pay tax in the state you live in this simplifies things a lot unfortunately neither north carolina nor south carolina have such agreements with each other or with any other state

the answer to the question can i exercise the option right away depends on the exercise style of the particular option contract you are talking about if it 's an american style exercise you can exercise at any moment until the expiration date if it 's an european style exercise you can only exercise at the expiration date according to the cme group website on the on gold futures it 's an american style exercise always make sure to double check this especially in the options on futures world there are quite a few that are european style so if you wanted to the answer is yes you can exercise those contracts before expiration but a very important question you should ask is should you option prices are composed of 2 parts intrinsic value and extrinsic value intrinsic value is defined as by how much the option is in the money that is for calls it 's how much the strike is below the current underlying price and for puts it 's how much the strike is above the current underlying price extrinsic value is whatever amount you have to add to the intrinsic value to get the actual price the option is trading at the market note that there 's no negative intrinsic value it 's either a positive number or 0 when the intrinsic value is 0 all the value of the option is extrinsic value the reason why options have extrinsic value is because they give the buyer a right and the seller an obligation ie the seller is assuming risk traders are only willing to assume obligations risks and give others a right if they get paid for that the amount they get paid for that is the extrinsic value in the scenario you described underlying price is call strike is whatever amount you have paid for that option is extrinsic value because the strike of the call is above the underlying price so intrinsic = 0 intrinsic + extrinsic = value of the option by definition now in your scenario gold prices went up to now your call option is in the money that is the strike of your call option is below the gold price that necessarily means that your call option has intrinsic value you can easily calculate how much it has exactly $ 5 intrinsic value price strike but that contract still has some risk associated to it for the seller so it necessarily still have some extrinsic value as well so the option that you bought for let 's say $ 2.30 could now be worth something like $ $ 5 + a hypothetical $ 1.90 in extrinsic value in your question you mentioned exercising the option and then making a profit there well if you do that you exercise your options get some gold futures immediately paying $ for them your strike and then you can sell them in the market for $ so you make $ 5 there multiplied by the contract multiplier but your profit is not $ 5 here 's why remember that you had to buy that option you paid some money for that in this hypothetical example you payed $ 2.30 to buy the option so you actually made only $ 5 $ 2.30 = $ profit on the other hand you could just have sold the option you 'd then make money by selling something that you bought for $ 2.30 that 's now worth $ this will give you a higher profit in this case if those numbers were real you 'd make $ $ 2.30 = $ profit more than $ profit here 's the interesting part did you notice exactly how much more profit you 'd have by selling the option back to the market instead of exercising it and selling the gold contracts exactly $ 1.90 do you remember this number that 's the extrinsic value and it 's not a coincidence by exercising an option you immediately give up all the extrinsic value it has you are going to convert all the extrinsic value into $ 0 so that 's why it 's not optimal to exercise the contract also many brokers usually charge you much more commissions and fees to exercise an option than to buy sell options so there 's that as well always remember when you exercise an option contract you immediately give up all the extrinsic value it has so it 's never optimal to do an early exercise of option contracts and individual retail investors institutional investors doing hft might be able to spot price discrepancies and make money doing arbitrage but retail investors do n't have the low commissions and the technology required to make money out of that might also be interesting to think about the other side of this have you noticed how in the example above the option started with $ 2.30 of extrinsic value and then it had less $ 1.90 only that 's really how options work as the market changes extrinsic value changes and as time goes by extrinsic value usually decreases other factors might increase it like more fear in the market usually bring the option prices up but the passage of time alone will decrease it so options that you buy will naturally decrease some value over time the closer you are to expiration the faster it 's going to lose value which kind of makes intuitive sense for instance compare an option with 90 days to expiration to another with 10 one day later the first option still has 89 almost the same as 90 but the other has 9 it relatively much closer to the expiration than the day before so it will decay faster option buyers can protect their investment from time decay by buying longer dated options which decay slower edit just thought about adding one final thought here probabilities the strategy that you describe in your question is basically going long an otm call this is an extremely bullish position with low probability of making money basically for you to make money you need two things you need to be right on direction and you need to be right on time in this example you need the underlying to go up by a considerable amount and you need this to happen quickly before the passage of time will remove too much of the extrinsic value of your call and obviously before the call expires benefit of the strategy is in the highly unlikely event of an extreme unanticipated move of the underlying to the upside you can make a lot of money so it 's a low probability limited risk unlimited profit extremely bullish strategy

what prevents a company from doing secondary public stock offerings on regular basis the primary goal of a company doing secondary public offering is to raise more funds that can be utilized for funding the business if no funding is needed i.e. company has sufficient funds or no expansion plans this funding creates a drag and existing shareholder including promoters loose value for example with the current 100 invested the company is able to generate say 125 25 as profit if additional 100 is taken as secondary public offering then with 200 the company should mark around 250 else it looses value so if the company took additional 100 and did not is not able to deploy in market on 200 they still make 25 as profit its bad there are other reasons i.e. to fight off hostile acquisition or dilute some of promoters shares etc thus the reasons for company to do a secondary po are few and doing it often reduces the value for primary share holders as well as minority share holders

the actual price is represented on charts and not the change in price as a percentage because it is the actual price which is used in all other parts of analysis both technical and fundamental and it is the actual figure the security is bought and sold at a change in price has to be relative to a previous price at a previous time and we can easily work out the change in price over any given time period i think what you are concerned about is how to compare a certain actual price change in low priced securities to the same actual price change in a higher priced securities   for example $ 1.00 rise in a $ 2.00 stock representing a 50 increase in price $ 1.00 rise in a $ 10.00 stock representing a 10 increase in price on a standard chart both of these look the same as they both show a $ 1.00 increase in price so what can we do to show the true representation of the percentage increase in price it is actually quite simple you view the chart using a log scale instead of a standard scale most charting packages should have this option what may look like a bubble on a standard scale chart looks like a healthy uptrend on a log scale chart and represents a true picture of the percentage change in price example of standard price scale vs log price scale on a chart standard price scale   on the standard scale the price seems to have very little movement from to and then the price seems to zoom up after to this is because a 4 increase for example of $ 0.50 is only $ 0.02 whilst a 4 increase of $ 7.00 $ 0.28 so the increases seem much bigger at the end of the chart log price scale   on the log chart however these price changes seem to be more evenly displayed no matter at what price level the price change has occurred at this thus give a better representation of how fast or slow the price is rising or falling or the size of the change in price

i have a quick question about statement of cash flows and how account receivable net and affect it i 've already asked the accounting subreddit but was wondering if anyone who does fundamental analysis etc would have a take on it    it stems from a homework problem where i have to a cash flow statement using two comparative balance sheets end of period 2013 and end of period 2014 and a change in retained earnings statement   the following transaction took place in 2014    the firm wrote off accounts receivable as totaling $ in 2013 and $ in 2014 it recognized expired insurance of $ in 2013 and $ 3,900 in 2014   my understanding is that the write offs have already been subtracted in order to yield account receivable net and therefore i can just take the change in that account and make the appropriate entry   for the recognition of expired insurance i can simply take the change in the prepayment account and record the appropriate cash flow entry   am i correct in assuming this or did they give me those amounts in order to figure out accounts receivable gross and take the change in that

first of all there are some differences between the retirement accounts that you mentioned regarding taxes   traditional ira and 401(k accounts allow you to make pre tax contributions giving you an immediate tax deduction when you contribute   roth ira roth 401(k are funded with after tax money and a non retirement account is of course also funded with after tax money   so if you are looking for the immediate tax deduction this is a point in favor of the retirement accounts roth ira roth 401(k accounts allow the investment to grow tax free which means that the growth is not taxed even when taking the investment out at retirement   with traditional ira and 401(k accounts you need to pay tax on the gains realized in the account when you withdraw the money just as you do with a non retirement account   this is a point in favor of the roth retirement accounts to answer your question about capital gains yes it is true that you do not have a capital gain until an investment is sold   so discounting the contribution tax deductions of the retirement accounts if you only bought individual stocks that never paid a dividend and never sold them until retirement you are correct that it really would n't matter if you had it in a regular brokerage account or in a traditional ira   however even people dedicated to buy and hold rarely actually buy only individual stocks and hold them for 30 years there are several different circumstances that will generally happen in the time between now and when you want to withdraw the money in retirement that would be taxable events if you are not in a retirement account if you sell an investment and buy a different one the gains would be taxable if you want to rebalance your holdings this also involves selling a portion of your investments   for example if you want to maintain an 80 bond ratio and your stock values have gone up to 90 you might want to sell some stock and buy bonds   or if you are getting closer to retirement you might decide to go with a higher percentage of bonds   this would trigger capital gains inside a mutual fund anytime the management sells investments inside the fund and realizes capital gains these gains are passed on to the investors and are taxable   this happens more often with managed funds than index funds but still happens occasionally with index funds dividends earned by the investments are taxable   any of these events in a non retirement account would trigger taxes that need to be paid immediately even if you do n't withdraw a cent from your account

if the checking account is in a fdic insured bank or a ncua insured credit union then you do n't have to worry about what happens if the bank goes out of business in the past the government has made sure that any disruption was minimal the fraud issue can cause a bigger problem if they get a hold of your debit card they can drain your account yes the bank gives you fraud protection so that the most you can lose is $ 50 or $ 500 many even make your liability $ 0 if you report it in a timely manor but there generally is a delay in getting the money put back in your account one way to minimize the problem is to open a savings account it also has the fdic and ncua coverage the account may even earn a little interest if you do n't allow the bank to automatically provide an overdraft transfer from savings to checking account then the most they can temporarily steal is your checking account balance getting a credit card can provide additional protection it also limits your total losses if there is fraud the bill is only paid once a month so if they steal the card or the number they wo n't be able to drain the money in the bank account   the credit card if used wisely can also start to build a positive credit file so that in a few years you can get a loan for a car or a place to live of course if they steal your entire wallet with both the credit and the debit card

institutions and market makers tend to try and stay delta neutral meaning that for every options contract they buy or write they buy or sell the equivalent underlying asset this as a theory is called max pain which is more of an observation of this behavior by retail investors this as a reality is called delta hedging done by market makers and institutional investors the is that many times a stock gets to a very even number at a particular price on options expiration days like or by closing bell at options expiration dates many options contracts are being closed and market makers are typically on the other side of those trades to keep liquidity so for every one standard 100 share contract the market maker wrote they bought 100 shares of the underlying asset to remain delta neutral when the contract closes or get rid of the option they sell that 100 shares of the underlying asset at mass volume of options traded this would cause noticeable downward pressure similarly for other trades it would cause upward pressure as institutions close their short positions against options they had bought the result is a stock right above or below an expiration that previously had a lot of open interest this tends to happen in more liquid stocks than less liquid ones to answer that question as they have more options series and more strike prices no this would not be illegal in the us attempting to mark the close is supposedly prohibited but this would n't count as it the effect of derivatives on stock prices is far beyond the sec 's current enforcement regime although an active area of research

taking into account that you are in cyprus a euro country you should not invest in usd as the usa and china are starting a currency war that will benefit the euro meaning if you buy usd today they will be worth less in a couple of months as for the way of investing your money look at it like a boat race starting on the 1st of january and ending on the 31st of december each year there are a lot of boats in the water some are small some are big some are whole fleets your objective is to choose the fastest boat at any time if you invest all of your money in one small boat that might sink before the end of the year you are putting yourself at risk say startup capital if you invest all of your money in a medium sized boat you still run the risk of it sinking say stock market stock if you invest all of your money in a the risk of it sinking is smaller and the probability of it ending first in the race is also smaller say a stock of a multinational a fleet is limited by it 's slowest boat but it will surely reach the shore say a fund now investing money is time consuming and you may not have the money to create your own portfolio your own fleet so a fund should be your choice however there are a lot of funds out there and not all funds perform the same   most funds are compared with their index a 3 star morningstar rated fund is performing on par with it 's index for a time period a 4 or 5 star rated fund is doing better than it 's index most funds fluctuate between ratings a 4 star rated fund can be mismanaged and in a number of months become a 2 star rated fund or the other way around but it 's not just luck depending on the money you have available your best bet is to buy a number of star rated managed funds there are a lot of factors to keep into account currency is one geography sector do n't buy for less than € in one fund and do n't buy more than 10 funds stay away from gold unless you want to speculate short term stay away from the usd for now and if you can prevent it do n't put all your eggs in one basket

my knowledge relates to etfs only by definition an etf 's total assets can increase or decrease based upon how many shares are issued or redeemed   if somebody sells shares back to the etf provider rather than somebody else on market then the underlying assets need to be sold and vice versa for purchasing from the etf provider   etfs also allow redemptions too in addition to this for an etf to determine its total assets you need to you need to analyze the total shares on issue by the net asset value   etfs are required to report shares outstanding and nav on a daily basis total assets is probably more a function of marketing rather than demand and this is why most funds report on a net asset value per share basis some sites report on net inflows is basically the net change in shares outstanding multiplied by the etf price if you want to see this plotted over time you can use a such as which allows you to see this as a net flows on a date range basis

lets just get to the point ordinary income gains earned from s corp operations i.e. income earned after all expenses for providing services or selling products is passed through to the owners shareholders and taxed at the owner 's personal tax rate separately if an s corp earns capital gains i.e. the s corp buys and sells stock earns dividends from investments etc those gains are passed through to the owners and taxed at a capital gains rate capital gains are not the same as ordinary income gains do n't get the two confused they are as different for s corp taxation as they are for personal taxation in some cases an exception occurs but only when the s corp was formally a c corp and the c corp had non distributed earnings or losses this is a separate issue whereas the c corp gains losses are treated differently than the s corp gains losses it takes years of college coursework and work experience to grasp the vast arena of tax it should not be so complex but it is this complex it is not within the scope of the non tax professional to make sense of this stuff the cpa exams although very difficult and thorough only scrape the surface of tax and accounting i hope this provides some perspective on any questions regarding business tax for s corps and any other entity type hire a good cpa if you can find one

it is illegal because laws are written by people and laws of stock trade are written in part to make it appear fair and thus contribute to the willingness of the people to invest their money in that particular venue profiting from information on the stock market that some people have and some ca n't have is considered unfair since it presumably excludes the latter from profit making opportunities and thus makes their trades less profitable than otherwise since it is universally felt so people made laws that prohibit such behavior   i am not aware of any research that shows beyond doubt that allowing insider trading would really ruin stock markets but such thing would be very hard to prove there are arguments to both sides and the side that supports prohibiting such trade has a clear majority so it is prohibited

there has been a lot of research on the effects of stock splits some studies have concluded that however note that i these are averages over large samples and does not say it will work on every split and ii most of the research is a bit dated and more recent papers have often struggled to find any significant performance impact after 1990 possibly because the effect has been well documented and the arbitrage no longer exists this document the existing research on the subject although it seems to miss some of the more recent papers more practically if you pay a commission per share you will pay more commissions after the split than before bottom line do n't it and focus on other criteria to decide when whether to invest

you are on the right track for tax purposes its all ordinary income at the end of 2016 if the free lance employer will withhold fed state and local tax then that takes care of your estimated tax if they ca n't or wo n't you will need to make those estimates and make payments quarterly for the fed and state tax at your projected tax liability   or you can bump up withholding by your day job employer and cover your expected tax liability at year end without making estimated tax payments

oh you mean converting your money to that of a country whose public debt is 103 of gdp instead of the 108 of your wiki   that seems hardly an advancement even more so considering that the public debt of the eurozone as a whole is of gdp   greece is just 2 of the european economy its default would not mean the collapse of the euro

gt instead we give money to banks tax breaks for the already wealthy and then deregulate finance when the problem seemed to stem from deregulation and non enforcement   what deregulation there is no deregulation in the banking sector the fact that the banks got bailed out with taxpayer dollar is proof that the market is far too regulated failed banks are not allowed to fail you can not possibly have a more regulated market than that    we need to deregulate the market therefore letting shitty banks fail

the strategy looks good on paper but in reality the 150 call will have some time value particularly if it has got some time to mature let us say this time value is 0.50 so the call costs 3.50    if the stock stays above 150 actually above by the expiration of the call you will lose this 0.50 then you need to keep buying calls over and over and hope one day a big down move will more than make up for all this lost premium it is possible but not entirely predictable you may get lucky but it may take many months to produce a significant move to make up for all the lost premium if a big down move were to happen and the market had any indication of that in advance that would be priced into the call already so the 150 call may cost 4 $ or 4.50 $ if the market had wind of a big move a.k.a high implied volatility

competition or actually lack of competition mostly due to a demand curve that has minimal change due to price you would buy the equivalent cheaper option if it was available but the store has little interest in offering multiple competing options that would drive their same store revenue down and the competing stores grocery department drug card have similar overhead costs floor space lights personnel most carry the cards for incremental revenue and observe little advantage to lower price for a card customers seldom buy more cards due to a lower price thus they mark the price to what most customers are willing to pay you may choose to shop the various stores and find the one that has a slightly better pricing for cards and then stop at that store when you want to buy a card but many cards are sold as an incremental purchase as part of a larger shopping trip convenience as the customer combines trips reduce the time spent shopping albeit not reducing the money spent

poverty in the united states   poverty is a state of lacking the usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions the most common measure of poverty in the u.s. is the poverty threshold set by the u.s. government this measure recognizes poverty as a lack of those goods and services commonly taken for granted by members of mainstream society the official threshold is adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index     ^ ^pm](https://www.reddit.com message compose?to = kittens_from_space ^| ^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com message compose?to = wikitextbot&amp;message = excludeme&amp;subject = excludeme ^| ^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com r economy about banned ^| ^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com r wikitextbot wiki index ^| ^source](https://github.com kittenswolf wikitextbot    ^ ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27

i think the point is that if people took all the time they spent on parenting and used that time instead to suck up to their boss and get promotions then that 's where the 900k figure comes from   the whole article is about refuting the 300k number that the government came up with because it does n't take forgone income into account   usda economist mark chief author of the annual study the report excludes college and forgone income   seems to me like a sad attempt to justify this guy 's lifestyle

if you are worried about it call up the loan company and confirm that they received the payment and that they credited it properly if they received the payment but did not credit it properly to your loan the customer service representative on the phone should be able to make the adjustment as well as remove any late fee that might have been applied as a result of the payment

from an article i wrote a while back dalbar inc. a boston based financial services research firm has been measuring the effects of decisions to buy sell and switch into and out of mutual funds since 1984 the key finding always has been that the average investor earns significantly less than the return reported by their funds for the 20 years ended dec. 31 2006 the average stock fund investor earned a paltry 4.3 average annual compounded return compared to percent for the standard poor ’s 500 index it 's one thing to look at the indexes but quite another to understand what other investors are actually getting the propensity to sell low and buy high is proven by the data dalbar publishes and really makes the case to go after the magic s&p 0.09 gotten from an etf

i 've been doing healthcare financial consulting for a few years now and i was going to start studying to take cfa level i and slowly change industries but ended up learning programming instead at this point in my career i 'll be way too far behind if i do n't solely focus on increasing technical skills related to programming and data science    i think this is the point in time where if you do n't start gaining experience and skills in those areas any professional field is going to be out of reach in 5 years or so for healthcare finance no one will care that you have 10 + years of experience with the industry if you ca n't turn the experience into useful data analysis then no firm is going to want you   right now our firm has moved from the typical pyramid structure with tons of analysts on the bottom and a few high level consultants at the top towards more of a balloon most of our staff are in the middle tier and we are all with varying level of experience but our real selling point is how we are able to collect and process a hospital 's data i feel like i started working at a typical small finance firm and now i work at a typical saas style startup so we can feel it in other financial fields so i 'm sure you equity folks are going to have the same experiences

it is not a dump question because it concerns your most important invisible financial partner the taxman the answer depends of the legal status of this account if your account is 401(k in usa or rrsp in canada the answer is no no capital gain taxes if your money is registered for retirement you 'll pay later on as taxes are like death unavoidable yes capital gain if your money is not in an retirement account as soon as you realize a capital gain it becomes taxable in that fiscal year

here 's the slippage i was talking about this is when i was trading or around that time   the ultra read at least   based on data from october 22 2008 to january 26 2009 the s&amp;p 500 had a daily standard deviation of   if you were to invest in an etf which has the s&amp;p 500 as its underlying index and were to hold it for a year you should expect to lose between 34 and 74 of your money if the s&amp;p 500 is flat for that period   this assumes that there are no transaction costs and that the expense ratio is 0 in fact it 's   my experiment also assumed that daily stock market returns follow a normal distribution   in fact the the distribution of daily stock market returns is it has fat tails   according to my mathematical intuition the ph.d. is in math in case you were curious if i had performed the experiment with a distribution the losses would have been larger   obviously this could be checked but the results are bad enough as it is

the only way someone can take money out of your account using just your sort code and account number is if you set up a direct debit to pay them or someone pretending to be you sets up the direct debit even with paperless dd 's this can take some time anyone who can process debit card transactions can take money from your account if they have your debit card number expiry date and cvv number direct debits do not have an expiry date so they are normally used for paying automatic regular long term bills like rent rates electricity etc note anyone with an ordinary bank account can pay money into account   using your sort code and account number

this depends entirely on what the market guesses the news will be and how much of that guess has already been factored into the price there is no general answer beyond that   note that this explains the apparently responses where a stock good down on good news the market expected better or up on bad news the market expected worse

indeed there 's no short term long term issue trading inside the ira and in fact no reporting if you have a large ira balance and trade 100 for example times per year there 's no reporting at all   as you note long term gains outside the ira are treated favorably in the tax code as of now 2012 but that 's subject to change also to consider the worst thing i did was to buy apple in my ira a huge gain that will be taxed as ordinary income when i withdraw it had this been in my regular account i could sell and pay the long term cap gain rate this year   last there 's no concept of wash sale in one 's ira as there 's no taking a loss for shares sold below cost to clarify trading solely within an ira wo n't trigger wash sale rules a realized loss in a taxable account combined with a purchase inside an ira can trigger the wash sale rule if the stock is purchased inside the ira 30 days before or after the sale at a loss thank you dilip for the comment aside from the warnings of trading too much or running afoul of frequency restrictions your observation is correct

if you business is incorporated it 's up to the two of you how to do it typically you will have the company write cheques or make transfers whatever to each of the humans if you want to say that each of you gets a salary of 80 of the revenue you bring in and then tweak things with bonuses you can if one of you is contributing more to marketing and awareness and less to revenue then you may prefer to pay you each the same even though the revenue you bring are different it 's up to you it 's quite literally your business when you 're not incorporated then for tax purposes you split the income and the expenses according to your ownership share if that does n't seem fair to you then a partnership is probably not as useful to you as being incorporated in general it 's better to be incorporated once you 're past any initial phase in which the business is losing money for tax purposes acquiring depreciable assets and the partners have taxable income from elsewhere day jobs or at least income from the earlier part of the year before starting the business i would recommend that the partnership phase of the business be very short get incorporated and get a shareholder agreement

i think by definition there are n't generally speaking any indicators as in chart indicators i assume you mean   for fundamental analysis off the top of my head i ca n't think of one chart indicator that i would n't call technical even though a couple could possibly go either way and i 'm sure someone will help prove me wrong but the point i want to make is that to do fundamental analysis it is most certainly more time consuming depending on what instrument you 're investing in you need to have a micro perspective company specific details and a macro perspective about the industry it 's in if you 're investing in sector etfs or the like you 'd be more reliant on the macro analysis if you 're investing in commodities you 'll need to consider macro analysis in multiple countries who are big producers consumers of the item there 's no cut and dried way to do it however i personally opt for a macro analysis of sector etfs and then use technical analysis to determine my entry and/or exit
