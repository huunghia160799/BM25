per the irs instructions on filing as head of household as a citizen living abroad if you choose to file only your own taxes and you qualify for head of household without them the irs does not consider you married if you are a u.s. citizen married to a nonresident alien you may qualify to use the head of household tax rates you are considered unmarried for head of household purposes if your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the year and you do not choose to treat your nonresident spouse as a resident alien however your spouse is not a qualifying person for head of household purposes you must have another qualifying person and meet the other tests to be eligible to file as a head of household as such you could file as married filing separately if you have no children or head of household if you have one or more children a parent etc for whom you paid more than half of their upkeep see the document for more information    you also may choose to file as married filing jointly if it benefits you to do so it may if she earns much less than you   see the irs document nonresident spouse treated as resident for more information   if you choose to treat her as a resident then you must declare her worldwide income   in some circumstances this will be beneficial for you if you earn substantially more than her and it lowers your tax rate overall to do so   married filing separately severely limits your ability to take some deductions and credits so it 's well worth seeing which is better

when i was in this situation i always did married filing separately in the space for spouse you just write non resident alien i 'm assuming you do n't make more than the foreign earned income exclusion about $ 100k so the fact that you do n't qualify for certain exemptions is probably irrelevant for you   as a side note now that you are married you have a financial interest in all her bank accounts so if her and your foreign bank accounts had an aggregate value of over $ 10k at any point in 2015 you have until june 30th to file an fbar listing both her and your accounts if you have a decent amount of assets you might need to fill out form 8938 with your tax return too here is a link with the reporting thresholds

according to this section in publication 15   collecting taxes from employees    if you withheld no    income social security or medicare taxes or less than the correct    amount from an employee 's wages you can make it up from later pay to    that employee but you ’re the one who owes the underpayment    reimbursement is a matter for settlement between you and the employee    it seems that if the employer withheld less than the correct amount of fica taxes from you it is still the employer who owes your fica taxes to the government not you i do not believe there is a way for you an employee not self employed to directly pay fica taxes to the government without going through the employer the employer can deduct the amount from you future paychecks assuming you still work for them or settle it with you in some other way in other words you owe the employer and the employer owes the government but you do not directly owe the government if they do deduct it from your future pay then they can issue a corrected w-2 to reflect the amount deducted from you but they can not issue a corrected w-2 that says fica were deducted from you if it was n't

context my parents overseas japan sent me a little over $ 100,000 to    cover an expensive tuition payment and moderate living expenses in    2014 they are not us residents green card holders or citizens they did not remit the tuition payment directly to the school i am a    resident for tax this is enough to answer yes that 's basically the set of requirements for filing you received > $ 100 k from a non us person and you yourself are a us person you have to report it and unless it is taxable income it is a gift taxable income is reported on the form 1040 gifts are reported on the form 3520 the fact that in japan it is not considered a gift is irrelevant gift tax laws vary between countries some many do n't have gift taxes at all but the reporting requirement is based on the us law and the us definition of gift as i said above if it is not a gift per the us law then it is taxable income and then you report all of it regardless of the amount and pay taxes had they paid directly to the institution you would n't need to count it as income gift to you because you did n't actually receive the money so no income and it went directly to cover your qualified education expenses so no gift but this is not the case in your situation whether or not this will be reported by the irs back to japan i do n't know but it was probably already reported to the authorities in japan by the banks through which the transfers went through as to whether it will trigger an audit does n't really matter it was most likely reported to the irs already by the receiving banks in the us so not reporting it on your tax return either as income or on form 3520 may indeed raise some flags

companies do both quite often   they have opposite effects on the share price but not on the total value to the shareholders   doing both causes value to shareholders to rise ie any un bought back shares now own a larger percentage of the company and are worth more and drops the per share price so it is easier to buy a share of the stock   to some that 's irrelevant but some might want a share of an otherwise expensive stock without paying $ 700 for it as a specific example of this apple appl split its stock in 2014 and also continued a significant buyback program apple announces $ repurchase program oct 2014 apple stock splits in june 2014 this led to their stock in total being worth more but costing substantially less per share

your main concern seems to be to be accused of something called or structuring depositing money amounts cash or checks under the 10k limit to circumvent the reporting requirement people have been investigated for depositing under the limit e.g. small business owners if you 're always above 10k you should be fine as your deposits are reported and should n't raise irs or fbi suspicions
# 176017
checks in the us anyway are only good for six months after they have been written after that under the us uniform code they are considered stale checks and banks need not accept them my experience is that they generally wo n't but you probably should n't count on that either when figuring out whether to try depositing an old check or figuring out how much cash you need to keep in your checking account to cover recent stale checks the check you now hold is certainly a statement of intent to pay you and thus is a useful document to supplement other evidence that they still owe you the money but since checks can be cancelled and/or a replacement check may have been issued its value for that purpose may be limited you can try depositing it and see what happens if that does n't work or you do n't want to bother trying it you can contact the retirement plan point out that this check went uncashed and ask them to send you a replacement if they have n't already done so you might want to check your own records for that there should n't be any problem with this note many business checks have a statement printed on them that they 're only good for 90 days or so if yours does you can skip trying to cash it just contact the retirement plan offices

the situation you 're proposing is an over simplification that would n't occur in practice orders occur in a sequence over time time is an important part of the order matching process orders are not processed in parallel otherwise the problem of fairness already heavily regulated would become even more complex first crossed and locked markets are forbidden by regulators   crossed orders are where one exchange has a higher bid than another 's ask or a lower ask than another 's bid   a locked market is where a bid on one exchange is equal to the ask on another   hfts would be able to make these markets because of the gap between exchange fees since these are forbidden and handling orders in parallel would ensure that a crossed or locked market would occur orders are up processed in order of price time priority so the first to cross the market will be filled with the best oldest opposing order regulators believe crossed or locked markets are unfair   they would however eliminate the bid ask spread for many large securities thus the bid ask cost to the holder

what you should do is called re characterization see the instructions for form 8606 for details that is also the form to use to report the incident see example 3 you made a contribution to a roth ira and later part    or all of it to a traditional ira report the nondeductible    traditional ira portion if any on form 8606 part i. if you did not    recharacterize the entire contribution do not report the remaining    roth ira portion of the contribution on form 8606 attach a statement    to your return explaining the recharacterization if the    recharacterization occurred in 2012 include the amount transferred    from the roth ira on form 1040 line form 1040a line or    form 1040nr line if the recharacterization occurred in 2013    report the amount transferred only in the attached statement and not    on your 2012 or 2013 tax return you re characterize it back to traditional ira contribution which will not be deductible you then convert it back to a roth ira basically you end up at exactly the same place except that if you already had some gains on that amount you 'll have to pay tax on them now for the conversion since because of the re characterization it will now be gains in a traditional ira you should of course contact your broker to do the re characterization of the amount and its gains from a roth ira account to a traditional ira account

this is a very interesting question   unfortunately in the way you wrote the question the answer is no   essentially you would be asking someone to give you a ~20 return for your cash on something that is almost guaranteed when holding your cash only gets them a < 1 return   would anyone take the other side of that deal interestingly though you can to some extent hedge surprises in health care costs   for instance investing in the healthcare industry as david rice suggests is a partial hedge   the prices of those industry stocks already has future expected cost increases included however if costs were to jump even higher than expected you would gain some of the added cost you would pay in healthcare back not that i recommend this strategy as you lose diversification but this is a valid and reasonable reason to slightly overweight american healthcare companies for someone in your situation    note that the wiki article you mention talks about hedging surprises as well   if at planting time the farmer sells a number of wheat futures contracts equivalent to his anticipated crop size he effectively locks in the price of wheat at that time   thinking that way you may actually be able to buy health insurance now for two or three years in the future essentially locking in expected price increases today   probably not the answer you were looking for but the best analogy for what financial hedging truly does

if you are in an economy which has a decent liquid debt market corporate bonds etc then you may look into investing in aa or rated bonds they can provide higher returns than bank deposits and are virtually risk free though in severe economic downturns you can see defaults in even very high rated bonds leading to partial or complete loss of value however this is statistically quite rare you can make this investment through a debt mutual fund but please make sure that you read through the offer document carefully to understand the investment style of the mutual fund and their expense ratio which directly affect your returns in any case it is always recommended to reach out to an investment adviser who is good with local tax laws to minimize taxes and maximize returns

you almost never want to repay a student loan early as you 've realised you can put the money in an isa instead and earn more interest than you 're paying on the loan if you withdrew money from the isa each month to replace the repayments being taken from your salary there 'd be money left in the isa when you finished repaying the loan this is also the cheapest debt you 'll ever have so if you repay it now and then end up borrowing money elsewhere in the future you 'll probably be worse off in particular if you expect to have a mortgage at some point you 'll probably be better off keeping the money to add to a deposit rather than repaying it now and then borrowing more on the mortgage you should also consider how long it 'll take you to repay the loan normally if you do n't expect to finish repaying within 25 years you 'd be throwing money away by repaying early this is more of an issue for the larger loans

money can make people do some odd things it makes otherwise nice people stab other nice friendly people in the back for a decent paycheck now i 'm fresh out of school with the intent of finding a job that is going to make me want to get up in the morning with a smile across my face it could be minimum wage and it would not bother me in the slightest as much as the media and the government would like you to think it really does not cost that much to live a simple life and be happy about it consumerism has really fucked people up and it is a shame i 'm in it for the memories and fun times not spending countless hours breaking my back for a company that would fuck me over in an instant

i 'm assuming that all the savings are of defined contribution type and not defined benefit as per 's comment to the original question aside from convenience of having all the pension money in one place which may or may not be something you care about there may be a benefit associated with being able to rebalance your portfolio when you need do say you invest your pension pot in a of equities and bonds respectively due higher risk reward ratio of the equities part in the long run equities tend to get overweight turning your mix into 70%/30 or even therefore raising your overall exposure to equities general practice is to rebalance your portfolio every now and then in this case by selling some equities and buying more bonds sell high buy low now if you have few small pockets of pension money it makes it harder to keep track of the overall asset allocation and actually do the rebalancing as you can not see and trade everything from one place

pmi is mortgage insurance it stands for private mortgage insurance this guy is just trying to get you to buy it from him instead of whoever you have it with now   your lender would always be on the policy since it is an insurance policy they hold and you pay for that protects them from you defaulting on the loan do n't think of it as insurance for you in case you ca n't pay if that should happen your credit would still be trashed the bank just would n't be out the money you do n't really get any benefit at all from it it is just the way a bank can mitigate the risk of giving out large loans this is why people are keen to drop it as soon as possible   the whole thing about keeping the house in your estate after you die makes me think he is trying to sell you a different type of insurance called mortgage life insurance pmi is n't typically about that type of situation your estate will go into probate to work out your debts if you die and my understanding is that pmi does n't usually pay out in that situation   if this is what he is selling buying such a policy would be on top of your pmi insurance payment not instead of it be personal finance experts usually consider mortgage life insurance to be a ripoff if you want to protect against the risk of your heirs losing the house because they ca n't make the payments you are better off with term life insurance   however do n't worry that they will inherit your debt on the house unless they are on the loan if they do n't want the house they wo n't be obliged to make payments on it unless they want to keep it it wo n't affect their credit if they just walk away and let the bank have the house after you die unless they are on the note here is an article in two parts with a pretty good treatment of the issue of choosing your own pmi policy give buyers freedom to choose mortgage insurance part 1 part 2

ah but that 's not how the game is played there are no free lunches but there are lunches that are free or mostly free to individuals as someone on the receiving end of a pension your only objective is to lock in the highest average payout the cost of that will be borne by shareholders and customers of the business so a higher number is always better right up to the point that the company folds and because of the pbgc there is a discount on the risk of the company being dragged under by its pension costs even if the company goes under the pensioners still probably get something*. likewise it 's in a company 's best interest to pensions as much as possible paying pensions from free cash flow keeps the least dollars tied up in poor investments leaving the company the most room to manage its assets efficiently likewise corporate bosses also know that they can be aggressive with   pension promises because they are allowed to under fund those liabilities it 's a taxpayer backed just because taxpayers are n't paying up front does n't mean they are n't the lender of last resort that 's just a political reality there 's no waiting to bail my ass out if the market crashes

this answer assumes you 're asking about how to handle this issue in the usa i generally downvote questions that ask about a tax legal issue and do n't bother providing the jurisdiction in my opinion it is extremely rude seeing that you applied for an llc i think that you somehow consider it as a relevant piece of information you also attribute some importance to the ein which has nothing to do with your question i 'm going to filter out that noise as an individual sole proprietor whether under llc or not you can not use fiscal years only calendar years it does n't matter if you decide to have your llc taxed as s corp as well still calendar year only c corp can have a fiscal year and you probably do n't want to become a c corp so the year ends on december 31 and whether accrual or cash you can only deduct expenses you incurred until then also you must declare the income you got until then which in your case will be the full amount of funding again regardless of whether you decided to be cash based or accrual based so the main thing you need to do is to talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state and learn about the tax law relevant to your business and its implications on your actions there may be some ways to make it work better and there are some ways in which you can screw yourself up completely in your scenario so do get a professional advice

in finance we make a distinction between investments that tend to grow in value and assets that hold value   investments that grow in value are generally related to investing in well thought out businesses   investments can be done in retirement accounts through stocks and bonds but also owning part of a business directly   good investments make more and more money off the money you put in common examples of assets include gold and other non productive property like real estate you do n't rent or cars   you can even have some assets in your retirement account as many would argue government bonds behave like assets   all of these things tend to more or less go up in value as the cost of everything goes up in value but do n't tend to make you any excess money in the long run there is certainly a place for both investments and assets   especially as a young person it is good to lean toward investments as you likely have a lot of time for the money to grow as you get older   as suggests in the united states this is fairly easy as retirement accounts are common there is a long history of stable financial law even in crises   pakistan 's institutions are fairly stable and improving but still assets and investments of all types can be riskier so i recommend taking your father 's advice partially having some assets are good in riskier situations but good investments are generally the way to grow comfortably wealthy   a good mix of the two is the way to grow wealthy slowly while protecting yourself from risk   you your father and your neighbors know you local situation better than i who has only visited a number of pakistan 's neighboring countries so i ca n't really give more detailed advice but hopefully this gets you started

if this is an issue of opportunity cost then there is a benefit mortgage interest rates are extremely low low enough that they can effectively be used to indirectly fund investments if one stores equity in a house ie pays it off then that wealth returns only the rate of growth of the house less expenditures if one borrows against the house to fund investments then the above stated returns which on average exceed the mortgage interest rate can be augmented by the investments yielding a greater return the tax benefit is more of a cherry on top if one is using this as a justification to spend then it is

are you obligated to do what they ask probably not with one big caveat discussed below your employer sent your money and their money after every paycheck to the 401 k management company then after a while the 401 k management company followed your instructions to roll it over into an ira now the ira management company has it pulling it out of the ira would be very hard and the ira company would be required to report it to the irs as a withdraw here is the caveat if the extra funds you put in allowed you to exceed the annual contribution amount set by the law or if it allowed you to put more than 100 of your income into the fund then this would be an excess contribution and you and your employer would have to resolve or face the excess contribution penalties though if the 401 k company and hr allowed you to exceed the annual limit they have a much more complex problem with their payroll system the bigger concern is why they want you to pull out your $ 27.50 and their $ 27.50 unless you were hitting the maximum limit your $ 27.50 could have been invested by adjusting the percentage taken out of each check   you could have picked a percentage to reach a goal that money is yours because you contributed it and unless you exceed the irs set limits it is still pre tax retirement money the return of matching funds may be harder to calculate the returns for 2013 were very good each $ 1.06 of matching funds each paycheck purchased a fraction of some investment that investment went up and down ok mostly up if it was invested in the broad market i guess you should be glad they are n't asking for more due to the increase in value   it would be very hard to calculate what happened if you have moved it around since then which of course you did when you moved it into an ira if the average employee was also given a $ 55 gift last year then the suggestion to the employer is that the tax complexity you and your fellow employees face would exceed the cost of the extra funds they should chalk it up to an expensive lesson and move on

theoretically when a company issues more shares it does not affect the value of your shares   the reason is that when a company issues and sells more shares the proceeds from the sale of those shares goes back into the company using your example you have 10 out of 100 shares of the company for a 10 stake   let 's say that the shares are valued at $ 1,000 each meaning that the market value of the company is $ 100,000 and your stake is worth $ 10,000 now the company issues 100 more shares at $ 1,000 each   the company receives $ 100,000 from new investors and now the company is worth $ 200,000   your stake is now only 5 of the company but it is still worth $ 10,000 the authorized share capital is the amount of shares that a company has already planned on selling   when you buy stock in a company you can look up how many shares exist so you know what your percent stake in the company is   when a company wants to sell more shares this is called an increase of authorized share capital   in order to do this the company generally needs the approval of a majority of the existing shareholders

we do n't have all the relevant numbers to give you the perfect answer knowing your income is pretty important for this question but since you have 200 k in student loans i 'm going to guess and hope you probably make more than 80k yr which is the cutoff for deducting student loan interest it starts phasing out once you make over 65 k and fully phases out at 80 k or 160 k if you 're married even if you make less than 65 k you can only deduct a max of in student loan interest and you 'll be maxing that out for at least the next 4 years so my take is throw it at the student loan your mortgage interest is probably fully deductible which means your mortgage interest rate is effectively reduced by your tax bracket e.g. if you are in the 28 tax bracket a 4 mortgage rate would effectively become outside of that if you were to make minimum payments on your mortgage and student loans starting now as soon as your student loan is paid off i would start making that same student loan payment amount towards your mortgage this way you wo n't have any change in cash flow but it will significantly lower the term of your mortgage which is what would happen if you choose to pay down the mortgage now but then you do n't get the tax advantage on the difference

from paul and mike of the 101 years of global investment returns princeton princeton university press 2002 the small firm effect has not proved the road to    great riches since soon after its discovery the us size premium went    into reverse this was repeated in the united kingdom and virtually    all other markets around the world despite their disappointing performance in recent years the very    long run record of small caps remains one of outperformance in both    the united states and the united kingdom furthermore and    small size companies are still an important asset class their    differential performance over long periods of history shows that there    is useful scope for investors to reduce risk by diversifying across    the large and the small capitalization sectors of the market    furthermore given the of the size effect across the    entire size spectrum it is important to all investors since the    size tilt of any portfolio will strongly influence its short- and    long run performance this holds true whether there is a size premium    or a size discount the size effect has certainly proved persistent    and robust what is at issue is whether we should continue to expect a    size premium over the longer haul and accompanying charts     and one chart from blackrock

i do n't believe from reading the responses above that questrade is doing anything original or different much less bad in rrsps you are not allowed to go into debt so the costs of all trades must be covered   if there is not enough usd to pay the bill then enough cad is converted to do so   what else would anyone expect how margin accounts work depends on whether the broker sets up different accounts for different currencies some do some do n't   the whole point of using margin is to buy securities when you do n't have the cash to cover the cost   the result is a short position in the cash   short positions accrue interest expense which is added to the balance once a month   every broker does this if you buy a us stock in a usd account without the cash to cover it you will end up with usd margin debt   if you buy us stock in an account that co both usd and cad assets and cash then there will be options during the trade asking if you want to settle in usd or cad   if you settle in cad then obviously the broker will convert the necessary cad funds to pay for it   if you settle in us funds but there is no usd cash in the account then again you have created a short position in usd

i have an example that may be interesting for your question my grandfather had a tennis club around 35 years ago and some other businesses some investments went bad and he was heading for bankruptcy due to the tennis club 's expensive payments so he asked to renegotiate a variable rate rather than a fixed rate even though the interest rates were going up not down the idea was that if the current situation is going to bankrupt you taking a chance might be better as an analogy if you ca n't swim and you 'll drown in 6 feet of water it does n't matter that you 're taking the risk to go deeper you might have to take that chance to survive he did keep the tennis club in the end but that 's irrelevant here for student loans if i 'm not mistaken declaring bankruptcy does n't free you of all their debt so it may not be applicable   and this situation is when renegotiating not when negotiating the first time because obviously if you 're in trouble financially taking a loan you know you ca n't repay is suicide

value investing is an investment approach that relies on buying securities below their intrinsic values there are two main concepts one is the intrinsic value and the other is margin of safety   intrinsic value is the value of the underlying business if we are talking about stocks that can be calculated through carefully analyzing the business looking at all aspects of it if there is an intrinsic value exists for a company then there is a price tag we can put on its shares as well value investing is looking to buy shares well below its intrinsic value   it is important to know that there is no correct intrinsic value exists for a company and two people can come up with different figures if they were presented the same data calculating the intrinsic value for a business is the hardest part of value investing   margin of safety is the difference between the buying price of a stock and its intrinsic value value investors are insisting on buying stocks well below their intrinsic value where the margin of safety is or even more this concepts is protecting them from poor decisions and market downturns it is also providing a room for error when calculating the intrinsic value   the approach was introduced by benjamin graham and david dodd in a book called security analysis in 1934 other famous investor using this approach is warren buffet books to read   i would start to read the first two book first

this may be a great idea or a very bad one or it may simply not be applicable to you depending on your personal circumstances and interests the general idea is to avoid passive investments such as stocks and bonds because they tend to grow by only a few percent per year instead invest in things where you will be actively involved in some form with those much higher investment returns are common but also the risk is higher and you may be tied down and have to limit the traveling you want to do so here are a few different ways to do that get a college degree but only if you are interested in the field and it ends up paying you well if you are n't interested in the field you wo n't land the $ 100k+ jobs later and if you study early childhood education you may love the job but it wo n't pay enough to make it a good investment of course it also has to fit with your life plans but that might be easier than it seems you want to travel have you thought about anthropology marine biology or pick a reputable hard to get into academic school rather than a oriented and make sure that they have at least some research program that 's one way to distinguish between the for profit schools who tend to be very expensive and land you in low paying jobs and schools that actually lead to a well paying future or if your interest runs more in a different direction start a business your best bet might be to buy a franchise many of the fast food chains such as mcdonalds will let you buy as long as you have around $ 300k net worth most franchises also require that you are qualified it may often make sense to buy not just one store but several in an area you can increase your income and your risk by getting a loan you can probably buy at least $ 5 million worth of franchises with your seed money btw i 'm only using mcdonalds as an example well known fast food franchises used to be money making machines but their popularity may well have peaked there are franchises in all kinds of industries though some tend to be very short term there is a franchise based on selling customer 's stuff on ebay while others can be very long lived many real estate brokerages are actually franchises do be careful which ones you buy some can be a license to print money while others may fail and there are some fraudsters in the franchising market out to separate you from your money advantage over investing in stocks and bonds if you choose well your return on investment can be much higher that 's generally true for any business that you get personally involved in if you do well you may well end up retiring a multimillionaire drawback you will be exposed to considerable risk the investment will be a major chunk of your net worth and you may have to put all your eggs in none basket if your business fails you may lose everything a third option but only if you have a real interest in it get a commercial driver 's license and buy an truck i hear that owner operators can easily make well over $ 100k and that 's with having to pay off a bank loan but if you do n't love culture it is likely not worth doing overall you probably get the idea the principle is to use your funds as seed money to launch something profitable and secure as well as enjoyable for you

fixed rate mortgage is supposed to give you security you are not going to get the best possible rate but it is safe and predictable your argument is the same as complaining that you are paying for home insurance and your home has n't burnt down   switching to a variable rate mortgage right now seems a bad idea because there is some expectations that rates are going up if you can overpay that is probably what you should do unless you can invest with better return after tax than your mortgage interest it does n't just shorten the time of your mortgage every time you overpay £ 500 your mortgage principal is down by £ 500 and you pay interest on £ 500 less   and if the interest rate goes up over the next five years as you seem to hope that just means you will pay higher interest when your mortgage needs renewing   you ca n't hope to always make the optimal decision you made a decision with very low risk as with any decision you do n't know what 's in the future a decision that is low risk if the risk could lead to fatal results is not unwise you could have picked a variable rate mortgage and could be paying twice as much interest today

a company 's return on equity roe is its net income divided by its shareholder 's equity   the shareholder 's equity is the difference between total assets and total liabilities and is not dependent on the stock price what it takes to have a roe over 100 is to have the income be greater than the equity   this might happen for a variety of reasons but one way a high roe happens is if the shareholder 's equity the divisor is small which can occur if past losses have eroded the company 's capital the original invested cash and retained earnings   if the equity has become a small value the income for some period might exceed it and so the roe would be over 100 operating margin is not closely related to roe   although operating income is related to net income to calculate the margin you divide by sales which is completely unrelated to shareholder 's equity   so there is no relationship with roe to be expected   operating margin is primarily dependent on market conditions and can be substantially different in different industries

the best way i know of to get the interest rate lowered is to call the credit card company and simply ask typically if a credit card company thinks you will leave them for another company they will be willing to work with you   there is also the option of transfering some of the higher interest debt to one of the lower interest credit cards it sounds like you have your friend on the right track by focusing all extra money on the credit card with the highest interest rate then after that one is paid off send all extra to the next highest one and so on   the classic snowball effect

here are my reasons as to why bonds are considered to be a reasonable investment while it is true that on average over a sufficiently long period of time stocks do have a high expected return it is important to realize that bonds are a different type of financial instrument that stocks and have features that are attractive to certain types of investors the purpose of buying bonds is to convert a lump sum of currency into a series of future cash flows this is in and of itself valuable to the issuer because they would prefer to have the lump sum today rather than at some point in the future so we generally do n't say that we 've lost the money we say that we are purchasing a series of future payments and we would only do this if it were more valuable to us than having the money in hand unlike stocks where you are compensated with dividends and equity to take on the risks and rewards of ownership and unlike a savings account which is much different that a bond where you are only being paid interest for the time value of your money while the bank lends it out at their risk when you buy a bond you are putting your money at risk in order to provide financing to the issuer it is also important to realize that there is a much higher risk that stocks will lose value and you have to compare the risk adjusted return and not the nominal return for stocks to the risk adjusted return for bonds since with investment grade bonds there is generally a very low risk of default while the returns being offered may not seem attractive to you individually it is not reasonable to say that the returns offered by the issuer are insufficient in general because both when the bonds are issued and then subsequently traded on a secondary market which is done fairly easily they function as a market that is to say that sellers always want a higher price resulting in a lower return and buyers always want to receive a higher return requiring a lower price so while some sellers and buyers will be able to agree on a mutually acceptable price such that a transaction occurs there will almost always be some buyers and sellers who also do not enter into transactions because they are demanding a lower higher price the fact that a market exists indicates that enough investors are willing to accept the returns that are being offered by sellers bonds can be helpful in that as a class of assets they are less risky than stocks additionally bonds are paid back to investors ahead of equity so in the case of a failing company or public entity bondholders may be paid even if stockholders lose all their money as a result bonds can be a preferred way to make money on a company or government entity that is able to pay its bills but has trouble generating any profits   some investors have specific reasons why they may prefer a lower risk over time to maximizing their returns for example a government or pension fund or a university may be aware of financial payments that they will be required to make in a particular year in the future and may purchase bonds that mature in that year they may not be willing to take the risk that in that year the stock market will fall which could force them to reduce their principal to make the payments other individual investors may be close to a significant life event that can be predicted such as college or retirement and may not want to take on the risk of stocks in the case of very large investors such as national governments they are often looking for capital preservation to hedge against inflation and forex risk rather than to make money additionally it is important to remember that until relatively recently in the developed world and still to this day in many developing countries people have been willing to pay banks and financial institutions to hold their money and in the context of the global bond market there are many people around the world who are willing to buy bonds and receive a very low rate of return on t bills for example because they are considered a very safe investment due to the creditworthiness of the usa as well as the stability of the dollar especially if inflation is very high in the investor 's home country for example i once lived in an african country where inflation was 60 80 per year this means if i had $ 100 today i could buy $ 100 worth of goods but by next year i might need $ 160 to buy the same goods i could buy for $ 100 today so you can see why simply being able to preserve the value of my money in a bond denominated in usa currency would be valuable in that case because the alternative is so bad so not all bondholders want to be owners or make as much money as possible some just want a safe place to put their money also it is true for both stocks and bonds that you are trading a lump sum of money today for payments over time although for stocks this is a different kind of payment dividends and you only get paid if the company makes money this is not specific to bonds in most other cases when a stock price appreciates this is to reflect new information not previously known or earnings retained by the company rather than paid out as dividends most of the financial instruments where you can make money immediately are speculative where two people are betting against each other and one has to lose money for the other to make money again it 's not reasonable to say that any type of financial instrument is the worst they function differently serve different purposes and have different features that may or may not fit your needs and preferences you seem to be saying that you simply do n't find bond returns high enough to be attractive to you that may be true since different people have different investment objectives risk tolerance and preference for having money now versus more money later however some of your statements do n't seem to be supported by facts for example retail banks are not highly profitable as an industry so they are not making thousands of times what they are paying you they also need to pay all of their operating expenses as well as account for default risk and inflation out of the different between what they lend and what they pay to savings account holders also it 's not reasonable to say that bonds are worthless as i 've explained the world disagrees with you if they agreed with you they would stop buying bonds and the people who need financing would have to lower bond prices until people became interested again that is part of how markets work in fact much of the reason that bond yields are so low right now is that there has been such high global demand for safe investments like bonds especially from other nations such that bond issues especially the us government have not needed to pay high yields in order to raise money

from a purely analytical standpoint assuming you are investing your roth ira contributions in broad market securities such as the spdr s&p 500 etf which tracks the s&p 500 the broader market has historically had more upward movement than downward and therefore a dollar invested today will have a greater expected value than a dollar invested tomorrow   so from this perspective it is better to max out your roth on the first day of the contribution year and immediately invest in broad market or at least well diversified securities that being said opportunity costs must also be taken into account every dollar you use to fund your roth ira is a dollar that is no longer available to be invested elsewhere hence a lost opportunity   with this in mind if you are currently eligible for a 401k in which your employer matches some portion of your contributions it is generally advised that you contribute to the 401k up to the employer match   for example if your employer matches 75 of contributions up to 3.5 of your gross salary then it is advisable that you first contribute this 3.5 to your 401k before even considering contributing to a roth ira   the reasoning behind this is two fold first the employer match can be considered as a guaranteed return on investment so for example for an employer that matches 75 for every dollar you contribute you already have earned a 75 return up to the employer 's limit   secondly 401k contributions have tax implications not only is the money contributed to the 401k pre tax i.e. contributions are not taxed it also reduces your taxable income so the marginal tax benefit of these contributions must also be taken into account   keep in mind that in the usual circumstances 401k disbursements are taxable finally many financial advisors will also suggest establishing an emergency fund which is money that you will not use unless you suffer an emergency that has an impact on your normal income loss of job medical emergency etc   these funds are often kept in highly liquid accounts savings accounts money market funds etc so they can be accessed immediately when you run into one of life 's little surprises   generally it is advised that an emergency fund between $ is established asap and over time the emergency fund should be increased until it has reached a value equivalent to the sum of 8 months worth of expenses   if funding an ira is preventing you from working towards such an emergency fund then you may want to consider waiting on maxing out the ira before you have that ef established of course it goes without saying that credit card balances with aprs other than 0.00 or similar should be paid off before an ira is funded since while you can only hope to match the market at best between 10 15 a year in your ira investments paying down credit card balances is an instant return of whatever the apr is which usually tends to be between a 15 30 apr in a nutshell assuming you are maxing out your 401k if applicable have an emergency fund established are not carrying any high apr credit card balances and are able to do so historical price movements in the markets suggest that funding your roth ira upfront and investing these funds immediately in a broadly diversified portfolio will yield a higher expected return than funding the account periodically throughout the year using dollar cost averaging or similar strategies   if this is not the case take some time to consider the opportunity costs you are incurring from not fully contributing to your 401k carrying high credit card balances or not having a sufficient emergency fund established this is not financial advice specific to any individual and your mileage may vary   consider consulting a certified financial planner certified public accountant etc before making any major financial decisions

the difference is that yahoo is showing the unadjusted price that the security traded for on that date while google is adjusting for price splits this means that google is showing how much you would have had to pay to get what is now one share since 1979 jnj has split once and 2-for-1 four times = 48 if you bought 1 share at that time you would now have 48 shares today yahoo is showing a price of $ 66 for what was then 1 share $ = which google rounds to you can see this if you get the prices from may 14 21 1981 the stock split and the price dropped from 108 to yahoo 's adjusted close column has not been accurate since they re wrote the finance website it now just represents the closing price the other relevant field on yahoo is the adj close this adjusts for splits but also adjusts for dividends hence why this does n't match either the google or yahoo numbers

be radical i assume you are not working for a city bank getting paid city wages e.g. you are one of the 99 of people in london or more normal income house prices and rents in london and anywhere within reasonable commuting distances are now so high that couples in reasonable jobs often have to rent rooms in shared houses    this is due to so many people wishing to live work in london and there not being enough new homes built   if you are looking at buying a property to rent out you need the rent to be about double the interest payments on the mortgage otherwise you will not be able to afford repairs or cope when interest rates increase you could also get a tax bill that is more the your profit    finding such a property is very hard in london as the prices of homes have gone up a lot more in london then rents have      there are still some flats where the rent will cover the landlord ’s costs but not many    any landlord that brought more than a few years ago is making a very nice profit in london as the rents have gone up a lot since they brought but are you willing to bet your life on the rents going up even more moving a short distance out of london does not help much so look at somewhere like manchester or birmingham

i 've found that the most effective way to get things done is to communicate directly in person or over the phone if the former is not possible then to follow up with an immediate email per our conversation etc   this allows the natural conversations to occur connecting you with you team members and direct reports while also holding everyone accountable in writing   accountability is n't about being able to say i told you so nor is it about waiting for an opportunity to make someone look bad accountability is about ensuring that no one falls behind or lets the team down in the first place through preventative measures   this comes back full circle to my point on communication the most effective method of management in my experience is simply leading by example when you lead by example you never need to threaten employees with discipline or accountability you simply do what you do and if people respect you for the way you work they will look up to you as a role model your team members will do everything they can to support the team 's objectives on their own accord   source i learned this through a former manager he motivated me to be more committed to the team 's objectives and now i get to pay that forward to my direct reports   edit typos on mobile

the biggest problem is that the rate of return for a completely program is really low   especially now given the low rate of return the cost of such a program makes it nearly unless you assumed a ridiculously low rate of return return   as it is they 're assuming a 4.5 rate of return which is about 2 above inflation a very very conservative forecast     plus not every pension plan could their plans   all that does is shift interest rate risk btw not the only type of risk that exists there 's credit risk as well   to get rid of both you 'd be getting marginally above 0 return not something you can run a pension plan on   so you 'd have to have someone or some set of people that have a very large and very unnatural interest rate risk   if you had a large move in rates it would those people which would completely invalidate those hedges   it 's much better for the economy on whole that pension plans are able to take credit and interest rate risk

banks do n't care that you are responsible cardholder they care to make money interest rates are basically 0 by government policy and the banks charge their responsible cardholders 20 interest rates think about that for one second and realize they really do not care about your ability to avoid paying interest they only need you to slip up one month during your entire lifetime to make a profit from you it is in their interest for you to get into a spending habit from 0 promo rates so that eventually a frivolous purchase or life changing event causes a balance to stay on the card for over one month

as a 22 year old planning for your financial life it is obvious to say that saving as much as you can to invest for the long run is the smartest thing to do from a financial point of view   in general at this point aged 22 you can take as much risk as you 'll ever will you 're investing for the very long term + years the downside of risk the level of uncertainty on returns positive or negative is most significant on the short term < while the upside of risk assuming you can expect higher returns the more risk you take are most significant on the long term   in short for you 're financial life it 's smart to save as much as you can and invest these savings with a lot of risk   so what is smart to invest in the most important rule is to keep your investment costs as low as possible risk and returns are strongly related however investment costs lower the returns while you keep the risk be aware of the investment industry marketing fancy investment products most of them leave you with higher costs and lower returns research strongly suggests that an etf portfolio is our best choice personally i disregard this new smart beta hype as a marketing effort from the financial industry they charge more investment costs that 's a certain and promise better returns because they are geniuses hmmm no thanks as suggested in other comments i would go for an low cost you should n't pay more than 0.2 per year etf portfolio with a global diversification with at least 90 in stocks actually that is what i 've been doing for three years now i 'm 27 years old

short answer no   do not buy a house   houses are a luxury good see why is a house not an investment   although the experience of the early 2000s seemed to convince most people otherwise houses are not an investment   historically it has usually been cheaper to rent because owning a house has non benefits such as the ability to change things around to exactly the way you like them   consult a rent vs. buy calculator for your area to see if your area is exceptional   i also would not rely on the mortgage interest deduction for the long term as it seems increasingly likely the federal government will do away with it at some point the first thing you must do is eliminate your credit card and other debts   try to delay paying your lawyers and anyone else who is not charging you interest or threatening to harm you in other ways as long as possible   save enough money to maintain your current standard of living for 6 months should you lose your job then put the rest in your 401(k another word of advice learn to live with less   your kids do not need separate bedrooms   hopefully one day the time will come when you can afford a larger house but it should not be your highest priority   you and your kids will all be worse off in the end should you have unexpected financial difficulties and you have overextended yourself to buy a house now that your credit score is up see if you can renegotiate your credit card loans or negotiate a new loan with lower interest

it has nothing to do with forcing people to pay off their debt in that case it would make better sense to have people pay off debt rather than interest it is because you want to have your actual payment stay the same each month which is easier for the vast majority of people to comprehend and put into their budget it is called an annuity in finance terms in theory you could use another method eg pay of the same amount of debt each month then your interest payments will decrease over time but in that case your monthly payment debt + interest will not be stable it will start of high and decrease a little bit each month with an annuity you have a constant cashflow in finance you generally operate with three methods of debt repayment annuity fixed cashflow high interest payment in the beginning with small debt payments later it will be reversed serial loan fixed debt payments debt payments are equally spread out accross the period is paid on the remaining debt cash flow will decrease over time because interest payments become smaller for each period standing loan you only pay interest on the loan no debt payments during the period all debt is payed back in the end of the loan in europe it is common practise to combine a 30 year annuity with a 10 year standing loan so that you only pay interest on the loan for the first 10 years thereafter you start paying back the debt and interest the fixed amount each month the annuity this is especially common for first time buyers since they usually have smaller salaries early in life than later and therefore need the additional free cash in the beginning of their adult life

the assumption that house value appreciates 5 per year is unrealistic over the very long term real house prices has stayed approximately constant a house that is 10 years old today is 11 years old a year after so this phenomenon of real house prices staying constant applies only to the market as a whole and not to an individual house unless the individual house is maintained well one house is an extremely poorly diversified investment what if the house you buy turns out to have a mold problem you can lose your investment almost overnight in contrast to this it is extremely unlikely that the same could happen on a well diversified stock portfolio although it can happen on an individual stock thus if non leveraged stock portfolio has a nominal return of 8 over the long term i would demand higher return say 10 from a non leveraged investment to an individual house because of the greater risks if you have the ability to diversify your real estate investments a portfolio of diversified real estate investments is safer than a diversified stock portfolio so i would demand a nominal return of 6 over the long term from such a diversified portfolio to decide if it 's better to buy a house or to live in rental property you need to gather all of the costs of both options including the opportunity cost of the capital which you could otherwise invest elsewhere the real return of buying a house instead of renting it comes from the fact that you do not need to pay rent not from the fact that house prices tend to appreciate which they wo n't do more than inflation over a very long term for my case i live in finland in a special case of near rental property where you pay 15 of the building cost when moving in and get the 15 payment back when moving out and then pay a monthly rent that is lower than the market rent the property is subsidized by government provided loans i have calculated that for my case living in this property makes more sense than purchasing a market priced house but your situation may be different

i would say it actually applies to more readily to things like eating dinner than moral acts the rationalization part need not be a justification it may simply be the narrative your mind creates to give the illusion of agency to the actions you perform   what i was getting at originally though is that most people rationalize emotional decisions after the fact the mark of a higher moral being is one whose rational morals are informed by but ultimately its   emotional instincts    your counterexample of deserved is telling there are two distinct lines of thought in justice punitive and preventative punitive focuses on retribution while preventative focuses on isolation or elimination of an individual from a situation where it can do further harm    i think most punitive measures are at heart an emotional response to a situation or an entity while preventative usually is informed by emotion but ultimately rational this is another division in the potential reasons why someone might cheat a large organization on the emotional side one might live in a dramatically unequal society in which such organizations often blatantly act in a manner which is contrary to all social conditioning we receive from a very young age despite this they thrive this observation might lead to resentment and a sensation that such organizations deserve to be punished for their deeds and a persons deeds might be justified because of this at least in their heads   alternatively one might think that the continued existence of such organizations and the systems which make them successful is a force for human misery and therefore work to lessen their impact and/or ultimately destroy them    i think it is interesting that most people would find the punitive motive for behavior to be childish destructive and immoral in these terms despite this they will happily apply it to individual humans who it is and frustrating to me that people in moments of anger and grief when these observations are most important will not see this even when it is presented to them plainly i chalk it up to the dominance of emotion over reason

here is what i have learned with multiple close encounters with bankruptcies ask yourself what if i save vs what if i spend say you like a new shirt ask yourself what can you do saving $ 40 vs rewarding yourself your well right away you will end up spending just like you the other person needs money he she is doing a work ask yourself what if you are in his her situation you would obviously want others to be happy so spend i think these two should be good i must add that you should not be wasteful eg buying a handmade shoes vs corporation made shoes choose handmade one because it fits above two buying a corporate one would be more polluting and less rewarding because you just gave your money to someone who already has lots and cares least about you in what way are you saying mortgage is good i see that as a waste you can pay back your mortgage only when someone takes even bigger mortgage check with some maths before refuting in other words you have taken part in ponzi scheme i would suggest making a house vs buying one is better spending finally spending is a best saving do n't forget that you are getting money only because someone is spending wisely stop feeding your money to corporates and interests and everyone will have plenty to spend

summary the phrase short sale circuit breaker rule normally refers to the sec 's recent adoption of a new version of the uptick rule the new uptick rule triggers a ban on short selling when the stock drops a certain amount the sec defines the process like this the circuit breaker is triggered for a security any day the price declines by 10 or more from the prior day 's closing price the alternative uptick rule which permits short selling only if the price of the security is above the current national best the rule applies to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day as well as the following day in general the rule applies to all equities 1 the national best bid is usually the bid price that you see in level 1 data    example if a stock closed at $ 100/share on monday the circuit breaker would be triggered if the stock traded at or below $ during tuesday 's session short selling would be disallowed until the start of trading on thursday unless the short sell price is above the national best bid i.e. on an uptick purpose the stated purpose of this rule is promote market stability and preserve investor confidence by restricting potentially abusive short selling from driving prices farther downward during periods of increased volatility and downward price pressure whether or not such rules succeed is a matter of some debate and the sec removed similar uptick rules in 2006 because they modestly reduce liquidity and do not appear necessary to prevent manipulation exceptions there are a few exceptions to the uptick rule that mainly revolve around when the short sell order was placed or when the securities will be delivered

i thought the finance buff made a pretty solid argument for a financial advisor the other day but 1.5 is too expensive the blog post at finance buff suggests several alternatives he also has the great suggestion to use vanguard 's cheap financial planning service if you go with vanguard a lot of investing advice fails to consider the human factor sure it 'd be great to rebalance exactly every 6 months and take precisely the amount of risk to theoretically maximize returns but yeah right it 's well known that in the aggregate individual investors go to cash near market bottoms and then buy near market tops it 's not that they do n't know the right thing to do necessarily it 's just that the emotional aspect is stronger than any of us expect you should n't rely on sticking to your investments any more than you rely on sticking to your diet and exercise program the theoretically optimal solution is not the real world people are involved optimal solution my own blog post on this suggests a balanced fund rather than a financial advisor but i think the right financial advisor could well be a better approach http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ anyway i think people are too quick to think of the main risk as volatility and to think of investing as simple sure in theory it is simple but the main risk is yourself fear at market bottoms greed at market tops laziness the rest of the time so there 's potential value in taking yourself out of the picture the human part is the part that is n't simple on whether to get a financial advisor in general not just for investments see also what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money

paying weekly to be able to have maneuver room under your credit limit is a way to handle low credit limits doing it to boost your credit score when you have no immediate need for a loan is wasting energy   a few months in advance of buying a car or house you can start to worry about your utilization rate when you apply for the loan they will pull your credit file and that will lock in your utilization rates then make sure that you pay the balance quickly and if you need to make a big purchase pay the bill before the account closes for the month keep in mind that if you pay the balance every month the highest utilization rate will occur the day the payment is due this is because it not only has all the purchases from the previous bill but all the purchases you have made since that bill closed for example if you have a credit limit of 10 k and you spend 2 k a month on the credit card on the day the payment is due it is not unusual to see the total owed to be above if they pulled your file on that day your utilization rate would appear to be above 30

what you are describing is a chart of accounts   it 's a structure used by accountants to accounts into sub categories below the standard asset liability income expense structure the actual categories used will vary widely between different people and different companies   every person and company is different whilst you may be happy to have a single expense account called lunch i may want lots of expense accounts to distinguish between all the different restaurants i eat at regularly   companies will often change their chart of accounts over time as they decide they want to capture more or less detail on where a particular type of expense is really being spent all of this makes any attempt to create a standard in the strict sense rather futile   i have worked at a few places where discussions about how to structure the chart of accounts and what referencing scheme to use can be surprisingly heated   you 'll have to come up with your own system but i can provide a few common recommendations if you 're looking for some simple examples to get started with most personal finance software e.g. gnucash will offer to create an example chart of accounts when you first start a session

you could consider turning your current place into a rental property this is more easily done with a fixed rate loan and you said you have an arm the way it would work if you can charge enough rent to cover your current mortgage plus the interest difference on your new mortgage then the income from your rental property can effectively lower the interest rate on your new home    by keeping your current low rate month after month you 'll pay the market rate on your new home but you 'll also receive rental income from your previous home to offset the increased cost granted a lot of your value will be locked up in equity in your former home and not be easily accessible except through a heloc or similar but if you can afford it it is a good possibility

i 'm looking at this because i 'm just wondering what they base their criteria on   how are they splitting their operations to have multiple headquarters especially when both are in the same country it would make more sense if it was in another country although i 'm not sure how they manage their operations maybe they need a move like this etc is one more focused on global operations while the other is on local their hq is on the west coast so would they build a second hq that 's that close to their main base or move it to the east coast to spread it out i 'm just wondering why and what the reasoning is behind a move like this   the impact a move like this makes on the surrounding area is large considering the local economics and jobs etc which was outlined in the post   how will it effect traffic flows including if freight is involved now population concentration commutes etc there 's a lot of stuff to consider talent pools development of the area   i 'm not saying it should or should n't be but just because i have an idea of the surroundings my guess matching their criteria would be va its on the edge of the metro system connected to the major concentrated near engineering and computer science jobs etc off ways to the side to allow easier commutes instead of directly traffic into a city like dc and also near the airport    there are probably similar places all around if you look for it

401(k withdrawals early or otherwise are not subject to fica or medicare taxes   that 's because they already were taxed when they were contributed   and of course the earnings from the 401(k contributions are not earned income and thus are not subject to payroll taxes for that reason while 401(k contributions are exempt from federal and generally state income taxes they are n't exempt from payroll taxes and as such you 'll see two separate amounts on your w2 and paystub if you contributed the amount that is subject to those taxes and the amount that is subject to income tax so no you do n't have to pay payroll fica social security taxes on your early withdrawal   as for the penalty that is basically an extra tax so if you withdraw $ 1000 you pay income tax at your marginal rate plus 10 penalty if your marginal rate is 25 and you 're not moving across a rate step boundary you will pay +

figured it out   vertical spreads significantly reduce the amount of buying power on the account needed vs. buying selling pure calls puts   so even though the transaction fees may more double in some instances it may be worth it in order to operate with underlying instruments spreads are also considered defined risk trades where both the profit and loss are capped per how the spreads are setup   this is compared to single calls puts where either the upside or the downside can be unlimited   so for times when the expected move is not as pronounced a spread may be a better fit depending on environment and other factors

p e ratio is useful but limited as others have said another problem is that it does n't show leverage two companies in the same industry could have the same p e but be differently leveraged in that case i would buy the company with more equity and less debt as it should be a less risky investment to compare companies and take leverage debt into account you could use the ev ebit ratio instead its slightly more complicated to calculate and is n't presented by as many data sources though enterprise value ev can be said to represent the value of the company if someone would buy it today and then pay off all its interest bearing debt ev is essentially calculated like this market capitalization plus cash cash equivalents   minus interest bearing debt   this is then divided by ebit earnings before interest and tax to get the ratio one drawback of this ratio though is that it ca n't be used for financials since their balance sheet pretty much consists of debt and the enterprise value therefore does n't tell us very much also like the p e ratio it is dependent on fresh numbers a balance sheet is just a glimpse of the financial situation on one day and this could and probably will although not drastically for bigger companies change to the next day

an option gives you an option   that is you are n't buying any security you are simply buying an option to buy a security   the sole value of what you buy is the option to buy something an american option offers more flexibility i.e. it offers you more options on buying the stock   since you have more options the cost of the option is higher of course a good example makes sense why this is the case   consider the vix   options on the vix are european style   sometimes the vix spikes like crazy tripling in value in days   it usually comes back down pretty quick though within a couple of weeks   so far out options on the vix are n't worth just a whole lot more because the vix will probably   be back to normal   however if the person could have them right when it got to the top they would have made a fortune many times what their option was worth   since they are style though they would have to wait till their option was redeemable right when the vix would be about back to normal   in this case an american style option would be far more valuable especially for something that is difficult to predict like the vix

companies do not support their stock once the security is out on the wild market its price fluctuates according to what investors think they are worth support is a whole different concept financially speaking support or support level refers to the price level below which historically a stock has had difficulty falling it is the level at which buyers tend to enter the stock so it is the lowest assumed price for that stock once it reaches its price buyers will rush to the stock raising its price the company wants to keep the stock price at acceptable levels as it can be seen as the general view of the company 's health also several employees executives in the company have stock or stock options so it is in their interest to keep their stock price up a bond that goes down in value may indicate a believe the bond issuer government in this case wo n't honor the bond when it matures as for bonds there is a wealth of reading in this site can someone explain how government bonds work who sets the prices on government bonds   basic understanding of bonds values rates and yields

the reason on line savings accounts ally capitalone american express and many others provide much higher rates than brick and mortar banks is because they 're not brick and mortar they do not need to pay for a huge amount of real estate utilities public facing employees inter office mail security etc etc all that allows them to pay more for your money the back office of these banks is the same as that of chase boa or wells fargo its just that they do n't have the enormous expense of having a branch in every neighborhood while still reaching all the same population of depositors so no its not a scam these are reputable banks some have physical offices for example i know that capitalone has some branches in new york some do n't iirc neither ally nor american express federal saving bank have physical branches but they 're banks nonetheless insured as required by fdic or ncua in case of credit unions and provide all the same services for less or all the same savings for more if you will imho giving 0.01 apr is a scam not the other way around the old style banks want your money for free and you 're worried why would someone else treat you better well that 's why the us has one of the most retarded financial systems in the western world

if you are investing for 10 years then you just keep buying at whatever price the fund is at this is called dollar cost averaging if the fund is declining in value from when you first bought it then when you buy more the average price you bought in at is now lower so therefore your losses are lower and when it goes back up you will make more even if it continues to decline in value then you keep adding more money in periodically eventually your position will be so large that on the first uptick you will have a huge percent gain anyway this is only suggested because you are in it for 10 years other people 's investment goals vary

what is never mention was that even though top marginal taxes were high even extreme nobody paid them reagan lowered taxes but also made lots of people pay taxes that had never had to pay them before you could essentially write off losses from a business indefinitely failing to earn money on an investment was also a loss my dad on the advice of an irs tax auditor built a greenhouse and we started selling flowers but it was intended to never make any money it 's sole purpose was to reduce tax liability   these tax shelters were geared as personal tax shelters so what was done to service bigger business was to create what was called holding corporations these corporations would take investors money and basically just sit on it which could then be claimed as a loss but if these spread between bank interest cds paid on the holdings of this corporation and the interest cost of borrowing against those holdings hit a sweet spot they would build a strip mall or something similar this was the trigger to the boom bust when the feds raised lowered the interest rates and had a lot to do with stagflation at the time they would turn key the project and reinvest in holdings people could essentially bring their taxes down as much as they wanted even to zero it just meant that they had to put more money into holding corporations   when reagan changed the tax code to disallow these tax write offs he put lots of very wealthy people in the poor house overnight they went to bed one night and woke up with all their investors wanting their money i know a guy that operated a holding corporation that still cries about it to this day of course he has never really financially recovered either      the point is that what the tax code listed as your top marginal tax had no bearing on what you paid in tax prior to reagan 34 tax was way more than most of these people ever dreamed of paying in taxes prior to reagan

first your professor should learn proper grammar should be why do   second it looks like you 're dealing with synthetic securities you can create a synthetic t bill by doing a combination of long short calls puts   but ignore all that just think about this without the technical jargon we know that the risk free rate is typically what t bills are yielding right and we know that since options are inherently more risky than us government debt investors will demand a higher interest rate to compensate them for the risk so as the risk free rate increases the value of a call will move the same direction otherwise investors would stop dealing with call options and would instead buy safer less risky riskless investments   it 's not really an options question just one of basic finance risk understanding of interest rates etc

it 's not quite clear what you are asking so i 'll answer a few possible interpretations businesses pay taxes on their profits so if your business took a million pounds in revenue e.g. sold a million pounds worth of stuff then you would subtract roughly speaking everything the business spent on making and selling that stuff and pay taxes only on the profit vat however is a different matter and you would have to pay vat on all of that income technically the vat portion is n't even income it 's tax you are forced to collect on behalf of the government if your business made a million pounds pounds profit it would pay tax on all of that million subject to what a tax accountant can do to reduce that which ought to be considerable   you ca n't subtract your personal living expenses like that however the company can pay you a salary which counts as an expense and the company does n't pay tax on that you might also take some money from the company as dividends both salary and dividends count as personal income to yourself and you will need to pay personal income tax on them   as for the ferrari it depends on whether you can justify it as a business expense a lot of companies provide cars for their employees so that they can use them for business however you have to be able to show that is for business otherwise they are taxed like salary the rules for company cars are quite complicated and you would need an accountant if this is a real rather than hypothetical situation definitely get a tax accountant involved

from the way you frame the question it sounds like you more or less know the answer already yes you can make a non deductable contribution to a traditional ira and convert it to a roth ira here is wikipedia 's explanation regardless of income but subject to contribution limits contributions can be made to a traditional ira and then converted to a roth this allows for backdoor contributions where individuals are able to avoid the income limitations of the roth ira there is no limit to the frequency with which conversions can occur so this process can be repeated indefinitely one major caveat to the entire backdoor roth ira contribution process however is that it only works for people who do not have any pre tax contributed money in ira accounts at the time of the backdoor conversion to roth conversions made when other ira money exists are subject to pro rata calculations and may lead to tax liabilities on the part of the converter 9 do note the caveat in the second paragraph this article explains it more thoroughly the irs does not allow to specify which dollars are being converted as they can with shares of stock being sold for the purposes of determining taxes on conversions the irs considers a person ’s non roth ira money to be a single co sum hence if a person has any funds in any non roth ira accounts it is impossible to contribute to a traditional ira and then convert that account to a roth ira as suggested by various pundits and the wikipedia piece referenced above conversions must be performed on a pro rata basis of all ira money not on specific dollars or accounts say you have $ 20k of pre tax assets in a traditional ira and make a non deductable contribution of $ 5k the account is now 80 pre tax assets and 20 post tax assets so if you move $ 5k into a roth ira $ 4k of it would be taxed in the conversion the traditional ira would be left with $ 16k of pre tax assets and $ 4k of post tax assets

the answer is just close your eyes and ignore it in your words i 'm right there with you the amount of detail that i track in my personal finances would be called obscene by some people   but as you look at these features in any accounting application you need to ask the question what does this information represent in the case of your bank and credit card accounts the reconciliation marker represents that you have received documentation from the issuing institution which you have verified against your accounts   marking them off confirms that you have reviewed the information and that you checked for errors    these markers exist on all transactions whichever end of the splits you are looking at   when reviewing the expense side of the transaction it might make less sense to see these reconciliation markers because as you stated nobody receives documentation related to their expenses   however if you itemized your expenses and kept a separate log of certain transactions like a notebook where you track gasoline and/or mileage on your car it might be useful to reconcile your records once a month   checking off individual transactions and verifying a new balance in terms of gas consumed or miles driven would allow you to identify any inconsistencies in your records not everyone would find such an activity useful thus the reconciliation markers are present everywhere but required nowhere

from the card issuer 's point of view the purpose of balance transfers is very simple a credit card company wants you to owe them more money so they will make more profit getting more interest payments from you to do that they will offer an apparently good deal to transfer the debt that you owe to other companies onto their card the deal may look good to you because it offers a low interest rate for a limited time period etc but never forget that its real purpose is to be a good deal for the card company not for you of course credit card companies target these deals at their typical customers they have to tolerate a few smart customers who actually make them no money at all by always paying off their card balance before any interest is due never using their card to draw cash from an atm which has no interest free loan period never using their card for overseas transactions that incur fees and/or poor currency exchange rates etc   your financial objective should be to make yourself one of the customers the card company does n't want but only paying off the minimum balance every month is exactly the wrong way to do that

i 'll be happy to edit when you provide answers to the question i posed in the comments   given the choice and i assume there is no other i 'd take a loan from the 401(k vs a withdrawal   you withdraw $ i 'll assume 25 bracket as you 're planning at least a $ 200 k house hopefully your taxable income is above $ 38 k the 25 line for singles the tax and penalty is 35 total federal you net $ and you have $ 40 k less in the retirement account in 40 years at 10 average growth that 's $ 1.8 m you wo n't have in your 401(k and as littleadv stated no deposits for 6 months meaning no matching there 's a few more thousand you 'll lose   you borrow $ 20k. your 401(k will see a return on the $ 20k that 's better than the short bond account 4 5 vs less than 1 you are short $ 6 k but in return have paid no tax no penalty etc i respect those who are strongly anti loan but even they would agree this is the far lesser of 2 evils    the above is pretty generic there are better choices but your cpa friend 's advice is nearly as bad as it gets by the way the tax you 'll save once you have the mortgage has nothing to do with that 10 penalty say you bought the house with cash as many would be happy to do you 'd pay the penalty for the 401(k withdrawal but have no mortgage deduction if you had the 20 you still have a loan and the deduction but no penalty for taking his bad advice   my advice is to take that refund and use it to pay the loan faster

a savings account and a checking account or a demand account or a transactional account have different regulations   for example fractional reserve requirements are 10 against checking accounts but 0 against savings accounts   the theory is that savings accounts are sticky while checking accounts are hot money so the fed wants to stop banks from creating accounts that are regulated as savings accounts but have the features of checking accounts   in the past this was done by banks to pay interest on checking accounts   they eliminated that rule back in the inflation years and instead imposed the rule that to qualify as a savings accounts for regulatory purposes banks must discourage you from using them as transactional accounts   for example by limiting the number of withdrawals per month that can be made from a savings account if the fed gave up on trying to enforce a distinction i suspect there would soon no longer be a distinction

i do not know the full answer but i know here are some important factors that you need to consider do you have a physical location in the united states are you working directly from canada with a office business location in the united states your tax obligation to the us is much higher most likely you will owe some to the state in which your business is located in payroll tax your employer will likely want to look into payroll tax because in most states the payroll tax threshold is very low they will need to file payroll tax on their full time part time employees as well as contractor soon as the total amount in a fiscal year exceeds the threshold related to do you have a social security number and are you legally entitled to working in the states as an individual you will be receiving the appropriate forms and tax withholding info related to if you do n't have that already you may want to look into how to obtain permissions to conduct business within the united states technically you are a one person consulting service provider you may need to register with a particular state to obtain the permit the agency will also be able to provide you with ample tax   chances are you will really need to piece together multiple information from various sources to resolve this one as the situation is specific to start look into consulting service contractor work permit and tax info for the state your client is located in work from state level up to kick start your research then research federal level which can be more complex as it is technically international business service for canada us

see publication 505 specifically the section on annualized income installment method which says if you do not receive your income evenly throughout the year for example your income from a repair shop you operate is much larger in the summer than it is during the rest of the year your required estimated tax payment for one or more periods may be less than the amount figured using the regular installment method the publication includes a worksheet and explanation of how to calculate the estimated tax due for each period when you have unequal income   if you had no freelance income during a period you should n't owe any estimated tax for that period however the process for calculating the estimated tax using this method is a good bit more complex and confusing than using the short method in which you just estimate how much tax you will owe for the year and divide it into four equal pieces   therefore in future years you might want to still use the equal payments method if you can swing it   it 's too late for this year since you missed the april deadline for the first payment   if you can estimate the total amount of freelance income you 'll receive even though you might not be able to estimate when you 'll receive it you can probably still use the simpler method   if you really have no idea how much money you 'll make over the year you could either use the more complex computation or you could use a very high estimate to ensure you pay enough tax and you 'll get a refund if you pay too much

i think you 're missing several key issues here first for the facts ira contributions are $ 5500 a year maximum currently it changes with inflation i.e. you can not deposit $ 10 k in an ira account in a single year ira withdrawals can only be made if you have something liquid in the ira you can not withdraw from lending club ira unless you manage to sell the notes currently held by you there roth ira is funded with after tax money and you can withdraw your deposits in roth ira any time for any reason no 10 k limit there only limited by what you deposited however the main thing you 're missing is this you can withdraw up to $ 10 k from your ira for first home purchase without penalty pay attention not without tax but without penalty so what is the point in depositing $ 10k into ira just to withdraw it the next year

firstly you mean resistance not support as a support is below the current price and resistance is above the price secondly using a ma as support or resistance would mean that that support or resistance level would move up or down as the price moved up or down and would not be static at $ 25 generally stocks will range trade more often than they will be trending either up or down so a stock can be range trading between a support and resistance levels for months and even years and usually the longer it range trades for the bigger the outbreak either up or down will be when it does happen using a ma especially shorter dated ones as support or resistance or as a up or down trend line works better when a stock is already trending up or down when a stock is moving sideways it will tend to keep crossing above and below the ma and you will be if you try to use them as your trigger for entry in these situations compare the two charts below   in the first chart the stock is up trending for over 6 months and the ema is being used as a support or up trending line as long as the price does not break through and close under the ema then the uptrend continues you could use this ema line as a means of entering the stock when prices move towards the ema and bounce off it back up again or you could use it as your stop loss level so if price closes below the ema line you would sell your position   in the second chart the stock has been range trading between the support line at about $ and the resistance line at about $ for 10 months in this case the price has been moving above and below the ema during these 10 months and you may have been many times if you were trading each break above or below the ema a better strategy here would be to buy the stock as it approached the support line and bounces up off it and then close and reverse your position go short when the price approached the resistance line and bounces down off it   edit when range trading you would have your stops just below the support line when going long and just above the resistance line when going short that way if it does break through support or resistance and starts trending you will be covered so this shows that different strategies should be used when a stock is trending to when it is range trading mas are better used as entry signal during an established uptrend or downtrend than when a stock is range trading

i see a lot of answers with incomes that are much higher than yours here is something for your situation if you would keep your current income for the rest of your life here is approximately how things would turn out after 40 years all interest is calculated relative to the amount in your portfolio therefore lets start with 1 dollar for 40 years with your current income 15 would be dollar at 12 this would over 40 years get you almost 1 million dollar i would call a required return of more than 12 not likely the good news is that your income will likely increase and especially if this happens fast things will start to look up   the bad news is that your current salary is quite low so it basically means that you need to make some big jumps in the next few years in order to make this scenario likely if you can quickly move your salary towards ranges that are more common in the us then 15 of your income can build up to a million before you retire however if you just follow gradual growth you would need to get quite lucky to reach a million   note that even if reaching a million appears unlikely it is probably still a good idea to save

the cleanest way to accomplish this is to make the purchase of your new house contingent on the sale of your old one   your offer should include that contingency and a date by which your house needs to sell to settle the contract    there will also likely be a clause that lets the seller cancel the contract within a period of time like 24 48 hours if another offer is received   this gives you the buyer at least an opportunity to either sell the house or come up with financing to complete the deal for example suppose you make an offer to buy a house for $ 300,000 contingent on the sale of your house which the seller accepts   in the meantime the seller gets an offer of $ in cash no contingency   the seller has to notify you of the offer and give you some time to make good on your offer either by selling your house or obtaining $ 300,000 in financing   if you can not the seller can accept the cash offer this is just a hypothetical example the offer can have whatever clauses you agree to but since sale contingencies benefit the buyer the seller will generally want some compensation for that benefit e.g. a larger offer or some other clause that benefits them or do i find a house to buy first set a closing date far out and then use that time to sell my current one most sellers will not want to set a closing date very far out   contingency clauses are far more common in short yes it 's possible and any competent realtor should be able to handle it   it also may mean that you have to either make a higher offer to compensate for the contingency and to dissuade the seller from entertaining other offers or sell your home for less than you 'd like to get the cash sooner   you can weigh those costs against the cost of financing the new house until yours sells

with 150 k € to invest to become a landlord you have several options pay for 100 of one property and you then will make a significant percentage of the monthly rent as profit each month that profit can be used to invest in other things or to save to buy additional properties at the end of the 21 years in your example you can sell the flat for return of principal minus selling expenses or even better make a profit because the property went up in value pay 20 down on 5 flats and then make a much a smaller profit per flat each month due to the mortgage payment for each one at the end of the 21 years sell the flats assuming that a significant portion of the mortgage is paid off each flat will sell for more than the mortgage balance thus you will have 5 nice large profits when you sell something in between 1 and 5 flats each has different risks and expenses with 5 rental properties you are more likely to use a management company which will add to your monthly cost

as i understand it us federal gift tax does n't kick in at all until one person gives more than about $ 14,000 in a single year so a couple can give someone $ 28,000 if you want to give more than that in a lump sum while avoiding gift tax one workaround is to structure it as an intra family loan basically you write and formally register a loan for the amount then gift them with up to the limit for them to pay off that loan the irs requires that you charge interest on this loan but the rates are pretty minimal and of course you can incorporate that in the gift the downside is that the interest income you 're required to take is taxable but that 's a small sum on the other hand if the loan is a mortgage against real property and properly filed as such the interest paid may be deductable for the person you 're giving the money to doing this properly requires a tax accountant or lawyer who has a clue about the right legalese to make it work however there are starting to be some services which specialize in this doing it for a fixed fee i used one of those recently which is why i 'm somewhat familiar with this process they made it about as much of a fill out the forms process as they could but it still took a few weeks for me to figure out which options were best for my needs

making a profit in trading is not a function of time it 's a function of information speed and consistency regardless of how much time you spend learning about trading there is no guarantee that you will ever become profitable because you will always be competing against a counter party who is either or more poorly informed than you are   since trading is a zero sum game someone is always a winner and someone else is always a loser so you need to be either better informed than your counter party or you need to be as well informed as them but beat them to the punch you also need to be able to be consistent or else eventually you will get wiped out when the unexpected happens or you make a mistake this is why resources such as full time professional analysts high speed trading terminals platforms and sophisticated algorithms can provide significant advantages personally i think that people with talent and those kinds of resources would take all my lunch money so i do n't trade and stick to passive investing one funny story i once knew a trader who was in the money on a particular trade and went out to have a drink to celebrate the next day she remembered that she had forgotten to exercise the options luckily they had expired while in the money and by rule had been exercised automatically as a result

as others have noted in the u.s. a checking account gives you the ability to write a check while a savings account does not i think you know what a check is even if you do n't use them right let me know if you need an explanation personally i rarely write paper checks any more i have an account for a small side business and i have n't bothered to get new checks printed since i moved 6 years ago even though the checks still have my old address because i 've only written i think 3 paper checks on that account in that time   from the bank 's point of view there are all sorts of government regulations that are different for the two types of accounts but that is probably of little concern to you unless you own a bank if the software you have bought allows you to do the things you need to do regardless of whether you call the account savings or checking then who cares i doubt that the banking software police will come to your house and beat you into and arrest you because you labeled an account checking that you were supposed to label savings if one account type does what you need to do and the other does n't then use the one that works

there 's a bit of confusion here   michael 's article you linked is focused on the issue of post tax 401(k deposits for those new to this it sounds like we are talking about roth 401(k money not so the roth ira was introduced in 1998 and the roth 401(k in 2006 before 06 people had the ability to deposit more to their 401(k than the pretax limit of $ 15,000 into the account as after tax deposits my understanding is that these funds were analogous to the non deducted ira deposits for those outside the income limits   michael goes on the point out that now with the addition of roth 401(k and roth iras there are folk with pre and post tax 401(k funds and trying to crack them for transfer to traditional ira and roth ira may be problematic   aside from a recent thread here there are separate accounts for the roth 401(k and traditional 401(k and it 's possible for the traditional to contain post tax money which given the recent introduction of the roth 401(k conversion should be easily

you have no idea where interest rates will go   a year or two ago people thought 3 was absurdly low why buy them   and then interest rates dropped even further so the people who bought then got more interest and the present value went up since then   if you 'd done nothing you would have lost money   now rates are really absurdly low   what do   well they could drop even more   it 's possible   we could also have 20 years of see japan   sitting on your hands loses money   what else should you do   put your money in risky equities   a lot of people these days are buying dividend paying stocks now   it 's extremely foolhardy to treat stocks as fixed income because they are very far from it   yourself and taking on too equity risk imo is far more risky than accepting low interest rate risk   finally i do n't exactly use bonds to make money i use it as a safe haven while i wait for stocks to do something   stocks go up i sell some and buy bonds   bonds go up i sell them and buy more stock   it 's nice to get a little interest on the side but not critical   i could use cash or but i 'm comfortable with the amount of risk return that 5 bonds provide

my question is how do you rebuild a home without the money to rebuild the home i thought that was why we paid for insurance the reason that you have insurance is so as to keep the mortgage lender from losing money   that 's why you buy the insurance through the mortgage lender and they get paid   without the insurance you 'd have no home but still have a mortgage   you 'd either have to pay off a mortgage with no house or have to declare bankruptcy to shed the mortgage    you essentially have two paths   if you or the builder suppliers can afford to float the cost you can rebuild the original house   you 'll eventually get the $ and can pay off the builder and suppliers   this may involve taking out a construction mortgage to refinance the original mortgage   presumably the construction mortgage would be with a different lender    the other path is that you can sell the existing property as is and use the insurance and proceeds to pay off the existing mortgage   then you 'd have no house and no mortgage   you start over and buy a house with a mortgage    it 's possible that your insurance payoff is n't enough to pursue either path   then your option is to get the insurer to make a bigger payoff   this may involve suing them   note that you may be able to talk the government into suing the insurer for you   they do have regulators who can review things   if you ca n't get government action there are lawyers who will do the suing and take their fees out of their winnings

credit card interest rates are obscene try to find some other kind of loan for the furnishings if you put things on the card try to pay them off as quickly as possible i should say that for most people i do recommend having a credit card hotels car rental agencies and a fair number of other businesses expect to be able to guarantee your reservation by taking the card info and it is much harder to do business with them without one it gives you a short term emergency fund you can tap and then immediately pay back or as close to immediately as possible credit cards are one of the safer ways to pay via internet since they have guarantees that limit your liability if they are misused and the bank can help you charge back to a vendor who does n't deliver as promised and if you have the self discipline to pay the balance due in full every month they can be a convenient alternative to carrying a checkbook or excessive amounts of cash but there are definitely people who have n't learned how to use this particular tool without hurting themselves remember that it needs to be handled with respect and appropriate caution

quantitative easing explained the short of it is that you 're right the fed or another country 's central bank is basically creating a large amount of new money which it then injects into the economy by buying government and institutional debt this is in fact one of the main jobs of the central bank for a currency to manage the money supply which in most fiat systems involves slowly increasing the amount of money to keep the economy growing if there is n't enough money moving around in the economy it 's reflected in a slowdown in gdp growth while controlling inflation the devaluation of a unit of currency with respect to most or all things that unit will buy including other currencies inflation 's primary cause is defined quite simply as too many dollars chasing too few goods when demand is low for cash because you have a lot of it while demand for goods is high the suppliers of those goods will increase their price for the goods because people are willing to pay that higher price and will also produce more with quantitative easing the central bank is increasing the money supply by several percentage points of gdp much higher than is normally needed this normally would cause the two things you mentioned inflation inflation 's primary cause is too many dollars chasing too few goods when money is easy to get and various types of goods and services are not people bid up the price on these things to get them this usually happens when sellers see high demand for a product and increase the price to take advantage and to prevent a shortage this often happens across the board in a situation like this but there are certain key drivers that can cause other prices to increase things like the price of oil which affects transportation costs and thus the price to have anything shipped anywhere whether it be the raw materials you need or the finished product you 're selling with the injection of so much money into the economy rampant inflation would normally be the result however there are other variables at play in this particular situation chief among them is that no matter how much cash is in the economy most of it is being sat on in the form of cash or other safe havens like durable commodities gold and t debt so most of the money the fed is injecting into the economy is not chasing goods it 's repaying debt savings and generally being hoarded by consumers and institutions as a hedge against the poor economy in addition despite how many dollars are in the economy right now those dollars are in high demand all around the world to buy treasury debt one of the biggest safe havens in the global market right now so much so that buying t debt is considered saving this is why the yields on treasury bonds and notes are at historic lows it 's bad everywhere and u.s. government debt is one of the surest things in the world market especially now that euro bonds have become suspect currency devaluation this is basically specialized inflation when there are more dollars in the market than people want to have in order to use to buy our goods and services demand for our currency the medium of trade for our goods and services drops and it takes fewer euros yen or yuan to buy a dollar this can happen even if demand for our dollars inside our own borders is high and is generally a function of our trade situation if we 're buying more from other countries than they are from us then our dollars are flooding the currency exchange markets and thus become cheaper because they 're easy to get again there are other variables at play here that keep our currency strong first off again it 's bad everywhere nobody 's buying anything from anyone relatively speaking and so the relative trade deficits are n't moving much in addition devaluation without inflation is self if currency devalues but inflation is low the cheaper currency makes the things that currency can buy cheaper which encourages people to buy them at the same time the more expensive foreign currency increases the cost in dollars of foreign made goods all of this can be beneficial from a money policy standpoint devaluation makes american goods cheaper to americans and to foreign consumers alike than foreign goods and so a policy that puts downward pressure on the dollar but does n't make inflation a risk can help american manufacturing and other producer businesses china knows this just as well as we do and for decades has been artificially fixing the exchange rate of the b yuan lower than its true value against the dollar meaning that no matter how cheap american goods get on the world market chinese goods are still cheaper because by definition the yuan has greater purchasing power for the same cost in dollars in addition dollars are n't only used to buy american made goods and services the u.s. has positioned its currency over the years to be an international medium of trade for several key commodities like oil and the primary currency for global lenders like the imf and the world bank that means that dollars become necessary to buy these things and are received from and must be repaid to these institutions and thus the dollar has a built in demand pretty much regardless of our trade deficits   on top of all that a lot of countries base their own currencies on our dollar by basically buying dollars using other valuable media like gold or oil and then holding that cash in their own central banks as the store of value backing their own paper money this is called a dollar board their money becomes worth a particular fraction of a dollar by definition and that relationship is very precisely with 10 billion dollars in the vault and 20 billion issued from 's central bank a is worth $ .50 print an additional 20 billion and the value of one decreases to $ .25 buy an additional 10 billion dollars and the 's value increases again to $ .50 quite a few countries do this mostly in south america again creating a built in demand for u.s. dollars and also tying the u.s. dollar to the value of the exports of that country if 's goods become highly demanded by europe and its currency increases relative to the dollar then the u.s. dollar gets a boost because by definition it is worth an exact fixed number of and also because a country with a dollar board typically has no problem accepting dollars as payment and then printing to maintain the exchange rate

perhaps buying some internationally exchanged stock of china real estate companies it 's never too late to enter a bubble or profit from a bubble after it bursts as a native chinese my observations suggest that the bubble may exist in a few of the most populated cities of china such as beijing shanghai and the price does n't seem to be much higher than expected in cities further within the mainland such as and i myself is living in i did a post about the urban housing cost of at the end of last year it may give you a rough idea of the pricing level the average of 5,500 cny per square meter condo has n't fluctuated much since the posting of the entry but you need to pay about 1,000 to 3,000 higher to get something desirable for location just search china in google maps = = = = = = = = = = = i actually have no idea how you a foreigner can safely and easily profit from this i 'll just share what i know it 's really hard to financially enter china to prevent speculative funds from freely entering and leaving china the admin of forex has laid down a range of rigid policies regarding currency exchange by law any native individual such as me is imposed of a maximum of $ 50,000 that can be converted from usd to cny or the other way around per year and a maximum of $ 10,000 per day larger chunks of exchange must get the written consent of the admin of forex or it will simply not be cleared by any of the banks in china even hsbc that 's not owned by china however you can circumvent this limit by using the social id of your immediate relatives when submitting exchange requests it takes extra time and effort but viable however things may change drastically should china be in a forex crisis or simply war you may not be able to withdraw usd at all from the banks in china even with a positive balance that 's your own money my whole income stream are usd which is wired monthly from us to bank of china i purchased a property in the middle of last year that 's worth cny using the funds i exchanged from usd i had earned it 's a down payment on a mortgage loan of 20 years in cny not usd the current household loan rate is across the entire china however because this is my first property it is discounted by 30 to to encourage the first house purchase there will be no more discounts of loan rate for the 2nd property and so forth to discourage speculative stocking that drives the price high the apartment i bought in july of 2009 can easily be sold at 300,000 now some of the earlier buyers have enjoyed much more appreciation than i do to give you a rough idea a house bought in 2006 is now evaluated 100 more one bought in 2008 now 50 more and one bought in the beginning of 2009 now 25 more

with near zero marginal cost and infinite supply your prices are going to be decided by entry cost competition and what the market will bear generally speaking though there are no accurate models for getting these kinds of optimal prices in advance your best bet is to test experiment and then build a business and market specific model based on what you observe   look at the steam network as an example they are in the business of selling 0 marginal cost software games in a market with a significant but quickly decreasing entry cost and with solid competition despite being around for years in a mature market they 're still discovering unexpected optimal price points when testing how their customers behave

yes if you do it as a hobby as it 's still income but it should be something you can offset against tax either way you should n't be doing this as you you should either register as self employed or create a company you register this income as self employed income or income of the company and offset the expenses of running the server against tax in the uk companies or self employed people which are basically companies pay tax on profit not income unless vat applies in which case they 're basically just passing the vat on for their customers since you 're not making a profit over the whole year even if some months are profitable you will pay no tax

you can contribute to a traditional ira instead of a roth   the main difference is a contribution to a roth is made with after tax money but at retirement you can withdraw the money tax free   with a traditional ira your contribution is tax deductible but at retirement the withdrawal is not tax free   this is why most people prefer a roth if they can contribute you can also contribute to your work 's 401k plan assuming they have one   and you can always save for retirement in a regular account

first of all i agree with both the conclusion in the question and ’s answer avoid funds or stockmarket based instruments given the short timescale and need to draw an income however i think looking at savings accounts only is missing a trick at the moment there are several current accounts that pay > 2 interest on balances the size of which you ’re proposing the list of which accounts are offering which rates conditions at which point in time will vary so here is a link to a good source of regularly   updated information   there are some conditions but the best interest rate on offer that is n't limited to one year appears to be 3 much better than the leading instant access savings account

good subs to research icos i am all for cryptocurrencies and their usage but i believe icos are an unfettered bubble no one can raise millions in seconds from sources without it being a pump and dump scheme or a pretty well advertised product that everyone wants a piece i.e. an ipo with a roadshow but without the hassle of investment bankers or share placement or underwriting   laying out my thoughts in case you see any glaring faults right there if not sources would be appreciated

every company has stocks    for the stocks to be traded via some stock exchange the companies must follow the eligibility criteria and guidelines once done these are then listed on the stock exchange and can be traded the advantage amongst others of listing is liquidity and stocks can easily be bought and sold   some small companies or closely held companies may not want to list on stock exchange and hence are not traded this does not mean they ca n't be bought and sold they can be outside of the market however the deals are complex and every deal has to be worked out during the course of time a stock that is traded on a stock exchange would either fail to meet the criteria or voluntarily choose not to be traded and follow the delisting process either by stock exchange or by company after this the stocks are no longer traded on the exchange

standard nfc for payments reads a straight copy of the card details does not generate any one time use card number does not employ any over the air encryption or even a challenge response system the normal contactless payment process does involve transaction specific signatures   however what process is used depends on the vendor equipment and the scheme visa mastercard amex a mode if supported allows the card number and expiry date to be read there is a good description at which covers magnetic stripe mode and emv mode etc for each scheme mastercard visa etc do things differently mastercard contactless mastercard transactions can be performed in either emv mode or mag stripe mode after entry point has initiated a transaction the mastercard kernel issues a get processing options command in the response from the card a data object called the application interchange profile determines whether the transaction will continue in either emv mode or mag stripe mode the also determines if on device cardholder verification is supported emv mode m chip the commands exchanged with the card for emv mode closely resemble those used for an emv contact transaction with read record commands being used to retrieve all the card data followed by a generate application request to obtain a unique transaction specific from the card once all of these exchanges have been completed the card can be removed from the rf field however unlike for contact transactions not all the transaction processing occurs before the card exchanges have been completed this is to the contactless transaction performance by reducing the amount of time the card is required to remain in the rf field my emphasis according to visa uk our technology uses the chip on your card to generate unique that ’s techie speak for a type of puzzle that consists of a short piece of encrypted or encoded text and digital signatures to protect your payments digital signatures are like handwritten signatures in some ways but they are much more difficult to forge my emphasis according to the uk card association a fraudster can steal my details from my contactless card fact you have to be extremely close to someone for their gadget to be able to read your card and even then all they would ever get is the card number and expiry date that ’s the same information you see by simply looking at the front of any card there ’s no way anyone can get the security code on the back of the card your name and address or bank account details the vast majority of online retailers require additional details like these and others to make a purchase however according to a guardian newspaper report of 2015 07 25 researchers bought cheap widely available card scanners from a mainstream website to see if they could steal key details from a contactless card they tested 10 different credit and debit cards that were meant to be coded to mask personal data and were able to read crucial data that was meant to be hidden it then went shopping with the information it had obtained and was able to successfully place orders for items including a £ 3,000 television set so yes even in the civilized world our security is undermined by a combination of how does apple pay work see apple pay must be using the mag stripe mode of the emv contactless specifications clearly apple pay must following the emv contactless specifications of books and for mastercard visa and american express transactions respectively more specifically it must be following what i called above the mobile phone profile of the contactless specifications it must be implementing the contactless mag stripe mode since magnetic stripe infrastructure is still prevalent in the us it may or may not be implementing contactless emv mode today but will probably implement it in the future as the infrastructure for supporting payments with contact cards is phased in over the next year in the us

i live in one of the highest cost of living areas in my country   for the cost of less than half the down payment my spouse and i have saved up for a house we could easily buy a home in most of the lower cost of living areas and several homes in say detroit as for the rest of your question though we 've chosen not to live that way   because like all high cost of living areas ours is near a city there are more free and inexpensive things to do than you would think at first   while others in our area think a great time is pre gaming drinks at a nice bar an expensive restaurant then some more drinks we 've taught ourselves how to make great meals from scratch using sale and inexpensive ingredients from the grocery store and often do that on weekends topped off by a movie from the that we promptly return the next day   we have chosen friends who will hang out with us over dinners and board games instead of out on the town   on weekend days we visit free do hikes wander around downtown strips or play at the local parks   our groceries as i mentioned are sale items or use coupons and we go for less expensive meats and produce   we visit our local farmer 's market for fun not to buy the expensive produce   we might find ourselves wandering through the mall to window shop but when it comes time to actually buy clothing or goods for the apartment we shop around for up to months to find a good deal plenty of our friends have money enough to spend and the most debt they are usually in is a big car payment no consumer debt   at the same time i have trouble imagining some of them buying a house any time soon because they simply ca n't be saving all that much since i know their incomes   they may eventually be able to afford a condo and ride rising housing prices to a and then a house it 's what lots of people do around here loosing buckets money in realtor fees and closing costs along the way   even with these choices it 's hard to view my friends as selfish knowing that most of them give around 10 of their income to charity there are probably plenty of people around here swimming in debt somebody recently asked in a q&a with the local paper editors how she could stop going to the city 's most expensive restaurants and start living within her means when she only liked expensive places but lots of folks can stretch themselves and afford to get by while wasting a lot of money   it 's not what my spouse and i have chosen to do because we want to be able to live very responsibly and plan for a rainy day but the longer you live with and around the money that tends to high cost of living areas the more it will seem normal to you also if it 's really $ 1000/mo for a 2 br apartment your cost of living is still lower than mine is if i were you i would n't try to myself to the habits of your surroundings   instead i 'd find friends who are frugal and work on maintaining your good financial habits   if you ever want one of those $ 4 $ 5 or $ 6 k plus houses you 're going to need them

why does the rising price of a bond pushes it 's yield down the bond price and its yield are linked if one goes up the other must go down this is because the cash flows from the bond are fixed predetermined the market price of the bond fluctuates now what if people are suddenly willing to pay more for the same fixed payments it must mean that the return i.e. the yield will be lower here we see that risk associated with the bonds in question has    skyrocketed and thus bonds returns has skyrocketed too am i right the default risk has increased yes now i assume that bonds price is determined by the market issued by    a state traded at the market is that correct correct as long as you are talking about the market price then who determines bonds yields i mean is n't it fixed or in the    ft quote above they are talking about the yields for the new bonds    issued that particular month the yield is not fixed the cash flows are yield is the internal rate of return see my answer above to your first question

if something in any transaction in life financial or otherwise make you feel comfortable and the choice is between saving money with one thing versus another do n’t sell your personal needs short pay more elsewhere that treats you the way you expect to be treated in the long run the $ $ $ you save in a cheaper transaction might cost you more in the headaches and annoyance you have to swallow in dealing with this bargain in the future your question is this do his sales tactics indicate other underlying problems how can i deal effectively with those tactics and you state this as well to make a long story short the dealer 's aggressive sales tactics have made me somewhat uncomfortable and finally ask how can i deal effectively with those tactics okay first and foremost if you feel discomfort in anything in life not just a financial situation just walk away you might have to say no when doing this but it ’s not always the case you will have to counter aggression with aggression and specifically in the case of a purchase like this you need to also ask yourself is this discount being offered me worth the headache i am getting at the end of the day money is meaningless and has it ’s main worth as an economic motivator someone has a need and someone else has something that can solve that need what would it take for the side of need to connect to the side of solution to that need this is the basic concept surrounding all economics so that said i have personally avoided buying things for less money and paid slightly more elsewhere for a service experience that made me feel comfortable at the end of the day if you feel happy in the transaction it helps in the long run more than let ’s say the $ 20 to $ 40 you save by buying from someone else also on the side of customer service this person ’s sales techniques sound like something out of a very old fashioned sales playbook nowadays it ’s all about relationships and service the immediate sale is not as important for competent and reputable businesses because they know a better customer service experience will bring people back so it does n’t matter how long this guy has been in business it could be that he ’s been in business a long time just because he has been in business a long time that said and in the case of musical instruments maybe this guy is really good at care and upkeep of instruments but has crappy sales techniques keep that in mind as well and just push back on their sales methods for things like musical instruments people might be jerks on the sales side but in the maintenance and repair side they are great will you need to go to them if when your instrument needs repair or you do n’t care at the end of the day go with your gut and if your gut says no then just go somewhere else and spend your money on an item you like from a place that treats you the way you need

there are a few ways to get money from property but i 'm not sure any would work for you 1 firstly you could sell it selling the building might require enough repairs that the building is if the repair costs are too high you might not be able to recover costs from selling for a particularly old and building this is more likely to be the case in extreme scenarios you may earn more net profit by a building and simply selling the land make sure you are n't setting your price too high if you are desperate to sell dropping your price might make the headache of upkeep go away and might be better for you financially in the long run 2 you could rent it but if it is so you ca n't sell it then this is unlikely without repairs and it seems you do n't want to do this anyway 3 if your building is in an area where the zoning laws are not strict you may be able to apply for a permit to have it for commercial use and either run a business out of it or rent it to someone else to do so again this would be dependent on repairs if the building is and also would require the building to well situated for a business 4 you could take out a mortgage on the building of course this has two big caveats a the bank would need to assess the building for value and it seems not to be worth much in your case and b this provides only temporary cash which you would need to pay back to the bank over time in some cases if you had a solid plan you might be able to take a mortgage out against the value of the land and use the cash from the mortgage to do some repairs so that it would be in good shape for selling

given that the laws on consumer liability for unauthorized transactions mean no cost in most cases the cvv is there to protect the merchant   typically a merchant will receive a lower cost from their bank to process the transaction with the cvv code versus without as far as the netflix case goes or any other recurring billing for that matter they would n't care as much about it because visa mc amex regulations prohibit storage of the cvv   so if they collect it then it 's only used for the first transaction and just use the rest of the card info name expiration date address does the presence of cvv indicate the merchant has better security   maybe maybe not   it probably means they care about their costs and want to pay the bank as little as possible to process the transaction

yup   it 's important to note that modern soft contact lenses let through 10 times as much oxygen as the original hard contacts that were in use 20 years ago   the company you referenced that 's actually owned run by the original inventor of soft contact daily lenses   he started it up because he was outraged at the prices being charged by the big name vendors who had licensed his patent   his story is here     two important things about re using dailies   1 do n't leave dailies in overnight buy solution and take them out and wash them each night   it really makes a difference in terms of complication rates   you do n't have to fill the contact holders up to the top not even to the internal line but make sure the contacts are covered   the latter will save you half on solution   when i 'm on a wilderness trip i will wear my contacts through every other night because trying to wash my hands completely and the sanitary conditions well it 's just less risk and trouble imho than handling my contacts with potentially not quite perfectly clean hands   2 do n't use a single pair more than 2 or 3 weeks   the risk of infections and complications gets too high using a single pair of general soft contacts around the one month mark   this is my recollection of what a medical doctor at an er near a university posted online 10 years ago   you see university kids are far more likely prone to over use a pair and he found that all the kids coming to his nearby er with eye infections had worn soft contacts for one month or more   also if you 're taking them out at night and using solution as i strongly recommend you do at the two week part the cost of daily contacts matches the cost of the solution you are using   so wearing a pair any longer than 2 weeks does n't actually save you much more money

try and bring with you a folder full of evidence about your skills and accomplishments many of the top blue chip companies do what 's called evidence based interviewing and it means you provide evidence to back up your assertions about how great you are so for example the interviewer asks how you get on with your colleagues and you provide an email thanking you for being a great team player or they ask you about research and you show them a piece of research you did of course this is harder when you go for your first job but bring what you can as an alternative and/or alongside this you can use stories as someone else said as a kind of evidence if you do n't have any physical evidence your story should show systematically how you handled a situation to get a good outcome   if they are a very conservative company they will want you to show that although you can kind of think outside the box you are not prone to emotional reactions or knee jerk responses and everything you do is carefully thought out and would n't bring them into if it got covered on the front page of a newspaper   good luck

nobody is going to stop you if you want to try that but you should keep in mind that you have to invest a lot in getting the best hardware you can lay your hands on best fail safe connectivity to the exchanges best trading algorithms and software that money can buy and loads of other stuff this all needs quite a big amount of upfront investment without guaranteeing returns that is why you see institutions with deep pockets i.e. banks and trading firms only involve themselves in hft

agree 100 with every post you made in this thread with a caveat   the traditional internet consumer advertiser provider model is heading to an existential crisis we have total information overload most people do n't even use facebook ads once through their whole facebook career google the originator of the model has its adwords roots   i do n't think we 'll actually pay for shows we 're way too cheap to do that but advertising is going to need to be revolutionized if it can maintain the status quo   completely misses the point it 's not about computer screens vs. tv 's it 's not tv vs internet the fundamental conflict is in the changing revenue flow in shows and movies i do n't care for season if hulu has them tomorrow when i have more time because these shows are paid for by advertisers providers must change their source of revenue or come up with new ways to entice consumers

the wording of this question is very confusing because primary signer would in ordinary parlance mean the person borrowing the money and the co signer not would mean the one who is guaranteeing the repayment of the loan if the borrower does not pay the co signer is liable for making the payments whose name is on the title of the car who borrowed the money to buy the car is the loan in your name and your son co signed the loan to induce the bank to loan you money to purchase the car or is it the other way around that your son borrowed the money and you co signed the loan in order to induce the bank to loan your son the money if the car title and the loan are in your name are you defaulting on the loan and so your son is making the loan payments that should have come from you or is it that your son borrowed the money to buy the car his name is on the title he is making the payments and you are no longer interested in backing him up in case he defaults and the bank comes after you for the money

the united states federal reserve has decided that interest rates should be low they think it may help the economy the details matter little here though it will enforce this low rate by buying treasury bonds at this very low interest rate bonds are future money so this means they pay a lot of money up front for very little interest in the future the fed will pay more than anyone who offers less money up front so they can set the price as long as they 're willing to buy at the end of the day treasury bonds pay nearly no interest    since there 's little money to be made with treasuries people who want better than zero returns will bid up the current price of any other bonds or similar loan like instruments to get what whatever rate of return that they can there 's really no more than one price for money you can think of the price of those bonds as basically treasury rate + some based on the risk percent   i realize thinking about bond prices is weird and different than other prices you 're measuring future money using present money and it 's easy to be confused and assure you it ultimately makes sense anyway your savings account money has to compete with everyone else willing to lend money to banks everyone else lends money for peanuts so you get peanuts on your savings account too your banking is probably worth more to your bank on account of your check card payment processing fees collected from the merchant than from the money they make lending out your savings notice how many places have promotional rates if you make your direct deposits or use your check card to make a purchase n times a month   in europe it 's similar except you 've got a different central bank if europe 's bank operated radically differently for an extended period of time you 'd expect to see a difference in the exchange rates which would ultimately make the returns from investing in those currencies pretty similar as well such a change may show up domestically as inflation in the country with the loose money policy and internationally as weakness against other currencies there 's really only one price for money around the entire world any difference boils down to a   difference in perceived risk

usually if the property is part of a strata then the water rates get sent to the owner each quarter to pay and the usage for the whole complex is paid by the strata so in this type of situation your tenant would not have to pay any water usage if for some reason as you mentioned your unit although part of a strata complex is individually and you receive a water bill for both water rates and water usage then the tenant would be liable to pay the water usage portion this can usually be arranged by either giving the tenant a copy of the water bill with the amount of usage payable or with the water company to separately sending the tenant the usage part of the bill as you had a real estate agent managing agent looking after your property at the time when the water usage was not being paid by the tenant it would have been their responsibility to either recoup this money from the tenant or organise with the water to send the usage part of the bill to the tenants that is part of the service you were paying them for you may need to check with fair trading in your state to find out who you should be going after for this money the tenant or the real estate agent in nsw you have 6 months after the lease has ended to take the tenants to tribunal to recoup owing money i do n't know how long it is after end your agreement with the real estate agent to pursue them   the case may be that you start with the tenant and if that does n't work then try with the real estate agent of course you may want to contact your old tenants first to see if they are reasonable and agree to back pay the water usage after you showing them copies of the water bills the tribunal will ask if you have tried to the matter first anyway then there is the matter of how much the water usage amounts to and whether it is worth chasing both the tenants and the real estate agent paying the tribunal application fees and taking time off work to attend the tribunal

i can safely assume that a credit union or a bank probably a bank based on the size of the short term loan would allow use of the annuity as collateral for the loan since the future payouts from the annuity will more than cover the total costs coming due for your education i 'm sure the bank will have no problem loaning the money and you can see if doing a direct payment monthly to them will reduce the rate you can try a credit union since they will most likely give you a more favorable rate if you can get a credit union to do it you will most likely be paying a lot less but typically they want interest paid monthly and not at the end of the 6 months term   there is also a service called or tuition management services which you can find at tuition management services they typically also expect monthly payments but might do an alternative for you they charge i believe a $ fee to use their service also just flat out bank shop and demand the lowest rate its guaranteed money so you should be paying libor plus 1 at most see if you can direct your next payout to them with the balance coming to you

some people have this notion that withdrawing dividends from savings    is somehow okay but withdrawing principal is not   note this notion would someone please explain the mistake on and why it 's a    mistake because there may be times where withdrawing principal may be a good idea as one could sell off something that has gained enough that in re balancing the portfolio there are capital gains that could be used for withdrawing in retirement how and why does the sale of financial instrument equate to the    receipt of dividends   in either case one has cash equivalents that could be withdrawn if you take the dividends in cash or sell a security to raise cash you have cash thus it does n't matter what origin it has if i sell a financial instrument that later    appreciates in value then this profit opportunity is lost in the    case of a dividend i 'd still possess the financial security and    benefit from the stock 's appreciation one could argue that the in the case of a dividend by not buying more of the instrument you are missing out on a profit opportunity as well thus are you out to make the maximum profit overall or do you have reason for taking the cash instead of increasing your holding

this is a very interesting question i 'm going to attempt to answer it use debt to leverage investment historically stock markets have returned 10 p.a so today when interest rates are very low and depending on which country you live in you could theoretically borrow money at a very low interest rate and earn 10 p.a pocketing the difference this can be done through an etf mutual funds and other investment instruments make sure you have enough cash flow to cover the interest payments similar to the concept of acid ratio for companies you should have slightly more than enough liquid funds to meet the monthly payments naturally this strategy only works when interest rates are low after that you 'll have to think of other ideas however imo the fed seems to be heading towards qe3 so we might be seeing a prolonged period of low interest rates so borrowing seems like a sensible option now since the movements of interest rates are political in nature monitoring this should be quite simple it depends on you since interest rates are the opportunity cost of spending money the lower the interest rates the lower the opportunity costs of using money now and repaying it later interest rates are a market mechanism so that people who prefer to spend later can lend to people who prefer to spend now for the price of interest disclaimer historically stocks have returned 10 p.a but that does n't mean this trend will continue indefinitely as we have seen fixed income outperform stocks in the recent past

the point of the enrollment penalty is basically the same as the aca penalty   any sort of health insurance or really any insurance is funded by creating a risk pool of high and low risk people and pricing it so that the overall payments cover the total risk    that means however that on average the low risk people end up paying more than their share more than it would have cost them without the insurance any provider agreements to charge less which is significant in the health insurance business   of course some of them do end up using more than they pay but not on average assuming the risk was calculated accurately while there is n't really a completely low risk pool in medicare there is a significant difference in utilization = cost between younger 65 70 and older   as such for many health 65 year olds it would be beneficial to not enroll in medicare right away delay a few years if they 're fully healthy and wait until they are less healthy   since medicare wo n't turn you away for pre existing conditions that 's a risk some would take in order to accommodate for that medicare effectively says if you did n't help subsidize the costs of the high users when you were younger you need to pay more to make up for that fact hence the enrollment penalty    the new york times explains this in part in a 2006 article discussing part d which was new that year and has a similar penalty the purpose of the late enrollment penalty is to encourage people to    sign up as soon as possible before they have significant drug costs

freehold is simple it 's when you own the building and the land it 's on   there 's no rent to pay but you will still have to pay taxes leasehold is when the property is leased rented out for a fixed period that could be anything from 6 months to 199 years   there will be a rent to pay   the person who owns the property is still the there may be some confusion caused by what is being sold   you can buy out a lease from the current   it 's also possible to buy the freehold of a property that is currently leased to someone else it is also possible to have a freehold building on leasehold land

the court by itself is not expensive it is the implied need for an attorney which are very expensive your average court case costs $ 130 to file however your average attorneys charge anywhere from $ 750 to $ 200 an hour granted the need for an attorney stems from the complexity of written law i would agree with you that this is not ideal about current society but the alternative an society without written law is much less ideal to even find something like that we would almost have to refer back to my previous example somalia

khan academy videos are really good you should start to read the tutorials for beginners on investopedia.com additionally you should keep yourself informed about the current finance related events i would suggest reading the wall street journal and watch bloomberg tv on their website

gt you could try to persuade the public that paying more for energy is in their interest but good luck with that   that 's exactly what i 'm hoping for   the hell out of it and hope no one notices   not only am i hoping that people will notice i 'm hoping they 'll heavily support it the reason being that not doing it will harm the future of the human race   suggest eliminating democracy would be an ahem undesirable side effect    not what i was suggesting

gt so depending upon location it can be incredibly inexpensive   yeah places where it is n't going to flood   i have something like $ 8k flood coverage with $ 5k deductible on an elevated condo unit and it is about $ as a city official told me if that place gets flooded we 're all dead and yet here i am throwing away money due to shitty regulations

very appropriate use of the quotations this is n't a solution this is akin to a doctor to negligent to do their job to save a patient and putting them on life support hoping to keep them going as long as possible to hide their incompetence before the shit hits the fan only a fool would think they could keep the patient alive forever

their suit looked like shit compared to the original and all they had to do was the text a bit so that it did n't line up every word in every line such a small difference and i bet they would have sold a lot more

the reason that funds and the like are bad is n't because of the leverage ratio it 's because they 're compounded daily and the product of all the doubled daily returns is not mathematically equivalent to the double the long term return i 'd consider providing big fancy equations using pi as the product of elements in a sequence operator and other calculus but that would be overkill i do n't think i can do here and i do n't know the relevant anyway anyway from the economics theory perspective the ideal leverage ratio is 1x that is unlevered straight investment consider using leverage costs money you know that surely if someone could borrow money at n% and invest at an expected where x > 0 then they would they would borrow all the money they could and buy all the s&p500 they could but when they bought all that s&p500 they 'd eventually run out of people who were willing to sell it for that cheap that would mean the excess return would be smaller eventually you 'd get to a point where the excess return is zero well no empirically we can see that it 's definitely not zero and that in the real world that stocks do return more than bonds why   because stocks are riskier than bonds the difference in expected return between an index like the s&p500 and a us treasury bond is due to the relative riskiness of the s&p500 which is n't guaranteed by the us government to return your principal any money that you make off of leverage comes from assuming some sort of a risk now assuming risk can be a profitable thing to do but there are also a lot of people out there with higher risk tolerance than you like insurance companies and billionaires so the market is n't exactly short of people willing to take risks and you should n't expect the returns of assuming risk in the general case to be awesome now it 's true that investing in an unlevered fashion is risky also but that 's not an excuse to go leveraged anyway it 's a reason to hold back in fact regular stocks are sufficiently risky that most people probably should n't be holding a 100 stock portfolio they should be that risk with bonds instead and increasing the size of their bond holdings over time the appropriate time to use leverage is when you have information which limits your risk you have done research and have reason to believe that you understand the future of an individual stock index better than the rest of the stock market does you calculate that the potential for achieving returns with leverage outweighs the risks then you dump your money into the leveraged position in exchange for this the market receives information about anticipated future returns of this instrument because of the price movement which occurs as a result of someone putting his money where his mouth is if you 're just looking to dump money into broad market in a leveraged fashion you 're doing it wrong there is no free money ed which is not to say there 's not money there 's lots of money but if you go looking for the free kind you wo n't find it and may end up with money that you thought was free but was actually quite expensive edit okay so you do n't like my answer i 'm not surprised i 'm giving you a real answer instead of a make free money answer okay here 's your how to make free money answer assume you are using a constant leverage ratio over the length of time you 've invested your money and you do n't get to just jump into and out of the market that 's market timing not leverage so you have to stay invested you 're going to have a scenario which falls into one of these categories the s&p500 historically rises over time the average rate of return probably exceeds the average interest rate so the ideal leverage ratio is infinite of course this is a stupid answer in real life because you ca n't pull that off your risk tolerance is too low and you will have trouble finding a lender willing to lend you unsecured money and you 'll probably lose all your money in a crash sooner or later ultimately it 's a stupid answer because you 're asking the wrong question you should probably ask a better question when i use leverage to gain additional exposure to risk am i being properly compensated for assuming that risk
