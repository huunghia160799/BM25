mostly we invest in companies to make money the money can be paid to as in the form of dividends that are a share of the profit    or the company can convince enough people that it will make a lot higher profit next year so its stock prices increases clearly a company that reinvests its 20 profit from one shop to open an 2nd shop is doing well and is a good investment       but but but we only have the companies word for it     a dividend paying company finds it a lot harder to hide bad news for long as it will not have the money in the bank to pay the dividends

technically the difference between dividends and growth ought to be that dividends can be reinvested in stocks other than the one that paid them which is a definite advantage if you actually have a strategy   dividend stocks used to be preferred for exactly that reason back in the days when fewer people were directly playing in the market and more knew what they were doing unfortunately   getting a periodic dividend from a stock whose price is relatively steady is n't as exciting a game as watching your stock 's value bounce around and hopefully   creep upward on a second by second basis those who are thinking in gambling terms rather than investment terms or who think they can beat the pros at high frequency trading comment withheld want the latter and have been putting a lot of pressure on companies to operate in the latter mode that does n't make it better certainly not for the longer term investors just more fashionable and fashion often means getting stuck with something impractical because everyone else is doing it on this i second scrooge

dividends telegraph that management has a longer term focus than just the end of quarter share price   there is a to at least maintain if not periodically increase the dividend payout year over year   management understands that cutting or dividends will cause dividend investors in market to dump shares driving down the stock price    dividends can have preferential tax treatment in some jurisdictions either for an individual compared to capital gains or compared to the corporation paying taxes themselves   for example reits real estate investment trusts are a type of corporation that in order to not pay corporate income tax are required to pay out 95 of income as dividends each year   these are not the only type mlp master limited partnerships and other partnership structures will always have high dividend rates by design dividends provide cash flow and trade market volatility for actual cash   not every investor needs cash flow but for certain investors it reduces the risks of a liquidity crisis such as in retirement   the alternative for an investor who seeks to use the sale of shares would be to maintain a sufficient cash reserve for typical market recessions

when you invest in stocks there are two possible ways to make money many people speculate just on the stock price which would result in a gain or loss but only once you have resold the shares others do n't really care about the stock price they get dividends every so often and hopefully the return will be better than other types of investments if you 're in there for the long run you do not really care what the price of the stock is it is often highly volatile and often completely disconnected from anything so it 's not because today you have a theoretical gain because the current stock price is higher than your buying price that you will effectively realise that gain when you sell need i the numerous crashes that prevented this from happening returns will often be more spectacular on share resale than on dividends but it goes both ways you can lose a lot if you resell at the wrong time dividends tend to be a bit more stable and unless the company goes bankrupt or a few other unfortunate events you still hold shares in the company even if the price goes down and you could still get dividends and you can still resell the stock on top of that of course not all companies distribute dividends in that case you only have the hope of reselling at a higher price or that the company will distribute dividends in the future welcome to the next bubble

is n't it true that on the ex dividend date the price of the stock goes down roughly the amount of the dividend that is what you gain in dividend you lose in price drop yes and no it depends generally stocks move up and down during the market and become more volatile on some news so one ca n't truly measure if the stock has gone down by the extent of dividend as one can not isolate other factors for what is a normal share movement there are time when the prices infact moves up now would it have moved more if there was no dividend is speculative secondly the dividends are very small percentage compared to the shares trading price generally even if 100 dividend are announced they are on the share capital on share prices dividends would be less than 1 hence it becomes more difficult to measure the movement of stock note if the dividend is greater than a said percentage there are rules that give guidelines to factor this in options and other area etc lets not mix these exceptions why is everyone making a big deal out of the amount that companies pay in dividends then why do some people call themselves dividend investors it does n't seem to make much sense there are some set of investors who are passive i.e. they want to invest in good stock but do n't want to sell it i.e. more like keep it for long time at the same time they want some cash potentially to spend similar to interest received on bank deposits this class of share holders it makes sense to invest into companies that give dividends as year on year they keep receiving some money if they on the other hand has invested into a company that does not give dividends they would have to sell some units to get the same money back this is the catch they have to sell in whole units there is brokerage fees etc there are tax events some countries have taxes that are more friendly to dividends than capital gains thus its an individual choice whether to invest into companies that give good dividends or into companies that do n't give dividends   giving or not giving dividends does not make a company good or bad

dividends indicate that a business is making more profit than it can effectively invest into expansion or needs to regulate cash flow this generally indicates that the business is well established and has stabilized in a dominant market position this can be contrasted against businesses that dividends are also given preferential tax treatment specifically if i buy a stock and sell it 30 days later i will be taxed on the capital gains at the regular income rate typically 25 33 but the dividends would be taxed at the lower long term capital gains rate typically 15

there are strategies based on yields dogs of the dow being a specific example while miller howard has a few studies around dividends that may be of use if you additional material selling off a portion of the holding can run into problems as how could one hold 10 shares selling a non zero whole number every year for over 20 years if the stock does n't ever pay a dividend in additional shares or cash
# 532139
the upvoted answers fail to note that dividends are the only benefit that investors collectively receive from the companies they invest in if you purchase a share for $ 100 and then later sell it for $ 150 you should note that there is always someone that purchases the same share for $ 150 so you get $ 150 immediately but somebody else has to pay $ 150 immediately so investors collectively did not receive any money from the transaction yes share repurchase can be used instead of dividends but it can be considered really another form of paying dividends the fair value of a stock is the discounted value of all future dividends the stock pays it is so simple this shows why dividends are important somebody might argue that many successful companies like berkshire hathaway do not pay dividend yes it is true that they do n't pay dividend now but they will eventually have to start paying dividend if they reinvest potential dividends continuously they will run out of things to invest in after several hundred years has passed so even in this case the value of the stock is still the discounted value of all future dividends the only difference is that the dividends are not paid now the companies will start to pay the dividends later when they run out of things to invest in it is true that in theory a stock could pay an unsustainable amount of dividend that requires financing it with debt this is obviously not a good solution if you see a company that pays dividend while at the same time obtaining more cash from taking more debt or from share issues think twice whether you want to invest in such a company what you need to do to companies fairly is to estimate the amount of dividend that can sustain the expected growth rate it is typically about 60 of the earnings because a part of the earnings needs to be invested in future growth but the exact figure may vary depending on the company furthermore to a company you need the expected growth rate of dividends and the discount rate you simply discount all future dividends correcting them up by the expected dividend growth rate and correcting them down by the discount rate

dividends are one way to discriminate between companies to invest in in the best of all worlds your investment criteria is simple invest in whatever makes me the most money on the timeline i want to have it   if you just follow that one golden rule your future financial needs will be taken care of oh you 're not 100 proof positive certain which investment is best for you   good   you 're mortal   none of us magically know the best investment for us   we wing it based on what information we can glean   for instance we know that bonds tend to be safer than stocks but with a lower return so if something calls itself a bond we treat it differently than we treat a stock so what sorts of information do we have   well think of the stock market   a dividend is one way for a company to communicate with their stockholders in the best way possible their   there 's some generally agreed upon behaviors dividends have such as they do n't go down without some good reason for it like a global recession or a plan to acquire another company that is well accepted by the stockholders   if a company starts to talk in this language people expect them to behave a certain way   if they do n't the stock gets fast   a dividend itself is n't a big deal but a dividend which is n't shunned by a lot of smart investors that can be a big deal a dividend is a promise which can be broken of course to cash out some of the company 's profits to its shareholders   its probably one of the older tools out there you give investors a share of the profits is pretty tried and true   it worked for many types of companies   if you see a dividend especially one which has been reliable for many years you can presume something about the type of company they are other companies find dividend is a poor tool to accomplish their goals   that does n't mean they 're better or worse simply different   they 're approaching the problem differently   is that kind of different the kind you want in your books   maybe   companies which are n't choosing to commit a portion of their profits to shareholders are typically playing a more aggressive game   are you comfortable that you can keep up with how they 're using your money and make sure its in your interests   it can be harder in these companies where you simply hold a piece of paper and never get anything from them again
# 117082
someone who buys a stock is fundamentally buying a share of all future dividends plus the future liquidation value of the company in the event that it is liquidated   while some investors may buy stocks in the hope that they will be able to find other people willing to pay more for the stock than they did that 's a zero sum game   the only way investors can make money in the aggregate is if either stocks pay dividends or if the money paid for company assets at liquidation exceeds total net price for which the company sold shares one advantage of dividends from a market rationality perspective is that dividend payments are easy to evaluate than company value   ideally the share price of a company should match the present per share cash value of all future dividends and liquidation but it 's generally impossible to know in advance what that value will be   stock prices may sometimes rise because of factors which increase the expected per share cash value of future dividends and liquidations in a sane market rising prices on an item will reduce people 's to buy and increase people 's to sell   unfortunately in a marketplace where steady price appreciation is expected the feedback mechanisms responsible for stability get reversed   rapidly rising prices act as a red flag to buyers unfortunately bulls do n't see red flags as signal to stop but rather as a signal to charge ahead for a variety of reasons including the disparate treatment of dividends and capital gains it 's often not practical for a company to try to stabilize stock prices through dividends and stock sales   nonetheless dividends are in a sense far more real than stock price appreciation since paying dividends generally requires that companies actually have sources of revenues and profits   by contrast it 's possible for stock prices to go through the roof for companies which have relatively few assets of value and no real expectation of becoming profitable businesses simply because investors see rising stock prices as a buy signal independent of any real worth
# 578619
it has little to do with money or finance   it 's basic neuroscience   when we get money our brains release read your money and your brain and receiving dividends is getting money   it feels good so we 're more likely to do it again what you often see are because the above explanation sounds irrational so many people want to make their behavior look more rational   ceteris paribus a solid growth stock is as good as a solid company that pays dividends in value investing terms dividend paying stocks may appear to give you an advantage in that you can keep the dividends in cash and buy when the price of the security is low underpriced   however as you realize you could just sell the growth stock at certain prices and the effect would be the same assuming you 're using a free brokerage like robin hood you can easily sell just a portion of the shares periodically to get a    stream of cash like dividends that presents no problem whatsoever    so this can not be the explanation to why some people think it is    smart to be a dividend investor yes if you 're using a brokerage like robin hood there may be others but i think this is the only one right now then you are right on
# 172636
if you assume the market is always 100 rational and accurate and liquid then it does n't matter very much if a company pays dividends other than how dividends are taxed vs. capital gains   if the market is 100 accurate and liquid it also does n't really matter what stock you buy since they are all fairly priced other than that you want the stock to match your risk tolerance    however if you manage to find an undervalued company which as an investor is what you are trying to do your investment skill wo n't pay off much until enough other people notice the company 's value which might take a long time and you might end up wanting to sell before it happens   but if the company pays dividends you can slowly get value from your investment no matter what the market thinks   of course if it 's really undervalued then you would often but not always want to buy more of it anyway    also companies must constantly decide whether to reinvest the money in themselves or pay out dividends to owners   as an owner there are some cases in which you would prefer the company invest in itself because you think they can do better with it then you can   however there is a decided tendency for c level employees to be more optimistic in this regard than their owners perhaps because even sub market quality investments expand the empires of the executives even when they hurt the owners    paying dividends is thus sometimes a sign that a company no longer has capital requirements intense enough that it makes sense to re invest all of its profits though having that much opportunity can be a good thing sometimes and/or a sign that it is willing to some degree to favor paying its owners over expanding the business   as a current or prospective owner that can be desirable    it 's also worth mentioning that since stocks paying dividends are likely not in the middle of a fast growth phase and are producing profit in excess of their capital needs they are likely slower growth and lower risk as a class than companies without dividends   this puts them in a particular place on the risk reward spectrum so some investors may prefer dividend paying stocks because they match their risk profile
# 72189
why do people talk about stock that pay high dividends   traditionally people who buy dividend stocks are looking for income from their investments most dividend stock companies pay out dividends every quarter every 90 days if set up properly an investor can receive a dividend check every month every week or as often as they have enough money to the ex dates there is a difference in high $ $ amount of the dividend and the yield   a $ 1/share dividend payout may sound good up front but how much is that stock costing you if the stock cost you $ 100/share then you are getting 1 yield if the stock cost you $ 10/share you are getting 10 yield   there are a lot of factors that come into play when investing in dividend stocks for cash flow keep in mind why are you investing in the first place growth or cash flow arrange your investing around your major investment goals do n't chase big dollar dividend checks do your research and follow a proven investment plan to reach your goals safely
# 234623
the answer for me has to do with compounding that drop in price post ex div is not compounded but if you reinvest your dividends back into the stock then you buy on those post ex div dips in price and your money is compounded because those shares you just bought will themselves yeald dividends next quarter   also with my broker i reinvest the dividend incurring no commission my broker has a feature to reinvest dividends automatically and he charges no commission on those buys edit i forgot to mention that you do not the loss from a drop in price until you sell the security if you do not sell post ex div then you have no loss as long as the dividend remains the same or increases then the theoretical roi on that security goes up the drop in price is actually to your benefit because you are able to acquire more shares with the money you just received in the dividend   so the price coming down post ex div is a good thing if you buy and hold

there is nothing fair unfair in such deals it is an art than a science   what kind of things should be considered to work out what would be a fair percentage stake a true fair value is take the current valuation of the company this can be difficult if it is small and does not maintain proper records divide by number of shares that is the value of share and you should 20 k worth of such shares but then there is risk premium you are taking a risk that an small start up may do exceedingly well or it may close off this risk premium is what is negotiated it depends on how desperate the owner of the small company is who all are interested in this specific deal if you want 30 share someone else is ready to offer 20 k for 15 of share or there is no one willing to lend 20 k as they do n't believe it will make money and the owner is desperate you may even get 50

it is a very complex question to answer and it really depends however here are some points to consider and verify with your accountant or tax expert   first if you exercise now the downside is that you may be subject to alternative minimum tax amt based on the theoretical gain on the stock current price minus your strike price when you file your tax return   the other obvious downside is that if the company goes nowhere you are stuck with the stock and potentially lose money   the benefit is that the clock starts ticking for long term capital gains so if you sell after 1 year from the exercise date or your company gets sold then the gain would be taxed as long term capital gain which is taxed at a lower rate if your company were to get sold the gains are not necessarily taxed as ordinary income   if it is a cash transaction then most likely unless you have exercised and held the stock for over a year   however if it is a stock sale then you may end up getting stock of the company that acquires your company   in that situation the tax event would be when you sell the new shares vs. the time of company sale finally whether to exercise or not also depends on how you feel about the prospects of the company   if you think they will be sold or of more value down the road then exercising makes sense   if you are not sure then you could hedge your bets by only exercising a portion of it you should definitely consult with a financial advisor or a tax consultant regarding these matters

edit quid identified the reverse split in may 2017   in a reverse split your shares are worth 7 times as much per share but you have the amount of shares   a share worth $ now was worth all else being equal $ a month ago    so a call with a $ 2.50 strike a month ago was well out of the money and would now be the equivalent of a call with a $ strike   a $ call with a $ underlying or a $ 2.50 call with a $ underlying would reasonably be worth only 5 cents so i now suspect that the quote is a stale quote that existed pre split and has n't been adjusted by the provider old answer i can find no valid reason why those calls would be so cheap   the stock price has been trending down from its onset in 2000 so either no one expects it to be above $ 2.50 in a month or it 's so illiquid that there 's not any real data to evaluate the options   they did pay some massive 30 dividends in 2010 and 2012 they 've been cash for the past 4 years at least and i have found at least on strong sell rating so there 's not much to be optimistic about   nasdaq does not list any options for the stock so it must be an otc trade    with an ask size of 10 you could buy calls on 1,000 shares for $ 0.05 so if you can afford to lose $ 50 and want to take a flyer you can give it a shot but i suspect it 's not a valid quote and is something that 's been manufactured by the option broker

first and foremost being cool stops being a thing you have to worry about once you graduate from secondary school nobody 's really going to care what car you drive the ones that do care are n't worth maintaining personal friendships or relationships with the notable exception would be a sales job requiring you to look successful to be successful and in that case you 'll need to either have a nice looking car or buy one very quickly also consider what you 're buying an which for the u.s. crowd was the previous generation of and sedans will be at best a old car and they made these as long ago as 98 which would make it 15 years old the standard in the u.s. is to put about 10k miles which would be about 17k km per year on it so you would expect even the newest to have at least 100 000 km on them at this point even the best cars start needing increasing amounts of maintenance and on a bmw that maintenance does n't come cheap   consider why a bmw would be sold it sounds cliche but in the u.s. at least there are three tiers of used car in the luxury class there are the and two year olds used by the dealer as a loaner or owned by the type of guy who buys a new car every year they 're practically new for 30 50 off sticker and a great deal when you find them there are the 15-year old or older cars which were used up and traded in the majority of these end up auctioned off and for parts with the remaining sold for salvage then there are the in between three and ten years old you get a wide variety this car could have been all its life and driven to and from work and around town before its owner got a raise and decided to splurge or its previous owner could have driven the wheels off all over the continent for work or travel it could have a major problem that developed or was discovered after the warranty expired and there is n't an on the road that 's still under warranty which caused the owner to sell overall i would wait until you have your first real job to spend real money on a car like this the one that will actually pay the bills with enough left over for fun when you 're making 35k a year with only your own personal expenses as long as you manage your debt well and do n't get in trouble with credit you should have no trouble buying a car like this or even a newer one if you are going to buy used even then i recommend you do your homework on required maintenance for the brand and in general what each milestone will cost you and based on mileage how soon and i would find a reputable used car dealer which is a contradiction in terms but there are guys out there who are n't out to completely screw you over

you should look into an llc   its a fairly simple process and the income simply flows through to your individual return   it will allow you to deduct supplies and other expenses from that income   it should also protect you if someone sues you for doing shoddy work even if the work was fine although you would need to consult a lawyer to be sure for last year it sounds like your taxes were done wrong   there are very very few ways that you can end up adding more income and earning less after taxes i 'm tempted to say none but our tax laws are so complex that i 'm sure you can do it somehow

because this question seems like it will stick around i will flesh out my comments into an actual answer i apologize if this does not answer your question as asked but i believe these are the real issues at stake for the actual questions you have asked i have paraphrased and below firstly do n't do a real estate transaction without talking to a lawyer at some stage note a real estate broker is not a lawyer secondly as with all transactions with family get everything in writing feelings get hurt when someone mis remembers a deal and wants the terms to change in the future being cold and calculated now by detailing all money in and out will save you from losing a brother in the future should my brother give me money as a down payment and i finance the remainder with the bank if the bank is not aware that this is what is happening this is fraud calling something a gift when really it 's a payment for part ownership of your house is fraud there does not seem to be any debate here though i am not a lawyer if the bank is aware that this is what is happening then you might be able to do this however it is unlikely that the bank will allow you to take out a mortgage on a house which you will not fully own by given your brother a share in the future value in the house the bank might not be able to foreclose on the whole house without fighting the brother on it therefore they would want him on the mortgage the fact that he ca n't get another mortgage means a the banks may be unwilling to allow him to be involved at all and b it becomes even more critical to not commit fraud you are effectively tricking the bank into thinking that you have the money for a down payment and also that your brother is not involved now to the actual question at hand which i answer only for use on other transactions that do not meet the pitfalls listed above this is an incredibly difficult question what happens to your relationship with your brother when the value of the house goes down and he wants to sell but you want to stay living there what about when the market changes and one of you feels that you 're getting a raw deal   you do n't know where the housing market will go as an investment that 's maybe acceptable because risk forms some of the basis of returns but with you getting to live there and with him taking only the risk that risk is maybe unfairly on him he may not think so today while he 's optimistic but what about tomorrow if the market crashes whatever the terms of the agreement are get them in writing and preferably get them looked at by a lawyer consider all scenarios like what if one of you wants to sell does the other have the right to delay or buy you out or what if one if you wants to buy the other out etc etc etc there are too many clauses to here which is why you need to get a lawyer

let 's say you owe $ 200 k since you did n't mention balance if you do i 'd edit my response and can get 4.5 you 'd save 1.5 or about $ 3k yr the first few years if a $ 12 k paydown is all that 's between you and and refi i 'd figure out a way   there are banks that are offering refi 's under the harp program if your current mortgage is owned by or which permit even if under water so the first step is research to see if you can refi exactly what 's owed failing that shop around a 401(k loan will not appear as a loan on your credit report that may be one way to raise the $ the best thing you can do is put all the savings into the 401(k to really get it going

it is n't an edge janitor   as a whole bart employees vastly better compensated than private industry       it 's noble that you desire a fair wage for every worker but that 's not how this works   the role of the business is to earn profit and return money to the shareholder   there is no corporate doctrine advocating that compensation must be equal or somehow divided   the janitor does n't need $ 100k year he needs affordable housing   but efforts like that are by public unions sucking up undue compensation that would have been better invested in a public private trust for affordable housing construction   even zuckerberg arguably the biggest liberal in town does n't implement your fair wage system why   because he runs a private corporation and has to answer to share holders   watch a companies profits plunge and hard decisions be made if it 's a bonus for your in demand finance or engineers or a $ 100k salary for the janitor i think you know what will take precedence   companies make these decisions every day     back to the root issue   my argument is that public transportation by rail can be a real money loser even in a dense urban setting like sf bay   the only way to fix bart is to starve the beast but bay area voters see the system through rose glasses and fail to do   counties should privatize the system the public union and cut labor costs by 50 so that taxpayer are n't required to maintain a system that takes in $ over 10 a ten year

in the broadest strokes    strategy is about decision making   finance is about the management of money   business development is about identifying and developing opportunities   there 's a lot of between all aspects of business so it 's going to sound like a lot of them the other or are interchangeable   because you ca n't make decisions without knowing your capital situation and how the decision will affect your cashflows and you would n't have a decision to make without an opportunity being identified and you would n't know how valuable an opportunity is unless you knew how it would impact your cashflows   this is also why the higher in the corporate ladder you go the more meetings you 'll be in because it 's a coordinated dance between every department and none of them act in a vacuum   if you got an mba concentrating in strategy your most prominent opportunities straight out of school are going to be in consulting where you would help businesses make decisions on moving forward   strategic roles within a fortune 500 company are likely going to be filled with senior employees with opportunities after a few years in consulting to transition into a management role within a corporate setting   none of it is set in stone though    if you got an mba concentrating in finance what i did your most prominent opportunities will be in corporate finance and financial services     corporate finance jobs center largely on capital budgeting and working capital management   capital budgeting is assessing how valuable potential investment projects are and prioritizing what should be funded and how   working capital management is making sure you do n't run out of cash more complicated than it sounds     you can look on to see what common career paths for any of the entry jobs look like   a financial analyst becomes a senior analyst after a few years and then moves into finance management positions then up to director vp cfo   a management consultant would become a project manager move into operations management director vp c suite

your question boils down to saving for a house or saving for retirement why not do both if you invest in a roth 401k or roth ira you can withdraw any contributions that are at least 5 years old without penalty assuming you 're willing to put off purchasing a little longer than your original 2 3 years if you qualify as a first time home buyer i.e. you have n't owned a home in at least 2 years you can withdraw investment earnings as well if your distribution is earmarked towards the down payment and is no more than $ 10000 although you wo n't be penalized for using investment earnings for a down payment you will still have to pay taxes on them so this may be more appealing to someone that has enough contributions to avoid dipping into the investment earnings the only other downside is that contributions to a roth investment are not tax deductible like traditional ira and 401k contributions are instead they grow tax free and distributions are tax free when you reach retirement age

let me ask you another question if that person stayed at home and made a widget instead would exporting that widget benefit his home country there is no difference economically between the two situations a foreign worker sending home remittances is no different from a local manufacturer exporting their products both are earning export dollars for themselves and their home countries is this a good thing or a bad thing clearly the answer is yes this is a good thing or a bad thing but we can not know which in isolation however in general foreign worker remittances are overwhelmingly beneficial for the host which gets work done that otherwise would not be done and the source which gets export income with reference to your particular question about local inflation a rise in exports causes appreciation in the exchange rate i.e. local currency becomes more expensive with respect to in this case the euro appreciation in the exchange rate actually puts downward pressure on inflation however the absence of our worker from the local economy puts upward pressure on local wages and and hence inflation both of these effects are small and other factors will dominate them

as observed there is no answer that will fit all but below are some considerations your monthly requirement is 5000 so you have 3000 left to pay the monthly instalments emi however if you do pay 3000 you will have no money left for any other activities holidays etc till your emi is finished set off a sum let us say 500 1000 per month you shall have to decide for other expenses the rest of the money in this case 2000 2500 you can pay as monthly emi if you indicate that your monthly emi to the bank they will be able to tell you how much of loan you are eligible for and for how long the emi would last this is your benchmark if this loan amount is 750,000 or more you do not need to put in your own money so the decision then becomes how fast you want to pay off your loan and as accordingly you shall utilize your 500,000 however if the emi will not cover a loan of 750,000 more likely case you have options between the following a. max out on your loan that 2000 2500 emi month in terms of years as well as amount can get you and put the rest from 500,000 b. min your loan in terms of amount and time and put your entire 500,000 c. the middle ground is to balance between the loan and your own money which is the best approach there is no figure here that works for all you have to take the decision based on your circumstances however in general the shorter the loan term in years better it is as in aggregate you pay less money to the bank if you are 1 2 months away from buying the house one exercise you could do is to keep the emi money in a separate bank account and see how you fare with the residual cash this would give you a good reality check hope this helps thanks

inflation refers to the money supply think of all money being air in a balloon inflation is what happens when you blow more air in the balloon deflation is what happens when you let air escape inflation may cause prices to go up however there are many scenarios possible in which this does not happen for example at the same time of inflation there might be unemployment making consumers unable to pay higher prices or some important resource oil may go down in price due to political reasons war has ended etc compensating for the money having less value   similarly peoples wages will tend to rise over time they have to otherwise everyone would be earning less due to inflation however again there are many scenarios in which wages do not keep up with inflation or rise much faster in fact over the past 40 years or so us wages have not been able to keep up with inflation making the average worker poorer than 40 years ago at its core inflation refers to the value of the money itself as all values of other products services assets etc are expressed in terms of money which itself also changes value this can quickly become very complex most countries calculate inflation by averaging the price change of a basket of goods that are supposed to represent the average joe 's spending pattern however these methods are often criticized as they would be hiding inflation the hidden inflation may come back later to bite us

depending on the state this might not be possible loans are considered contracts and various states regulate how minors may enter into them for example in the state of oregon a minor may not enter into a contract without their parent being on the contract as well so you are forced to wait until you turn 18 at that time you wo n't have a credit history and to lenders that often is worse than having bad credit i ca n't help with the car other than to recommend you buy a junker for $ and just live with it for now but you could certainly get a secured credit card or line of credit from your local bank the way they are arranged is you make a deposit of an amount of your choosing generally at least $ 200 for credit cards and $ 1,000 for lines of credit and receive a revolving line with a limit of that same amount as you use and pay on this loan it will be reported in your credit history if you start that now by the time you turn 18 you will have much better options for purchasing vehicles

yes there is such possibility also there 's a possibility people made your computer your operation system your browser etc put there some code there that would intercept your communications and steal your money so could bank clerks and unlike all other examples this really happened in real world numerous times though usually at smaller banks atm makers etc   in the modern world you rely on things made by thousands of people this is a part of modern world 's conveniences you do n't have to use it you can store all your money in a big jar in your basement and nobody but occasional thief breaking in could take it   however fraudulent unauthorized transactions in most banks can be rolled back and any transaction is reported to you so fraud from mint.com people would be quite low on my list of risks much bigger risk is that somebody could break into mint.com servers and steal information about your accounts from there or install some malicious code i believe they have good protections but no security system is perfect you need to evaluate how the convenience of using mint.com compares to your personal feeling about this risk if you feel you could n't sleep at night knowing somewhere out there there is information about your money do n't use it i do n't worry about it too much as i know the chance of it happening is low and the chance of getting the money back if it happens is high but if you feel differently do n't do it

does this plan make sense mathematically no not really   the housing market can be fairly volatile depending on your location and it is really a good market for buying right now   you 're going to make 1 or 2 on your money over the next year and risk paying 10 more for the house or more   even if you had a loan at 5 that would be 5 of what you still owe not the full value of the house does it make sense in terms of the common rules about paying a mortgage off early yes though make sure you have at least 80 of the house value so you do n't get nailed with pmi which may have a fixed duration is there a better strategy that i am overlooking yes investigate buying a house now   i 'm not saying rush into it shop around and find a really good deal   get a 15-year mortgage or less and put what you 're able to down maybe 80 down   you can then payoff the mortgage over the next year or two and not have the risk of the volatility of the market raising the prices on houses and you getting less for your money

in simplest terms when a company creates new shares and sells them it 's true that existing shareholders now own a smaller percentage of the company   however as the company is now more valuable since it made money by selling the new shares the real dollar value of the previous shares is unchanged that said the decision to issue new shares can be interpreted by investors as a signal of the company 's strategy and thereby alter the market price   this may well affect the real dollar value of the previous shares   but the simple act of creating new shares does not alter the value in and of itself

i would advise against wasting this rare opportunity on mundane things like by paying off debts or buying toys you can always pay those from your wages plus you 'll inevitably accumulate new debts over time so debt repayment is an ongoing concern this large pile of cash allows you to do things you ca n't ordinarily do so use the opportunity to invest buy a house then rent it out rent an apartment for yourself the house rent will pay most maybe all of the mortgage plus the mortgage interest is tax deductible so you get a lower tax bill and houses appreciate over time so that 's an added bonus when you get married and start a family you 'll have a house ready for you partially paid off with other people 's money

how is it possible for the average investor to underperform the market the average investor probably makes some bad decisions you also might need to take transaction costs into play including borrowing on margin so that there 's a natural erosion of returns across the market   meaning if transaction borrowing costs are 1 and the market return is 5 the average investor   alternatively if by average they mean the average of the population not weighted by amount it 's plausible that the mass of smaller investors perform slightly worse than the smaller number of large investors and have larger relative transaction costs thus having a lower average on a per capita basis does n't the fact that investors can consistently underperform the market by making poor decisions imply that an investor could consistently outperform the market by making the opposite decisions no   if my investment decisions cause me to earn only a 10 return compared to the average 12 return then making the opposite decision will cause me to lose 10 not to make 14

their high savings is n't why they have to export capital the issue is that domestic depositors do n't have access to the sky high interest rates over the last 2 decades in china there is definitely correlation between asset levels and debt   i miss typed in my previous post i meant to say that the amount of debt is overstated because wealth is high relative to income due to the high savings rate   ultimately there is n't a good answer yet to your question the seminal work which has received many updates in the last 6 years that first attempted to understand the disconnect between the ultra high interest rate in china and the high levels of capital exports is called growing like china by song and published in the american economic review in 2011   global debt according to the is of gdp so china is actually a little below average in terms of total debt to gdp and when you 're growing at a year it is okay to lever up a little bit    on top of all of this the chinese government is well aware of these issues and will almost certainly make some comments october 18th and over the next week about debt growth   this is all complicating the issue though when you have a huge supply of money to lend interest rates fall and companies take on more debt so in general you would expect savings and debt levels to move together

one can generalize on traditional vs roth flavors of accounts i suggest roth for 15 money and going pretax to avoid 25 tax   if the student loan is much over 4 it may make sense to put it right after emergency fund   for emergency fund priority i 'm assuming ef really requires 2 phases the $ 2500 broken transmission root canal bill and the lose your job or need a new roof level bills i 'm in favor of doing what let 's you sleep well i 'm also quick to point out that if you owe $ 2500 at 18 yet have $ 2500 in your emergency fund you 're really throwing away $ 450 in interest each year there 's an ongoing debate of credit card as emergency fund no i do n't claim that your cards should be considered an emergency fund per se but i would prioritize knocking off the 18 debt as a high priority once that crazy interest debt is gone fund the er and find a balance for savings and the next level er the 6 of expenses one one can choose to fund a roth ira but keep the asset out of retirement calculations it 's simply an emergency account returning tax free interest and if never used it eventually is retirement money a roth permits withdrawal of deposited funds with no tax or penalty just tracking it each year this actually some people the wrong way as it sounds like tapping your retirement account for emergencies for my purpose it 's a tax free emergency fund not retirement unless and until you are saving so much in the 401(k you need more tax favored retirement money i wrote an article some time ago the roth emergency fund which went into a bit more detail   last keep in mind this is my opinion i can intelligently argue my case but at some point it 's up to the individual to do what feels right paying 18 debt off a bit slower say 4 years instead of 3 in favor of funding the matched 401(k to me you run the numbers watch the 401(k balance grow by 2x your pretax deposits and see that in year 3 your retirement account is jump started and far far more than your remaining 18 cards those who feel the opposite and wish to be debt free first are going to do what they want and the truth is if this lets you sleep better at night i 'm in favor of it

you can withdraw from your rrsp to pay your taxes while not necessarily advisable it is permitted yet the tax consequences are no different just because you happen to be using the money to pay a prior year 's income tax balance due when you make the withdrawal from your rrsp an amount will be withheld towards your income tax for the withdrawal year assuming you have other income then you are likely to owe cra even more than the amount withheld because the withdrawal is effectively taxed at your marginal rate in that case consider the withholding tax merely a downpayment you 'll figure the final amount due when you file your next income tax return e.g. if you were to withdraw money from your rrsp today in 2015 to pay your 2014 income tax balance due then on your 2015 income tax return you 'll need to declare the withdrawn amount as income for 2015 you 'll get credit for the withholding taxes already paid when you made the withdrawal your tax return will indicate how much more you 'll need to pay to settle your 2015 taxes if you then pay your 2015 income tax balance due with an rrsp withdrawal in 2016 then repeat better to save up funds elsewhere e.g. in a bank account or a tfsa to cover an anticipated income tax balance owing

it is pretty much the same as a normal margin loan but cheaper because you do n't own the underlying if the margin is $ 1000 at 5 you could borrow $ 20000 in total so the actual amount would be $ in total that you would have to pay interest on so at the moment it is 5.1 which is $ days = $ a day and if the share price rises you do n't pay extra in interest costs unless you have borrowed still stays at a day until you have sold the shares

the main reason for paying your mortgage off quickly is to reduce risk should a crisis happen   if you do n't have a house payment you have much higher cash flow every month and your day to day living expenses are much lower so if an illness or job loss happens you 'll be in a much better position to handle it you should have a good emergency fund in place before throwing extra money at the mortgage so that you can cover the bigger surprises that come along there is the argument that paying off your mortgage ties up cash that could be used for other things but you need to be honest with yourself would you really invest that money at a high enough rate of return to make up your mortgage interest rate after taxes   or would you spend it on other things   if you do invest it how certain are you of that rate of return   paying off the mortgage saves you your mortgage interest rate guaranteed finally there is the more intangible aspect of what it feels like to be completely debt free with no payments whatsoever   that feeling can be a game changer for people and it can free you up to do things that you could never do when you 're saddled with a mortgage payment every month

andrew has a likely scenario for when greece defaults on its sovereign debt what happens when greece defaults    here are a few things every bank in greece will instantly go insolvent the greek government will every bank in greece the greek government will forbid withdrawals from greek banks to prevent greek depositors from rioting on the streets    when the    president had to flee by    helicopter from the roof of the    presidential to evade a mob of    such depositors the greek government    will declare a perhaps even    general martial law greece will all its debts into new drachmas or whatever    it calls the new currency this is a    classic ploy of countries defaulting the new drachma will devalue by some 30 70 per cent probably around 50 per    cent though perhaps more    effectively defaulting 50 per cent    or more of all greek euro denominated    debts as says there 's more at the link all depressing i think you 're focusing too much on greece leaving the euro and not enough on why greece would leave the euro greece would leave the euro precisely so that it could pay back its debt in a new currency worth less than valuable euros the new currency will devalue since that 's the point of leaving along the way the government forces its citizens to take the new currency the money they have in greek banks will be converted to the new currency the citizens do n't have a choice to keep their euros

this is the same as any case where income is variable   how do you deal with the months where expected cash flows are lower than projected when i got married my wife was in the habit of allocating money to be spent in the current month from income accrued during the previous month   this is slightly complicated because we account for taxes and benefit expenses withheld in the current months paychecks as current expenses but we allocate the gross income from that check to the following month for spending the benefit of spending only money made during the previous month is that income shocks are less shocking   i was working for a start up and they missed payroll that normally arrived on the first of the month   most of my co workers were calling the bank in a panic to avoid over draft fees with their mortgage payments but my mortgage payment was already covered   similarly when the same start up had a reduction in force on the first day of a new quarter i did n't have to pull any money from savings during the 3 weeks i was unemployed in the end you 're going to have to allocate money to the budget based on the actual income which is lower than your expectations   what part of the budget should fairly be reduced is a question you and your wife will have to figure out

the short answer is that it 's never the right time to buy an emerging technology as long as the technology is emerging you should expect that newer revisions will be both better and less expensive with solar specifically there are some tax credits to help the early adopters that may help you on the cost benefit analysis but in the end you still have to decide whether the benefits outweigh the costs now and if not whether that will change in the near future for me part of the solar benefit is the ability to generate electricity when the power goes out that option does require local battery storage however one of the benefits of using musk 's solar tiles instead of actual slate is the weight of the quartz tiles which is much lower than the weight of real slate in many cases a slate roof is heavy enough to require major reinforcement of the roof before installation the lower weight also saves significantly on shipping costs this is where musk can lower costs enough to be competitive to some of the materials he hope to compete with

you do not have to pay tax on any earnings inside a tfsa quoting wikipedia 's article investment income including capital gains and dividends earned in a tfsa is not taxed even when withdrawn this is backed up by the official tfsa government site which states investment income earned in a tfsa is tax free this makes the tfsa an appropriate vehicle to store investments which produce dividends for example if you invest $ 5500 and receive a total of $ 500 in dividends this year you will not pay tax on that $ 500 either in this tax year or even subsequently when you withdraw money out of your tfsa of course tfsas are n't meant to be used for regular withdrawals if you are planning on investing $ 5500 this year and withdrawing the dividends i 'd urge you to be careful and consider if this is actually the best sort of savings vehicle for you but that 's really just a general warning nothing specific to dividends it is possible to do this indeed withdrawing $ 500 in dividends this year will increase your available contribution room in the next tax year not in this tax year for example you contribute $ 5500 at the beginning of this year by the end of november you have accumulated $ 500 in dividends you withdraw these in december in the following tax year you can this $ 500 in addition to the standard $ 5500 contribution room so you could contribute $ 6000 just be careful with your calculations i messed mine up and ended up paying a rather substantial penalty for my overcontribution

you 're mostly correct although i think you 're missing something essential about no arbitrage versus an arbitrage argument   black scholes makes an arbitrage argument which is that the value of an option should be the same as any portfolio that has identical cash flows and this is generally a sound argument   notice however that bs is ultimately an equilibrium model it tells you the correct price of an option if the assumptions of bs hold and does n't necessarily match observed market prices   a no arbitrage condition or model deliberately incorporates observed prices or yields or whatever into the model so that there can not be an arbitrage opportunity implied by the model   this comes up a lot in term structure of interest rate problems where equilibrium models like or cox ross wo n't perfectly reproduce the current observed term structure and so imply an arbitrage opportunity   no arbitrage models like hull white specifically match the model 's term structure to observed yields prices so that there is no arbitrage opportunity between the observed term structure and your model of it   it 's important to note that this will still allow for arbitrage involving bonds that are not part of the observed term structure   as for equivalent martingale measures you might think about it more generally   the process involves changing the probability distribution from the actual which is hard to use for pricing to a different one that 's easier to use but will result in the same prices this is nearly always a risk neutral probability   you can think of equivalent martingale   pricing as asking how would this security behave and be priced in a world that is completely risk neutral and then making an argument that the prices are in fact equivalent   edit grammar

it 's not so much about time but about intent   if your intent is to move there permanently it would be when you arrive in the state for the purposes of living there i.e. not from a while before that when you went to check a place out or for an interview   i believe that most if not all states expect you to get a driver 's license from that state within of moving there something like a driver 's license or state id would be proof of your residency   these things vary greatly from state to state so you 'd have to research particular states   or find someone who 's done that already a bit of searching specifically for texas brought me to this forum thread if you he wish to establish residency here here being texas get a texas driver 's license and voter registration here government issued id with a texas address is pretty much bulletproof defense against being found to be a resident of elsewhere your battle if there is one will not be with texas but with your present home of record state and/or local government if there are income taxes associated with having been a resident there during the tax year which brings up the other question you would need to make sure that california does not have some provision that would cause you issues   this is n't so much a case of income from a company in the state as it about capital gains but it is still prudent to check

assuming you are being charged sales tax it all depends on where you take possession of the shipment are your suppliers shipping to a us address say your freight from where you handle the ongoing shipment or directly to you in south america if the latter per michael pryor 's answer you should not be charged sales tax if the former if the address is in a state in which your supplier has a physical location they will have to charge sales tax that said your freight should be able to furnish your supplier with a letter stating that the goods have been exported with a copy of the relevant bill of which will allow your supplier to refund you the taxes a company i was at before would allow refunds up to two years past the date of sale per various tax regulations alternatively you could see if just a letter of intent from your freight is enough to not charge you in the first place but that 's technically not proof of you might be able to get a refund or an exception from the state 's tax department directly but i would recommend going through your supplier much less hassle

very important returning again to the example of the farmer efficient liquid markets that fairly reflect the price of a given asset allow that farmer to run his business as cost effectively as he can that in theory lowers the price of his goods for the consumer if he was n't able to efficiently hedge he would have to charge a premium to reflect the price risk he takes on between planting and harvesting his corn   being pedantic here but single stock futures markets are extremely quiet if you were the owner of a company and you traded options on your company stock a hilariously common form of insider trading yes that would be illegal and the sec would certainly come after you

this is an answer grounded in reality not advice most states have no means of enforcing their foreign business entity registration statutes some states never even codified consequences california is a notable exception some states have business licenses that you need in order to defend your entity in court but will retroactively apply the corporate veil when you get the license the do i have to register question is analogous to asking a barber if you need a haircut but this does n't absolve you of looking in the mirror doing your research registration and income taxes are different stories if a state calls their fee a franchise tax and it is applicable and there are real consequences for not then you will have to pay that tax anyway this is n't advocating breaking the law but since it describes ignoring state chartered agencies then there are people that will disagree with this post despite being in line with business climate in the united states hope that helps

you are still paying a heavy price for the instant gratification of driving renting a brand new car that you will not own at the end of the terms it is not a good idea in your case since this luxury expense sounds like a large amount of money for you   edited to better answer question the most cost effective solution purchase a $ 2000 car now place the $ 300/mo payment aside for 3 years then go buy a similar car that is 3 years old you will have almost $ 10k in cash and probably will need minimal if any financing same as this answer from pete does this plan seem like a reasonable way to proceed or a big mistake reasonable is what you must decide as the first paragraph states you are paying a large expense to operate the vehicle whether you lease or buy you are still paying this expense especially from the depreciation on a new vehicle it does not seem reasonable to pay for this luxury if the cost is significant to you that said it will probably not be a big mistake that will destroy your finances just not the best way to set yourself up for long term success

banks have to disclose up front the annual percentage rate or interest rate that will be charged if you have an outstanding balance on a credit card however the apr of 19.9 is not charged all at once for example if you had a $ 100 dollar balance on your credit card you would not be charged 19.9 interest or making your new balance instead you would be charged the periodic rate which is one month 's interest you can easily calculate the period rate by dividing the apr by 12 so 19.9 equals per month this means if you had a $ 100 balance you would be charged interest or making your new balance ask the bank or look on the website for a document called cardholders agreement if you ca n't find a link ask them for a copy so you can read all the fine print ahead of time

as the other answer already states whether you should or should n't currency hedge your equity investments depends on a lot of factors if you decide to do so depending on your investment vehicles there might be a more cost efficient way than arranging a separate futures contract with a bank if you are open to or are already investing in etfs there are currency hedged versions of some popular etfs these are hedged against the currency risk for a specific currency for example if you are buying in and expecting to sell for usd you would buy an etf hedged to usd of course they have a higher expense ratio than non hedged etfs since the costs of the necessary contracts are included in the expenses

it surely does n't hurt to keep a receipt i tend to pile up receipts in my desk drawer never look at them and then every few months throw them all out if a vendor writes a receipt by hand or if the cash register is not tied in to the credit card system keeping a receipt could give you evidence against mistakes or fraud like if the vendor gives you a receipt for $ 10 and then sends a transaction to the credit card company for $ 20 you could use the receipt as evidence of the problem but if the vendor is trying to really cheat you the most likely thing for him to do is run the legitimate transaction through and then some time later run a fake transaction so say today you go to vendor x buy something for $ 20 and he bills your credit card $ 20 then a few days later he bills you another $ 100 even though you never came back to the store sure you have a receipt for $ 20 but you do n't have a receipt for the $ 100 because you never authorized that transaction your receipt proves nothing presumably you 're not disputing the $ 20 if you complain to the bank or go to the police or whatever saying hey look i do n't have a receipt for the $ 100 does n't prove anything how do they know you did n't just throw it away it 's difficult to prove that you never had such a receipt

start with the bank where you have your checking and savings account they can streamline some of the paperwork because they can see how much you make and have access to several years worth of bank statement legitimate mortgage companies do publish their rates but there is no guarantee that you will qualify for the best rate without them knowing your credit score salary and down payment information   there is no way to know that you have the best rate because of the time lag involved you will pick the best one you can work with but the rates can change every day   even when you lock in the rates other companies can drift lower once you have started down the application process you will reach a point where switching companies will cost you time and money once you decide to purchase a house the contract usually only gives you a few weeks to prove that you have financing in place therefore you will have to start the process before deciding on the house some advance work is needed to give you an idea of the maximum monthly payment you can afford which will then based on the rate and down payment determine the maximum house you can buy i have had good luck with my credit union but there is no guarantee that yours will be competitive keep in mind that while rates are very important some people also value customer service and also like that the mortgage wo n't be sold to out of town investors

i was in a similar but not quite as bad situation a couple years ago and i had a stroke of luck that helped me but your friend might be able to force a similar situation my parents refused to take out the huge parent loan understandably so but my dad made enough money that i was n't eligible for much aid   my stroke of luck came when they got divorced i could my fafsa with only one parent using my mom with very little income my aid shot through the roof and nearly covered my undergrad this happened in california i do n't know if this works in other states my advice for your friend would be to take the 6 units part time job option but do what she can to earn enough to pay her own rent food other bills   i think the requirement for filing as an independent is that you supply > 50 of your own income   it wo n't kick in right away but for next school year this would end up getting her a lot more money from the state federal governments   for me it was enough to cover my school food rent gas car payment and still have a little left over i do n't know if this is still possible and i know it does n't work for graduate school or if it applies to every state   it might be an option worth pursuing though

please find out whether you are considered to be a tax resident of the us from the date that you received the permanent immigrant visa or from the date that you first enter the us on that visa if the former and you received the visa after april 30 you might be a part year resident of india for indian income tax purposes for the current tax year you need to convert your bank accounts including fixed deposits the fds that you mention to nro accounts as soon as possible you will need to keep at least one nro account open for a year or more to receive the final interest payments on your fds as well as the proceeds of cashing in the fds not to mention any refunds of indian income tax that may be due to you for last year or the current year once you are done with all these follow the procedures outlined in this excellent answer by to transfer the money to your us account   at this point you can close the nro account if you wish as 's comment says it is not a good idea to bring a large sum of cash with you unless you are really really paranoid about banking channels note that if you insist on bringing cash whether it is inr or usd or negotiable instruments checks or bank drafts with you when you land in the us these will have to be declared on entry if the total exceeds us$ 10k. there is no limit to how much you can bring with you as long as you declare it transfers of your own money from india to the us is not taxable income to you in the us and income tax will already have been paid withheld on that money in india and so there is no income tax liability in india either on the sum transferred

one of the more subtle disadvantages to large credit card purposes purchases besides what the other answer mentions is that it makes you less prepared for emergencies if you carry a large balance on your credit card with the idea that your income can easily handle the payments to beat the no interest period you never know when you 'll have an unexpected emergency and you 'll end up having to pay less miss the deadline and end up paying huge interest even if you are about saving and budgeting what if your family comes under a large financial burden just as one possible example

the matching funds are free money so it is a very good idea to take that money off the table   look at it as free 100 return you deposit $ 1000 your employer matches that $ 1000 you now have $ 2000 in your 401(k   obviously i 'm keeping things simple   vesting schedules mean that the employer match is n't yours to keep immediately but rather after some time usually in chunks beyond the employer match you need to consider what is available for investment in a 401(k   typically your options are more limited then in an ira   the cost of the 401(k should be considered as it is n't trivial for most   the specifics will of course vary but in large ira accounts are cheaper so it 's about the opportunity costs   up to the employer match it does n't matter as much that your investment choices are more limited in a 401(k because you 're getting 100 return just on the matching funds   once that is exhausted you have more opportunity for returns due to having more options available to you by going with an account that provides more choices the overall principle here is that you have to look at the whole picture   this is similar to the notion that you should pay down your high interest debt before investing because from the perspective of investing the interest you 're paying represent a loss or negative return on investment since money is going out of your accounts   specific to your question you have to consider the various types of investment vehicles available to you   it is not just about 401(k and ira accounts   you may also consider a straight brokerage account a savings account cds etc   the costs and returns that you can typically expect are your guides through the available choices

as an individual i am not aware of any insurance you can buy that will cover legal costs for any event that may occur whether criminal or civil i imagine this is because the risk is too difficult to measure and the moral hazard too great i do notice you mention rental property small business needs   if your concern is truly for costs relating to some legal issue that arises out of your professional operations then   professional liability insurance may be what you are looking for oftentimes referred to as errors and or for short   this insurance is specific to whatever business you engage in however will typically protect you against legal claims including defense costs as a result of your business operations   note however that what is actually covered will be specific to your policy as duffbeer703 mentioned the purpose of insurance is for covering specific losses i.e. protecting you from legal claims that may arise during the course of business   if you are looking for a solution that will e.g. provide you a standard set of legal documents maybe a lease agreement then you are not in fact looking for insurance but instead legal services at a fixed rate why would an insurance company pay for services both you and it already know you need

you 're circling around the answer   the only real difference between a loddar and a privately issued promissory note is that the loddar is issued by a recognized third party with better credit credibility the whole merchant priest farmer cartel thing    private entities absolutely can and do issue their own promises to pay and accept them and in turn rely on those promises to make other promises it 's what you do when you charge something to a credit card on the basis of your employer 's promise to pay you charge new tires the tire store promises to pay its employees based on your cc company 's promise to pay the tire store which is based on your promise to pay the credit card company which is based on your employer 's promise to pay you which is based on your employer 's contracts with its customers and so on   in fact often as not the whole chain never actually gets reconciled with printed cash the central bank never has to print or even know about these transactions it 's just checks and electronic transfers promises all the way down maybe with occasional cash withdrawals for popcorn at the movies or to tip the or something    that does n't mean it 's not real money it absolutely is those promises are buying groceries and tires and making mortgage payments and paying dentist bills and getting people to dig up stuff out of mines that will be fashioned into ipads and all kinds of stuff   where this hurts most people in the brain is that they kind of accept dollar bills as and intrinsically valuable so trying to explain in reverse how they are the same as promissory notes or credit certificates is like trying to convince them that a plane ticket is the same as an airplane which is obviously not true    that 's why i started with this imaginary world without money if you let go of any and stop trying to think through the analogies and do n't read it trying to look for the outcome conclusions if you just read it and follow the story through it is obvious that the only intrinsic difference in that imaginary world between apple certificates loddars and privately issued ious is the credibility of the   trying to understand this stuff via analogy will make your head spin taking it all the way back to the thread topic and the question at the top of the page what makes it so difficult is the tendency and mental impulse to money as a thing that is somewhere and therefore has to go somewhere    but that 's an intrinsically and substantially imperfect analogy which is what makes it hard to explain to a five year old and you ca n't make the reality fit that analogy and stay sane even if you refuse to accept all this abstraction and insist on only doing transactions with physical cash or gold pieces the value of those markers is still 100 contingent on everyone accepting that everyone else will continue to believe that everyone else will continue to accept that currency   money is essentially a promise that other people will keep instead of giving you food your employer gives you a universal gift certificate that you can redeem anywhere and everyone else will accept it because they can in turn redeem it anywhere else the only difference between using a bank draft or printed dollar bill versus writing a promise to make good yourself is the credibility of the issuer    that 's a really difficult premise for most people to accept because it 's invisible and abstract and seems to conflict with tangible interactions you 've been doing all your life so we have this sort of tendency to try and force the reality to fit preconceived conceptual analogies like someone who keeps rejecting explanations of how airplanes can fly because that still does n't explain how metal can be lighter than air it 's demanding that the reality must fit a hypothesis that does n't apply    hope that helps

the first red flag here is that an appraisal was not performed on an as is basis and if it could not be done you should be told why getting an appraisal on an after improvement basis only makes sense if you are proposing to perform such improvements and want that factored in as a basis of the loan it seems very bizarre to me that a mortgage lender would do this without any explanation at all the only way this makes sense is if the lender is only offering you a loan with specific underwriting guidelines on house quality common with for instance va loans and how they require the roof be of a certain maximum age among dozens of other requirements and many loan products have their own standards this should have been disclosed to you during the process but one can certainly never assume anyone will do their job properly or it may have only mentioned in some small print as part of pounds of paper products you may have been offered or made to sign already the bank criteria is reasonable to the extent that generally mortgage companies are allowed to set underwriting criteria about the current condition of the house it does n't need to be reasonable to you personally or any of us it 's to protect lender profits by their risk models your plans and preferences do n't even factor in to their guidelines not all criteria are on a a sliding scale so it does n't necessarily matter how well you meet their other standards you are of course correct that paying for thousands of dollars in improvements on a house you do n't own is lunacy and the fact that this was suggested may on it 's own suggest you should cut your losses now and seek out a different lender   given the lender being the only reason to stick with it seems to be the sunk cost of the appraisal you 've already paid for i 'd suggest you specifically ask them why they did not perform an as is appraisal and listen to the answer if you can get one you can try to contact the appraiser directly as well with this question and ask if you can have the appraisal strictly as is without having a new appraisal they might be helpful they might not as for taking the appraisal with you to a new bank you might be able to do this or you might not it is strictly up to each lender to set criteria for appraisals they accept but i 've certainly known of people re using an appraisal done sufficiently recently in this way it 's a possibility that you will need to write off the $ 800 as an education expense but it 's certainly worth trying to see if you can salvage it and take it with you you 'll just have to ask each potential lender as i 've heard it go both ways it 's not a crazy or super rare request lenders backing out based on appraisal results should be absolutely normal to anyone in the finance business to do this you can just state plainly the situation you paid for an appraisal and the previous lender fell through and so you would like to know if they would be able to accept that and provide you with a loan without having to buy a whole new appraisal this would also be a good time to talk about condition requirements in that you want a loan on an as is basic for a house that is but needs cosmetic repair and you plan to do this in cash on your own time after the purchase closes some lenders will be happy to do this at below ltv and some absolutely do not want to make this type of loan because the house is n't in perfect condition and that 's just what their lending criteria is right now   based on description alone i do n't think you really should need to go into alternate plans like buy cash and then get a home equity loan to get cash out special rehab packages etc so i 'd encourage you to try a more straight forward option of a different lender as well as trying to get a straight answer on their odd choice of appraisal order that you paid for before trying anything more exotic or totally changing your purchase finance plans

from my limited experience having taken a class on bankruptcy in order to become a chapter 11 is the portion of the bankruptcy code that allows certain corporate entities to reorganize basically the entity files for bankruptcy protection to halt credit collections or any number of reasons and then work with the courts to get out if the entity can put together a reasonable sounding restructuring plan the court may allow them to do it a restructuring plan essentially is a plan of who to pay back when and by what means this is seriously a simple explanation it 's much more complex than this so if the court approves the plan the entity will attempt to carry it out and come out of bankruptcy several years down the road in a more solvent position if the court rejects the plan or the plan fails then the entity has to then engage in chapter 7 proceedings selling assets to pay off debts

you could debate the of tax policy endlessly there are lots of things in tax law that i think are bad ideas and probably a few here and there that i think are good ideas i am well aware that there are things that i think are good ideas that others think are bad ideas and vice versa   to your specific point i suppose you could say that having a place to live is a necessity but most people do not live in the absolute minimum necessary to give them a place to sleep and protection from the weather you could survive with a one room apartment with a bed on one side and a toilet and some minimal cooking facilities on the other most people have considerably more than that at some point that 's luxury and not necessity and if you want to push it you could live in a cardboard box under a bridge you do n't need a house or apartment to survive personally i think it 's absurd that as a home owner i get a deduction for my mortgage interest while if someone were to rent an identical house with a monthly rental equal to exactly the same amount that i am paying on my mortgage he would receive no deduction the stated goal of that one was to encourage home ownership but people who own homes are generally richer than those who rent so the net result is that the poor are paying higher taxes to help subsidize the homes of the rich and then the rich congratulate themselves on how they are giving these tax breaks to help make housing more affordable for poor people to reiterate @keshlam tax laws only makes sense when understood politically yes some people have fine ideas about what is fair and just others simply want tax breaks that benefit their business or people with tough financial situations that just happen by chance to resemble their own many of the people with noble ideas have little concept of what the implications of the policies they push are many of the ideas that some people view as worthy and noble others view as frivolous counter productive or even evil then you mash all these competing groups and interest together and see what comes out

a large number of bond holders decide to sell their bonds   if they all decide to do this at the same time then there will be a large supply of bonds being sold in the market   this will drive down the price of the bonds which will increase yields why do bond yields move inversely to bond prices you purchase a $ 100 bond today that yields 5   you spent $ 100   the very next day the same bonds are being sold with a yield of 10   if you wanted to sell your bond to someone you would have to sell it so it competed with the new bonds being sold   you could not sell it for $ 100 which is what you paid for it   you would have to sell it for less than the $ 100 you paid for it in order for it to have the equivalent yield of the new bonds being sold with a 10 yield   this is why bond yields move inversely to bond prices why does rising yields increase the cost of borrowing if someone is trying to sell new bonds they will have to sell bonds that compete with the yields of the current bonds already in the market if yields are rising on the existing bonds then the issuer of the new bonds will have to pay higher interest rates to offer equivalent yields on the new bonds the issuer is now paying more in interest making it more expensive to borrow money what are the incentives for the bond to sell his her bonds one reason a bond holder will sell his her bonds is they believe inflation will outpace the yield on the bond they are holding   if a bond yields 3 and inflation is at 5 then the bond holder is essentially losing purchasing power if they continue to hold onto the bond   another reason to sell would be if the bond holder has doubts in the ability of the issuer to repay the interest and/or principal of the bond

i 'll start with a question is the 63 k before or after taxes   the short answer to your question on how much is reasonable is it depends it depends on a lot more than where you live it depends on what you want do you want to pay down debt do you want to save are you trying to buy a house those will influence how much you can should let yourselves spend it also depends on your actual salary just because i spend 5 of my salary on something does n't mean to you if you 're making and i 'm only making 10,000   i also have a lot of respect for you trying to take this on it 's never easy but i would also recommend you start by trying to see what you can do to track how much you are actually spending that can be hard especially if you mostly use cash   once you 're tracking what you spend i still think you 're coming at this a bit backwards though rather than ask how much is reasonable to spend on those other expenses you basically need to rule out the bigger items first this means things like taxes your housing food transportation and kid related expenses i 've got 2.5 kids of my own i would guess that you 're listing your pre tax salaries on here so start first with whatever it costs you to pay taxes i 'm a us citizen living in berlin have n't filed uk taxes but says that on a year with 3 deductions your net earnings will actually be that 's   then what does it cost you each month for rent utilities etc to put a house over your family 's head the rule of thumb they taught in my home economics class was 35 40 but that 's not for europe you 'll know what it costs let 's say its a month 40 for rent and utilities and maybe insurance that leaves   the next necessity after housing is food my current food budget is about 5 6 of my after tax salary but that may not compare the cost to feed a family of 3 is a fairly fixed number and our salaries are n't the same as i said i am a us expat living in berlin so i looked at this cost of living calculator and it looks like groceries are about 7 10 higher there around than here in germany still i spend about 120 € per week on food that has a fair margin in it for splurging on ice cream and a couple it feeds me i 'm almost 2 m and about 100 kilos and my family of four let 's say you spend 100 £ a week on groceries for budgeting that 's £ a month 52 weeks 12 months = = weeks month but let 's call it that leaves   from here you 'll have to figure out the details of where your own money is going that 's why i said you should really start tracking your expenses somehow even just for a short time but for the purposes of completing the answers to your questions the next step is to look at saving before you try spending anything else a nice target is to aim for 10 of your after tax pay going into a savings account this is apart from any other investments let 's say you do that you 'll be putting away £ per month that leaves   as far as other expenses you need some money for transport you have n't mentioned but let 's say you 're spending another 500 £ there that would be about enough to cover one with the petrol you need to get around town that leaves 800 £ as far as a clothing budget and entertainment i usually match my grocery budget with what i call mad money that 's basically money that goes towards other stuff that i would love to categorize but that my wife gets annoyed with my efforts to drill into on a regular basis that 's another 500 £ which leaves   you mentioned debts assuming that 's a credit card at around 20 interest you probably pay 133 £ a month just in interest 20 = 0.20 12 = x 8,000 = 133 plus some nominal payment towards principal so let 's call it that leaves you with 125 £ of wiggle room assuming i have even caught all of your expenses and depending on how they 're timed you are probably feeling a serious squeeze in between paychecks i recognize that you 're asking specific questions but i think that just based on the questions you need a bit more careful backing into the budget and you really need to track what you 're spending for the time being until you can say right we usually spend about this much on x how can we cut it out   from there the basics of getting your financial house in order are across the interwebs make a budget stick to it pay down debts save develop goals and mini incentives rewards as a way to make sure your change your psyche about following a budget

fta yet this new study notes that subsidies are n’t simply cash being handed to oil companies subsidies often come in the form of tax breaks which is just one of the many ways oil companies receive government handouts   tax breaks are not subsidies   the taxpayer pay absolutely nothing to the oil companies when a tax break is applied   the taxpayers are actually net recipients from the drilling activity   if the existence of a tax break is a requirement for oil drilling profitability then elimination of the tax break would eliminate drilling   the taxpayers are choosing between zero additional tax revenue without tax breaks or some tax revenue with tax breaks so drilling can proceed   the article ’s point about export ports being subsidized by the taxpayer is a distraction   the vast majority of oil produced in the us is consumed in the us   all that oil is drilled transported refined transported again then sold to consumers in an end to end supply chain built on a vast sum of private capital

in general lump sum investing will tend to outperform dollar cost averaging because markets tend to increase in value so investing more money earlier will generally be a better strategy   the advantage of dollar cost averaging is that it protects you in times when markets are overvalued or prior to market corrections    as an extreme example if you done a lump sum investment in late 2008 and then suffered through the subsequent market crash it may have taken you 2 3 years to get back to even   if you began a dollar cost averaging investment plan in late 2008 it may have only taken you a 6 months to get back to even dollar cost averaging can also help to reduce the urge to time the market which for most investors is definitely a good thing

it depends on the business entity if the entity is a sole proprietorship or a general partnership the individual are considered to be the business there are no shares and so yes the owner would have to take on 75 of the expenses for example in the event of a lawsuit if the claimant were awarded $ 1,000,000 the 75 partner would be personally liable for $ 750,000 in the event of a corporation there are shares so the responsibility is on the management of the company not the owners to come up with money for the expenses of the business that money can come from the business capital which is the money owners have put in basically for a corporate entity the owner is not responsible for 75 of expenses for a partnership yes they are

is this a reasonable goal or will it be impossible to get a loan with    my almost non existent income i know i can put estimated rental revenue as income but i 'm not sure    if i would qualify banks typically only count rental income after you 've been collecting it for two years and at that point the banks will count 75 of it as income for loan qualification purposes   you 'd have to qualify for the mortgage without the potential rental income currently that means a 43 debt including proposed mortgage to gross income ratio even if you qualify you have to be prepared to handle repairs hvac water heater could fail on day 1 and tenants have a right to withhold rent if some repairs are n't made you also have to be able to weather non payment eviction of a tenant you could find a co maybe go in on a house with a friend but there are risks and complications that can arise there if a party becomes unable to pay or deciding how to split equity and expenses   if you had the income capital to comfortably pull it off without tenants then that 'd be a great situation college rentals tend to be lucrative i 'd recommend getting tenants with parental co signers to reduce risk if you qualify but would be in trouble quickly if one tenant stopped paying or a major appliance needed to be replaced then it 's probably not worth the risk

sadly most jurisdictions do n't think this way when they assign property taxes   you have x acres our standard for this county is $ y per acre so you owe $ property taxes     and if you tax by dwelling size and features you are saying a poor person can not live in a nice house   lets say joe millionaire buys a fancy $ 2 m house with a fancy pool and all the trimmings   sure joe millionaire can afford the high taxes of say $ 20k year   but what if jim who makes only $ 35k year spends 10 years and about $ 100k building a similar nice house out of scrap materials he finds purchases on sale or on craigslist etc   he rents a and   a gun and builds himself a fancy pool it really nice and the county comes in and says well jim that 's a $ 2 m house you owe us $ 20k year in taxes for it   jim ca n't afford it and the county takes his house for unpaid taxes   screw you and your efforts poor person   and before you say he can just sell it for $ 2 m well what if he made it unique to his tastes and no one wants to buy it   or the market is bad right now     and yes this has happened to someone i know though the house was valued at $ 500 k he still could n't afford the taxes   and since it was not yet fully finished he had to sell it for only about $ 100k after working on it for several years   so yes as long as you want to make sure poor people can not live in nice places property tax is the way to go

some things you should consider balance transfer debt consolidation if you get approved for the citibank 2 year interest free credit card on balance transfers you will need another loan of $ 18 k to consolidate your other debt if you can not get approval for the credit card you may need to get consolidation loan approval for your full $ 35 k of debt this approval again will depend on your income and your ability to make repayments as it sounds like you do n't have any assets you may have to get an unsecured loan which comes with higher interest rates remember a consolidation loan is only worthwhile if you can get an interest rate lower than your current interest rates and if you pay as much as possible to reduce the term of the loan and the total interest you end up paying you have n't given the interest rate for the consolidation loan but lets assume you could get one at 12 p.a over a 3 year period for a loan of $ 18 k you would have to pay $ per week together with the $ per week you would have to pay the credit card balance transfer your total repayments per week for the first 2 years would be $ then $ per week for the 3rd year this option sounds affordable but without knowing what your income and current expenses are it is hard for others to determine for sure if you had to get a consolidated loan for the full $ 35 k at say 12 p.a then your weekly repayments would be $ over a 3 year period this looks to be achievable too being disciplined as you said you will need to be very disciplined in order to get out of this debt you will need to set up a proper budget and watch every dollar you spend you will need to restrict any spending on credit cards and getting any new personal loans you say you will keep a small credit limit to pay for ongoing online payments for courses make sure you uses a 55 day interest free credit card preferably with no annual fee for this and pay the full amount due every month so you do n't end up paying any more interest on this card in case of death would my debts pass on to my next of kin or family if your debts are unsecured which personal loans and credit cards are then no your next of kin or family will not have to pay your debts if you die when you die any money or assets which would be sold in your estate will first be used to pay off any of your debts if there is not enough money or assets in your estate then your remaining debts may not need to be paid other people are only responsible for paying your debts after you die if bankruptcy an alternative to bankruptcy is a part 9 debt agreement as i mentioned in my answer to your previous question in this case you will still need to pay off at least part of the debt but will not be charged any further interest on the debt this is not as severe as bankruptcy but as i mentioned before should not be taken lightly like bankruptcy a debt agreement will appear on your credit file for seven years and your name will be listed on the national personal insolvency index forever bankruptcy or a debt agreement should only be used as a last resort if you are unable to undertake any other option and remember even if you do take this course of action you will still need to be disciplined now and into the future so you do n't end up in a similar situation again

firstly there is also a lifetime tax allowance if the father 's estate including other gifts given in his lifetime is unlikely to exceed that allowance it might be simplest simply to give the whole amount now and count it against the allowance right now the allowance is $ m but that seems quite a big political football and it 's the allowance when you die that matters looking back at past values for the allowance $ 1 m seems like a pretty safe amount to bet on if you want to avoid minimize the use of that allowance i would make a loan structured as a mortgage that will have $ 14 k payments each year which can then be forgiven the points in rick 's answer about an appropriate rate and being able to give more if more notional donors and recipients can be used also apply so for example in the first year hand over $ 200 k at 3.5 and immediately forgive $ the next year forgive the interest charge of $ 6.5 k and capital of $ given the age of the daughter i guess the father might well die before its all paid off that way leaving some residue to be forgiven by the estate and thus potentially incurring estate taxes there might also be state gift estate taxes to consider edited to reflect 2014 gift and lifetime exclusion limits

i think wikipedia offers a very good explanation a dividend reinvestment program or dividend reinvestment plan drip is an equity investment option offered directly from the underlying company the investor does not receive quarterly dividends directly as cash instead the investor 's dividends are directly reinvested in the underlying equity the investor must still pay tax annually on his or her dividend income whether it is received or reinvested this allows the investment return from dividends to be immediately invested for the purpose of price appreciation and compounding without incurring brokerage fees or waiting to accumulate enough cash for a full share of stock so essentially a dividend reinvestment plan is offered by companies directly allowing investors to bypass brokerages and immediately re invests dividends rather than paying them out in cash investopedia also gives a definition a plan offered by a corporation that allows investors to reinvest their cash dividends by purchasing additional shares or fractional shares on the dividend payment date   a drip is an excellent way to increase the value of your investment most drips allow you to buy shares commission free and at a significant discount to the current share price most drips do n't allow much lower than $ 10   i had a hard time finding a comprehensive listing of companies that offered or drips but offers these suggestions   finding a dividend reinvestment plan offers one stop shopping for hundreds of dividend reinvestment plans they offer a searchable list that can be filtered to easily find a dividend reinvestment plan that fits your needs you can also use probably the best way to find out if a company offers a dividend reinvestment plan is to visit the company website most companies have an investor relations area that will highlight the various options available to for example coca cola disney and wal mart hope this helps

nyt a nifty infographic that shows how the s&p 500 performs over various time horizons if you study it for a bit you 'll see that 10 percent is not likely over time that you 'll earn 10 percent annually after inflation most people quoting the higher number are working with numbers before inflation   the above linked chart is misleading in the following sense it groups into five categories who 's boundaries are by percentages of interest but we 'd rather see them clustered by those percentages for example percent falls into the neutral category better than investing in fixed interest securities but still below market average but 7.1 falls into the above average category the effect is that we will treat the neutral color that dominates the long term trend as being somewhere in the middle of 3 7 when i suspect that 's not the case some day i 'll probably make my own version and see how that plays out   so that all said if you look at the 30 year diagonal you can see there 's still quite a bit of variation in returns unfortunately i ca n't turn this into a single number for you but grab a spreadsheet and some market data if you want one

there are two reasons to do a reverse split   those partial shares will then be turned into cash and returned to the investors for large institutional investors such as mutual funds or pension funds it results in only a small amount of cash because the fund has merged all the investors shares together if the company is trying to meet the minimum price level of the exchange they have little choice if they do n't do the reverse split they will be delisted if the goal is to reduce the number of investors they are using one of the methods of going private a publicly held company may its equity securities when they    are held by less than 300 shareholders of record or less than 500    shareholders of record where the company does not have significant    assets depending on the facts and circumstances the company may no    longer be required to file periodic reports with the sec once the    number of shareholders of record drops below the above thresholds a number of kinds of transactions can result in a company going    private including

the standard customer is actually pretty with bofa because he gets access to the large number of branches for free but that money has to come from somewhere that service is n't free bofa gets it from those who are less responsible with their money alternatively bofa can just charge everybody evenly across the board due to low interest rates deposits are not very profitable they can not lower the interest on your savings account any more banks are actually losing money on most of their depositors because the stuff involved with maintaining an account costs money that 's why some banks are actively doing things to push some depositors away some banks even charge you money to store money in the bank   logically it makes sense for me to bank at a place where the profits are not squeezed from me so as someone who does n't get hit with fees i 'm happy with that might sound weird but logic dictates that i go to where i get the best value

you probably want to think about pools of money separately if they have separate time horizons or are otherwise not interchangeable a classic example is your emergency fund which has a potentially immediate time horizon vs. your retirement savings the emergency fund would be all in cash or very short term bonds and would not count in your retirement asset allocation since the emergency fund usually has a capped value a certain amount of money you want to have for emergencies rather than a percentage of net worth value this especially makes sense you have to treat the emergency fund separately or you 'd have to keep changing your asset allocation percentages as your net worth rises hopefully with respect to the capped emergency amount similarly say you are saving for a car in 3 years you 'd probably invest that money very conservatively also it could not go in tax deferred retirement accounts and when you buy the car the account will go to zero so probably worth treating this separately on the other hand say you have some savings in tax deferred retirement accounts and some in taxable accounts but in both cases you 're expecting to use the money for retirement in that case you have the same time horizon and goals and it can pay to think about the taxable and nontaxable accounts as a whole in particular you can use asset location put less tax efficient assets in tax deferred accounts in this case maybe you would end up with mostly bonds in the tax deferred accounts and mostly equities in the taxable accounts for tax reasons the asset allocation would only make sense considering all the accounts since the taxable account would be too equity heavy and the tax deferred one too bond heavy there can be practical reasons to treat each account separately too though for example if your broker has a convenient automatic rebalancing tool on their website it probably only works within an account treating each account by itself would let you use the automatic rebalancing feature on the website while a more complicated asset location strategy where you rebalance across multiple accounts might be too hard and in practice you would n't get around to it getting around to rebalancing could be more important than tax motivated asset location you could also take a keep it simple attitude as long as your asset allocation is pretty balanced say 40 bonds and includes a cash allocation that would cover emergencies you could just put all your money in one big portfolio and think of it as a whole if you have an emergency withdraw from the cash allocation and then rebuild it over time if you have a major purchase you could redeem some bonds and then rebuild the bond portion over time when i say over time i 'm thinking you might start putting new contributions into the now assets or you might dollar cost average back into them by selling bits of the now assets anyway there 's no absolute rule it depends on what 's simple enough to be manageable for you in practice and what separate shorter horizon investing goals you have in addition to retirement you can always make things complex but remember that a simple plan that happens in real life is better than a complex plan you do n't keep up with in practice or a complex plan that takes away from activities you 'd enjoy more

the setting of interest rates or repurchase rates varies from country to country as well as with the independence of the central bank there are a number of measurements and indices that central bankers can take into account this is a limited overview but should give an indication of just how complex tracking inflation is let alone attempting to control it   house prices are in the mix but which house or which price the choice of what to measure faces the difficulty of attempting to find a basket which really affects the majority regularly and not everyone is buying several new houses a year so the majority are ring from fluctuations in prices at the capital end but not from the interest rate end and this is only when the various agencies statistics central bank labour etc are independent   in countries like venezuela or argentina government has taken over release of such data and it is frequently at odds with individual experience links for the us and for australia

from what i understand they basically hold on to your money while you stop paying your debt   they keep it in an account and negotiate on your behalf the longer you go without paying the less the debt collector is willing to take and at some point they will settle   so they take the money you 've been putting into their account and pay it down   repeat the process for all your accounts i basically did this without using a service i had $ 17,000 on one card and they bumped the interest rate to 29 and i had lost my job i did n't pay it for 7 months   i just planned on filing bankruptcy   they finally called me up and said if you can pay $ 250 a month until it 's paid off we will drop the interest to 0 and forgive all your late fees i did that and five years later it was paid off similar situation happened on my other cards   it seems once they realize you ca n't pay is when they 're willing to give you a break   it 'd be nice they just never jacked up your rate to 30 though so forget the service just do it yourself   call them up and ask and if they do n't budge do n't pay it of course your credit will be shot   but i 'm back in the so anything is possible over time

in my experience even with such pos machines there is a display that asks you to confirm your total as a very last step even if they ask if you want a receipt as a first step by this manner it would be nearly impossible for the teller to change the total without you noticing so long as you read the total given to you by the device   the scam in question is more likely to happen in a restaurant with the additional tip segment allowing someone to give themselves more of a tip than you initially wrote onto the receipt this is the only way i believe you would have a feasible chance of being cheated like this

md tech 's answer is correct let me only point out that there are easier ways to invest in the djia index without having to buy individual stocks you can buy a mutual fund or etf that will track the index and your return will be almost identical to the performance of the underlying index it 's almost identical because the fund will take a small management fee you will have to pay annual taxes on capital gains if you hold the investment in a taxable account and because the fund has to actually invest in the underlying stocks there will be small differences due to rounding and timing of the fund 's trades you also ask assuming that i calculated those numbers correctly is this gain    approximately better equal to or worse than an average investment    for that while people argue about the numbers index funds tend to do better than average depends on what you call average of course they do better than most actively managed funds too and since they have low management fees index funds are often considered to be an important part of a long term investment portfolio because they require very little activity on your part other than buying and holding

after seeing your most recent comment on the original question it looks like others have answered the question you intended and described the extreme difficulty of getting the timing right the way you 're trying to since i 've already typed it up what follows answers what i originally thought your question was which was asking if there were drawbacks to investing entirely in money market funds to avoid stock volatility altogether money market funds have the significant drawback that they offer low returns one of the fundamental principles in finance is that there is a trade off between low risk and high returns while money market funds are extremely stable their returns are paltry under current market conditions you can consider them roughly equivalent to cash on the other hand though investing in stocks puts your money on a roller coaster returns will be on average substantially higher since people often invest in order to achieve personal financial stability many feel naturally attracted to very stable investments like money market funds however this tendency can be a big mistake the higher returns of the stock market do n't merely serve to an investor 's greed they are necessary for achieving most people 's financial goals for example consider two hypothetical investors saving for retirement over the course of a career the first investor apprehensive adam invests $ 10k per year in a money market fund the second investor brave barbara invests $ 10k per year in an s&p 500 index fund reinvesting dividends let 's be generous and say that adam 's money market fund keeps pace with inflation in reality they typically do n't even do that at the end of 40 years in today 's money adam will have $ 10,000 40 = $ 400,000 not nearly enough to retire comfortably on on the other hand let 's assume that barbara gets returns of 7 per year after inflation which is typical though not guaranteed barbara will then have using the formula for the future value of an annuity $ 10,000 1 0.07 or about $ 2,000,000 which is much more comfortable while adam 's strategy produces nearly guaranteed results those results are actually guaranteed failure barbara 's strategy is not a guarantee but it has a good chance of producing a comfortable retirement even if her timing is n't great over these time scales the chances that she will have more money than adam in the end are very high i wo n't produce a technical analysis of this claim as it 's a bit complicated do more research if you 're interested

it 's not quite clear what you are asking so i 'll answer a few possible interpretations businesses pay taxes on their profits so if your business took a million pounds in revenue e.g. sold a million pounds worth of stuff then you would subtract roughly speaking everything the business spent on making and selling that stuff and pay taxes only on the profit vat however is a different matter and you would have to pay vat on all of that income technically the vat portion is n't even income it 's tax you are forced to collect on behalf of the government if your business made a million pounds pounds profit it would pay tax on all of that million subject to what a tax accountant can do to reduce that which ought to be considerable   you ca n't subtract your personal living expenses like that however the company can pay you a salary which counts as an expense and the company does n't pay tax on that you might also take some money from the company as dividends both salary and dividends count as personal income to yourself and you will need to pay personal income tax on them   as for the ferrari it depends on whether you can justify it as a business expense a lot of companies provide cars for their employees so that they can use them for business however you have to be able to show that is for business otherwise they are taxed like salary the rules for company cars are quite complicated and you would need an accountant if this is a real rather than hypothetical situation definitely get a tax accountant involved

as per irs publication question is money received from the sale of inherited property considered taxable income answer    to determine if the sale of inherited property is taxable you must first determine your basis in the property the basis of property inherited from a decedent is generally one of the following for information on the fmv of inherited property on the date of the decedent ’s death contact the executor of the decedent ’s estate also note that in 2015 congress passed a new law that under certain circumstances requires an executor to provide a statement identifying the fmv of certain inherited property to the individual receiving that property check irs.gov for updates on final rules being to implement the new law if you or your spouse gave the property to the decedent within one year before the decedent 's death see publication 551 basis of assets report the sale on schedule d form 1040 capital gains and losses and on form 8949 sales and other of capital assets under the new law passed by congress in 2015 an accuracy related penalty may apply if an individual reporting the sale of certain inherited property uses a basis in excess of that property ’s final value for federal estate tax purposes again check irs.gov for updates on final rules being to implement the new law for estates of who died in 2010 basis is generally determined as described above however the executor of a decedent who died in 2010 may elect out of the estate tax rules for 2010 and use the modified carryover of basis rules    under this special election the basis of property inherited from a decedent who died during 2010 is generally the lesser of under this special election for estates of who died in 2010 the executor of the decedent ’s estate may increase the basis of certain property that beneficiaries acquire from a decedent by up to $ 1.3 million plus certain unused built in losses and loss if applicable but the increased basis can not exceed the fmv of the property at the date of the decedent ’s death the executor may also increase the basis of certain property that the surviving spouse acquires from a decedent by up to an additional $ 3 million but the increased basis can not exceed the fmv of the property at the date of the decedent ’s death the executor of the decedent ’s estate is required to provide a statement to all heirs listing the decedent ’s basis in the property the fmv of the property on the date of the decedent ’s death and the additional basis allocated to the property contact the executor to determine what the basis of the asset is report the sale on schedule d form 1040 and on form 8949 as described above additional information

get everything in writing that includes ownership money in money out who is allowed to use the place how much they need to pay the other partners who pays for repairs whether to provide friends and family discounts who is allowed to sell what happens if someone dies how is the mortgage set up what to do if one of you becomes delinquent etc etc etc money and friends do n't mix and that 's mostly because people have different ideas in their head about what fair means anything you do n't have in writing if it comes up in a disagreement could cause a friendship ending fight even if you are able to agree on every term and condition under the sun there 's still a problem what if 5 years from now someone decides that a certain clause is n't fair imagine one of you needs to move into the condo because your primary residence was pulled out from under you they crash at the condo because they have no where else to go you try to demand payment but they lost their job the agreement might say you must pay the partnership if you use the condo personally at the standard monthly rate of days but what is the penalty clause is everything under penalty of eviction and forced sale of the condo and distribution of profits following through on such a penalty means the friendship would be over you would feel guilty about doing it and also about not doing it at the same time your other partner loses their job and ca n't make 1/3rd of the mortgage payments anymore they need the rent or the bank will foreclose on their house etc etc etc even things like maintenance are the 3 of you going to do it yourselves labour distributed how will anyone get a management fee what about a referral fee for a new renter once you 've thought of all possible circumstances and rules and drafted it in writing go talk to a lawyer and maybe an accountant there will be many things you wo n't have considered yet and paying a few grand today will save you money and friends in the future

shipping costs tariffs mexico and us have nafta so comes in cheap to the country and local and national taxes   is made in mexico and is a short truck ride across the border to be distributed to get to australia it goes much slower and can cause more of the product to go bad before it gets there hence the cost goes up   same with budweiser except it has even less distance to travel within the states   by the way the us also has heavy sin taxes on alcohol i 'd imagine both of these products are cheaper in mexico   also i assume you are not exchanging $ 1 aus = $ 1 us right

just like they are cracking down gold and other stores of value i 'm unsure how you think that bitcoin falls outside of regulations that apply to all wealth and stores of value it 's not like you are allowed to buy drugs or not pay taxes as long as you do n't use us dollars   the fact that bitcoin and all other crypto currency are not controlled by any single entity government or business that can control the rules at thier will is a pretty big deal i would think the obvious freedom from a single entity seems pretty useful to me   obviously the and high transaction fees makes it a pretty questionable store of value for now considering the of bitcoin it 's not really that surprising at least those fees are based on the market and not just the whim of visa

i say this with all due understanding if they 're only there for the money if that 's what motivates them i do n't want them in the government we are better off without them really   maybe i confused things by saying bubble because it is n't just that but i do n't want the attitude that because one is educated or powerful one is deserving of better   i understand that you might not be saying that and you might be saying let 's use them well but alas this is too subtle a line and too easy to slip   if big dollars hinge on a particular situation being optimized let a manager make a case by case exception but the norm is not that   and by the mindset leads to a creeping overall theory that government needs to insulate itself from its own effects   it 's presumably why congress gets its own health care because these people are too important to be sick but then in having done that we reduce the pressure to make it work for everyone i 'm sorry i just do n't agree it 's a legitimate position you stake out clearly presented i am just not buying it

government subsidies could be provided if we could all agree what activities are of higher social worth this is not an insurmountable obstacle   for example in hong kong and singapore civil servants are paid vastly more than in the us the reasons are that society wants to attract some of its best people to serve in these positions and they want to insulate them from the temptation of corruption in effect these positions are considered to be of high social worth and society rewards them accordingly    also note that hk and singapore have even freer capitalist market societies than the us speaking of economic freedom here

suppose that i work from home but do not qualify for a business use    of home deduction as i understand it this means i can not deduct    trips from home to another work location e.g. going to a client 's    home or office to do work there i do not think this is true you can not deduct trips to your main business location i.e. you can not deduct trips to your office or client 's location if this is your main client and you routinely work on site however if you only visit your clients on occasion for specific events while doing your routine work at home you can definitely deduct those trips the deduction of the home usage itself has nothing to do with it however there 's a different reason they refer to pub your home must qualify as principal place of business even if it does n't qualify for deduction the qualifications of principal place of business are described in pub if for some personal reason you do not go directly from one location to the other you can not deduct more than the amount it would have cost you to go directly from the first location to the second what is not clear to me is what exactly is deductible if there are    significant time gaps within a single day between trips to different    clients you got it right what this quote means is that if you have client a and client b and you drive from a to b you can only deduct the travel between a and b nothing else i.e. if you have 2 hours to kill and you take a trip to the mall you can not deduct the mileage attributable to that trip you only deduct the actual distance between a and b as it would be had you driven from a to b directly the example you cite re first client being considered as the place of business is for the case where your home does n't qualify as principal place of business in this case you start counting miles from your first client and only for direct trips from client to client if you only have 1 client in that day tough luck nothing to deduct also it 's not clear whether between clients would really be    personal reasons since the appointment times are often set by the    client so it 's not as if the delay between a and b was just because i    felt like it there was never the option of going directly from a to    b. that 's what is called facts and circumstances you can argue that you had enough time between meetings to go back to your home office to continue working the irs agent auditing you and you 're likely to get audited will consider that maybe will accept it maybe not if i had a gap like that described above i could save on my taxes by    going to the park or a hamburger stand instead of going home between a    and b but then you would n't be at home so why would it be principal place of business if you 're not there boom lost deduction for the trip to the first client i suggest you talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state you 're dealing with deductions that are considered red flags for the irs i.e. many people believe that these deductions business use of your home car trigger audits to substantiate business use of your car you need to keep very good track of your travels literally travel log they sell them at staples and make sure to distinguish between personal travel and business travel keep proofs that the meetings took place although keeping a log is a requirement it can be faked so if audited the irs will want to see more than your own documentation a good tax adviser will educate you on all these rules and also clarify the complexities you were asking about here i 'm not a tax adviser so do n't rely on this answer when you 're preparing your tax return or responding to the irs audit in your edit you ask this specifically what i 'm wondering is whether it is possible for a home    to qualify as a principal place of business for purposes of    deducting car expenses but not for the home office deduction the answer is yes deductibility is determined by exclusivity of use among other things but the fact that you manage your business from your kitchen does n't make your kitchen any less of a principal place of business it is non deductible because you also cook your dinners there but it is still nonetheless your principal place of business the pub which i linked to has these qualifications your home office will qualify as your principal place of business if    you meet the following requirements you use it exclusively and regularly for administrative or management activities of your trade or business you have no other fixed location where you conduct substantial administrative or management activities of your trade or business as you see exclusivity of the usage of your home area is not a requirement here the exclusively and regularly in the quote refers to your business not using any other location and managing it from home regularly i.e. if you manage your business a day in a year that 's not enough for it to be considered principal if you manage your business from your office and your home you can not consider home as principal

there are a number of ways to measure such things and they are generally called sentiment indicators   the ones that i have seen work in the sense that they show relatively high readings near market tops and relatively low readings near market bottoms   the problem is that there are no thresholds that work consistently   for example at one market top a sentiment indicator may read 62   at the next market top that same indicator might read 55   so what threshold do you use next time   maybe the top will come at 53 or maybe it will not come until 65 there was a time when i could have listed examples for you with the names of the indicators and what they signaled and when   but i gave up on such things years ago after seeing such wide variation   i have been at this a long time 30 + years and i have not found anything that works as well as we would like at identifying a top in real time   the best i have found although it does give false signals is a drop in price coupled with a bearish divergence in breadth   the latter is described in weinstein 's secrets for profiting in bull and bear markets market bottoms are a little less difficult to identify in real time   one thing i would suggest if you think that there is some way to get a significant edge in investing is to look at the results of mark 's monitoring of newsletters   virtually all of them rise and fall with the market and almost none are able to beat buy and hold of the wilshire 5000 over the long term

i just wanted to add one factor to the other answers the cost of maintenance etc is not a fraction of the cost of financing it is more likely a fraction of the value of the house and a function of its age if you say you need to replace a roof every 25 years and that costs $ 10,000 depends on the size of the house obviously then you need to set aside $ 400 a year for roof repair other costs painting flooring kitchen bathrooms water heaters heating ac yard upkeep etc can be roughly estimated in the same way a rule of thumb is 1 of the value of the house per year to cover all big ticket maintenance if you pay 4 mortgage that would increase the reserve by 25 but if interest rates rise the fraction may be smaller i remember paying over 10 mortgage in general whether keeping a property for long term rental income with the potential for appreciation but prices can go up and down is a good idea will largely depend on your ability to predict future costs and value if you have a variable mortgage that will be harder to do

how would you respond to these cases limited card options if someone has a bad credit record the cards available may only be those with an annual fee   not everyone will have your credit record and thus access to the cards you have some annual fees may be waived in some cases thus someone may have a card with a fee that could be waived if enough transactions are done on the card   thus if someone gives enough business to the credit card company they will waive the fee on the point of the rewards if the card is from a specific retailer there could be a 10 discount for using that card and if the person purchases more than a couple thousand dollars worth from that store this is a savings of $ 200 from the retail prices compared to what would happen in other cases that more than offsets the annual fee   if someone likes to be a handyman and visits home depot often there may be programs to give rewards in this case credit cards can be useful for doing on line purchases flight reservations rental cars and a few other purchases that to with cash or debit can be difficult if not close to impossible some airline cards have a fee but presumably the perks provide a benefit that outweigh that fee over the year i 'm thinking of the citibank cards tied to american airlines first year free then an $ 85 fee

why are self checkout lanes always available because people do n't want the do extra work   sure this is be a good idea in a small convenience store setting but not a large grocery store   it just seems like a complete logistical nightmare especially with produce   with massive upfront construction costs or costs and then add in the new preventative maintenance and monitoring costs   do you truly see savings when cashiers are cheap   on top of everything you are still going to have lines   a week 's worth of groceries does n't bag itself

financing a portfolio with debt on margin leads to higher variance that 's the whole point let 's say it 's 50 50   on the downside with 100 equity you can never lose more than your whole equity but if you have assets of 100 of which 50 is equity and 50 is debt your losses can be greater than 50 which is to say more than the value of your equity the reverse is true you can make money at twice the rate if the market goes up but you pay your money and you take your chances punch

all of their recommendations are about 3 decades too late   the resistant strains that are currently such a major problem etc were bred for the most part back in the 1960 's they actually pre existed antibiotics but the use abuse of antibiotics clear the ground of other bacteria and allow them to   what then happened is that the medical industry engaged in a combination of ridiculously sloppy hygiene see they did n't need to worry about things like washing hands between patients because they could always just pump people full of yet another wonder drug antibiotic and they also engaged in cover their arse denial and self delusion which allowed the proverbial monkey to get out of the cage   yes later antibiotic usage in animals to cause inordinate weight gain really only needed in artificially confined animals who by definition have suppressed immune systems and generally gain weight slower than non confined animals has worsened the situation as far as animal infections which despite the seldom crossover into humans but   the real problem with the future viability of antibiotics in human lies entirely at the feet of the medical profession and this kind of pr attempt to blame someone else is utter bs

these statements are n't necessarily contradictory in the first case investors are bearish because they anticipate selling in the future because all the interested buyers have bought so all that remains in the short run are people willing to sell and therefore drive down the price   in the second case the trend is strengthened because the increase in volume indicates that the price movement interested a lot of traders the trend could be bullish or bearish   the statements are n't contradictory because the second case could very well lead to the first case for example if an increase in price is coupled with an increase in volume this could indicate that the positive trend is strengthening second case traders are becoming more interested in the price move so they buy   however once all of the traders who are willing to enter the market long do so we 're in the first case investors realize that all of the traders who were interested in buying have bought so they become bearish because they expect selling to start soon

all fair points and i agree that there is no silver bullet perhaps it 's human nature maybe a product of our ideologies whatever but i think you hit it on the head when you said that people treat their agenda as a perfect solution when in reality there is no such thing automation will kill jobs livable wage is variable not everyone fits a uniform mold and conversely not every business operates the same some are completely profit driven others are more conscious of their societal obligations regardless of legal requirement so all businesses into the same obligations seems like a losing battle as well if the long term data backs up the finding that higher minimum wages kill jobs at a disproportionate rate when accounting for factors like automation then the evidence should be conversely i do believe that we will reach a point possibly even in this lifetime where so much automation exists there will be fewer and fewer opportunities to get your foot in the door or things of that nature and a universal basic income will be needed how that is paid for what the societal and social implications are those are questions for another day but that day is also fast approaching

for many people giving to charity will have minimal effect on their taxes non profits love to attract donations by saying the money is tax deductible but for most people it does n't work out that way you will only itemize deductions if they exceed your standard deduction the irs allows you to either itemize your deductions where you list each deduction you can take or take the standard deduction consider a married couple filing jointly in 2011 their standard deduction is $ they are in the 28 tax bracket they donate $ 100 of old clothes to the goodwill and are looking forward to deducting that on your taxes and getting $ 28 of that back if that 's their only deduction though they 'd have to give up the standard deduction to take the itemized deduction not worth it suppose instead they have $ 11,500 of deductions in 2011 now we 're talking right no the tax impact of itemizing is only $ 28 since they only exceeded the standard deduction by $ 100 the cost of having a tax accountant fill out the form probably offsets that small gain there 's also all the time that went in to tracking those deductions over the year not worth it   tax deductions only become worthwhile when they significantly exceed the standard deduction you need some big ticket items to get past the itemized deduction threshold for most people this only happens when they have a mortgage as the interest on a residence is deductible   folks love to suggest that having a mortgage is a good deal because the interest is deductible however since you have to exceed the standard deduction before it makes sense to itemize it 's not likely to be a big win for most people tl;dr give to charity because you want that charity to have your money tax implications are minimal let your accountant sort it out disclaimer i am not an accountant

sidebar on gold and gold backed currency and stuff like that   because i said i would get to it   the above pretend history of the pretend village is not how modern money actually came to be in reality things are much less sequential and happen much more without the moments the above was a parable to illustrate how money works to a 5-year old not an actual history of how money emerged    until fairly recent times paper money was not really very useful or practical for most purposes especially if you wanted to spend money in a different village than where it was printed    if we go back in time a period before atms wire transfers widespread literacy etc then a piece of paper written in is not likely to get you very far in you could take your apples and deer and shoes around with you to trade but the earliest naturally emerging currencies tend to be hard things that were rare and easily identifiable colored etc and they frequently with the personal of the rich in a self reinforcing feedback loop people with a surplus of time and food could decorate themselves with pretty things which became valuable as status symbols which made them more valuable as which made them more valuable as barter objects which made them more prestigious shows of wealth etc   gold emerged as a sort of inevitable global currency before people even thought of it as currency it is rare portable easy to identify can easily be made into jewelry and can be easily quantified unlike say or seashells which are harder to treat as a substance once word got around that rich people like it it became easy to barter with anyone anywhere for anything    in the early stages it was not really the same thing as money it was just an easy thing to barter but it had money like characteristics   if someone walked into your apple orchard offering to trade a yellow rock for apples you might look at them a little funny what use does an apple grower have for a yellow rock   but if you know that rich people in town this soft yellow metal as something they can make jewelry out of then you might be happy to trade apples for it    once everyone knows that rich people will trade for this stuff it becomes something like actual currency neither the hunter the shoemaker nor the fisherman in town has much use for it but because they know they can redeem it for the stuff they do want and need it becomes a sort of transferable iou that can be redeemed anywhere i.e. money    the early history of paper money did not evolve the way i described in the earlier posts although it could have and would have got to the same place instead the early history of paper money was certificates issued by storage vaults of precious metals i.e. early banks instead of carrying around yellow and silver rocks you could deposit them somewhere and get a piece of paper entitling the holder to withdraw a certain quantity of gold or silver or whatever    dollars like virtually all paper currency until fairly recently could be redeemed for physical gold or silver at a federal reserve bank and dollars were only printed if the treasury had enough physical gold and silver to pay off the bearer with precious metals    for a whole lot of reasons that are topics for another discussion decisions were made that eventually led to the abandonment of the gold standard and now the dollar like most modern currencies is pure fiat paper it 's only worth whatever everyone agrees it is worth and can only be redeemed by trading it to someone else for whatever they will give you for it there are long loud and ongoing over whether that was a good idea and i 'm not going to get into that here

if you want to deposit checks or conduct business at a window you should look at a local savings bank or credit union generally you can find one that will offer free checking in exchange for direct deposit or a minimum balance some are totally free but those banks pay for interest if you do n't care about location i would look at charles schwab bank i 've been using them for a couple of years and have been really satisfied with them they provide free checking atm fee reimbursement free checks and pre paid deposit envelopes you also can easily move money between schwab brokerage or savings accounts other brokers offer similar services as well

this is most likely protecting square 's relationship with visa mastercard amex etc credit card companies typically charge their customers a much higher interest rate with no grace period on cash advances withdrawals made from an atm using a credit card if you use square to generate something that looks like a merchandise transaction but instead just hand over a wad of banknotes you 're forcing the credit card company to apply their cheaper purchases interest rate on the transaction plus award any applicable cashback etc square would absolutely profit off of this but since it would result in less revenue for the partner credit card companies that would quickly sour the relationship and could even result in them terminating their agreements with square altogether this is the kind of activity they are trying to prevent   1 bill yourself $ 5,000 for merchandise but instead give yourself cash   2 earn 1.5 cashback $ 75   3 use $ of the cash and a $ 75 statement credit to pay your credit card statement   4 pocket the difference   5 repeat note the fees involved probably negate any potential gain shown in this example but i 'm sure with enough creative thinking someone would figure out a way to game the system if it was n't expressly forbidden in the terms of service

term life insurance makes sense if you will have a need for money if someone dies   if you and your brothers do not have enough money currently for a proper burial for your father then you might consider term insurance to cover this   if you already have the money to cover this or can save for it in a short amount of time then you are better off financially to not purchase the insurance estimate what you think it will cost for a burial then determine if you have this money available to you   if you already do then do n't purchase the insurance if you do not have this money available to you then you can look into a term life insurance policy on your father   you definitely do not want a whole life insurance policy   this will cost many more times what a term policy costs   a term policy is a policy with an expiration date for example let 's say that you determine that you will need $ 10,000 when your father dies for the funeral and burial   you could get a 10-year policy on your father for $ 10,000   over the next 10 years besides paying your premiums save up $ 10,000 $ 1,000 each year in some type of savings investing account   hopefully your father will still be around 10 years from now and you wo n't need the insurance policy anymore because you will have saved enough to cover the costs when the time comes   doing this will almost always cost you less than getting a whole life policy which never expires but has much higher premiums there are also 20-year term policies which will cost more but will give you more time to save up your fund   the costs for these policies depend on your father 's age so get a quote for both and decide what will work for you

you ca n't directly contribute more however it seems that there is something you can do that can achieve a similar effect you can withdraw your entire account principal + earnings though in your case that 's less than the principal and then contribute up to the $ 5500 contribution limit again the end result is that you put in a net amount of $ 500 and the account ends up with $ 5500 which is what you want the first step is a return of contributions made for the contribution year before the tax filing deadline for that year this kind of withdrawal is not subject to tax and counts as if you never made the contribution at all since you are considered to have never made a contribution you still have $ 5500 that you can contribute before you hit the limit

an extra payment on a loan is broadly speaking a known return risk free investment that the return on the investment is in reduced costs going forward instead of increased revenue is basically immaterial assuming you have sufficient cash flow to handle either situation we ca n't know what the interest rates will be like going forward but we can know what they are today because you gave us those numbers in your question quick now given the choice between a known return of 3.7 annually and a known return of 7 annually with identical and extremely low risk where would you invest your money by putting the $ 15k toward the $ 14k loan you free up $ 140 per month and have $ 1k left that you can put toward the $ 30k loan which will reduce your payment term by $ 1k $ or about 4 months you will be debt free in 14 years 8 months you pay $ 14,000 instead of $ 16,800 on the $ 14,000 loan reducing the total cost of the loan by $ and reduce the cost of the $ 30,000 loan by four months worth of interest which is about $ 175 so the $ 30,000 loan ends up costing you something like $ instead of $ by putting the $ 15k toward the $ 30k loan you cut the principal of that one in half assuming that you keep paying the same amount each month you will reduce the payment term by 7 ½ years and will be debt free in 10 years because the $ 14,000 10-year loan now has the longer term instead of paying $ for the $ 30k loan you end up paying $ plus the $ 15,000 = $ reducing the total cost of the $ 30,000 loan by $ while doing nothing to reduce the cost of the $ 14,000 loan to a first order estimate using the $ 15,000 to pay off the $ 14,000 loan in full will improve your cash flow in the short term but putting the money toward the $ 30,000 loan will give you a three fold better return on investment over the term of both loans and nearly halve the total loan term assuming unchanged monthly payments and unchanged interest rates that 's how powerful compounding interest is

my opinion is that in general it is probably not a good idea to borrow at a cost in order to make your rrsp contribution   banks of course have an interest in loaning you money   do n't expect their literature to be objective on the matter   they are selling you a product and the advice is biased   what better way to double dip than to get guaranteed interest payments from you as well as ongoing fees for probably also getting your loan money invested in their high fee mutual funds a year 's rrsp contribution room allowance is n't use it or lose it unlike 401k contribution allowances in the u.s that is unused rrsp contribution room accumulates and you can take advantage of it in later years if we could n't carry our rrsp contribution room over i might feel different about the general case for rrsp loans yet there are two specific cases i can think of where it may make sense to borrow and pay back a possible case if your tax rate is currently in a high bracket e.g. 46 and you anticipate being in a lower income and bracket next year e.g. 35 then it would make sense to take advantage of the higher tax savings in the current tax year   if you waited until the following year to take the deduction you 'd lose out on 11 of the deducted amount    for a typical person whose income is level or increasing from year to year this is n't likely to be applicable but it could help somebody who is going on leave or otherwise has irregular income a foolish case if you knew somehow that you could realize a return on your invested rrsp money exceeding the pre tax earnings required to pay the interest on the rrsp loan   however i would suggest this is foolish bet to make   the interest you pay is guaranteed but the return you are expected to get is probably not or if it is it is probably a return lower than what your bank wants to charge on the loan if for some reason it does make sense for you take the money and invest it somewhere better than the high fee mutual funds the bank is also pushing

it is unlikely that buying 100 shares will have any effect on a stock 's price unless the stock 's average trading volume is incredibly low   that being said no matter how many share you buy there 's no way to know what the impact on the price will be because that 's only one factor in how shares are priced   if anyone could figure out the answer to your question then they 'd be extremely rich because they 'd simply watch for big share trades and then buy those stocks on the way up the market makers who actually execute the trades are the ones who set the prices and most stocks have multiple market makers trading the stock so the bid ask you see is the highest bid and lowest ask   the market makers set the price based on what the trend of the stock is   if for instance there 's a large number of sell orders against a stock the market makers will start dropping the bid prices as they fill execution orders and as they see buy orders increase they 'll raise ask prices as they fill execution orders   the market makers earn the difference between what they paid to buy someone 's stock who was selling and what they get from someone else who buys it this is a simplified explanation so pro traders do n't beat me up grin so basically it takes quite a bit of share volume in one direction or another to affect a stock 's price   i can guarantee a trade would n't even be noticed by market makers i hope this helps good luck

from lots of sensible advisers will tell you to buy index funds but    importantly the advice is not simply buy index funds    there are at least two other critical details 1 asset allocation    across multiple well chosen indexes maintained through regular    rebalancing and 2 dollar cost averaging or    much more complex but probably slightly better value averaging the    advice is not to take your single lump sum and buy and hold a    cap weighted index forever the advice is an investment    discipline which involves action over time and an initial    choice among indexes an index fund based    strategy is not completely passive it involves some active risk    control through rebalancing and averaging if you 'd held a balanced portfolio over the last ten years and rebalanced and even better if you 'd dollar cost averaged you 'd have done fine your reaction to the last 10 years incidentally is why i do n't believe an almost all stocks allocation makes sense for most people even if they 're pretty young more detail in this answer how would bonds fare if interest rates rose i think some index fund advocacy and books do people a disservice by focusing too much on the extra cost of active management and why index funds are a good deal   that point is true but for most investors asset allocation rebalancing and of their setup are more important to outcome than the expense ratio

depending on how you view the loan it could either be considered an asset or a liability   since you are not charging interest it might seem more intuitive to create an assets cash loan account and transfer money to from it when you receive payments like you would with a bank account personally i prefer to think of all loans as liabilities   whether it 's a debt which you owe someone or a balance which someone else owes you since it 's an unsettled amount i file it under liabilities loan   either way you record the initial balance as a debit from your bank and then record payments as credits back to your primary account the only way that income or expenses ever gets involved would be if you charged interest income or if you some or all of the loan expense at some point in the future

in general no if you just have one employer and work there with the same salary for the whole year   typically an employer does tax withholding by your monthly income to the entire year and withholding the right amount so that at the end what is withheld is what you owe   it 's not a surprise to them when your income crosses a tax bracket threshold because they knew how much they were paying you and knew when you would cross into another bracket so they factored that in if you have multiple jobs or only worked for part of the year or if your income varied from month to month e.g. you got a raise there could be a discrepancy between what is withheld and what you owe because each employer only knows about what it 's paying you not what money you may have earned from other sources   even here though the discrepancy would n't be due to the tax brackets per se   you can adjust your withholdings on form w-4 if needed to tell the employer to withhold more or less than they otherwise would

is a really really good rate doubly so if it 's a fixed rate and so if the interest is tax deductible that 's about as close to free money as you 're ever going to get heck depending on what inflation does over the next few years it might even be cheaper than free so if you have the risk tolerance for it it 's probably more effective to invest the money in the stock market than to accelerate your student loan payoff you can even do better in the bond market my go to intermediate term corporate bond fund is yielding nearly 4 right now just remember the old banker 's assets shrink liabilities never shrink you can lose the money you 've invested in stocks or bonds and you 'll still have to pay back the loan and when in doubt you can usually assume you 're underestimating your risks if you 're feeling up for it i 'd say make sure you have a good emergency fund outside of your investment money something you could live on for six months or so and pay your bills while looking for a job and sock the rest into something like the vanguard moderate growth fund or a similar instrument vanguard 's just my personal preference since i like their style and by style i mean low fees but definitely feel free to consider alternatives you could also pad your retirement accounts and avoid taxes on any gains instead but remember that it 's easier to put money into those than take it out so be sure to double check the state of your emergency fund

buying pressure means there are more interested buyers than there are ready sellers putting upward pressure on prices that might include institutional buyers who are slowly executing buy orders because they still want the best prices possible without clearing out the market buying pressure does n't have to be related to volume at all if everyone who owns shares think they are going to be worth far more than recent market prices they will not offer them for sale that means there is more demand to buy than there is a supply of shares to be bought that condition can exist regardless of trading volume
