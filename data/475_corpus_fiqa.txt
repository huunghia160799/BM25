all the other answers posted thus far discuss matters from the perspective of us tax laws and are unanimous in declaring that what the op wants to do is indeed a very bad idea i fully agree it is a bad idea from the perspective of us tax laws and is likely a bad idea from the perspective of indian tax laws too but what the op wants to do is   or used to be common practice in india in more recent times india has created a permanent account number pan number for each taxpayer for income tax purposes and each bank account or investment must have the owner 's or first named owner 's in case of a joint account pan number associated with it   this most likely has decreased the popularity of such arrangements or has led to new being used the op has not indicated the residence and citizenship of his family or his own status for that matter but if they are all indian citizens resident in india and are then there might be one mechanism for doing what the op wants to do apply for a pan number in the name of the hindu undivided family and use this number to carry out the investments in the name of the hindu undivided family   there presumably are similar statuses for undivided families for other religions but i am not familiar with them there are lots of matters here which are more legal questions than personal finance questions e.g. if the op is a us tax resident then the family presumably will not be able to claim hindu undivided family status since the op has been divided from the family for tax purposes or so i think even if status is available the op might not be able to act as the while his father is alive and so on   consultation with tax lawyers not just chartered accountants in india is certainly advisable

lets do some math there were people who passed l3 last year and became charter holders now lets just take the top 25 mba programs that 'd be 460 people class graduating to reach this number actual numbers are much lower than this   trust me i 'm a big fan of the cfa but i know some really dumb people who are charter holders because they learned to memorize a test these same people would never get admitted to a top 10 no less 25 mba program   one thing i will give you there are way too many mbas in general partially because of all the part time night time executive ones but an mba is very different then a cfa in that its banded by school and category everyone with a cfa has the same cfa however a wharton degrees sure carries a lot more clout than a one

my question is how is this new value determined   does it go off of    the tax appraised value the tax assessors values are based on broad averages and are not very useful in determining actual home value the most defensible valuation outside of a sale is a professional appraisal real estate agents may or may not give you reasonable estimates but their opinions are less valuable than that of a professional appraiser additionally agents hoping to land you as a client even if you tell them you 're not trying to sell could be motivated to over estimate in many instances a few opinions from agents will be good enough but if there is any contention a professional appraisal will be better should you prior to your death get an independent appraiser to    appraise the value of the property and include that assessment of the    properties value with the will or something the real estate market fluctuates too much to make having an appraisal done prior to your death a practical approach in most circumstances you could make arrangements so that an appraisal would be scheduled after your death here 's a good resource on the topic estimating the value of inherited real estate

i will give a slightly different answer which is actually an addendum to joetaxpayer 's soon to be edited answer do not go to your financial advisor and ask him how do i go about transferring my roth ira to where is whichever broker or mutual fund family that you have chosen from the list that joe has suggested   instead go to the website of the new group or call their toll free number and tell them i want to open a roth ira account with you and fund it by transferring all the money in my roth ira from first clearing your new roth ira custodian will take care of all the paperwork and get the money transferred over at no cost to you except possibly fielding a call from your current financial advisor because he had just ordered his new lamborghini and now will have difficulty making payments on his auto loan why are you leaving me after all the years we have had together you will need to choose some place to put the money and i suggest that you use their s&p 500 index fund   not the s&p 500 etf just the standard vanilla s&p 500 index mutual fund this recommendation is almost heresy in this forum but it is better to pay the extra 0.01 fee that the fund charges over and above the etf until you become a little more savvy and are ready to branch out into individual stocks which is when you really need a brokerage account revelation i have never made the transition and invest only in mutual funds which does not require a brokerage account after doing all this pay no attention whatsoever to your roth ira investment or how the s&p 500 index is doing for the   next 20 years this will help avoid the temptation of taking all your money out just because the index went down a little everybody is told buy low sell high but far too many folks end up doing exactly the opposite buying because the stock market is up and selling when it starts going down

if so it seems to me that this system is rather error prone by that i mean i could easily forget to make a wire some day and be charged interests while i actually have more than enough money on the check account to pay the debt i have my back account i.e. chequing account and visa account at from the same bank which in my case is the royal bank of canada i asked my bank to set up an automatic transfer so that they automatically pay off my whole visa balance every month on time by taking the money from my bank account in that way i am never late paying the visa so i never pay interest charges iow i use the visa like a debit card the difference is that it 's accepted at some places where a debit card is n't e.g. online and for car rentals and that the money is deducted from my bank account at the end of the month instead of immediately

noted the liquidity can very wildly especially 9 months out and there will be little volume even in the largest stocks   victor noted standard measures of liquidity do n't always apply cleanly to options as they are priced using a hybrid of model and market inputs   so your question is generally very hard to answer on se but you can get an answer yourself without too much trouble the best way to get a feel for slippage in your case is to just get quotes   most systems should let you get a quote for both buying and selling options at the same time   this will give you a feeling for how much you are paying in spread   do the same for near dated options to get a feeling for spread size when you end up selling you should factor in some widening of spreads at bad times but this should get you a feeling for the scale of the slippage problem

the author is using the simple dietz method alternatively the modified dietz with the assumption that the net cash flow occurs halfway through the time period   let 's say the time period is one year for illustration so the cash flow would be at the end of the second quarter the money weighted method gives a more accurate return but has to be solved by trial and error or using a computer   the money weighted return is and the simple or modified dietz return is   when the sums are done backwards to check the dietz is half a dollar out with a final value of $ while the money weighted return exactly $ 12,000 it is worth pointing out that the return changes if the cash flow is not in the middle of the time period   a case with the cash flow at the end of q3 is added to illustrate

i have a quick question about statement of cash flows and how account receivable net and affect it i 've already asked the accounting subreddit but was wondering if anyone who does fundamental analysis etc would have a take on it    it stems from a homework problem where i have to a cash flow statement using two comparative balance sheets end of period 2013 and end of period 2014 and a change in retained earnings statement   the following transaction took place in 2014    the firm wrote off accounts receivable as totaling $ in 2013 and $ in 2014 it recognized expired insurance of $ in 2013 and $ 3,900 in 2014   my understanding is that the write offs have already been subtracted in order to yield account receivable net and therefore i can just take the change in that account and make the appropriate entry   for the recognition of expired insurance i can simply take the change in the prepayment account and record the appropriate cash flow entry   am i correct in assuming this or did they give me those amounts in order to figure out accounts receivable gross and take the change in that

your basic point is correct the savvy move is to use insurance only to cover losses that would be painful or catastrophic for you otherwise self insure in the specific example of car insurance you may be missing that it does n't only cover replacement of the car it also covers liability which is a hundreds of thousands of dollars risk the liability coverage may well be legally required it may also be required as a base layer if you want to get a separate umbrella policy up to millions in liability so you have to be very rich before this insurance stops making sense in the us at least you can certainly buy car insurance that does n't cover loss of the car or that has a high deductible and in fact if you can afford to self insure up to a high deductible on average as you say that should be a good idea same is true of most kinds of insurance a high deductible is best as long as you can afford it unless you know you 'll probably file a claim health insurance in particular is weird in many ways and one is that you often can estimate whether you 'll have claims on our auto policy the liability and uninsured coverage is about 60 of the cost while damage to the car coverage is 40 i 'm sure this varies a lot depending on the value of your cars and how much you drive and driving record etc on an aging car the coverage for the car itself should get cheaper and cheaper since the car is worth less while liability coverage would not necessarily get cheaper

it would depend on a ones view on markets and b ones nature if one believes that the market would be going up in the near future then it would be best to buy all at once if one believes the market is uncertain it would make sense to invest over a period of time if one is a disciplined investor and can stick to plan it would make sense to invest over a period of time as the risk is generally less how much less is again subjective if one is not a disciplined investor then buying now and getting done with is a good idea    as to exactly quantifying this is absolute number for future would not be possible one can take the data from past however it would work advantages if the prices moves up and disadvantages if the price moves down

the assumption is not necessarily correct while the seven years affects the credit report the statute of limitations for collections may be different and is based on the state law where the debt was given or a federal law for na banks keep in mind that the creditor can reset the clock any time by taking legal action for example filing a lawsuit in a court to garnish some of his income or put a lien on some of his assets many   times just contacting the debtor is enough to reset the clock the statute of limitations on collections is a legal issue and he should talk to a lawyer about it different accounts may have different statutes affecting them

there is no standard way to divide property under these circumstances this is why lawyers recommend agreeing how property will be divided up front and why they make so much money sorting out issues like this when couples divorce incidentally you do n't say which country you are in but in many countries if you have lived together for five years your breakup can be treated like a divorce legally speaking if you ca n't agree on how to divide the property the courts will be involved you are faced with a choice either find some way to come to an agreement you can both accept or hire lawyers and argue it out in court you might want to consider finding someone to act as mediator who will help you to come to an agreement professional services exist or you could consider a person you both respect and with the skills to do this

genuine nearly passive income can be had from some kinds of investing index funds are an example of a mostly self managing investment of course investment involves some risk the income is essentially paying you for taking that risk and returns are reasonable but proportional to the risk ie not spectacular unless the risk is high if someone is claiming they can get you better than market rate of return look carefully at what they are getting out of it and what the risks are fees subtract directly from your gains and if they claim there is no additional risk they need to prove that you are giving someone your money be very sure you are going to get it back if it is n't self evident where the income comes from it 's probably a scam if someone is using the term auto pilot it is almost certainly a scam if they are talking about website advertising and the like it is far from autopilot if you want to make any amount of money though you may make money for them

although this is off topic since it is about economics i 'm going to write a short answer in case it is decided that it is on topic i will remove this if it gets migrated the key to why printing extra money causes inflation and a change in exchange rate has nothing at all to do with whether or not it is announced or done in secret the quantity of money in circulation by whichever measure is what informs the value of the currency not whether you tell people that it has changed or not announcing it should increase the volatility somewhat around the time of the announcement but the long term effects will be the same no matter what whether or not they announce it printing more money will mean that there is more in circulation which will reduce the value of each unit of the currency by the dilution amount which in turn will increase inflation and decrease the exchange rate

the professional financial advisors do have tools which will take a general description of a portfolio and run monte carlo simulations based on the stock market 's historical behavior after about 100 simulation passes they can give a statistical statement about the probable returns the risk involved in that strategy and their confidence in these numbers   note that they do not just use the historical data or individual stocks there 's no way to guarantee that the same historical accidents would have occurred that made one company more successful than another or that they will again past performance is no guarantee of future results but general trends and patterns can be roughly modelled which makes that a good fit for those of us buying index funds less good for those who want to play at a greater level of detail in the hope of doing better but that 's sorta the point to beat market rate of return with the same kind of statistical confidence takes a lot more work

as for a formula there is n't a simple one that you can apply to every type insurance i 'll try my best for a simple answer is the event devastating enough to change your lifestyle looking at life necessities not wants and nice to haves is the event very likely to happen do you have enough emergency funds to cover such an event once that emergency fund is utilized how long does it take you to restore that fund to be ready for the next event if the event is devastating enough and is very likely to happen and you do not have the cash to cover the event and/or it would take too long to restore that emergency fund then it makes sense to consider insurance then you would have to examine if the cost of the premium paid for the insurance if it is pennies of premium for a dollar of benefit then it makes sense

first note that a share represents a of ownership of a company in addition to the right to vote in the management of the company by voting on the board of directors who hires the ceo who hires the vps etc this gives you the right to all future value of the company after paying off expenses and debts you will receive this money in two forms dividends approved by the board of directors and the final liquidation value if the company closes shop there are many ways to attempt to determine the value of a company but the basic theory is that the company is worth a cashflow stream equal to all future dividends + the liquidation value so the market 's goal is to attempt to determine what that future cash flow stream is and what the risk related to it is depending on who you talk to a typical stock market has some degree of market efficiency market efficiency is basically a comment about how quickly the market reacts to news in a regulated marketplace with a high degree of information available market efficiency should be quite high this basically means that stock markets in developed countries have enough traders and enough news reporting that as soon as something public is known about a company there are many many people who take that information and attempt to predict the impact on future earnings of the company for example if starbucks announces earnings that were 10 less than estimated previously the market will quickly respond with people buying starbucks shares lowering their price on the assumption that the total value of the starbucks company has decreased most of this trading analysis is done by institutional investors it is n't simply office workers selling shares on their break in the coffee room it 's mostly people in the finance industry who specialize in various areas for their firms and work to quickly react to news like this is the market perfectly efficient no the psychology of trading ie people panicking or reacting based on emotion instead of logic as well as any of information means that not all news is perfectly acted upon immediately however my personal opinion is that for large markets the market is roughly efficient enough that you can assume that you wo n't be able to read the newspaper and analyze stock news in a way better than the institutional investors if a market is generally efficient then it would be very difficult for a group of people to manipulate it because someone else would quickly take advantage of that for example you suggest that some people might collectively short amzn a company worth half a trillion dollars so your nefarious group would need to have $ 5 billion of capital just to trade 1 of the company if someone did that the rest of the market would happily buy up amzn at reduced prices and the people who shorted it would be left holding the bag however when you deal with smaller items some more likely market manipulation can occur for example when trading penny stocks there are people who attempt to manipulate the stock price and then make a profitable trade afterwards this takes advantage of the low amount of information available for tiny companies as well as the limited number of institutional investors who pay attention to them effectively it attempts to manipulate people who are not very sophisticated so some manipulation can occur in markets with limited information but for the most part prices are determined by the market consensus on what the future profits of a company will be   additional example of what a share really is imagine your neighbor has a treasure chest on his driveway he gathers the neighborhood together and asks if anyone wants to buy a of the value he will get from opening the treasure chest perhaps it 's a glass treasure chest and you can mostly see inside it you see that it is mostly gold and silver and you weigh the chest and can see that it 's about 100 lbs all together so in your head you take the price of gold and silver and estimate how much gold is in the chest and how much silver is there you estimate that the chest has roughly $ 1,000,000 of value inside so you offer to buy 10 of the chest for $ 90k you do n't want to pay exactly 10 of the value of the company because you are n't completely sure of the value you are taking on some risk so you want to be compensated for that risk   now assume all your neighbors value the chest themselves and they come up with the same approximate value as you so your neighbor hands out little certificates to 10 of you and they each say this person has a right to 10 of the value of the treasure chest he then calls for a vote from all the new shareholders and asks if you want to get the money back as soon as he sells the chest or if you want him to buy a ship and try and find more chests it seems you 're all impatient because you all vote to fully pay out the money as soon as he has it so your neighbor collects his $ 900k $ 90k for each 10 share 10 and heads to the to sell the chest but before he gets there a news report comes out that the price of gold has gone up because you own a share of something based on the price of gold you know that your 10 treasure chest investment has increased in value you now believe that your 10 is worth $ you put a flyer up around the neighborhood saying you will sell your share for $ because other flyers are going up to sell for about $ it seems your valuation was mostly consistent with the market   eventually someone driving by sees your flyer and offers you $ for your shares you agree because you want the cash now and do n't want to wait for the treasure chest to be sold now when the treasure chest gets sold to the assume it sells for $ turns out you underestimated the value of the company the person who bought your 10 share will get $ he gained $ 2k your neighbor who found the chest got $ 900k because he sold the shares earlier when the value of the chest was less clear and you got $ which for you was a gain of $ 14k above what you paid for it this is basically what happens with shares buy owning a portion of the company you have a right to get a dividend of future earnings but it could take a long time for you to get those earnings and they might not be exactly what you expect so some people do buy and sell shares to try and earn money but the reason they are able to do that is because the shares are inherently worth something they are worth a small of the company and its earnings

great question   first my recommendation would be for you to get a card that does not have a yearly fee there are many credit cards out there that provide cash back on your purchases or points to redeem for gift cards or other items be sure to cancel the credit card that you have now so you do n't forget about that yearly fee canceling will have a temporary impact on your credit score if the credit card is your longest held line of credit   second it is recommended not to use more than 20 of all the available credit staying above that line can affect your credit score i think that is what you are hearing about running up large balances on your credit card if you are worried about staying below the 20 line you can always request a larger line of credit just keep paying it off each month though and you will be fine   you already have a history of credit if you have begun paying off your student loans

i do n't see that this follows capital commitments require that one assess the ability to unwind as information changes market   that s why private equity demands a premium     hft is not investing it is far closer to market making   in that regard it is a social good   what is of a concern is that they are far less supervised than a market maker   they provide liquidity the way bankers provide loans when it is not essential   the old adage of an umbrella when it is sunny but take them back at the sign of rain   if there are requirements to commit capital and maintain orderly markets with some oversight on their ability to maintain their capital ratios a shadow market maker then they should get to enjoy making a spread in exchange for keeping those spreads relatively tight

banks in general will keep saving rates as low as possible especially if there is a surplus of funds or alternative access for funding as in the case of the fed in the usa generally speaking why would bank pay you a high interest rate when they can not generate any income from your money usually we will expect to see a drop in the loan interest rate when their is a surplus of funds so as to encourage investment but if the market is volatile then no banks will allow easy access to money through loans the old traditional policy of lending money without proper security and no control from the central bank has created serious problems for savings account holders when some of these banks went into bankruptcy it is for this reason most countries has modified their financial act to offer more protection to account holders at the moment banks must follow rigid guidelines before a loan can be approved to a customer in my country we have seen the collapse of a few banks which sent a shock wave across the county for those that have savings held at those bank we have also seen unsecured loans having to be written off thus putting serious pressure of those banks so government stepped in a few years ago and amended the act to make it mandatory to have commercial banks follow certain strict guidelines before approving a loan

because it is a roth ira not traditional you never pay penalties for withdrawing any amount up to your total contributions amount this is because you are funding it with after tax money but it sounds like your roth had $ 11 k in it and you zeroed it out if you were less than 59.5 years old at the time you made the withdrawal then if you did not return anything to the account then you would pay tax on the 6 k as income this year at your normal tax rate plus an additional 10 penalty on that 6 k $ 600 the 5 k in contributions is not taxable now since it 's been more than 60 days since you withdrew the money you can not put the 6 k in earnings back in without paying the penalty however you can still contribute $ 5500 per year or $ 6500 if you 're over 50 so you can put back $ 5500 and then you would only have to pay tax + 10 on the $ 500 difference update i would recommend talking to an accountant the fact that you intended to buy a house might provide a mechanism for getting the money back in if you wish if this was your first house or you have not owned a home in the last 2 years then you would be considered a first time homebuyer and there is a special exception allowing you to remove 10 k without penalty if you end up not purchasing the home you have 120 days to contribute those funds back in treated as a thank you littleadv for the link to this as for the final 1 k overage i believe you can count that towards your $ contribution when you put the entire amount back lastly after digging into this you have hit so many edge cases with your scenario 6 k in earnings being between 5500 for under 50 and 6500 for over 50 it 's been 70 days which is between the 60 day normal cutoff and the 120 day extended cutoff for home purchase falling through and 11 k total being just over the 10 k cutoff for the same that i 'm starting to wonder if this is some sort of contrived case for an accounting exam

purchase loans tend to be more challenging to get the best possible rate because you have to balance closing the loan and getting the contract so there is n't as much time to shop around as when you do a refinance   i disagree with the sentiment to go with your local bank nothing wrong with asking at your local bank and using their numbers as a baseline but chances are they wo n't be competitive there are many reputable online mortgage originators that will show accurate fees and rates upfront assuming you provide accurate information   in the past there were a lot of issue with good faith estimates being pretty much worthless there were a fair number of horror stories about people showing up to closing and finding out fee or rates had increased dramatically there was a law passed after the housing debacle that severely limits the shenanigans that lenders can do at closing and so there is less risk when going with a lesser known lender in fact i would say the only real risk with a lender now days is choosing one that happens to be overloaded and or just has poor customer service in general personally i have found the most competitive rates from zillow 's mortgage service and the now defunct google mortgage the lenders tend to be smaller but highly efficient they are very much dependent on their online reputations i have heard good things about a number of larger online lenders but i do n't have personal experience so i will leave them off i personally would n't worry much about whether the loan is sold or not outside of refinancing i do n't think i have ever talked to the bank servicing my mortgage about my mortgage there just is n't much need to talk to them

your first home can be up to £ 450,000 today but that figure is unlikely to stay the same over 40 years the government would need to raise it in line with inflation otherwise in 40 years you wo n't be able to buy quite so much with it if inflation averages 2 over your 40 year investment period say £ 450,000 would buy you roughly what £ 200,000 would today higher rates of inflation will reduce your purchasing power even faster you pay stamp duty on a house for a house worth £ 450,000 that would be around £ 12,500 there are also estate agent 's fees typically 1 2 of the purchase price although you might be able to do better and legal fees if you sell quickly you 'd only be able to access the balance of the money less all those taxes and fees that 's quite a bit of your bonus lost so why did you tie your money up in a lisa for all those years instead of investing in the stock market directly one other thing to note is that you buy a lisa from your post tax income you pay into a pension using your pre tax income so if you 're investing for your retirement then a pension will start with a 20 bonus if you 're a lower rate taxpayer and a whopping 40 bonus if you 're a higher rate taxpayer if you 're a higher rate taxpayer a pension is much better value

i have a few recommendations comments the trick here is to make it clear to the dealer that you will not be getting a new car from them and their only hope of making some money is to sell you your own car you need to be prepared to walk away and follow through don't buy a new car from them even if you end up turning it in they could still come back a day later and offer a deal leasing a new car every 3 years is not the best use of money you have to really really like that new car feeling every three years and be willing to pay a premium for it if you 're a car nut like me and want to spend money on a luxury car it 's far wiser to purchase a slightly used luxury vehicle keep it for 8 + years and that way you wo n't have a car payment half the time

i am not sure if this is the actual reason or not but all of the major credit cards visa mastercard amex discover provide damage insurance coverage on car rentals debit cards do not usually provide this coverage so if you use a credit card the car company knows it will be able to recover the cost of any damage to the car   of course this does n't explain some of the odd debit card policies out there for example will not let you use a debit card unless you provide proof of round trip travel like a plane or cruise ticket but you can use a credit card without having a travel ticket i 'm not sure how having a travel ticket makes debit card users less of a risk but apparently it does somehow

i live where uber sidecar and lyft are available and have almost regularly used all three services   out of all of my experiences lyft has been the worse the drivers i 've had are quite creepy they do n't seem to have any regulations of how the drivers should act i 've had a driver start smoking in the car with me also they do not have upfront pricing they do not give an estimate so it 's a surprise when you get the bill they are also a dollar or two more expensive per mile than sidecar or uber   sidecar is great for when you need longer rides their rates are generally cheaper for long trips the drivers have rules they need to follow as a driver for them it kind of sucks they are based off of a donation that you pay for your ride so you could have a $ 20 bill but only pay $ 3 and then sidecar takes 20 of that and then to transfer that to your account is either $ 0.50 or $ 1 unless you drive full time it does n't make much sense to drive   and uber oh how i love them i had one bad experience riding with them and they called me the next day and gave me a refund and some extra ride credit they are consistently cheaper than sidecar or lyft and much more professional it 's like getting a private town car without breaking the bank most of the drivers are former taxi drivers but they go through training with uber on how to be courteous and knowledgeable about the city i can not rave enough about them :d   it 's shady of uber to mess with their competitors but that does n't change my opinion about them i highly doubt that uber is telling the drivers to do this

i was able to find a fairly decent index that trades very close to 1/10th the actual price of gold by the ounce the difference may be accounted to the indexes operating cost as it is very low about 0.1 the index is the etfs gold trust index by using the index along with a standard brokerage investment account i was able to set up an investment that appropriately tracked my gold shares as 10x their weight in ounces the share cost as 1/10th the value of a gold ounce at the time of purchase and the original cost at time of purchase as the cost basis there tends to be a 0.1 loss every time i enter a transaction i 'm assuming due to the index value difference against the actual spot value of the price of gold for any day probably due to their operating costs   this solution should work pretty well as this particular index closely follows the gold price and should reflect an investment in gold over a long term very well it is not 100 accurate but it is accurate enough that you do n't lose 2 3 every time you enter a new transaction which would skew long term results with regular purchases by a fair amount

if you just had one expense once a year of $ 1200 you would put in $ 100 a month the average balance is going to be $ 600 in that case the 0 and $ 1200 months average to $ 600 as do the $ 100 and $ 1100 the $ 200 and $ 1000 and so on if you had one expense twice a year of $ 600 and put in $ 100 per month it will average to $ 300 you have a mix of months does 8 months seem reasonable as an average frequency if so there should be about a 4 month slush all the time now instead of one expense averaged over 12 months imagine 12 accounts each needing $ 100 a month if you started at zero you would put in $ 1200 the first month and immediately spend it one account would go from + 100 its share of what you put in to while the rest are all at + 100 overall your balance would be zero then the next month you would again deposit 1200 and spend 1200 bringing one account to one to and the rest to + 200 you average to zero actually on deposit because some of the accounts have negative balances and some have positive but are n't doing that you caught up the months you were   behind so it would be like putting in $ 1200 for the first account $ 1100 for the second $ 1000 for the third and so on a total of $ then you take out $ 1200 and go down to the next month you put in $ 1200 and take out $ 1200 but you will always have that $ amount in there all of the accounts will have positive balances averaging $ 550 in this example

well that 's the clever part of it   if you only dole out effective surpluses to those who have squandered a bunch of energy then you 've incentivized a certain lifestyle and robbed people who do n't live that lifestyle to finance it   it 's what we 've been doing for 40 years give or take with consumer goods   they keep getting cheaper and higher quality so if you 're not budgeting a healthy portion of your annual income on consumer goods then you 're missing out on the effective surplus   that incentivizes participation in the mass production consumer culture   which in turn keeps the wheels of the economy turning and keeps all the little worker bees in line   if you just handed people more money they might get crazy ideas like starting their own businesses organizing labor unions running for political office taking a day off work to go vote or attend council meetings and generally being a nuisance to the people that run everything   you would n't want that would you

none of what i say is advice directed to you it is how i would continue to analyse the situation you have were it mine first off i prefer to work in more than possibilities   saying that paying down the mortgage makes sense as i can calculate the amount i will save i also believe that rate rises are coming in the future based on the talk from the so any money i pay off now means guaranteed less interest to pay in the future also the lower my loan to value ratio the better lower interest rates i can receive in the mortgage market if i do not want to work until retirement age it 'd be nice to have as few bills as possible in the decade or so prior to retirement age i could then do early retirement or part time work in the run up to retirement i could use my savings to fund life until retirement pays out i 'd be aiming to put 15 of my gross income into future investing using isas to build up a savings pot taking advantage of retirement products that way all the money is not tied to a normal retirement age before it can accessed and it 's not by future greedy government taxation any income leftover above the 15 i 'd be throwing at the mortgage taking advantage of the 10 overpay window remortgaging as ltv comes down in theory overpaid mortgage equity is money that could still be accessed provided house prices do n't decline and remortgaging is a possibility so in short i 'd follow a plan along these lines of logic 1 make sure i have 4 6 months of living expenses as a rainy day fund insulate myself from fluctuations in my financial situation 2 put away 15 of annual gross income towards future saving isas first pension second 3 overpay the mortgage and look to remortgage as ltv drops when ltv 60 look to lock in to a longer term fix eg 2 year fixes at 90 ltv 5 year fixes at 60 4 reassess steps 2 3 as life happens circumstances change work fluctuates etc 5 once the mortgage is paid off build as much wealth as possible isas first then non tax efficient savings products aim for keeping expenses down and raising my savings rate as much as possible your analysis was thorough and shows you are thinking through consequences never forget to factor in the risk of carrying debt having no low debt as you get older means there 's more income left to build wealth ignore the american view of carrying debt for life and trusting investments to outperform the debt you have to pay monthly to keep that debt around and it ai n't a pet

there are many reasons for buying stock for dividends   you are right in the sense that in theory a stock 's price will go down in value by the amount of the dividend as the amount of dividend was adding to the value of the company but now has been paid out to shareholder so now the company is worth less by the value of the dividend however in real life this may or may not happen sometimes the price will drop by less than the value of the dividend sometimes the price will drop by more than the dividend and other times the price will go up even though the stock has gone ex dividend we can say that if the price has dropped by exactly the amount of the dividend then there has been no change in the stockholders value if the price has dropped by more than the value of the dividend then there has been a drop to the stockholder 's value and if the price has gone up or dropped by less than the value of the dividend then there has been a increase to the stockholder 's value benefits of buying stocks with good dividends what you should n't do however is buy stocks solely due to the dividend be aware that if a company starts reducing its dividends it could be an early warning sign that the company may be heading into financial troubles that is why holding a stock that is dropping in price purely for its dividend can be a very dangerous practice

that argument is an argument for investing generally not peer to peer lending per se and the argument as phrased thus you should invest your money at a peer to peer loan platform is a false dichotomy that said as soon as one is investing as opposed to just getting a small but guaranteed return then risk comes into play   in that sense any savings account is fundamentally different from any investment and in that reading the two should n't be compared as different approaches to investing   peer to peer lending as an investment could be compared with stock market investing for one

it was actually meant to be more of just a joke comment but it does n't take very many successful billion dollar lawsuits to justify $ 10 million a pop   personally i think that part of the patent reform solution is that patents are non exclusive however licensing must be set up before use including free licensing if the owner wants to public domain it if the two parties ca n't agree to terms then it goes to a to set the the licensing fees which is binding the arbitration will take into account the research and development costs required likelihood of the same thing being independently created estimated profits from products using the patent etc   of course the core issue is granting patents for silly stuff but since the ones already in existence are presumably grandfathered in i think enforcing market driven licensing fees is the best way to prevent all of the dumb lawsuits going on the patent holder gets its money or maintains market advantage if the licensing fee is so high that no one wants to pay it and it does n't prevent competition from using other another party 's patented ideas

i expect that data may be copyright data that 's published e.g. on a newsfeed or web site is subject to terms of use standard poor 's web site says about the shiller indexes who do i contact at s&p to license my    use of these indices    questions    regarding licensing the    s&p case shiller home price indices    can be addressed to   bo chung     managing director        + as for recording the information yourself that may depend on how and where e.g. from what source you 're recording it if for example you tried to record prices from the canadian mls realtor 's network they too have their own terms of use on the data they publish copyright laws vary from country to country and terms of use certainly vary for example see which is case law about a phone directory in the usa and contrast that with which is european legislation so who owns data if it is determined by free market i guess that determined by free market means that buyers and sellers are publishing their offers to buy and their offers to sell and i guess that the publisher e.g. the stock exchange has terms of use about the data the offers that they 're publishing

i completely agree with pete that a 401(k loan is not the answer but i have an alternate proposal reduce your 401(k contribution down to the 4 that you get a match on   if you are cash poor now and have debts to be cleaned up those need to be addressed before retirement savings   you 'll have plenty of time to make up the lost savings after you get the debts paid off    if your company matches 50 meaning you have to contribute 8 to get the 4 match then consider temporarily stopping your 401(k altogether a 100 match is very hard to give up but a 50 match is less difficult   you have plenty of years left ahead of you to make up the lost match   plus the pain of knowing you 're leaving money on the table will incentivize you to get the loans paid as quickly as possible   it seems to me that i would be reducing middle to high interest debt while also saving myself $ 150 per month   no you 'd be deferring $ 150 per month for an additional two years and not reducing debt at all just moving it to a different lender interest rate is not your problem   right now you 're paying less than $ 30 per month in interest on these 3 loans and about $ 270 in principal and at the current rate should have them paid off in about 2 years   you 're wanting to extend these loans to 4 years by borrowing from your retirement savings    i would buckle down reduce expenses wherever possible cable cell phone coffee movies restaurants until you get these debts paid off   you make $ 70,000 per year or almost $ 6,000 per month   i bet if you try hard enough you can come up with $ 1,100 fairly quickly then the next $ 1,200 should come twice as fast then attack the next $ 4,000 you can argue whether the $ 1,200 should come first because of the interest rate but in the end it does n't matter either one should be paid off very quickly so the interest saved is negligible maybe you can get one of them paid off get yourself some breathing room then loosen up a little bit but extending the pain for an additional two years is not wise some more drastic measures

no one of the key ideas behind a corporation is that an investor 's liability is limited to the amount he invests i.e. the amount of stock he buys this is the primary reason why small businesses become corporations even though one person owns 100 of the stock then if the business goes broke he wo n't lose his house fund etc he 'll lose everything he had in the business but at least there 's a limit to it in some countries there are other ways to achieve the same results like creating a limited company but that 's another story

gt you do realize that investors are protected from being sued right   not usually no if the investor is a partner in the company then they 're just as responsible for the debts of their business as any other partner if they 're just a capital investor with no interest in the company business then sure you ca n't sue them but then my contract would n't be with them would it   gt so if the company you work for tanks you can sue them but they do n't have any money so what do you expect to get   the registered owners of the company can also be held liable for it 's debts if it 's a corporation or you can always just have them sign as guarantor for your back pay   and do n't say nobody will ever do that because if your service is valuable enough then yes they i 've pushed for a personal liability guarantee from a company owner before and got it

i hope a wall of text with citations qualifies as relatively easy many of these studies are worth quoting at length long story short a great deal of research has found that actively managed funds underperform market indexes and passively managed funds because of their high turnover and higher fees among other factors   longer answer chris is right in stating that survivorship bias presents a problem for such research however there are several academic papers that address the survivorship problem as well as the wider subject of active vs. passive performance i 'll try to provide a brief summary of some of the relevant literature   the seminal paper that started the debate is michael 's 1968 paper titled the performance of mutual funds in the period 1945 1964 this is the paper where 's alpha the ubiquitous measure of the performance of mutual fund managers was first defined using a dataset of 115 mutual fund managers finds that the evidence on mutual fund performance indicates not only that these 115 mutual funds were on average not able to predict security prices well enough to outperform a buy the market and hold policy but also that there is very little evidence that any individual fund was able to do significantly better than that which we expected from mere random chance although this paper does n't address problems of survivorship it 's notable because among other points it found that managers who actively picked stocks performed worse even when fund expenses were ignored since actively managed funds tend to have higher expenses than passive funds the actual picture looks even worse for actively managed funds a more recent paper on the subject which draws similar conclusions is martin gruber 's 1996 paper another puzzle the growth in actively managed mutual funds gruber calls it a puzzle that investors still invest in actively managed funds given that their performance on average has been inferior to that of index funds he addresses survivorship bias by tracking funds across the entire sample including through mergers since most mutual funds that disappear are merged into existing funds he assumes that investors in a fund that disappear choose to continue investing their money in the fund that resulted from the merger using this assumption and standard measures of mutual fund performance gruber finds that mutual funds underperform an appropriately weighted average of the indices by about 65 basis points per year expense ratios for my sample averaged 113 basis points a year these numbers suggest that active management adds value but that mutual funds charge the investor more than the value added another nice paper is mark 's 1997 paper on persistence in mutual fund performance uses a sample free of survivorship bias because it includes all known equity funds over this period it 's worth quoting parts of this paper in full i demonstrate that expenses have at least a one for one negative impact on fund performance and that turnover also negatively impacts performance trading reduces performance by approximately 0.95 of the trade 's market value   in reference to expense ratios and other fees finds that the investment costs of expense ratios transaction costs and load fees all have a direct negative impact on performance the study also finds that funds with abnormally high returns last year usually have higher than expected returns next year but not in the following years because of momentum effects lest you think the news is all bad russ 's 2000 study mutual fund performance an empirical into talent style transactions costs and expenses provides an interesting result he finds that many actively managed mutual funds hold stocks that outperform the market even though the net return of the funds themselves underperforms passive funds and the market itself   on a net return level the funds underperform broad market indexes by one percent a year of the 2.3 difference between the returns on stock holdings and the net returns of the funds 0.7 per year is due to the lower average returns of the holdings of the funds during the period relative to stocks the remaining 1.6 per year is split almost evenly between the expense ratios and the transaction costs of the funds the final paper i 'll cite is a 2008 paper by fama and french of the fama french model covered in business schools titled appropriately mutual fund performance the paper is pretty technical and somewhat above my level at this time of night but the authors state one of their conclusions bluntly quite early on after costs that is in terms of net returns to investors active investment is a negative sum game   emphasis mine in short expense ratios transaction costs and other fees quickly diminish the returns to active investment they find that the value weight portfolio of mutual funds that invest primarily in u.s. equities is close to the market portfolio and estimated before fees and expenses its alpha is close to zero since the value weight portfolio of funds produces an close to zero in gross returns the alpha estimated on the net returns to investors is negative by about the amount of fees and expenses this implies that the higher the fees the farther alpha decreases below zero since actively managed mutual funds tend to have higher expense ratios than passively managed index funds it 's safe to say that their net return to the investor is worse than a market index itself i do n't know of any free datasets that would allow you to research this but one highly regarded commercial dataset is the crsp survivor bias free us mutual fund database from the center for research in security prices at the university of chicago in financial research crsp is one of the gold standards for historical market data so if you can access that data perhaps for a firm or academic institution if you 're affiliated with one that has access it 's one way you could run some numbers yourself

the price the provider charges you is the amount he would like to get for his services let 's take an example you do a blood test at a lab and they charge you $ if you have insurance and the provider has a contract with that insurance meaning they take them the contract limits what they can charge and what the will get for the example that might be this is what the insurance pays them or what you pay them if you have deductible note that if you have no insurance you owe them they are typically willing to negotiate that you only pay maybe $ but it still will be much higher than the insurance price why the reason is that the insurance agreed payment of $ does not cover their cost but the insurance forces them to make that contract or basically be out of business let 's say for example they need $ to make a living on it so they lose 5.00 $ on every insured customer one in 235 customers has no insurance and his price is calculated as + 235 5.00 = $ so his bill covers the losses for all insured under payers all numbers are examples made up to illustrate the math the provider does my typically comes between 800 and 1400 and gets reduced to around 20 so the numbers are not completely off the ratio and concept works for doctors and hospitals the same just not as significant a difference

in the us mortgage payments are not deductible what is deductible is the mortgage interest to a limit that as well is not deductible but rather as part of your itemized deductions on schedule a of your yearly tax return so if you 're married and have a standard deduction of $ a year live in a state with no state income tax and your property tax and the mortgage interest are less than your standard deduction you will not be getting any tax benefit whatsoever that is in fact the case for many if not majority of the us mortgage payers so in order to get a proper estimate you need to take into account all the aspects of your tax calculations which are by nature quite personal and simulate the changes with the mortgage interest deduction most tax preparation software will allow you creating multiple files so you can run the numbers for different scenarios

your initial premise mid cap and small cap company stocks have outperformed the market is partially correct they have over many 40 yr periods provided higher returns than large caps or bond funds the important thing to consider here is that risk adjusted the returns from a diversified portfolio are far more robust with proper asset allocation you and expect high returns and reduce your risk simultaneously   imagine this scenario you decide to stick to small mid caps for 10 15 yrs and move into a more diversified portfolio then had you made that decision during a sustained period of poor small cap performance late 80s or the 40 's you would have lost a of return as those were periods were small underperformed the market as a whole and large caps in particular as an example from 1946 to large caps outperformed small every single year if 2016 were to be the first year of a similar trend you 've done yourself a major disservice   since the dot com crash small have outperformed for sure pretty much every year but that does n't mean that they will continue to do so the reason asset allocation exists is precisely this over a 40 yr period no single asset class outperforms a diversified portfolio   if you attempt to time the market even if you do so with a multi decade time horizon in mind there a good chance that you will do more poorly

yes you can do the withdraw if you turned 55 during the year you separated from service leaving your job on or after age 55 the age 59½ distribution rule says any 401k participant may begin to withdraw money from his or her plan after reaching the age of 59½ without having to pay a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty there is an exception to that rule however which allows an employee who retires quits or is fired at age 55 to withdraw without penalty from their 401k the rule of 55 there are three key points early retirees need to know first this exception applies if you leave your job at any time during the calendar year in which you turn 55 or later according to irs publication 575 second if you still have money in the plan of a former employer and assuming you were n't at least age 55 when you left that employer you 'll have to wait until age 59½ to start taking withdrawals without penalty better yet get any old 401k 's rolled into your current 401k before you retire from your current job so that you will have access to these funds penalty free third this exception only applies to funds withdrawn from a 401k iras operate until different rules so if you retire and roll money into an ira from your 401k before age 59½ you will lose this exception on those dollars

you should also know that its far cheaper for everybody including you at least $ 250,000 over each person 's lifetime each american compared to a canadian to get rid of the whole insurance system and pay for health care with taxes we would n't need any more than today and simply give people health care eliminating all of the administrative complexity from the users standpoint    that would allow doctors and hospitals to save a lot of money on staffing so your tiered system that denies health care to those who ca n't afford to pay actually costs everyone more and they get less care and lower quality care in short we 're cutting off our own nose to spite our face all this time the rest of the world is growing farther and farther ahead of us

look at a broader diversification something like for physical gold i 'd look at a mix of gold coins and bullion study the pricing model for coins you 'll probably find that the spreads on small coins make them too expensive there are a few levels of risk with storing in a vault the practical risk is that your government will close banks in the event of a panic and your money will be inaccessible you need to balance that risk with the risk to your personal security that comes with having lots of gold or cash in your home my recommendation is to avoid wasting time on the mad max scenarios if the world economy collapses into utter ruin we 're all screwed a few gold coins wo n't do much for you

wait a minute this is a huge clickbait statistic   from the article    gt   total overdraft fees totaled $ billion in 2016 just shy of the $ billion financial institutions collected in credit card interchange fees   they 're comparing the total sum of overdraft fees to the total sum of interchange fees     while interchange fees have gone up over time all the statistic in the story tells us is more people are using credit cards for transactions than before     merchants also have a huge choice in what sort of fees they pay the processor they use it 's a surprisingly large market and the rates vary by processor type of merchant risk to the merchant type of business type of card and so on   as a note the type of card is not just visa or amex but different cards from different issuers can have different interchange fees   that airline rewards card has a higher fee than that rebuild your credit secured read backed by a deposit card     in short this is a nonsense article that provides no useful comparison

with the second example if you continue to read on you will see that although directors must try and maximise shareholders wealth that precedence does n't change however the interpretation of the actions and whether they maximise shareholders wealth does for example giving money to charity with regards to the v. ford case would probably have been blocked on the grounds that it decreases shareholder wealth but later cases such as a. p. smith manufacturing co. v. say that donations can increase shareholders wealth in the long run so it gives a broader coverage of the actions deemed to increase shareholder wealth   the second is related to short term vs long term wealth but part of the reason for it was due to the inability of paramount to prove that the value increase for shareholders in the long run from selling to viacom rather than would be larger than the difference between the two offers which was 1.3 billion then there is also the issue of shareholders rights and the ability to block shareholders from selling to whomever they want so as i said it 's related but the issue is n't solely and simply about short term vs long term wealth   both examples are kind of weak as in the first well the issue does n't really exist in the present day as previous case law has the definition of actions which increase shareholder wealth and in the second short term vs long term value is related but mostly tagging along with a larger issue your original statement was in matters of cost vs. quality i 'd expect publicly traded companies to prioritize short term shareholder profit or be sued by said shareholders   are there any examples where shareholders have sued simply because they wanted better short term performance over long term performance

there is a difference between an owner and a signer an owner is the legal owner of the funds a signer has access to withdraw the funds in most cases when a new personal account is opened the name is added as an however that is not always the case a person could be an owner but not a signer in a custodial arrangement for example a minor child may be an owner only on their account with a custodial parent listed as a signer the minor could not withdraw from the account a person could be a signer but not an owner in a business or estate trust account the business or estate would be the owner with individuals listed as signers only the business employees do not own the funds they are only allowed to withdraw and disburse the funds on behalf of the company the creditor can only garnish withhold funds that are owned by the indebted if the second person on the account is only a signer those funds can not be withheld as part of a judgment against the second person they do n't own those funds however simply the second person as a signer only is not sufficient if you share access with the second person and allow them to spend the money for their own benefit they are no longer just a signer they have become an owner because you are sharing your funds with them think of the business relationship as an example the employee is a signer so they can withdraw funds and pay business expenses like the electric bill if the employee withdrew funds and bought herself a new dress she is stealing because she does not own those funds if the second person on the account buys things for themselves or transfers some of the money into their own account they are demonstrating that more than a signer only relationship exists a true signer only relationship is where the individual can only withdraw funds on the owner 's behalf for example the owner is out of town and needs a bill paid the signer can write a check and pay the bill for the owner a limited power of attorney may be worth looking into with a limited poa the owner can define the scope and expiration of the power of attorney with this arrangement the second person becomes an executor of the owner under certain circumstances for example you could write a power of attorney that states something like john smith is hereby granted the limited power to withdraw funds from account on deposit at bank for the purpose of paying debts and obligations and otherwise maintain my estate in the event of my or inability to attend to my own affairs this power of attorney shall expire on it 's fifth anniversary unless renewed if the person you have granted the power of attorney abuses their access you could sue them and you would only have to demonstrate that they the scope of their power

my problem with your argument is the idea that we make a decision and reap the benefits sometime in the near and measurable future   where as the actual outcome of our decision may not be realized until many other decisions are made afterwards thus making the number of permutations very high   while i agree there tend to be people who can make better or more informed decisions given a situation i think you give them entirely too much credit given the long run possibilities of outcomes   my ultimate point being no matter who you are you are limited to being able to consider so many steps ahead or combinations at a single time   and there are certainly people who make bad choices but get good outcomes and vice versus   since we do n't see one person or a specific model for making decisions i have to believe that one simply does not exist   so call it luck or informed decisions i think at a certain point people make decisions and reap the rewards of those decisions independently   maybe more often than not the informed win but there have been plenty of smart people out there with brilliant models and ideas that go down in flames   likewise i 've meet some pretty dumb people who happen to be at the right place at the right time and turn the right knob   not sure i was clear in explaining my point its been a long day

the fundamental issue with leverage of any sort really is that the amplified downsides are extremely likely to more than cancel out amplified equivalent upsides example without using a major swing 2x leverage on a 5 decline so a 10 decline   the 5 decline needs a increase to get back level   however the 2x leverage needs an increase to get back   so a cycle for the unleveraged returns of -5 + 5.4 would see the unleveraged asset go up by a net + but 2x leverage would leave you at   conversely imagine leverage it 's easy to do that 50 cash allocation after an underlying -5 the leverage needs only + to reach par   this is basically the argument for low volatility funds of course if you can leverage an asset that does n't go down then the leverage is great   and for an asset with an overall positive compound return a little leverage is probably not going to hurt simply because there are likely to be enough upsides to cancel out downsides

it sounds like you plan to sell sooner or later if your opinion is that there is still room for the housing market to grow make your bet and sell later the real estate market is much less liquid than other markets you might be invested in so if you do end up seeing trouble another housing crash you may be stuck with your investment for longer than you hoped i see more risk renting the house out but i do n't see significantly more reward if you are comfortable with the risk by all means proceed with your plan to rent   my opinion is contrary to many others here who think real estate investments are more desirable because the returns are less abstract you can collect the rent directly from your tenants but all investments are fraught with their own risks if you like putting in a little sweat equity doing your own repairs when things break at your rental renting may be a good match for you i prefer investments that do n't require as much attention and index funds certainly fit that bill for me

credit cards and debit cards make up the bulk of the transactions in the us   visa and mastercard take a percentage of each credit card transaction   for the most part this fee it built into the price of what you buy   that is you do n't generally pay extra at the grocery store if you use a credit card gasoline purchases are a notable exception here if you were getting something like 2 of a third of all the retail transactions in the us you 'd probably not want to rock the boat too much either   since there is little fraud relative to the amount of money they are taking in and it can often be detected using statistical analysis they do n't really stand to gain that much by reducing it through these methods   sure they can reduce the losses on the insurance they provide to the credit card consumer but they risk slowing down the money machine   these companies want avoid doing something like reducing fraud by 0.5 revenues but causing purchases with the cards drop by 1   more security will be implemented as we can see with the slow introduction of chip cards in the us but only at a pace that will prevent disruption of the money machine   emv will likely cause a large drop in cc fraud at brick and mortar stores but wo n't stop it online   you will likely see some sort of system like you describe rolled out for that eventually

the reason people like mint is because it allows you to see all of your financial details in one place when you create an account you ’re able to link all of your bank accounts credit cards and investment accounts this linking enables mint to update your transactions automatically the catch is that you have to provide the username and password you use for each one which can certainly make you feel if you ’re worried about a security breach mint is designed to be a read only service which means you ca n’t transfer money back and forth between accounts if someone were to get their hands on your mint login all they ’d be able to do is view your balances and transactions your full account numbers are n’t displayed nor are your bank account or credit card usernames and passwords the only thing that would be visible would be your email address if a hacker was interested in taking things a step further there ’s always the possibility that they could physically steal the information from mint ’s secure servers but that ’s really a long shot that would require knowing where the servers are located bypassing the physical security measures that are in place and cracking the code on how the data is encrypted if that were to happen then your personal information might be at risk but so far there ’s no record of it being attempted i was very skeptical of mint and how secure it truly was i did my fair share of research try looking at

probably the easiest to do is to do an international transfer via online banking you will need to give your iban and bic swift code of your bank to your friend he should then be able to transfer the money from his bank at least i think they use iban in israel as well the money will be converted to the currency of your account there are some fees but they are not too big i think and depending on the choice of transfer they can be paid by sender shared or by receiver contact your bank for precise details edit if you really need to be paid in usd this may not be the best option though

you understand it perfectly right the thing with pmi is that when your home price rises or your loan balance goes down so that your loan balance is below the 80 of the current house price the pmi goes away the higher rate does not so no pmi option is much better to the bank as you suspected your calculations are correct with the pmi you 'll pay less interest and more balance as to the tax deductions interest can be deducted but the pmi no starting of 2012 to the best of my understanding at least see details here consult a tax professional for more current information

banks want to be paid back and if you do n't then want to be able to sell your property for enough money to cover what you did n't pay back your credit rating will determine the interest rate you pay and this affects how much you can borrow because a higher interest rate means that you can borrow less on the same terms than you could with a lower interest rate paying 50 down will bring your payment way down of course and will improve everything about your loan debt to income ratio debt to equity but you 'll likely still be charged the higher interest rate based on your credit rating this of course is contingent on the property 's value properly

this depends on your definitions of assets and liabilities the word asset has a fairly straight forward definition   generally speaking an asset in finance is something that you own control that has economic value   the asset has value because it is generating income for you or because you expect that it will be worth something to someone in the future liability is tougher to define and depends on context   in accounting a liability is a debt or obligation that is owed   it is essentially the opposite of an asset where an asset represents something of value that you own increasing your balance sheet a liability is a value that you owe decreasing your balance sheet in that sense a website or domain name that you own is an asset not a liability because it is something you own that has some value   it is not a debt many people use the word liability informally to refer to a bad asset something that is losing value or is causing more in expenses than it is generating in income   see definition 5 on   with this definition you might consider a website or a domain name a liability if it is losing money alternatively depending on your business you might not consider it an asset or a liability but an expense instead   an expense is a cost of doing business   for example if your business is selling something you might need a website to make that happen   the website is n't purchased as an investment and it might not have any value apart from your business   it is simply a necessary expense for your business

maybe you can explain their position   it seems to me they should be in favor of   1 universal healthcare public or private for the reduced uncertainty and increased mobility to the working class    2 ending government subsidies of things like energy and farming so that the markets will properly transition and adjust based on the economic realities rather than manipulated markets    3 copyright reform to enable easier access to aged content by creators and the public at large including the creation of new businesses 4 infrastructure investments that fuel growth in the forms of market development and market access    5 industry based for things like waste management a la germany to preclude the need for the government to dictate the standards and practices while actually dealing with the problem   but as far as i have seen they are opposed to all of these things     for example in 1 above what i 've seen is that business likes to have the upper hand in the employer employee equation they like when employees ca n't up and leave because the children would lose health care   but the same informational that enable capitalism to function to their benefit are stifled in that case preventing the employment market from properly equalizing     to put it another way barriers to entry to prevent people from competing with you sounds great but it usually bites you your investors and everyone else in the ass because your products services are stagnant and you are n't competing   why do the so called fiscal conservatives seem to be okay with ass biting externalities and artificial barriers to entry

bond mf etf comes in many flavour one way to look at them is corporate govt gilt money market short term overnight lending etc govt backed bonds the etf that invest money in these are also different types one way to evaluate an etf mf is to see where they invest your money corporate debts are by the highest coupon paying bonds however the chance of default is also greater if you wish to invest in these it is preferable to look at the etf mf 's debt portfolio financial ratings etc govt bonds are more stable and unless the govt defaults which happens more often than we would like to think here also look for higher rating bonds portfolio that the fund scheme carries the govt backed bonds are somewhat similar to bonds however these are by institutions which are backed by govt e.g. national railways municipal bodies etc any fund scheme that invests in these bonds could also be considered and similarly measured the last are the short term money market related which provides the least return but are very liquid it is very difficult to answer how you should invest large sum on etf that are bond oriented however from any investment perspective it is better to spread your money if i take your case of i would divide it into pieces and invest in 10 different etf mf schemes of different flavour hope this helps

coins are legal tender they 're authorized by governments and have a face value rounds are simply coined pieces of metal minted by private manufacturers they do not have any face value and are not legal tender rounds are used to own metal they have no value other than the value of the metal in them any premium you pay over the price of the metal is the mint 's profit coins are also used as i.e. to own metal and create profits for the government but many times coins have limited issue and become valuable because of the rarity specific issues with a specific coin mistakes impurities exclusive designs etc so they also may have some value depends on the specific coin coins also have the assurance of quality of the authorizing government and are dealt with by the law as forgery of coins is illegal and is a crime rounds however do not enjoy such protection and any one can mint them only copyright trademark protections apply where the enforcement is by the owner and not the government re the advantages coins if you pick the right ones appreciate much more than the metal however this is mostly in hindsight and most of the coins do not appreciate significantly beyond the price of the metal unless there 's something else significant about them first year of issue high quality certification etc rounds on the other hand are cheaper 1 oz round will be significantly cheaper than 1 oz coin and monitor more closely the price of the metal it is unlikely for rounds to significantly deviate from the spot price although this does happen occasionally for specific designs or if a mint goes out of business

it 's not quite identical due to fees stock rights and reporting tax obligations   but the primary difference is that a person could have voting rights in a company while maintaining zero economic exposure to the company sometimes known as empty voting as an abstract matter it 's identical in that you reduce your financial exposure whether you sell your stock or short it   so the essence of your question is fundamentally true   but the details make it different   of course there are fee differences in how your broker will handle it and also margin requirements for shorting   somebody playing games with overlapping features of ownership sales and purchases may have tax and reporting obligations for straddles wash sales and related issues   a straight sale is generally less complicated for tax reporting purposes and a loss is more likely to be respected than someone playing games with sales and purchases but the empty voting issue is an important difference   you could buy stock with rights such as voting engage in other behavior such as forwards shorts or options to negate your economic exposure to the stock while maintaining the right to vote   of course in some cases this may have to be disclosed or may be covered by contract and most people engaging in stock trades are unlikely to have meaningful voting power in a public company   but the principle is still there as explained in the article by henry and bernie black hedge funds have been especially creative in voting rights from economic ownership sometimes they hold more votes than economic ownership a pattern we call empty voting in an extreme situation a vote holder can have a negative economic interest and thus an incentive to vote in ways that reduce the company 's share price sometimes investors hold more economic ownership than votes though often with voting rights the de facto ability to acquire the votes if needed we call this situation hidden ownership because the economic ownership and de facto voting ownership are often not disclosed

well for a start funds do n't pay interest   if you pick an income paying fund as opposed to one that automatically reinvests any income for you you will receive periodic income based on the dividends paid by the underlying stocks but it wo n't be the steady predictable interest payment you might get from a savings account or fixed rate security this income is not guaranteed and will vary based on the performance of the companies making up the fund it 's also quite likely that the income by itself wo n't cover the interest on your mortgage   the gains from stock market investment come from a mixture of dividends and capital growth i.e. the increase in the price of the shares   so you may have to sell units now and again or cover part of the interest payments from other income you 're basically betting that the after tax returns from the fund will be greater than the mortgage interest rate you 're paying    3 facts if you 're comfortable with these 3 facts go for it if they 're going to keep you awake at night you might not want to take the risk

md tech answered the answer is in your question derivatives are contracts so are enforced in the same way as any other contract   if the counterparty refuses to pay immediately they will in the first instance be billed by any intermediary prime broker etc that facilitated the contract if they still refuse to pay the contract may stipulate that a broker can net off any outstanding payments against it or pay out using deposited cash or posted margins the contract will usually include the broker as an interested party and so they can but do n't need to report a default such that this is to credit agencies in some jurisdictions they are required to by law any parties to the trade and the courts may use a debt collection agency to collect payments or seize assets to cover payment if there is no broker or the counterparty still has not paid the bill then the parties involved the party to the trade and any intermediaries can sue for breach of contract if they win which would be expected the counterparty will be made to pay by the legal system including but not limited to seizure of assets enforced bankruptcy and prison terms for any of court rulings all of this holds for governments who refuse to pay derivatives losses as argentina did in the early 20th century but in that case it may escalate as far as war it has never done so for derivatives contracts as far as i know but other breaches of contract between countries have resulted in armed conflict as well as the hard results of failing to pay there are soft implications including a guaranteed fall in credit ratings that will result in parties refusing to do business with the counterparty and a separate loss of reputation that will reduce business even further potential employees and will be unwilling to become involved with such a party and suppliers will be unwilling to supply on credit the end result in almost every way would be bankruptcy and prison sentences for the party or their senior employees most jurisdictions allow for board members at companies in material breach of contract to be banned from running any company for a set period as well edit netting off cash flows netting off is a process whereby all of a party 's cash flows positive and negative are used to pay each other off so that only the net change is reflected in account balances for example company 1 cash flows netting off the total outgoings are 3 m + 500k = 3.5 m and total are 1.2 m + 1.1 m + 1.2 m = 3.5 m so the incoming cash flows can be used to pay the outgoing cash flows leaving a net payment into 's account of 0

i have won a large amount of money on an online casino how reputed is the company have you done any research around it it has taken 2 months for me to see any payouts last week i received $ 2300 check from them   did you win everything in the same period if so there is no reason why they sent you a smaller check of $ 2300 instead of the full amount this should raise a red flag why would someone write multiple checks the only valid reason is you won in different months the payout for first month was $ 2300 and they sent a check the payout for next month is large amount the request for bank details that they would rather wire me the money and they are asking for my banking account number and routing number although giving bank account number and routing has some risks this is the fundamental information that is need to make a credit to your account directly you would be giving this to quite a few entities people in most countries this information is printed on every check that you write from your account is this safe or am i stupid for even considering this online world is full of traps and this could be a scam so proceed with extreme caution insist of check in worst case open a different savings account that does not allow direct debits does not have over draft etc use this to receive money and move it into your regular account

what would they be trying to predict   the value ynab and mint provide is objective truth about what you 've spent they can force you to think about the tradeoffs inherent in budgeting by showing that you 've overspent one category and making you decide where to find the money to cover it they can call your attention to a credit card swipe that 's larger than you intended to a subscription you did n't intend to keep etc by just generally getting you to read and think about your transaction history and the sums of transactions per category and overall prediction does n't really enter into it one way to understand mint 's business model is as a service that collects training data for machine learning models that do try to predict things such as how stock prices will move or whether users will click on certain ads

from the article gt employment relations minister said pregnancy discrimination is illegal immoral and completely unacceptable there is no excuse for such attitudes from these employers who frankly are dinosaurs   yeah it might be illegal but only in the context of when the idea is spoken out loud amp and the final selection is male   which is why the notion is kept internally to the mind of the hiring manager and why the final selection is based on merit     good thing there is no such thing as thought crime

assuming you are being charged sales tax it all depends on where you take possession of the shipment are your suppliers shipping to a us address say your freight from where you handle the ongoing shipment or directly to you in south america if the latter per michael pryor 's answer you should not be charged sales tax if the former if the address is in a state in which your supplier has a physical location they will have to charge sales tax that said your freight should be able to furnish your supplier with a letter stating that the goods have been exported with a copy of the relevant bill of which will allow your supplier to refund you the taxes a company i was at before would allow refunds up to two years past the date of sale per various tax regulations alternatively you could see if just a letter of intent from your freight is enough to not charge you in the first place but that 's technically not proof of you might be able to get a refund or an exception from the state 's tax department directly but i would recommend going through your supplier much less hassle

putting a dollar amount on the valuation of a start up business is an art form that often has very little at all to do with any real numbers and more to do with your salesman abilities when talking with the vc that said there are a few starting points first is past sales the cost of those sales and a hopefully realistic growth curve   however you do n't have that so this gets harder do you have any actual assets   machinery computers desks patents etc   things that you actually own   if so then add those in   if this is a software start up code is an asset but without sales it 's incredibly hard to put a value on it   the best i 've come up with is how much would it cost for someone else to build it after they 've seen yours   yes you may have spent 5,000 hours building something but could someone else duplicate it or at least the major parts in 200 hours after seeing a demo   use the lower number if i was you i 'd look hard at my business plan   hopefully you were as honest as you can be when writing it and that it is as researched as possible   what is it going to take to get that first sale   what do you actually need to get there hint your logo on the side of a building is not a necessary expense   nor is really nice office space   once you have that first sale what is the second going to take   can you extrapolate out to 3 years   how many key members are there   how much is their contribution worth   at what point will you be profitable    next is to look at risks   you have n't done this before that 's huge i 'm assuming simply because you asked this question   another is competitors hopefully they already exist because opening a new market is incredibly hard and expensive on the flip side hopefully there are n't that many because entering a crowded market is equally hard and expensive   note each are possible but take radically different approaches and sums of money and $ 200k is n't going to cut it no matter what it is you are selling that said competition should be able to at least point you in the direction of a price point and estimate for how long sales take   if any are publicly traded then you have additional info to help you set a valuation   are there any potential regulatory or legal issues what happens if a key member leaves dies or is otherwise no longer available   insurance only helps so much if the one guy that knows everything literally gets run over   god help you if this person likes to go i bring risks up because you will have to them during this negotiation   for example asking for $ 200k with zero hard assets while trying to sell software to government agencies assuming a 3 week sales cycle will have you laughed at for naivety   whereas asking for $ 10 m in the same situation with a team that has governmental sales experience would likely work another big question is exit strategy do you intend to ipo or sell to a competitor or a business in a related category   if selling do you have evidence that the target company actually buys others and if so how did those deals work out   what did they look for in order to buy   exit strategy is huge to a vc and they will want to make several multiples of their money back in a relatively short amount of time   can you realistically support that for how much you are asking for   if not then going through an angel group would be better   they have similar questions but very different expectations the main thing is that no one knows what your business is worth because it is 100 unproven after 2 years and is therefore a huge financial risk   if the money you are asking for is to complete product development then that risk factor just went up radically as you are n't even talking about sales   if the money is purely for the sales channel then it 's likely not enough however if you know what it 's going to take to get that first sale and have at least an educated idea on how much it 's going to cost to repeat that then you should have an idea for how much money you want   from there you need to decide how much of the business it is worth to you to give up in order to get that money and voila you have a pre money valuation the real trick will be to convince the vc that you are right which takes research and a rock solid presentation and negotiating from there   no matter what offer a small percentage of the business for the money you want and realize you 'll likely give up much more than that a few things you should know usually by year 3 it 's apparent if a start up is going to work out or not   you 're in year 2 with no sales that does n't look good unless you are building a physical product have a competent team with hard experience doing this have patents at least filed a proven test product and hopefully have a few pre orders and just need cash to deliver   although in that situation i 'd probably tell you to ask your friends and family before talking to a vc   even would be better    $ 200k just is n't a lot of money and should be very easy to raise from friends or angels   if you ca n't then that speaks volumes to an institutional vc   a plus is having two or three people financially invested in the company more than that is sometimes a problem while having only 1 is a red flag if it 's a web thing and you 've been doing this for 2 years with zero sales and still need another $ 200k to complete it then i 'd say you need to take a hard look at what you 've built and take it to market right now   if you ca n't do that then i 'd say it might be time to abandon this idea and move on as you 'll likely have to give up 80%+ to get that $ 200k and most vcs i 've run into would n't bother at that level   which begs the question how did the conversation with the vc start   did you approach them or did they approach you   if the latter how did they even find out about you   do they actually know anything about you or is this a fishing expedition   if the latter then this is probably a complete waste of your time the above is only a rough guide because at the end of the day something is only worth what someone else is willing to pay   $ 200k in cash is a tiny sum for most vcs so without more information i have no clue why one would be interested in you i put a number of hard questions and statements in here   i do n't actually want you to answer me those are for you to think about   also none of this should n't be taken as a rather it should shock you into a realistic viewpoint and hopefully help you understand how others are going to see your baby    if the vc has done a bit of research and is actually interested in investing then they will bring up all the same things and likely more in order to convince you to give up a very large part of it   the question you have to ask yourself is is it worth it   sometimes it is often it 's not

it is   if the salaries were higher more bright college students would consider it a no brainer to pursue computer programming degrees in the same way that they do finance degrees   top talent should start in the mid and high end talent should be making tens of millions a year   their businesses share more in common with financial firms than manufacturing   but the pay has n't caught up because salaries are artificially deflated by selective immigration   i 'm all in favor of immigration restrictions but not when it 's targeted to prop up the bottom line of one already very profitable economic sector   it 's considered a win win for politicians because it creates jobs but all it really does is distort markets and make things our economy less efficient

as a former consumer credit counselor who worked with struggling homeowners and first time homebuyers i would argue that it is a mistake for lenders to rely on gross income and assumptions on what an applicant spends their income on i think lenders do this because they believe it is efficient and may not understand the long term ramifications for the stakeholders e.g. the borrower the lender the servicer the investor the broker the taxpayer the marshall the foreclosure lawyers etc or lenders do know the impact of a superficial mortgage screening and intentionally want to enrich themselves in the short term while harming other stakeholders in the long term developing a budget that reflects what a person can realistically spend on their mortgage takes much longer than signing up for a rocket mortgage i would say an hour minimum for the first appointment to get a baseline and at least two follow up appointments to make soon after or whenever a borrower 's financial situation changes dramatically credit counselors factor in all of the factors mentioned above i.e. take home pay future pay vs current pay the ability to adjust deductions seasonal expenses multiple sources of income and their frequency debt load etc budgets are always fluctuating but when it is done right by a qualified professional the result is a much more accurate financial picture   the consequences for not doing this type of old school due diligence or for willfully choosing to skip it are varied first off mortgages will be given to homeowners who should never have qualified in the first place and likewise denied to homeowners who should qualify this will result in market distortion and this distortion was a primary contributor to the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis and the wave of foreclosures that came with it another consequence is the stripping of wealth from minority communities since they are often targeted by the most unscrupulous of lenders additionally the securitization of mortgages based on poor diligence at the loan officer level means loan portfolio ratings are questionable investors will lose money and small banks who are heavily invested will fail as they did in the past depending on the federal enforcement of dodd frank act the taxpayers may or may not have to pick up the bill from a bailout of a big mortgage bank that was too big to fail via higher taxes lost jobs lost homes and other negative externalities that were not accounted for by the loan officer or willfully ignored   lastly borrowers also have a responsibility to provide accurate financial information which they do n't always do unfortunately in a capitalistic society where property is commoditized instead of communal there is always mistrust competition the fear that you will be left behind or the desire to get ahead this could incentivize cheating by either the borrower the broker lender or both in this example e.g. no doc negative loans this is just one of many other negative externalities so the only true fix would be a switch to communal land ownership in the interim i would push for universal borrower access to low cost consumer credit counselors and a change in loan officer training and incentive structure

do i have to explain the source of all income on my taxes yes you do say the of and mary the argued to the irs that the money was n’t income and so it should not be taxed as such the irs was n’t swayed by the couple ’s argument the case went to federal court and the irs won found property and money has been considered taxable income ever since the irs plainly states that taxpayers must report all income from any source even income earned in another country unless it is explicitly exempt under the u.s. tax code this covers a wide range of miscellaneous income including gambling winnings according to the decision money you find is n’t explicitly exempt the tax impact wo n’t be significant if you find an item of property with a fair market value of only $ 500 and are in the 25 tax bracket you ’ll owe the irs $ 125 $ 500 x .25 = $ 125 however if you are a finder and keeper of $ 10,000 your tax burden will be $ 2,500 $ 10,000 x .25 = $ 2,500

unfortunately it 's not unusual enough   if you 're looking for a popular car and the dealer wants to make sure they are n't holding onto inventory without a guarantee for sale then it 's a not completely unreasonable request   you 'll want to make sure that the deposit is on credit card not cash or check so you can dispute if an issue arises    really though most dealers do n't do this requiring a deposit pre sale is usually one of those negotiating tactics where the dealer you into a deal even if they do n't have a good deal to make   dealers may tell you that you ca n't get your deposit back even if they do n't have the car you agreed on or the deal they agreed to   you do have a right for your deposit back if you have n't completed the transaction but it can be difficult if they do n't want to give you your money back   the dealer does n't ever not know if they have that specific vehicle in stock   the dealer keeps comprehensive searchable records for every vehicle it 's good for sales and it 's required for tax records   even when they did n't use computers for all this the entire inventory is a log book or phone call away in my opinion i would never exchange anything with the dealer without a car actually attached to the deal   i 'd put down a deposit on a car transfer if i were handed a vin and verified that it had all the exact options that we agreed upon and even then i 'd be very cautious about the condition

to build a us credit record you need a social security number ssn which is now not available for most non residents    an alternative is an itin number which is now available to non residents only if they have us income giving a reason to file a us tax return do you really want to get into all that assuming you did have a reason to get a itin one reason would be if you sold some ebooks via amazon us and need a withholding refund under the tax treaty then recent reports on give mixed results on whether it 's possible to get a credit card with an itin and whether that would build a credit record   it does sound possible in some cases    a credit record in any other country would not help   you would certainly need a us address and banks are increasingly asking for a physical address rather than just a mailbox regardless building this history would be of limited benefit to you if you later became a us resident at that point you would be eligible for a new ssn different from the itin and have to largely start again if getting a card is the aim rather than the credit record you may find some banks that will offer a secured card or a debit card to non residents especially in areas with lots of canadian visitors border florida arizona   you 'd find it a lot easier with a us address though and you 'd need to shop around a lot of banks in person until you find one with the right rules   most will simply avoid anyone without an ssn

honestly i wonder if the other are n't overthinking it their answers are detailed and correct but what your coach may be saying is this when you have bought a stock on cash or margin and you are watching it rise you are evaluating when you sell on the price of the stock you are seeing in reality you should look at the bid price buyers will give you for the stock and ask price sellers will charge you for the stock prices if the stock is going up odds are the price of the stock is very close to the ask price because it is purchases that are driving it up but that 's not what you 're going to get when you sell you 're going to get something around the bid price if the spread between the two is large i.e. a volatile stock this could be many cents or more lower than the ask price therefore what your coach may mean by selling on ask is you 're using the stock price when it 's equal or close to the ask price to decide when to sell instead of letting the stock peak and drop when its price will approach the bid price or letting the trailing bid offers catch up to your desired sell point and selling then i.e. letting the stock point grow past your sell point dragging the bid price up with it just a thought but that sounds like a term a coach would come up with to mean selling and getting less than you thought you were going to from the sale i know it 's a reply but the interwebs are and people come via google i did

the lot size is 100 troy ounce see the contract specification at the same site so with the current price of around $ one lot would cost you around there may be other sites that offer smaller lots you would need to check with your broker if the price moves up by $ 500 you gain $ 50,000 for a lot the margin required changes from time to time   currently it 's $ with a maintenance of $ so a drop of $ per oz of gold will cause a margin call you make or lose 100 times the per oz movement as there are 100 oz in the contract you cited there 's also a broker fee analogous to the commission on a stock trade   the other option would be to buy a fund that invests in gold this will be more easier to buy and the lot sizes will be much less i hope you jumped into this great opportunity at the time experts said gold would have a straight run to $ 5000

as someone who 's currently shopping for some winter wheels and has the raised blood pressure to go with that i 've got a few suggestions as to what would make me pick up the phone and call your or email you if you 're advertising a vehicle keep in mind that if you 're willing to deal with the additional hassle you 'll normally get the most money for a used car if you sell it privately if it is worth the additional effort though is both a matter of judgement and if you 're willing to put up with strange people like me depending on the value of the vehicle and its rarity desirability you 're looking at newspaper ads probably wo n't get you much of a response these days craigslist and similar and last but not least ebay if you 're trying to sell something that 's easy to find because there are five at every street corner think minivan skip ebay if it 's worth below i would n't bother with places where you have to pay to advertise which leaves cl for the cheap stuff that said i 'd still stick it on cl if it 's advertised in other places heck it 's free after all the figure out what sort of money you 're asking for check the resources like and have a look at your local cl for similar vehicles out here certain types of vehicles for example sell quickly and often above even a little market research will help you come up with a good price just do n't do things like asking a massively inflated price for a vehicle because you paid $ x five years ago all this shows that you have no idea what your vehicle is worth oh and i 'd always work out what the minimum i 'd take is leave yourself some haggle room but do n't the vehicle once you know where you advertise and for how much pull together the basic facts for your vehicles and the points that would make it stand out basic facts about the car should include engine size type of transmission if it 's awd where applicable mileage color i can see on the pictures but it 's nice to include that too if you have service records recently replaced a big ticket item think transmission or similar or had a very recent service especially a big one where you had a timing belt and changed mention it do n't say the vehicle has a new engine if that was put in 100k miles ago that 's nice to mention but it 's not new if nobody 's ever smoked in it mention it if it 's got other outstanding features super low mileage summer only use etc make sure to mention it that too next if it 's got any faults that you know of especially obvious ones disclose them people like me will most likely find the leaking shock and the rust holes in the floor anyway and it makes a much better impression if you do tell us about them beforehand trying to tell someone that your banana shaped car that looks like the blue man group used it for practise is actually pristine and accident free is n't going to go down very well next pull together the paperwork make sure you 've got the title if there is a lien on the title check with the lienholder before advertising the car so you know their procedure for releasing the title any maintenance records you have manuals receipts etc if the vehicle has a salvage title try to find out why and mention it in the ad i 've just had a comedian phone me while i was driving to see his vehicle and leave a message that he did n't have a title and did n't seem to be willing to bother to get one either obviously that put me in the right frame of mind given that it was a 200 mile round trip so do n't do it if you ca n't get a title the schmuck you sold it to will have even less of a chance of getting one and given that you are in california a lot of people including myself react really badly to three years worth of back registration missing expired registrations on something i 'd expect to test drive etc essentially anything that would stop a potential cash buyer to drive it away on the spot next clean the car you know the five years of accumulated mcd and inch thick layer of dirt i 'm only partially kidding i 've seem some pretty horrible stuff recently spend the two hours it takes to clean it or pay to have it or detailed clean shiny cars sell a lot better than a rolling recycling container oh and last make the effort take some decent photos the more the shot in daylight no a black car after sunset and if there is any damage an additional photo or two showing the damage would be nice stick the on or similar and put the links in your craigslist ad so you do n't restrict yourself to the photos that you normally get on there as to payment i 'd either take cash meet the buyer at his bank where he draws out a cashiers check in front of your eyes or well cash no deeds on bridges in brooklyn or anything else be prepared to take a deposit a lot of buyers are n't willing to wander around with ten large ones in the back pocket to go look at a car and spell out exactly how long the deposit is good for i also tend to make them non refundable buyer does n't pick up the car within the negotiated timeframe you keep the deposit as damages for not being able to sell it to another cash buyer check your dmv 's website as to what exactly you need to do once you sold the car here in nevada it 's the buyer 's problem on how to move it as you keep the plates but i know in california the regular plates not personal ones iirc stay with the vehicle and i think you need to inform the dmv that you sold the vehicle i 'd also keep a record of who i sold a vehicle to name address from his drivers license license number etc just in case they run a few red lights and accumulate a few worth of parking tickets

ca n't vouch for la but property typically is taxed at either the appraised value the most recent purchase price if it was n't worth that much you would n't have paid that much or some combination of the two usually highest of the two to prevent $ 1 and other goods and services from lowering the tax to zero you have now explicitly paid a total of $ 125k for the property the fact that you bought it in two stages should n't be relevant but should and law are only tangentially connected i 'd recommend asking a tax accountant who know your local practices unless someone here can give you an authoritative answer

obviously the best way to consolidate the real estate loans is with a real estate loan mortgages being secured loans provide much better interest rates also interest can be deducted to some extent depending on how the proceeds are used but up to $ 100 k of the mortgage can have deductible interest just for using the primary residence as a collateral last but not least in many states mortgages on primary residence are non recourse again may depend on the money use that may prove useful if in the future your mother runs into troubles repaying it so yes your instincts are correct how to convince your mother that 's between you and her

time for a lawyer essentially regardless of the situation it 's not right for him to be paying the mortgage and only get half the value out of the equity in the house all other things aside no court i can think of would allow that the could happens are many but the most common include keep in mind that if he keeps paying the mortgage enough most courts will end up giving him ownership outright essentially they will say he has already bought her out by paying her half of the debt   unfortunately any way he goes he is going to need to take action when there is a missed mortgage payment a bad tax year or some other legal issue some one is injured on the property the last thing he is going to want is for the courts to decide the issue for him for example john breaks an arm while climbing a tree on the property line john takes the owners of the property to court he says but my sister owns half and the courts decide then and there that because he 's been paying the mortgage alone he owns the house alone seems like a win except now he owns the liability alone and owns john $ 1,000,000 for a silly lawsuit alone   point is this ownership of property comes with risks and responsibilities he really needs to get those risks and responsibilities under control so he can mitigate them or he could end up in a very nasty situation in the years to come

long story short 8 turned out to be the tipping point because it was the average subordination level of the a rated tranches of the subprime mbs bonds     the reason this was the magic number is because of the way bonds were placed during the period   basically no end user wanted to take on the risk of buying below a rated paper so instead of being sold directly these bbb rated and below bonds were re packaged into cdos and off   again the higher rated paper was sold off to whomever while the bbb and below stuff got and repackaged into other cdos or further levering up the initial subprime bonds     now back to the magic 8 number remember how i said that 8 was the subordination level for the a rated subprime paper the other way of saying that is once defaults reached 8 the bbb and below tranches of the the mbs were completely wiped out   since the cdos were largely made up of these bbb and below mbs once they started getting written down so did the cdos   when the lower rated cdo tranches started to go because they were also repackaged in the same way it just continued the negative feedback loop and before long even the   aa and aaa rated paper was seeing massive losses     as more and more supposedly safe paper started to get wiped out highly leveraged cds contracts started coming due causing aig which had written contracts on over $ 500 billion in assets to get downgraded by the rating agencies putting it on the brink of going under   because basically every major bank had exposure to aig had they gone under the other banks would have all had to write down those contracts at the same time essentially causing the entire financial system to collapse

any time you are optimizing a portfolio the right horizon to use for computing the statistics you will use for optimization expected return covariance etc will be the same as your rebalance trading frequency   if you expect your trading strategy to trade once a day you should use daily data for optimization   ditto for monthly or quarterly   if at all possible you should use statistics across the board that are computed at the same frequency as your trading regarding currency pricing i see no reason you ca n't take the reported prices and convert them to whatever currency you want using that day 's exchange rate   foreign exchange rates are available for free at the fed and elsewhere   converting prices from one currency to another is not rocket science since you are contemplating putting actual money behind this note that using data to compute statistics is less reliable for lower statistical moments   the mean expected return is the first moment so using historical returns is extremely unreliable at predicting future returns   the variances and are second moments they are better   and yet better   the fact that the expected return ca n't reliably be estimated from past returns is the major downfall of the markowitz method resulting portfolios are often very crazy and will depend critically on the data period you use to set them up    there are approaches to fixing this such as black 's 1992 method but they get complicated fast

when you buy shares you are literally buying a share of the company   you become a part owner of it companies are not required to pay dividends in any given year   it 's up to them to decide each year how much to pay out the value of the shares goes up and down depending on how much the markets consider the company is worth   if the company is successful the price of the shares goes up   if it 's unsuccessful the price goes down   you have no control over that   if the company fails completely and goes bankrupt then the shares are worthless dilution is where the company decides to sell more shares   if they are being sold at market value then you have n't really lost anything   but if they are sold below cost perhaps as an incentive to certain staff then the value of the company per share is now less   so your shares may be worth a bit less than they were   you would get to vote at the agm on such schemes   but unless you own a significant proportion of the shares in the company your vote will probably make no difference in practice you ca n't protect yourself   buying shares is a gamble   all you can do is decide what to gamble on

you 're a partnership you should ask the money to be paid to the partnership you 'll have to fill partnership income tax return form 1065 and each of you will get a k-1 schedule with your own personal portion of the income for example you 're adam ben and you work together on a project and are being paid you get a check for $ 300 issued to adam ben and dba abc partnership you do n't have to have a dba it just makes it easier to show you as a single entity you then deposit the check to an account you set up for your partnership and from that account you transfer $ 100 to each of you year end you file form 1065 showing $ 300 income and attach k-1 for each of the partners showing $ 100 income that $ 100 income will flow to your individual tax returns the overhead here is setting up a partnership account potentially making a dba and filing the extra tax return that 's the proper way to do it especially if it is something you 're going to do regularly for a one time thing one of you can get paid report it as income on his her schedule c and issue 1099 to the rest of you for your parts and deduct the amount as his her expense here the overhead is schedule c for each of you instead of schedule e if handling it as a partnership extra 1099 forms instead of 1065 and and a risk of one partner defrauding the others depends on how much you trust each other with proper documentation each of these is equally legal and tax wise the costs are the same i.e. either way you pay the same taxes with partnership the overhead is a bit more expensive extra cost but in the long term it will make your life easier if you do this kind of thing regularly you may want to consider setting up your partnership as a llc llp depending on what your state allows but that would require state paperwork and potentially more fees

this might vary from other answers but i generally prefer to use debt before touching an emergency fund   but one of the reasons i have an emergency fund is to that i can make sure i can cover any debt payments   essentially this give you leverage   you might start off with a small emergency such as needing a new refrigerator   if you pull the cash out of the fund to pay this off immediately you 've depleted your account and if something major comes along you might be short   by using debt you can often cover the costs with cash flow and leave your risk buffer in place often retailers will offer really sweet financing deals   0 for 12 months or whatever   often though if you do n't pay it off in time they can be costly   i 'm not sure if this is legal in the us anymore but if it was n't fully paid off in time you 'd be retroactively charged interest on the whole amount   but if you have an emergency fund you pretty much guarantee that wo n't happen   the only time it will is if something else happens that requires the emergency fund to be cashed in   but if things are that dire the debt is unsecured   you 're credit may suffer but they ca n't come after your assets it 's not an either or situation   you give yourself options by having the cash available   it allows you to take advantage of opportunities that might be too risky otherwise   ultimately what you want to be able to weather the storm in a situation where you have say a mortgage on a house that is underwater the stock market is down and you have no income   in that situation you do n't want to liquidate your stock when it 's down and you probably do n't want to lose your home equity in a foreclosure

looking at some large lotto games out there it seems that the lump sum cash option comes in at anywhere from about 50 to 70 percent of the jackpot amount sum of annual payouts typically over 20 to 30 years i 'm a fan of the phrase money today is better than money tomorrow   there 's no telling how laws will change taxes will change if inflation will skyrocket if you 'll die early if you or a family member will encounter a life changing event etc   by taking the lump sum option you trade a percentage of the winnings for the risk of the future unknowns   how much are those unknowns worth to you the tax implications are something else to consider   in your example of a small jackpot with $ 50,000 annual payouts it 's likely that you could still avoid the highest tax bracket each year whereas taking the lump sum would be taxed at the highest rate 35 of the amount above $ for a single filer in 2010   however this might not make much of a difference for large jackpots with higher annual payouts with the lump sum option you also have a greater potential of investment returns and losses since you can put all the money to work for you right away   it also allows you to purchase larger assets sooner if that 's something that interests you in the end i 'd say the reduced risk and the higher return potential of the lump sum option is well worth the reduced payout   i 'd also suggest not playing the lottery

this is going to depend on the tax jurisdiction and i have no knowledge of the rules in illinois   but i 'd like to give you some direction about how to think about this    the biggest problem that you might hit is that if you collect a single check and then distribute to the tutors you may be considered their employer   as an employer you would be responsible for things like   this is not meant as an exhaustive list    even if not an employer you are still paying them   you would be responsible for issuing 1099 forms to anyone who goes above $ 600 for the year source    you would need to file for a taxpayer identification number for your organization as it is acting as a business   you need to give this number to the school so that they can issue the correct form to you   you might have to register a doing business as name   it 's conceivable that you could get away with having the school write the check to you as an individual   but if you do that it will show up as income on your taxes and you will have to deduct payments to the other tutors    if the organization already has a separate tax identity then you could use that   note that the organization will be responsible for paying income tax   it should be able to deduct payments to the tutors as well as marketing expenses etc    if the school will go for it consider structuring things with a payment to your organization for your organization duties   then you tell the school how much to pay each tutor   you would be responsible for giving the school the necessary information like name address social security number and cost or possibly hours worked

for insight on what will happen i suggest looking at the situation from the lender 's perspective if your setbacks are temporary and you are likely to get back on your feet again they will protect their investment by making accommodations and probably charging you extra fees along the way if your financial hardship seems they probably try to squeeze you for as much as possible and then eventually take your house protecting their investment as best they can if they are going to foreclose they may be reluctant to do it quickly as foreclosure is expensive takes man power and looks bad on their books   so it may get pushed off for a quarter or a fiscal year but if you are asking if they 'll help you out from the goodness of their heart well a bank has no heart and creditors are interested in roi   they 'll take the easiest path to profit or failing that the path to minimum financial losses    the personal consequences to you are not their concern once you realize this it may change your thinking about your own situation    if you think you have a path to financial recovery then you need to make that clear to them in writing with details   make a business case that working with you is in their own best interests if you can not make such a case recognize that they 'll likely squeeze you for as much as possible in penalties fees interest payments etc before eventually foreclosing on you anyway   do n't play that game if your home is a lost cause financially plan how to get out from it with the smallest losses possible   do n't pay more than you need to and do n't throw good money after bad

i was in a very similar place 10 years ago i was in my mid 20 's with 45 k in combined school + personal business related debt and working in it for not very much i already had 10 15 k in debt when my college loans first came due and it was the first time i really had to come to terms with the hole i had dug myself and i spent weeks at a time obsessing over plans that would help me get out of debt it effected my health and my relationships i felt like i was never going to come out from under it my family was very much lower middle class k household income and i was n't going to get or expect any help there so i went to work and made it a point to make sure every personal and professional decision i made was conducive to my long term goals and before i knew it they became short term goals    find out what your basic monthly need is be brutally honest cut back on things like cable tv i still do n't have it reduce your phone plans borrow things when you do n't have to buy them and send that money to your debt pick up some hobbies that do n't cost much these are all minor sacrifices i got back in to playing the piano and spent a lot of time at the beach in the summer and up on books i 'd always meant to read in the winter    i ran a lot of numbers in a spreadsheet but you can play with the numbers with online loan calculators to put some real numbers behind your goals here is one that i just tried out   you 'll probably be surprised how much effect a little bit of extra towards a loan can make in the long term   put your current college loan details in to it and then see what the effect of an extra 150 a month is i know you 've implied that you really do n't have anything extra each month and that is fine figure out an amount that gets you moving towards your goals and then start working on a way to make it figuring out how to make or squeeze an extra n dollars out of your budget every 30 days is much less daunting than thinking about paying off 50k. you said you are working in it i do n't know where you live but in my city there are lots of decent it related jobs your first goal might need to be to find a better one     if possible move around balances until you 've got interest rates you can deal with and now that you have solid numbers to plan with consider the effect of making smaller goals would you feel as bad if you had half as much debt how about if you got rid of 10 k of debt or just your credit cards   i know i felt a huge relief when i cut my overall debt in half it felt like a huge part of my burden had lifted and it had i could start seeing the end of the tunnel     i think that one of the biggest changes in my life since then has been the way i look at and think about money and debt   i did n't really have to sacrifice much i learned to travel cheaply and whenever i met    a goal i 'd reward myself with a small trip today i have a very low mortgage payment and i pay my full credit balances each month so i have no revolving bad debt    i wish you luck and i know exactly where you are standing right now

as nri pio non resident indian person of indian origin the overseas income and transfers in foreign currency are exempt from indian income taxes however the account in india has to be designated nre or fcnr there are three kind of accounts that an nri can maintain interest earned in nre and fcnr accounts is exempt from income taxes interest earned in nro accounts is not exempt from income taxes in fact banks would withhold about 30 of interest tds the exact tax liability would depend upon income generated in india and tds could be applied towards that liability when the tax returns are filed there are other implications also of designating the account as nre or nro nre accounts can only be funded via inward remittance of permitted foreign currency e.g. deposit usd gbp so proceeds like rental income pension etc that are generated in inr within india ca n't be deposited in this account the money deposited in nre account can grow tax free and can be converted back in any foreign currency freely on the other hand nro accounts can be funded through both inward remittance of permitted foreign currency or local income e.g. rental pension etc all the amount in this account is treated as indian originated inr even if remitted in foreign currency and thus is taxed as any other bank account the amount in this account is subject to the annual cap of of usd 1 million both nre and nro accounts are maintained in inr and can be saving and term deposit any remittance made to these accounts in any foreign currency is converted to inr at the time of deposit and is maintained in inr fcnr account are held in foreign currency and can only be term deposit official definitions accounts for non resident indians nris and persons of indian origin

yes you can insure against the fall in price of stock by purchasing a put option   you pay for a put and if the price of the share falls below the strike price of the put then you can exercise the put   on exercise the person who sold you the put contract agrees to buy the stock for the strike price even though that strike price is higher than the market price   you can adjust the level of insurance by buying put options at higher or lower prices or buying fewer put options than shares you own leaving some shares uninsured alternatively you can minimize your risk exposure by investing in an index or other fund which gives you partial ownership in a large number of shares   that means on any given day lots of shares do worse and lots of shares do better   you can reduce the need for insurance by purchasing a lower risk lower growth financial product

changing my answer based on clarification in comments it appears that some of the securities you mentioned including are traded on what is colloquially known as the grey market grey sheets and also known as the gray market is another category of otc stocks that is completely separate from pink sheets and the   from investopedia the grey market is an over the counter market where dealers may execute orders for preferred customers as well as provide support for a new issue before it is actually issued this activity allows underwriters and the issuer to determine demand and price the securities accordingly before the ipo   some additional information on this type of stocks source unlike other financial markets no recent bid or ask quotes are available because no market makers share data or quote such stocks there is no quoting system available to record and settle trades all grey sheet trading is moderated by a broker and done between individuals at a price they agree on the only documentation that can be publicly found regarding the trades is when the last trade took place no sec registration and little sec regulation regulation of grey sheet stocks takes place mainly on a state level unlike pink sheets these stocks have no sec registration to possess a stock symbol or to possess shares or trade shares of that stock such penny stocks similar to pink sheets are not required to file sec securities and exchange commission financial and business reports these stocks may not be solicited or advertised to the public unless a certain number of shares are qualified to be traded publicly under 504 of regulation d. extremely illiquid gray sheet trading is infrequent and for good reason difficult to trade not advertised difficult to follow the price the least regulation possible hard to find any information on the stock very small market cap little history and most such stocks do not yet offer public shares the lack of information bids history financial reports alone causes most investors to be very skeptical of gray sheets and avoid them altogether   gray sheets are commonly associated with initial public offering ipo stocks or start up companies or spin off companies even though not all are ipo 's start ups or spin offs grey sheets is also home to delisted stocks from other markets some stocks on this financial market were once traded on the nasdaq or the pink sheets but ran into serious misfortune usually financial and thus failed to meet the minimum requirements of the registered sec filings and/or stock exchange regulations for a financial market such stocks were delisted or removed and may begin trading on the grey sheets   so to answer your question i think the cause of the wild swings is that    great question btw

gt our corporations pay some of the lowest taxes in the world with some of the larger ones actually paying none   no they do n't the top marginal rate for income taxes is 38 meanwhile in the republic of ireland rates vary from 12.5 25 depending on the exact source of the income so no our corporations do not pay the lowest taxes in the world as far as them paying none that stems from one of two things one corporations that pay out all their money in salaries and therefore have no retained earnings hence all their money is taxed at the individual level and workers get at a full 35 and two corporations that create a price transfer agreement with a foreign corporation so that income is shifted to a low tax region where they end up paying nothing to uncle sam that money will still be taxed if they ever try to bring it home and distribute it but as long as it stays overseas then no one can touch it because technically it has n't been earned as income yet that 's how companies avoid greedy bastards trying to take their money because contrary to your opinion you 're not actually entitled to any of their money or anyone else 's money either it 's not your money or our money its their money and they have an effective method to make sure it stays that way   gt btw if wanting decent opportunity to take care of me and mine is greed then yes i 'm greedy    you can already do that it 's called getting a fucking job and living within your means you do n't deserve anything in life you have to earn it no one is obligated to just give you things just because you want them ultimately this whole lets sock it to the rich attitude does n't actually take any money out of their pockets the only people harmed are workers who ca n't take advantage of the methods they use to shift income overseas in short you 're not simply wrong you 're criminally ignorant

i believe there is an overtime meal allowance that is if an employee works overtime defined as p.m. for a start or ten plus hours after the shift starts the company can provide a non taxable meal free of charge or give a reasonable allowance $ that must be spent outside on a meal no drinks this is because the employee is working extra hours at the convenience of the company lunches can be subsidized that is the company can provide lunch on company premises and must charge employees the direct costs of the food and preparing it but can forego charging for overhead e.g. the implied rent for the lunch facility and profit

most of the information we get about how a company is running its business in any market comes from the company if the information is related to financial statements it is checked by an external audit and then provided to the public through official channels all of these controls are meant to make it very unlikely for a firm to commit fraud or to cook its books in that sense the controls are successful very few firms provide fraudulent information to the public compared with the thousands of companies that list in stock markets around the world   now there is still a handful of firms that have committed fraud and it is probable that a few firms are committing fraud right now but these companies go to great lengths to keep information about their fraud hidden from both the public and the authorities all of these factors contribute to such frauds being black swan events to the outside observer   a black swan event is an event that is highly improbable impossible to foresee with the information available before the event it can only be analyzed in retrospect and it has very large impact the classification of an event as a black swan depends on your perspective e.g. the enron collapse was not as unexpected to the enron executives as it was to its investors   you can not foresee black swan events but there are a few strategies that allow you to insure yourself against them one such strategy is buying out of the money puts in the stocks where you have an investment the idea being that in the event of a crash due to fraud or whatever other reason the profits in your puts would offset the loses on the stock this strategy however suffers from time and loses a little money every day that the black swan does n't show up thanks to theta decay   so while it is not possible to detect fraud before investing or at least not feasible with the resources and information available to the average investor it is possible to obtain some degree of protection against it at a cost whether that cost is too high or not is the million dollar question

for starters like some other people have said just talk to someone in ib and get some advice on how to break in and what it 's really like i 've spoken to people in ib and learned that it 's really just not going to be for me in response to your four questions   1   get your degree at depaul and wait a few years to get your masters you do n't need an mba for ib and it 'll be a lot harder to go to a prestigious grad school without significant work experience and a solid network   1 it definitely would n't hurt for you to double major in cs but if you do you 're going to have to keep your grades up and still stay sharp in both majors you do n't want to have a 3.0 and have both it 'll kill your chances you 're going to need at least a 3.8 if you 're under that it 's gon na be a lot harder to get anywhere    1 if there are other industries you want to turn to then sure i used to be interested in ib but now i 'm leaning more towards private equity and working with reg d. clients 1031 exchanges etc    1 network if you are n't already seriously get out there and network like hell but do n't just cold call random people you really need to make meaningful connections with people and continue to stay in contact with them you can also learn a lot from wso and various ib books guides etc i have a bunch of that stuff on my google drive from a friend if you want it    and some general   do n't stress about the school you go going to a prestigious school really does help but if you work hard enough make the right connections and are good at what you do you can land a role in ib i know several people that have gone into ib from my school and i would consider us maybe a grade c state school it 's possible   i 'd also recommend looking more at a boutique and middle mark companies rather than your bulge bracket banks it 'll have less competition and could be easier to break into and like some other people are said you really need to get that junior year internship if you want to make it into ib but if you ca n't get into ib right after school do n't fret go somewhere get some experience get your certifications series 7 series 63 etc and try again   know your technicals you need to be able to walk through a dcf an lbo and all of the financial statements in an interview there are billions of guides on how to do this but you need to know this   stay on top of current events just be well versed in how the market is doing which industries are hot right now and what 's not and why   know your story believe it or not but your story and how that aligns with a companies culture is really important i have a friend that did n't make it into a certain firm solely because they just did n't think he was a good enough fit for their culture i want to make a lot of money wo n't work instead think more along the lines of i want to challenge myself   good luck man

do not do investing with a bank   do investing with a low cost investment company like vanguard fidelity or charles schwab   the lower the expenses of the fund the better the additional money your account earns because of lower overhead expenses is so dramatic over the course of your investing it is mind boggling to me    the lower the expenses the more of your money you keep which feeds the power of compound interest

you are likely thinking of a individual variable insurance contract better known as a segregated fund or a principal protected note for a segregated fund to get a full guarantee on invested capital you need a where the maturity value and death benefit are each 100 guaranteed the works similar to a long term gic or cd with a variable investment component   the thing is neither of these things are cheap and the cost structure that is built in behind them makes it difficult to make any real above market rates of return in both cases if you try to break the contracts early then the guarantees are null and void and you get out what you get out

ditto just to get concrete i just checked one bank in india and they say they are paying 4 on savings accounts i do n't know what you 're getting or if 4 is typical in india but it 's at least an example so if the bank pays interest based on average daily balance and you left the money in the bank for a week you 'd get = so on rs 95,000 that would be rs 73 i live in the us where typical interest on a savings account today is about 1 so an equivalent amount of money i think that would be about $ 1,500 would get of 1 or 29 cents   do n't leave the lights turned on while you do the calculations you 'll spend more on the electricity than you make on the interest addendum this suddenly reminds me i read a news story a few years ago about a man who was expecting a tax refund check from the irs of a few hundred dollars and when the check arrived it was for several million well obviously it was a mistake but he came up with the clever idea deposit the check in an interest bearing account promptly contact the irs inform them of the mistake and ask how and where to go about returning the money hope that it takes at least a few days for them to figure everything out then keep the interest accumulated on the several million dollars for the time that he had the money and as he contacted them immediately about the error they ca n't say he was trying to hide anything it was a nice try but it did n't work they demanded he send them the interest as well as the principle

competition or actually lack of competition mostly due to a demand curve that has minimal change due to price you would buy the equivalent cheaper option if it was available but the store has little interest in offering multiple competing options that would drive their same store revenue down and the competing stores grocery department drug card have similar overhead costs floor space lights personnel most carry the cards for incremental revenue and observe little advantage to lower price for a card customers seldom buy more cards due to a lower price thus they mark the price to what most customers are willing to pay you may choose to shop the various stores and find the one that has a slightly better pricing for cards and then stop at that store when you want to buy a card but many cards are sold as an incremental purchase as part of a larger shopping trip convenience as the customer combines trips reduce the time spent shopping albeit not reducing the money spent
