i do n't have any specific situation on the situation in austria but in general there are a few things that you should keep in mind first of all the official website of the austrian tax authorities appears to be this one there is an english page there but it is mainly aimed at international businesses the part about tax treaties may be relevant though the general procedure is outlined here like i said in my comment most information is likely only available in german i would strongly advise to ask help from someone who speaks german and is familiar with the tax system in austria the main thing that you would have to do first is to check of which country you are a resident for tax purposes this is usually the country in which you lived for more than 183 days in the past year if you moved during the year and had income from more than one country you may have to file tax returns in both countries there are tax treaties between austria and the uk and most other countries so you would have to check those treaties to find out what gets taxed where in principle you get taxed only once but usually you would have to declare all income the last important thing is of course to make sure you submit before the relevant deadlines

i 'm surprised by all the pro credit answers here debit has some definite advantages most importantly when you pay with a credit card the merchant pays around 3 of the transaction to the credit company in many states they are forced to charge you the same amount and this is frequently as consumer protection but consider what this means for the business they loose money for every credit transaction and they 're legally forbidden to do anything about it so you 're taking 3 from a business and handing it over to a massive cooperation   to make matters worse the buisness is inevitably going to have to raise their prices by a small amount so in the end the average consumer has gained nothing on the other hand the credit card company wins big and they use their profits to pay lobbyists and lawyers to keep these rules in place to put in the worst possible light it 's essentially legal extortion on corruption as for the fraud protection offered while it may be true that credit cards will offer a more hassle free reimbursement i.e. you just do n't have to pay the bill if your card is stolen consumer protection laws also extend to debit in many cases your bank is legally required to cut you a check for all the money you lost

as for refinancing many institutions charge up front fees when doing any type of vehicle loan typically this is in the neighborhood of 1 the value of the loan with a floor of $ 100 although this may vary by lender however for the loan the be secured by the vehicle the principle value must be less than the collateral value in your case this means there is a collateral shortfall of $ 4,000 when working with a traditional bank you would have two options pay the difference up front reducing the principle value of the loan or obtaining a separate loan for the difference this separate loan would often have a higher interest rate unless you have some other form of collateral to secure it with i doubt carmax would do a separate loan all that being said if you plan on selling the vehicle within the next months do n't bother refinancing it wo n't be worth the hassle

there are lots of different ways to generate passive income   what is passive income basically it is income you receive without having to consistently work for it i.e. paid to do your day job or get paid by the hour instead you do the work once and then receive ongoing payments like a recording artist getting paid royalties or a book author etc   online passive income also some online business models can be great ways to generate passive income you set up an automated system online to drive traffic and sell products either as the merchant or an affiliate and get paid regularly without having to do any more work   you just need to use seo or ppc or media buys or online advertising to generate the automated traffic to your website which will have special landing pages and sales that do the conversion and selling for you if you are an affiliate you do n't even have to handle any products packaging delivering etc   and if it ’s a digital product like software or information products they can be sent straight to the customers automatically online then you can set up a system that can generate true passive income time consuming or expensive however the above mentioned methods of generating passive income tend to require a lot of work or special skills talent or knowledge and can be expensive or time consuming to set up preferred method therefore for many people the preferred passive income method is fully managed hands free property investing or other types of investing for that matter   but for people who want full ownership of the income generating asset then property investing is the best as they can sell and have control over the capital invested whereas investing in a business for example will have a lot of other variables to consider like the business sector the market factors the management team and even down to individual employee performance so in my opinion if you have the money to invest then fully managed hands free buy to let property investing is one of the best types of passive income available to us today   some of the most popular income generating property assets today in the uk include    student property    care homes    residential buy to let

i do n't have any experience in this but this is my academic understanding of business pricing   the lowest amount a seller would accept is the liquidation value for a b&b what would the value of the land the house the furnishings accounts payable etc be if it had to be sold today minus any liabilities   the amount the seller would like to pay for is going to be a multiple of its annual earnings one example of this is the discounted cash flow analysis you determine the ebitda the earnings a company generated before interest   depreciation taxation and amortization   once you have this amount you can project it out in perpetuity or you use an industry multiplier   perpetuity   you project this value out in discounted by the going interest rate in other words if you project the business will earn $ the business should grow at a 5 rate and the going interest rate is 8 using a growing perpetuity formula one value of a business would be 100,000 .08 = $ 2,000,000   this is a very high number and the seller would love to get it   it 's more common to do a multiple of the you can do some research into the valuation of the particular industry to figure out the multiplier for the industry for example this article suggests that the 2011 ebitda multiplier for hospitality industries is it 's valuing large hotel chains but it 's a start so the value of this b&b would be around $ here is an online sme valuation tool to help with the multiple based valuation also from my research it looks like many small business use seller discretionary earnings   instead of ebitda i do n't know much about it but it seems to serve a similar purpose as ebitda   a potential buyer should request the financial statements of the business for the last few years to determine the value of the business and then can negotiate with the owner a price you would probably want to enlist a broker to help you with the transaction

gt that said the non profit also was likely to enroll about 1,000 students at nominal tuition levels whereas the for profit is likely to enroll tens of thousands with dozens of staff doing nothing but making sure their students get the largest possible student loans   i get what you are saying the non profit is n't causing as much long term damages as these for profit johnny come has anyone taken the numbers and really crunched them   i feel like the problem is the perverse incentives created by the student loan system there is n't anything inherently wrong with for profit colleges but there are issues under the current system because of the way we extend credit to students anytime credit is available the big corrupt banks are not far behind   i say get rid of the loan programs and see how these for profit schools adjust i think they would probably be able to adjust more quickly and possibly even get better than the non profit schools due to their lack of legacy contracts and traditions

two options not mentioned information about your emergency fund in your question if you do n't have 6 months of expenses saved up in a safe place high yield savings account or money market fund i 'd add to that first you auto withdraw the amount over six months then when you can start contributing contribute twice as much so you are still putting in $ 18,000 a year the amount you pulled into savings the first 6 months could be used to make up for the extra income coming out after the six months are over depending on your income and since you have the ability to save it 's important not to lose access to these tax efficient accounts and also tax brokerage account as mentioned above is also fine but if you will use this money for downpayment on a home or something similar within the next five years i would n't recommend investing it however having money invested in an after tax account is n't a terrible thing yes you 'll get taxed when you sell the investments but you have a lot of flexibility to access that money at any time unlike your retirement accounts

i just scanned in a single sheet summary of my last two years tax returns it is something our cpa does for us how would i post it do n't worry i marked out all the personal information     what is says is i paid over $ 50 k in taxes in 2015 last year we had one of our biggest contracts put on hold so i only paid $ 20k.    i wo n't have this years figures because we do n't submit them to our cpa until the end of the year however this year we just bought out two other owners at $ 1.2 m which makes me a 33 owner the contract is getting knock on wood which all together means my personal tax liability is going to be well over $ 100k.    my company is a commercial company but we work with the government and matter of fact some of the stuff we produce was designed and developed by the government as is many of today 's modern inventions i think you would be surprised    so lets tackle it one at a time pick one of those things that commercial does better than government    p.s higher taxes does n't mean higher for you a lot of times it means higher for guys like me or way better than me which i am perfectly fine with and matter of fact would support people who use more like large corporations should pay more for it

gold has no intrinsic value none whatsoever   this is because value is a subjective term intrinsic value makes just as much sense as a cat dog animal dog and cat are referring to two mutually exclusive animals therefore a cat dog is a nonsensical term intrinsic value   the actual value of a company or an asset based on an underlying perception of its true value   intrinsic value is perceived which means it is worth whatever you or a group of people think it is intrinsic value has nothing i repeat absolutely nothing to do with anything that exists in reality   the most obvious example of this is the purchase of a copy right you are assigning an intrinsic value to a copy right by purchasing it however when you purchase a copy right you are not buying ink on a page you are purchasing an idea someone 's that for all intensive purposes does n't even exist in reality by definition things that do not exist do not have intrinsic properties because things that do n't exist do n't have any natural properties at all intrinsic according to dictionary   belonging to the essential nature or constitution of a thing the intrinsic of a star   an intrinsic property of an object is something we know that exists because it is a natural property of that object emit light we know this because we can measure the light coming from it it is not subjective intrinsic value is the opposite of intrinsic

gt why should i have to pay someone more to do a shittier job just because they 're in a members only club   uh you might not have to pay more since many employers can just take a modest hit to their profit margin to treat their workers better than cattle and given the amounts they 're paying their workers to begin with i doubt your wallet will scream in pain if prices inch up a tiny bit to pay these so they may live lives of regular poverty instead of grinding poverty getting beyond the liquid bullshit your sentence has been in i 'll assume you 're merely asking why you should have to pay someone more to do the same job   essentially the answer lies in the power employers usually have to to lower wages because there are always fewer usually far fewer employers in any industry than there are employees so the employers are always in an exclusive members only club the examples of employers combining to lower wages and salaries are so numerous that it 's an embarrassment of riches as to which to choose but i 'll pick the refusal of major league baseball to sign free agents in 1979 just to teach the players a lesson this ended rod 's career among other things even though the owners were later punished in court so it does not please me   in some industries unions are unnecessary medicine and law come to mind but these workers still have wage hiking and incompetence protecting mechanisms consider the ama 's efforts to close teaching hospitals and limit doctor supply or the seeming inability of state bar associations to investigate anything less than the incompetence of their members it 's just that the ama and the bar association are not called unions   but back to the issue of walmart unionization unions though prone to excess when they are too strong have been the only means of leveling the playing field between ownership and employees in ways that have made life livable for all of us today want an example the 40-hour week which would never have become customary let alone been given legal force if it were up to the employers and the free market fairy with her magical market dust today employees in industries never unionized enjoy the benefits of overtime pay decent working conditions saturdays off and healthcare such as it is thanks to union representatives who were beaten by thugs and then returned to be beaten so many times that the bosses finally gave in and made america a decent place to live for those who were labor and not just capital   it has been proven over and over again throughout history that given the chance the wealthy will treat the rest of us like s h i t unless we occasionally fight back collectively if labor becomes cheaper under the free market employers will eventually attempt to pay workers only enough to reproduce unless there are so many workers already that this is unnecessary and nothing more knowing what societies are like when this occurs think 19th century industrial europe or modern venezuela i 'm not eager to live in such a society   when workers are treated like dirt you usually end up paying more anyway in home security systems public safety costs and salaries for corpse removal crews to keep the city streets clean   tldr fuck you you ignorant fuck

let 's say i have $ 10,000 and i invest said monies in mutual fund    at $ 100/share effectively giving me 100 shares now let 's    assume at the end of the year i have a 5 return my $ 10,000 is now    $ 10,500 at what point does my investment benefit from compounded interest    monthly quarter yearly does it even benefit daily would be my answer as your investment unless you are selling shares or not re investing distributions is getting the following day 's change that impacts the overall return consider how if your fund went up 2 one day and then 2 another day from that $ 10,000 initial investment the first gain brings it up to $ and then the second makes it $ where the extra $ 2 is from the compounding the key though is that these are generally small movements that have to be multiplied together note also that if your fund goes up and down you may end up down overall given how the returns compound consider that your $ 10,000 goes up 10 to $ 11,000 and then down 10 to result in $ 9,900 as the return for up x% and down x% is which in this case is 1 as 10 of 10 is 1 the key is how long do you keep all the money in there so that the next day is applied to that amount rather than resetting back to the initial investment

gt;sounds like he should sell or close the company   you bring up a very good point if he cares so much about his employees but it 's just too inconvenient for him to run the company if his taxes go up 5 why not sell it instead of putting 7000 people out of a job why threaten people when there 's an obvious alternative hell if he just wants to close it anyways he could just give the company away   i can already shoot down your explanation because it 's not just higher taxes its increased business tax liability increased business insurance liability   nope he explicitly states that he will downsize or close the company if there are any new taxes whatsoever on either him or the business it 's also worth noting that his company is currently more profitable than its ever been   said he did nt build it   what   is cute until thousands of employees are out of jobs because the owner did n't feel it was worth it to continue the business   yeah so maybe he should cut his bullshit rhetoric when those jobs are on the line and the only one responsible for their fates is him and if it 's really too much of a bother for him to run the company if he 's making slightly less money when he 's already said he has more money than he 'll ever need he can promote someone else to run the company or just sell it saying he cares about his employees makes him a liar criticizing people who spent beyond their means makes him a hypocrite and his empty threats and beating make him a bully

be radical i assume you are not working for a city bank getting paid city wages e.g. you are one of the 99 of people in london or more normal income house prices and rents in london and anywhere within reasonable commuting distances are now so high that couples in reasonable jobs often have to rent rooms in shared houses    this is due to so many people wishing to live work in london and there not being enough new homes built   if you are looking at buying a property to rent out you need the rent to be about double the interest payments on the mortgage otherwise you will not be able to afford repairs or cope when interest rates increase you could also get a tax bill that is more the your profit    finding such a property is very hard in london as the prices of homes have gone up a lot more in london then rents have      there are still some flats where the rent will cover the landlord ’s costs but not many    any landlord that brought more than a few years ago is making a very nice profit in london as the rents have gone up a lot since they brought but are you willing to bet your life on the rents going up even more moving a short distance out of london does not help much so look at somewhere like manchester or birmingham

do you work in this field or something you sound like a very passionate apologist    gt;why should n't traders be able to decide as a group what the companies are worth   because often they purposefully distort value so they can either a buy low and profit or b sell high and profit why are you so anti government i 'd rather have people i elected and who are accountable to me determining things instead of private and highly selfish interests who represent only themselves    gt do you really think that intraday or even prices are really representative of what the market thinks a company is valued at   if not why bother with the in the first place what is the point of wild price fluctuations even throughout a single day if they as you admit do not represent value the whole concept of short term profiting off of these pointless and often engineered market movements is silly and adds nothing to society whatsoever the original point of the stock market further that money needs to come from somewhere and that typically is long term investors who want a pension at some point and do n't feel like trading at timeframes because they do something useful instead its disgusting   to the effect of long term buy and holders changing their mind about a company the effect of any hft people on the valuation of a stock is practically nothing like i said there 's just about no evidence of speculators causing significant mispricing over any significant period   so you 're saying just because the aggregate effect is no one should worry about it that is the absolute thing i have ever heard if i steel a car every other week who cares right millions of cars are made every year the effect of me stealing 20 or 30 wo nt change car markets in any noticeable way    further speculation in commodities mainly food has indeed caused enormous mispricing and human suffering in the developing world

first off putting extra cash toward a mortgage early on when most of the payments are going to interest is the best time if you pay an extra $ 1 on your mortgage today   you will save 30 years worth of interest assuming a 30 year mortgage if in 29 years you pay an extra dollar you will only save 1 year worth of interest that said there are lots of things that go into a decision like this do you have other debts how stable is your income what is the interest rate on your mortgage compared to any other debts you may have or potential investments you might make how much risk are you willing to take etc mortgages tend to be very low interest and at least in the u.s. the interest on them is tax deductible making the effective interest rate even lower if you have some other loan you are almost always better to pay the other loan off first if you do n't mind a little risk you are usually better off to invest your money rather than pay off the mortgage suppose your mortgage is 5 the average return on the stock market is something like 7 according to my buddy who works for wells fargo so if you put $ 1000 toward your mortgage you 'd save $ 50 the first year ignoring compounding for simplicity changes the exact numbers but not the basic idea if you put that same $ 1000 in the stock market than if it 's a typical year you 'd make $ 70 you could put $ 50 of that toward paying the interest on your mortgage and you 'd have $ 20 left to go on a wild spending spree the catch is that the interest on a mortgage is fixed while the return on an investment is highly variable in an average year the stock market might return 7 but this year it might return 20 or it might lose 10 or a wide range of other possible numbers well you might have a variable rate mortgage but there are still usually some defined limits on how much it can vary

i think you can do it as long as those money do n't come from illegal activities money laundering etc the only taxes you should pay are on the interest generated by those money while sitting in the uk bank account since i suppose you already paid taxes on those money in greece while you were earning those money about being audited in my own experience banks do n't ask you much where your money are coming from when you bring money to them they are very willing to help and happy it 's a story when you ask to borrow money when i opened a bank account in us i did not even have an ssn but they did n't care much they just took my passport and used the passport number for registering the account obviously on the interest generated by the money in the us bank account i had to pay taxes but it was easy because i simply let the irs via the bank to the 27 on the interest generated not on the capital deposited i did n't put a huge amount of money there i had to live there for 1 year or some more maybe if i deposited a huge amount of money someone would have come to ask me how did i make all those money but those money were legally generated by me working in italy before so i did n't have anything to be afraid about btw in italy i was thinking to move money to a german bank in germany the risk of default is a nightmare something of new now in compared to the past where each state had its own currency according to muro history says that in case of default it happened that some government prevented people from withdrawing money form bank accounts yes historically governments have    shut down banks to prevent people from    withdrawing their money in times of    crisis see argentina circa 2001 or us    during great depression the    government prevented people from    withdrawing their money and people    could do nothing while their money    rapidly lost value but in case greece prevents people from money those money are still in euro so i 'm wondering what would be the effect i mean would it be fair that a greek guy can not withdraw is euro money an italian guy can withdraw the same currency money in italy

there is not necessarily a need to prevent what you describe turning insurance on before high risk situations they just need to calculate the premiums accordingly for example if an insurance needs to take for insuring your house against flood and a flood happens in average every 10 years if you just insure the two weeks in the ten years where heavy rain is predicted you might pay 500 $ for the two weeks the total is the same for the insurance they get 500 $ and you get insurance for the dangerous period in the contrary if a flooding unexpectedly happens outside your two weeks they are out from the home owners view 500 $ for two weeks when heavy rains and floods are expected and nothing otherwise sounds pretty good compared to 50 $ every year it is the same of course but psychology works that way

how low you can reduce your costs does depend on your calling pattern   how many minutes per month you call locally call long distance call internationally and how many minutes you receive calls for   if all these figures are low you can be better off with a pay per minute service if any of the outbound figures are high then you could consider a flat rate unlimited service   so that 's the first step determine your needs do n't pay for what you do n't need for example i barely use a landline voip phone any more   but it is still useful for incoming calls and for 911 service   so i use a prepaid pay per minute voip company that has a flat rate < $ for the incoming number an add on fee for the 911 service 80c mo and per minute costs for outgoing calls 1c min or less to us canada western europe   i use my own box under $ 50 to buy   there is a bit of setup and learning needed but the end result means my landline bill is usually under $ no other taxes or fees companies in this byod bring your own device space in the us canada include in order and many others   a good discussion forum to learn more about them is the voip forum at although it can be a bit technical   there is also a reviews section at that site if your usage is higher you make lots of calls to a variety of numbers most of these companies and others have flat rate bundles probably similar to what you have now   comparing them depends on your usage pattern so again that 's the first thing to consider then you know what to shop for   if you need features like or be sure to look at whether you need an expensive bundle with it in or whether you 're better off paying for that if your outbound calls are to a limited number of numbers such as relatives far away or internationally consider getting a similar voip system for those relatives   most voip companies have free on network calls between their customers regardless of the country they are in   so your most common and most lengthy calls could be free the boxes 's analog telephone have an advantage here if you install them in yours and relatives houses   as well as allowing you to use any of the bring your own device voip companies like those listed above they have their own network allowing free calls between their boxes and also to from their ios and android apps   there are other 's from other companies cisco have well known models and other ways to make free calls between them so is n't the only option   i mentioned above i pay for the incoming number   not every supplier has incoming numbers available in every area you need to check this   some can port in transfer in your existing number if you are attached to it but not all can so again check you can also get incoming numbers in other areas or countries that ring on your home line without forwarding costs   this means you can have a number near a cluster of relatives who can call you with a local call   does n't directly save you money each number has a monthly fee but could save you having to call them back

no   in good years the income seems free in a down year particularly a bad one the investor will be subject to large losses that will prove the strategy a bad one   on the other hand one often hears of the strategy of selling puts on stock you would like to own if the stock rises you keep the premium if it drops you own it at a bit of a discount from that starting point

cd 's are not compressed later specifications added surround sound encoding higher sampling rates and bit depths compression especially compression is a different animal and some later formats may use some form of compression but the cd version of encoding is not considered compression   the spec was designed to exceed the range of normal human hearing and if properly implemented it 's suitable for that purpose there are a lot variations in terms of recording mastering and in terms of the quality of the gear involved and the techniques used which is probably what the sentence you quoted meant i.e.   cd recorded on a cheap setup using default settings and playing it back on a budget consumer player might not sound as good as a vinyl record mastered by a pro and played back on a high quality pickup connected to an grade and speakers and vice versa

yes if it 's an american style option american style options may be exercised at any time prior to expiration even if they 're not in the money generally you are required to deliver or accept delivery of the underlying by the beginning of the next trading day if you are short you may be chosen by the clearinghouse to fulfill the exercise a process called assignment because the clearinghouse is the counter party to every options trade you can be assigned even if the specific person who purchased the option you wrote did n't exercise but someone else who holds a long position did similarly you might not be assigned if that person did exercise the clearinghouse randomly chooses a brokerage to fulfill an assignment and the brokerage will randomly choose an individual account if you 're going to be writing options especially using spreads you need to have a plan ahead of time on what to do if one of your legs gets assigned this is more likely to happen just before a dividend payment if the payment is more than the remaining time value

modern portfolio theory has a strong theoretical background and its conclusions on the risk return trade off have a lot of good supporting evidence   however the conclusions it draws need to be used very carefully when thinking about retirement investing   if you were really just trying to just pick the one investment that you would guess would make you the most money in the future then yes given no other information the riskiest asset would be the best one    however for most people the goal retirement investing is to be as sure as possible to retire comfortably   if you were to just invest in a single very risky asset you may have the highest expected return but the risk involved would mean there might be a good chance you money may not be there when you need it instead a broad diversified basket of riskier and safer assets leaning more toward the riskier investments when younger and the safer assets when you get closer to retirement tends to be a better fit with most people 's retirement goals   this tends to give on average more return when you are young and can better deal with the risk but back the risk later in life when your investment portfolio is a majority of your wealth and you can least afford any major swings   this combines the lessons of mpt diversity risk return trade off in a clearer way with common goals of retirement caveat   your retirement goals and risk tolerance may be very different from other peoples   it is often good to talk to fee only financial planner

yes you 've got it right   the change in price is less meaningful as the instrument is further from the price of the underlying   as the delta moves less the gamma is much less gamma is to delta as acceleration is to speed   speed is movement relative to x and acceleration is rate of change in speed   delta is movement relative to s and gamma is the rate of change in delta delta changes quickly when it is around the money which is another way of saying gamma is higher   delta is the change of the option price relative to the change in stock price   if the strike price is near the market price then the odds of being in or out of the money could appear to be changing very quickly even going back and forth repeatedly gamma is the rate of change of the delta so these sudden in pricing are by definition the gamma   this is to some extent a little mundane and even obvious   but it 's a useful heuristic for analyzing prices and movement as well as for focusing analyst attention on different pricing aspects you 've got it right   if delta is constant zero speed for the change in price then gamma is zero zero acceleration

thanks for the response i apologize i should have specified about the govt job i was referring to was a state job more specifically it was 3 jobs with the california boe as an auditor 1 and business tax and also another job with the county assessors office as an audit appraiser   the state jobs were my best bet because of connections but they can only do so much since its a govt job and people are cracking down on nepotism with the little amount of research i just did the pre requisite to take the pmp certification is four year degree 4,500 hours leading and directing projects and 35 hours of project management education that seems like a bit much and a somewhat vague as to what counts as relevant hours so i 'll have to look into it more but as of now given my experience the pmp is not something i ca n't obtain until i have those hours under my belt

i had a client that boa forced escrows and then forgot to pay their insurance company and during the period the client 's policy lapsed while the policy was lapsed a tree fell on the roof during a storm creating a huge hole when they contacted their insurance they were of course told the policy was cancelled for non payment when they contacted boa they admitted to their mistake and apologized but accepted no responsibility in helping the homeowner with repairs instead they gave them back the 2 months of escrows and stopped collecting escrows for insurance and taxes all together   my client spent all the money they were reimbursed and had saved up fixing their roof and could n't make payments that following month boa threw their hands up and said oh well not our problem they explained why they were n't able or prepared to pay them on time and eventually ended up falling 3 months behind when boa decided to foreclose on them   being average consumers that did n't know their rights they lost their home but have now filed suit one could only hope the court awards these people maximum damages boa needs to be taken down and has no business being in existence after all they have done to the consumers

agreed even if you do n't wish to stay with the company as you mentioned op getting any qualifications you can especially when they 're free before you start job hunting is great sure any company you start at will likely pay for it anyway but if you can get it now that means you 'll be employed that much faster    be sure however to check that your current employer who intends on sponsoring you does not have a clause in their contract saying you have to pay it back if you leave within so many months i 'm not sure what the standards in the us are like but in austria if you receive expensive training most contracts will require that you continue your employment for at least x amount of months or you have to pay it back in full or partially this should all be in your employment contract

even if we accept these claims as being true neither the fact that their clients are more confident nor the fact that people who use an investment professional have a higher net worth tells you anything about the value of the service that such professionals provide   judging a service provider is a complex matter where you take into account multiple variables but the main ones are the cost and quality of the service the cost and quality of doing it yourself and the value you assign to your time and effort i think it 's highly likely that professional gardeners will on average maintain larger gardens than those who do their own garden work and any professional will have more experience at his profession than an average member of the public but to determine if hiring a professional is objectively better requires defining what that word means finance is a bit weird in that respect since we actually do have objective ways of measuring results by looking at performance over time but since the quotes you give here do n't address that at all we can simply conclude that they do not make the case for anything related to financial performance

as a recent college grad who switched to his own car insurance many of the things i did myself are reflected here the 1 thing i did was find out what coverages i had what coverages some friends of mine had car enthusiasts mostly they 're the most informed on this stuff and then figured out what kind of coverages i wanted from there i went around getting quotes from anyone and everyone and eventually built out a sizeable spreadsheet that made it obvious which company was going to offer me the best rate at a given coverage level something else to remember not all insurance companies look at past accidents and violations speeding etc the same in my search i found some have a 3-year scope on accidents and violations while others were as much as 5 years so if your driving record is n't a shining example mine is n't perfect you could potentially save money by considering insurance through a company that will see fewer violations incidents than another because of the size of their scope i ended up saving $ by choosing a company that had a 3-year scope which was on the cusp of when my last violation incident occurred insurance companies will also give out discounts for younger drivers based on gpa average if you have kids and they maintain a high gpa you might be able to get a discount there not all companies offer it so if they do it 's worth finding out how much it is

if the checking account is in a fdic insured bank or a ncua insured credit union then you do n't have to worry about what happens if the bank goes out of business in the past the government has made sure that any disruption was minimal the fraud issue can cause a bigger problem if they get a hold of your debit card they can drain your account yes the bank gives you fraud protection so that the most you can lose is $ 50 or $ 500 many even make your liability $ 0 if you report it in a timely manor but there generally is a delay in getting the money put back in your account one way to minimize the problem is to open a savings account it also has the fdic and ncua coverage the account may even earn a little interest if you do n't allow the bank to automatically provide an overdraft transfer from savings to checking account then the most they can temporarily steal is your checking account balance getting a credit card can provide additional protection it also limits your total losses if there is fraud the bill is only paid once a month so if they steal the card or the number they wo n't be able to drain the money in the bank account   the credit card if used wisely can also start to build a positive credit file so that in a few years you can get a loan for a car or a place to live of course if they steal your entire wallet with both the credit and the debit card

now is there any clever way to combine forex transactions so that you receive the us interest on $ 100 k instead of the $ 2 k you deposited as margin   yes absolutely but think about it why would the interest rates be different imagine you 're making two loans one for 10,000 usd and one for 10,000 chf and you 're going to charge a different interest rate on the two loans why would you do that there is really only one reason you would charge more interest for the currency that you think is less likely to hold its value such that the expected value of the money you are repaid is the same in other words currencies pay a higher interest when their value is expected to go down and currencies pay a lower interest when their value is expected to go up so yes you could do this but the profits you make in interest would have to equal the expected loss you would take in the devaluation of the currency people will only offer you these interest rates if they think the loss will exceed the profit unless you know better than them you will take a loss

does your job give you access to confidential information such that you can only buy or sell shares in the company during certain windows   employees with access to company financial data resource planning databases or customer databases are often only allowed to trade in company securities or derivatives thereof during certain windows a few days after the company releases its quarterly earnings reports   even those windows can be cancelled if a major event is about to be announced   these windows are designed to prevent the appearance of insider trading which is a serious crime in the united states is there a minimum time that you would need to hold the stock before you are allowed to sell it   do you have confidence that the stock would retain most of its value long enough that your profits are long term capital gains instead of short term capital gains what happens to your stock if you lose your job retire or go to another company does your company 's stock price seem to be inflated by any of these factors if any of these nine warning flags are the case i would think carefully before investing if i had a basic emergency fund set aside and none of the nine warning flags are present or if i had a solid emergency fund and the company seemed likely to continue to justify its stock price for several years i would seriously consider taking full advantage of the stock purchase plan   i would not invest more money than i could afford to lose at first i would cash out my profits quickly either as quickly as allowed or as quickly as lets me minimize my capital gains taxes   i would reinvest in more shares until i could afford to buy as many shares as the company would allow me to buy at the discount in the long run i would avoid having more than one third of my net worth in any single investment   e.g. company stock home equity bonds in general et cetera

ditto to md tech but from a more philosophical point of view when you buy stock you own it just like you own a cell phone or a toaster or a pair of socks that you bought the difference is that a share of stock means that you own a piece of a corporation you ca n't physically take possession of it and put it in your garage because if all the stock holders did that then all the company 's assets would be scattered around all the stock holder 's garages and the company could n't function like if you bought a share in a football team you could n't take one of the football players home and keep him in your closet because then the team would n't be able to function i might want to take one of the home but that 's another subject in pre electronic times you could get a piece of paper that said xyz corporation 1 share you could take physical possession of this piece of paper and put it in your filing cabinet i 'm not sure if you can even get such certificates any more i have n't seen one in decades these days it 's just recorded electronically that does n't mean that you do n't own it it just means that someone else is keeping the records for you it 's like leaving your car in a parking lot it 's still your car the people who run the parking lot does n't own it they are keeping it for you but just because they have physical possession does n't make it theirs

in this situation i would recommend figuring out about what you would need to pay in taxes for the year   you have two figures your salary and dependents but not others   will you contribute to a 401 k do you itemize deductions etc   if things are uncertain i would figure my taxes as if i took the standard deduction    for argument 's sake let 's assume that comes out to $   i would then add $ 500 on to my total to cover potential increases in taxes fees   you can adjust this up or down based on your ability to absorb having to pay or the uncertainty in your first so now $ divide by 26 the amount of paychecks you receive in a year = $ 300 then i would utilize a payroll calculator to adjust my exemptions and additional witholding so my federal withholding is as close as possible to this number    or you can sit with your payroll department and do the same

i would n't start a bidding war if i were you sometimes you may get potentially bad tenants who can not find a property anywhere else offering more money just to get in a place if you know nothing else about these people how can you guarantee they will keep paying the rent once they get in the things you should be doing is checking the prospective tenant 's employment and income status making sure they are able to easily pay the rent you should check their credit report to see if they have a history of bad debts and you should be checking with their previous landlords or real estate agents to see if they caused any damages to their previous properties you should create a form that prospective tenants can fill out providing you with all the essential information you are after get them so sign a statement that gives you authority to ask information about them with other people their previous real estate agents and their employers have a system set out on how you will assess all applicants and for the information the applicants need to provide you with treat it as a business

you can and are supposed to report self employment income on schedule c or c ez if eligible which a programmer likely is even when the payer is n't required to give you 1099-misc or 1099-k for a payment network now from there after deducting permitted expenses it flows to 1040 for income tax and schedule se for self employment tax see for some basics and lots of useful links if this income is large enough your tax on it will be more than $ 1000 you may need to make quarterly estimated payments or if you also have a day job have that employer increase your withholding to avoid an underpayment penalty but if this is the first year you have significant self employment income or other taxable but income like realized capital gains and your economic tax situation is otherwise unchanged i.e. you have the same or more payroll income with the same or more withholding then there is a safe harbor if your withholding plus estimated payments this year is too low to pay this year 's tax but it is enough to pay last year 's tax you escape the penalty you still need to pay the tax due of course so keep the funds available for that at the end of the first year when you prepare your return you will see how the numbers work out and can more easily do a good estimate for the following a single member llc or 's corp is usually disregarded for tax purposes although you can elect otherwise while a traditional c corp is more complicated and aiui out of scope for this stack see for more

you 're talking about money in a savings account and avoiding the risks posed by an ongoing crisis and avoiding risk if you are risk averse and likely to need your money in the short term you should not put your money in the stock market even in safe stocks like coca cola etc even these safe stocks are at risk of wild price swings in the short- to intermediate term especially in the event of international crises such as major european debt defaults and the like these stocks are suitable for long term growth objectives but they are not as a replacement for a savings account coca cola lost a third of its value between 2007 and 2009 it 's recovered and is currently doing better than ever went from $ to $ it 's partially recovered and back at $ 63 on the other hand these stocks may indeed be suitable as long term investments to protect you against local currency inflation and yes they even pay dividends if you 're after this investment a good option is probably a sector specific exchange traded fund such as a consumer staples etf it will likely be more diversified and safer than anything you could come up with using a list of individual stocks you can also investigate recommendations that show up when you search for a defensive etf if you do not wish to buy the etf directly you can also look at listings of the etf 's holdings read the prospectus for an idea of the risks associated with these funds you can buy these funds with any brokerage that gives you access to us stock exchanges

retirement calculation in general should be based on the amount of money needed per year month and the expected life expectancy life expectancy if calculated to 90 years let 's say indicates that post retirement age 60 yrs your accumulated invested money should generate adequate income to cover your expenses till 90 years the problem in general is not how long you shall live but what would be your expected spending from retirement to end of life expectancy the idea is at the minimum your investments should generate income that is inflation adjusted one way to do this is to consider your monthly expense now i.e. the expense that is absolute minimum for carrying on food electricity water medicines household consumables car petrol insurance servicing entertainment newspaper etc this does not contain the liabilities home loan child 's education other debts it is better to take this amount per family rather than per person and yearly rather than monthly as we tend to miss a lot of yearly expenses this amount that you need today will increase at a compounded annual growth rate cagr of the average inflation for example if today you spend 100 per year in 7 years you will need to spend 200 at 10 inflation now your investments will not increase post your retirement so your current investment needs to do two things 1 give you your yearly requirement 2 grow by a fixed amount so that next year it can give you cagr adjusted returns in general this kind of investment grows by high net amounts initially and slowly the growth decrease the above can be calculated by net present value npv formulae the key is to remember that the money that is invested when you retire should be able to give you inflation adjusted returns to cover your yearly expenses how much money you need depends on your life style expectation and how much return is received depends on the instruments that you invest on as for your question above on the difference between the age of you and your spouse it better to go with the consolidated family requirement and get an idea of how much investment is necessary and provision the same as soon as possible from your as well as your spouse 's income hope this thanks

i did n't mean to imply that bankruptcy is a magical process i was using that to clarify my use of conservative vs. aggressive to be fair i guess it can vary depending on your perspective if you 're taking the perspective of the debt laden company then yes on the side of a higher value could be defined as aggressive if you 're taking the perspective of someone looking to acquire business i would say on the side of a higher value is conservative    if the debt is trading at say $ 0.20 on the dollar then yes i can agree that the market value of the debt is likely more representative of the book value i guess i was n't thinking of that type of extreme example a more common scenario i 'd encounter would be a the debt trading at maybe $ 0.95 on the dollar and b taking the perspective of someone looking to invest in the equity which is why i 'd say that it 's more conservative to use the higher value which is the book value   so i 'm persuaded that using market value of the debt can make sense in some cases but i would still argue that the book value might make more sense in other cases

she seems to be paying an inordinate amount of money for car payments $ is just too high she may be able to get by on public transit depending on where she lives but if not she needs to look at selling her car and picking up a cheap second hand vehicle public transit would probably save her $ going to a cheaper car should still save her $ 300 $ 400/month next phone and cable these are certainly nice but they are rarely necessities i do not have cable for example i do have a cell phone and i do have internet a requirement of my job but no cable she may be able to save some money there my guess is that she could save $ here though i may be biased on how much it costs to heat a canadian home in our cold cold winters and of course the college payment $ 900 $ 1000 a month i understand that she is paying this so that your sister can attend college that 's very nice but it certainly sounds like your mother can not afford that on the other hand if this is repayment of college expenses already incurred there may be no choice here rent at $ i have no idea what that gets you in nj but perhaps she could rent out a room it 's not that she could bring in $ 1000/month from doing so though obviously that 's going to very much depend on the real estate rental market where you live alternatively she could move out and move in with someone else and that should certainly get her share of the rent down to $ 800 $ 1000/month or thereabouts and most likely cut her utility bills also i 've identified a number of places where she can save money no doubt the budget is tight but i think she 's spending on far more than just bare essentials one thing that concerns me here is that she appears to have no emergency funds and very little for entertainment other than cable if at all possible she needs to cut her budget down so that she is not living paycheque to paycheque and has money to cover for example emergency car repairs and i 'd really like to see her have more than $ 50/month for expenses which i 'm guessing is entertainment it may not be possible of course but i would most definitely say she should not be paying for your sister 's college if this places her in such dire financial risk easier said than done of course most certainly i would not even consider cutting the health insurance by the way another approach would be to look at how her expenses will go down when your sister is done school and perhaps cleared up other expenses it may be worth borrowing from family and friends knowing that in a year her expenses will go down $ 500/month that makes her budget manageable additionally the debt repayment presumably will finish at some point the point i 'm trying to make is that in a year her budget will be just about manageable and she may be able to get there with smaller in the immediate future

also keep note some companies have a combined ceo chairman of the board role while he she would not be allowed to negotiate contracts or stock plans some corporate governance analysts advocate for the separation of the roles to remove any opportunity for the ceo to unduly influence the board   this could be the case for dysfunctional boards however the alternate camps will say that the combined role has no negative effect on shareholder returns    sec regulations require companies to disclose negotiations between the board and ceo as well as other named executives for contracts employee stock plans and related information sometimes reading the proxy statement to find out for example how many times the board meets a year how many other boards a director serves on and if the ceo sits on any other board usually discouraged to serve on more than 2 will provide some insight into a well run or not well run board

fundamentals   then remember that you want to put 20 or more down in cash to avoid pmi and recalculate with chunk taken out of your savings   many banks offer calculators on their websites that can help you run these numbers and figure out how much house a given mortgage can pay for remember that the old advice that you should buy the largest house you can afford or the newer advice about starter homes are both questionable in the current market = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = added   if you 're willing to settle for a rule of thumb first approximation ballpark estimate maximum mortgage payment rule of 28 your monthly mortgage payment should not exceed 28 percent of your gross monthly income your income before taxes are taken out   maximum housing cost rule of 32 your total housing payments including the mortgage homeowner ’s insurance and private mortgage insurance pmi association fees and property taxes should not exceed 32 percent of your gross monthly income maximum total debt service rule of 40 your total debt payments including your housing payment your auto loan or student loan payments and minimum credit card payments should not exceed 40 percent of your gross monthly income as i said many banks offer web based tools that will run these numbers for you these are rules that the lending uses for a quick initial screen of an application they do not guarantee that you in particular can afford that large a loan just that it is n't so bad that they wo n't even look at it note that this is all in terms of mortgage which means it 's also affected by what interest rate you can get how long a mortgage you 're willing to take and how much you can afford to pull out of your savings also as noted if you ca n't put 20 down from savings the bank will hit you for pmi standard reminder unless you to live in the same place for five years or more buying a house is questionable financially there is nothing wrong with renting depending on local housing stock it may be cheaper houses come with costs and hassles rental even renting a house does n't buy a house only when it makes sense both financially and in terms of what you actually need to make your life pleasant do not buy a house only because you think it 's an investment real estate can be a profitable business but thinking of a house as simultaneously both your home and an investment is a good way to get yourself into trouble

the problems with ratings and the interpretation of ratings is that they are retrospective and most people read them as prospective they basically tell you that debtor is solvent right now what does that mean it means that the ratings are based on the audited financial statements of a company government or other organization issuing debt so in the best case scenario where the rating agency is acting properly they are still dependent on folks with fiduciary responsibility telling the truth and even if they are telling the truth accounting rules make it possible to obscure problems for years in some cases municipal are a great example of this the general obligation bonds cities and even states with deep structural budget problems still get good ratings because they are solvent and have sufficient operating cash to meet obligations today but towards the end of a 30-year bond 's life that may not be the case anymore unless they dramatically alter their budgets at the end of the day ratings are one aspect of due diligence they are useful screening devices but you need to understand who you are lending money to by purchasing bonds and diversify your holdings to protect your wealth   the problem of course is when the trustees of your pension fund invests in garbage assets after getting a sales pitch on the beach in hawaii then conveniently place all of the blame for that bad investment on the rating agency you unfortunately have zero control over that

first read my answer here oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing for me the answer to your question comes down to how badly you want to get rid of your student loan debt i recommend that you get rid of it as fast as possible and that you sacrifice a little in your budget temporarily to make that happen if that is what you want here is what i would do following the steps in my other answer i would pay off the student loans first cash out your non retirement growth fund to jump start that then challenge yourself to take as much of your paycheck as you can and throw it at the debt figure out how many months it will take before the debt is gone   once the debt is gone you wo n't have those monthly payments anymore and you wo n't be continually losing money in interest to the bank at that point you can build up your cash savings invest in your employer 's 401(k plan for retirement and start saving toward other long term saving goals car house etc to address some of your other concerns if you cash out the non retirement fund you 'll probably owe some capital gains tax although on a $ 3k investment the long term rate wo n't add up to very much depending on your tax bracket and cost basis you ca n't use the money from your non retirement fund to invest in your 401(k   you can only contribute to your 401(k via payroll deduction   to explicitly answer your question your non retirement fund is not bound by the limitations of retirement funds meaning that you can cash it out and use it however you like without penalty only paying perhaps a few hundred dollars of capital gains tax at tax time next year think of it as another source of cash for you

in the us dividends have special tax treatment similar to but not the same as capital gains no easy way to transform one to the other the very fact that you invested your money in a company that has returned part of your capital as income means it is just that income also in the us you could invest in master limited partnerships these are companies that make distributions that are treated as a return of capital instead of dividends throughout the life of the investment you receive tax forms that assign part of the operating expense loss of the company to you as a tax payer then at the end of the investment life you are required to recapture those losses as capital gains on sale of the stock in some ways these investments do exactly what you are asking about they transform periodic income into later capital gains basically deferring tax on the income until the sale of the security here is an article i found about mlps coming to the uk through an etf master limited partnerships in the uk

companies are expected to make a profit otherwise there is no point to their existence and no motivation for investment that profit comes back to shareholders as growth and/or dividend if a company is doing well and has a healthy profit to turn back into investment to facilitate increased future earnings it increases shareholder equity and share price if a company is doing well and has a healthy profit to pay out in dividend it makes the shares more attractive to investors which pushes the price up either way shares go up share prices drop when companies lose money or there are market affecting all companies recessions or when individual companies fail averaged over all companies over the long term decades stocks can be reasonably expected to go up

terminology aside   your gains for this year in a mutual fund do seem low   these are things that can be quickly and precisely answered through a conversation with your broker you can request info on the performance of the fund you are invested in from the broker   they are required to disclose this information to you    they can give you the performance of the fund overall as well as break down for you the specific stocks and bonds that make up the fund and how they are performing talk about what kind of fund it is   if your projected retirement date is far in the future your fund should probably be on the aggressive side   ask what the historic average is for the fund you 're in   ask about more aggressive funds or less if you prefer a lower average but more stable performance   your broker should be able to adequately and in most cases accurately set your expectation also ask about fees   good brokerages charge reasonable fees that are typically based on the gains the fund makes not your total investment   make sure you understand what you are paying even without knowing the management fees your growth this year should be of concern   it is exceptionally low in a year that showed good gains in many market sectors   speak with your broker and decide if you will stick with this fund or have your ira invest in a different fund finally makes a great point in that your fund may perform well or poorly over any given short term but long term your average should fall within the expected range for the type of fund you 're invested in though not guaranteed most importantly actually talk to your broker   get real answers since they are as easy to come by as posting on stack

try over in /r personalfinance   economics is about understanding the economy and how it works investing is about taking your money and putting it somewhere useful they 're related but what you want probably is n't economy wide advice but specific individual options   fyi they 'll recommend you get into some index fund to start one that just tracks a big index like the dow jones nasdaq or s&amp;p 500 these help diversify your risk and tend to offer good returns but a lot depends on what your personal situation entails so head on over there and read their faq

you should call your plan administrator and ask few plans allow people to take a hardship withdraw after leaving because their is no way to pay the funds back since you are no longer working there the repayment process is done via payroll deduction usually also you will most likely be required to withhold 20 for taxes from the 401k there is no way to defer the taxation unless you take it   next calendar year you may want to consider doing a rollover into an ira and taking the w d and you can do a 60 day rollover you only get 1 per rolling 12 months now rather than account do to a change in the rule ira 's not 401k do give you flexible withholding so you do n't have to pay taxes today though they would still be in the tax year based on the calendar date taken out so if you take it out in 2015 your going to be paying them at the end of this year when you file in april of 2016 your question seems to be mixing characteristics of both 401k and ira and while they are similar they do operate very differently

i think it may be best to take everything you 're asking line by line once you buy stocks on x day of the month the chances of stocks never actually going above and beyond your point of value on the chart are close to none this is not true companies can go out of business or take a major hit and never recover   take volkswagen for example in 2015 due to a scandal they were involved in their stocks went downhill now their stocks are starting to rise again the investors goal is not to wait as long as necessary to make a profit on every stock purchase but to make the largest profit possible in the shortest time possible sometimes this means selling a stock before it recovers if it ever does i think the problem with most buyers is that they desire the most gain they can possibly have however that is very risky this can be true every investor needs to gauge the risk they 're willing to take and high gain investments are riskier   therefore it 's better to be winning small medium amounts of money of the time than any amount of money < ~25 safer investments do tend to yield more consistent returns but this does n't mean that every investor should aim for low yield investments again this is driven by the investor 's risk tolerance to conclude profitable companies stock tends to increase over time and less aggressive investments are safer but it is possible to lose from any stock investment

first as others have commented the idea that getting a mortgage to buy a house is always a good idea is false   it depends on a number of factors including the current interest rate what you think the future interest rate will do over the life of your mortgage the relative cost of renting vs. buying and how long you would stay in the house that you bought to the extent that a mortgage for a house is more often recommended than buying other goods on credit it is for these reasons except for 1 above you could and can find other situations where taking a loan makes more sense than buying in cash   this more true if you have the resources and the skill to invest money at a rate that beats the interest rate you pay to the creditor   the general advice not to try this rests in the fact that most people do n't have the resources or the skill to actually make this pay off especially on high interest rate loans or over short time periods

it makes sense if the npv is positive but what rate should you use at determining the npv a textbook might say market rate and by definition the market rate to use in bond calculations like yours will mean that your npv will be zero   how can this be well it 's a bit of a circular definition you take less capital to earn a higher return the value of your capital spread over the period of the bond 's maturity is the net difference but the money in your pocket from selling the bond and not purchasing also has value banks and traders do this exact swap every day many many times the rate at which you can execute this swap is what defines the market rate therefore by definition the npv will be zero now this does n't mean it 's a bad idea for you you can on your own accord decide the value you place on the capital versus the yield and make the decision do you expect rates to rise or fall do you expect higher or lower inflation in reality you can form whatever opinion you like for your own circumstance but the market is the net aggregation of opinion you only get to decide whether or not you agree with the market

you 're not crazy but the banks are here 's the problem you 're taking 100 ltv on property a you wo n't be able to get a second mortgage for more than 80 total including the current mortgage ltv that 's actually something i just recently learned from my own experience if the market is bad the banks might even lower the ltv limit further so essentially at least 20 of your equity in a will remain on the paper banks do n't like seeing the down payment coming from anywhere other than your savings putting the downpayment from loan proceeds even if not secured by the property which you 're refinancing will probably scare banks off how to solve this suggest to deal with it as a business putting both properties under a company llc if possible it might be hard to change the titles while you have loans on your properties but even without it deal with it as if it is a business approach your bank for a business loan either secured by a or unsecured and another investment loan for b. describe your strategy to the banker preferably a small community bank in the area where the properties are and how you 're going to fund the properties you wo n't get rates as low as you have on a 3.25 on investment loan not a chance that one is a keeper but you might be able to get rid of the balloon variable apr problem

assuming nothing here helps here are some thoughts first if principal financial knows the 401k was rolled over to an ira then it must have been a custodian to custodian transfer which means they need to know who the recipient custodian was so i 'd call them back and push a little harder next they could n't have just created an ira out of thin air and moved some money into it without some paperwork and signatures from you so you should have copies of that paperwork principal may also still have archived copies of that paperwork that they may be able to provide to you although they 'll probably charge for that service also there would have been tax reporting around the rollover for the year the rollover occurred in you would have received a 1099-r and 5498 the 1099-r would have to have been reported on your federal and possibly state income tax for that year it may be possible to obtain copies of old 1099-r 's from the irs maybe call them and ask in subsequent years you should have received at least a year end statement if you do n't have any of that and contacting principal and the irs do n't help then i 'm not sure there 's much that anyone can do to help you as far as i know there 's no universal clearinghouse for iras and there are a lot of ira custodians i would expect you to receive a year end statement from the custodian for 2015 sometime in early 2016 so maybe just wait for and watch for that and take this as an object lesson that you need to keep better track of your finances no one 's going to do it for you unless you pay them a bunch of money

with 150 k € to invest to become a landlord you have several options pay for 100 of one property and you then will make a significant percentage of the monthly rent as profit each month that profit can be used to invest in other things or to save to buy additional properties at the end of the 21 years in your example you can sell the flat for return of principal minus selling expenses or even better make a profit because the property went up in value pay 20 down on 5 flats and then make a much a smaller profit per flat each month due to the mortgage payment for each one at the end of the 21 years sell the flats assuming that a significant portion of the mortgage is paid off each flat will sell for more than the mortgage balance thus you will have 5 nice large profits when you sell something in between 1 and 5 flats each has different risks and expenses with 5 rental properties you are more likely to use a management company which will add to your monthly cost

the big difference is that you get your money earlier at the start suppose you start on a random day with payday on the last day of the month monthly or on every 2nd wednesday biweekly and it takes 3 days for payroll to ramp up ie if payday is within 3 days on your start date your next paycheck is not on the next payday but on the one after if we assume every month has 30 days to keep things simple it is an average of 4 + days until you get your first paycheck with monthly pay an average of days for weekly it is a bit trickier assuming you get hired at a random date here with being a time until you get paid an average of 10.5 days so you get your first pay an average of 8 days earlier later on that 3 day thing no longer occurs and now the company holds an average of 6.5 days of your pay due to you with biweekly paychecks and about 14.5 days with weekly paychecks if you have monthly pay so with monthly pay on average your bank account has 8 fewer days of   your pay in it at all times   this happens when   you are first hired and persists over the length of your employment now suppose you save that extra money on average suppose you have an investment at 4 after inflation   over 40 years those 8 days of pay invested at 4 grow to 38 days of pay a free month what more if the company has problems making payroll you 'll get a warning to say look for another job an average of 8 days sooner and/or have the money in your account   having someone owe you money is usually worse than having the money in your bank account

in general insurance payouts you receive in compensation for damage to your vehicle are not taxable income see for instance this nolo page however i do n't see how that is related to your three bullet points about how your sister should buy her car   you can transfer the money to her in any way that 's convenient to both of you   whether the dealership will accept cash is something you 'll have to ask them about but my impression is most dealers are eager to accept cash as long as the car you are getting from her is not worth substantially more than the $ 8500 you 're giving her i do n't see that you 'll be in trouble income tax wise   as mentioned in the question you linked to you can give each other up to $ 14k per year tax free   so if you give her a $ 8500 and she gives you a car worth roughly the same amount no problem   if you actually do it as a sale even better since then the only amount that will count as a gift to either of you is whatever one party gets above and beyond the fair value of the car   that is if the car is worth $ 10000 but she sells it to you for $ 8500 she effectively gave you a gift of $ 1500 in car value   if it 's worth $ 7000 but she sells it to you for $ 8500 you gave her a gift of $ 1500 in cash as rocky pointed out in a comment if you do a sale it may be subject to sales tax depending on what state you 're in   in practice it is very common for people to not deal with sales tax in informal transactions like this between family members but you do owe it if your state 's laws require it and the state could theoretically come after you for it another edit i see from your comment you are in michigan   according to this page from the michigan secretary of state no tax is due if you purchase a vehicle from an immediate family member   so you would not owe sales tax if you do it as a sale

the advantage of using a mortgage is that you pay for a house at today 's price using tomorrow 's money your question suggests that you rightly observed that it was not a good idea around 2006 the last peak in housing that was when prices were at their maximum and had nowhere to go but down some experts think that house prices still have further to go on the downside meanwhile wages have been going nowhere during that time this phenomenon seems to happen about every 40 years or so the 1930s the 1970s and around 2010 at most other times say the 1980s houses are likely to go up for the foreseeable future at those times you want to buy the house at today 's price then pay for it in future dollars when you are earning more money the irony is that what most people observe as teenagers is usually the wrong thing to do when they are say forty in it will probably make sense to have a large mortgage in a bull housing market which is the opposite of what you observed around 2010 so a better rule is to do at age 40 what made sense about the time you were born in your case perhaps the 1990s whereas the people born in the early 1970s that got caught recently observed the bull market of the 1980s and 1990s in their teens and twenties rather than the bear market of the 1970s that took place about the time they were born

if i buy vusa from one exchange can i sell it in a different exchange assuming my brokerage account lets me trade in both exchanges or is it somehow tied to the exchange i bought it from this does n't happen for all securities and between all stock exchanges so that is dependent on broker and country i checked for vusa with they categorically refused allowing me to trade in vusa in different exchanges i can only buy and sell in same currency only albeit in the same exchange where i from should be the same behaviour for all brokers for us mere mortals if you are a bank or a millionaire than that might be a different question   the vusa you quote is quoted in gbp in lse and in eur in and the etf has been created by an irish entity and has an irish isin   as chris mentioned below happens between us and canadian exchanges but not sure it happens across all exchanges you can not deal in inter listed stocks in lse and nyse since it 's the same asset its value should not vary across exchanges once you compensate for exchange rates right yes else it opens up itself for arbitrage profit without any risk which everybody wants so even if any such instance occurs either people will exploit it to make the arbitrage profit zero security reflects the equilibrium price or the profit from such transaction is so less compared with the effort involved that people will tend to ignore it anyways arbitrage profit is very difficult to garner nowadays considering the super computers at work in the market who exploit these discrepancies the moment they see them and bring the security right to the zero arbitrage profit point if there 's no currency risk because of 2 what other factors should i consider when choosing an exchange to trade in liquidity something else time difference by the time you wake up to trade in japan the japanese markets would have closed tax implications across multiple continents law of the land providing protection to investors finding a broker dealing in markets you want to explore or dealing with multiple brokers regulatory headaches

three important things worth remembering about kelly when applied to real world edges 1 full kelly is gut volatile while it the growth of the bankroll it does so in a way that still leaves you very likely to experience massive 50%+ reductions in capital most long terms users of kelly tend to stick in the 1/4 to 1/2 kelly unit range to try and stay sane and retain a margin of error see below for how large the typical swings can be with full kelly   2 garbage in garbage out if you are making errors in pricing your actual edge kelly becomes very wrong very fast easily leading you to a high chance of ruin if you are over estimating your true edge as most people do massively over estimate their edges kelly simply pushes them far into territory where risk of ruin is high 3 a kelly user prefers to back likely outcomes over non likely ones even to the point where they prefer a smaller edge if the chances of winning are better compare the below comparison of growth between two betting scenarios decimal odds so for the chances do   in this case despite the percentage edge on the red bet being higher than that of the green in terms of bankroll growth it ends up only being roughly as good to a kelly gambler as the smaller edge on the more likely event this has an obvious effect on the types of edges you should be seeking out if given choices between

you can perfectly well manage their wealth without transferring their money into your account first just make them open their own account on their name then ask them for credentials and then manage their money from within their own account that way everyone will be taxed according to their wealth which is probably advantageous but you probably have to help them with the paperwork and it is clear at every time what belongs to whom and your relatives can at every time access their wealth these are big advantages for them this keeps you at the role of an adviser a very active one though which should have almost zero legal ramifications for you unless you try to deceive your relatives you may want to shift wealth between accounts to minimize tax burdens but that comes at the risk that should the family relations get worse this might result in anger you could open up a registered society all members getting shares and voting rights making you the ceo but that should be a lot of paperwork and maybe only a good idea for large amounts of money if you decide to transfer money between accounts of different persons this is like a gift it might invoke a gift tax in your area all in all i strongly advise you to make them all open up their own accounts and then just operate the accounts and manage their wealth in their name sell it to them as the solution that retains them maximum ownership

how can they reduce the number of shares i hold they may have purchased them   you do n't say what stock it is so we can only speculate   let 's say that the stock is called penny   so they may have taken your 1600 penny shares and renamed them to 1600 shares   then they created a new $ 5 penny share and gave you shares of that in exchange for your 1600 shares   this suggests that your old shares were worth $ or less than a tenth of a cent each    as an example mylan did this in 2015 as part of their tax inversion moved official headquarters from the us to europe   they did not change the number of shares at that time but mylan is not a penny stock    this is the kind of thing that might happen in a bankruptcy    a reverse split where they give you one share in exchange for more than one share is also possible although you received an odd amount for a reverse split   usually those produce numbers   a number like sounds more like a market price as those can be bizarre

yes merchants may charge a fee for using a credit card for a credit card transaction interchange fees flow from the merchant to the card issuer this is why australians are seeing a boom in debit mastercard visa cards the issuing banks make income when you select credit   these costs can be passed from the merchant to the customer as a credit card fee for an transaction the interchange flows the other way from the card issuer to the acquiring bank the merchant 's bank   as an aside the setup of these fees is why some large supermarket chains in australia restrict you from selecting credit with a scheme debit card mastercard and visa are schemes   they are in the payments networks and they make interchange fees when you hit savings and pay if you hit credit therefore where you can hit either credit or savings they prefer and may force you to press savings

a company has 100,000 shares and 100,000 unexercised call options company issued share price and strike price both at $ 1 what country is this related to    i ask because in the us most people i know associate a call option with the instrument that is equivalent to 100 shares    so 100,000 calls would be 10,000,000 shares which exceeds the number of shares you 're saying the company has    i do n't know if that means you pulled the numbers out of thin air or whether it means you 're thinking of a different type of option perhaps you meant incentive stock options meant to be given to employees   each one of those is equivalent to a single share   they just are n't called call options in the rest of my answer i 'm going to assume you meant stock options i assume the fact that these options exist will slow any price increases on the underlying shares due to potential dilution i do n't think the company can just create stock options without creating the underlying shares in the first place   said another way a more likely scenario is that company creates 200,000 shares and agrees to float 50 of them while reserving the other 50 as the pool for incentive employee stock   they then choose to give the employees options on the stock in the incentive pool rather than outright grants of the stock for various reasons   one of which is being nice to the employees in regards to taxes since there is no us tax due at grant time if the strike price is the current price of the underlying stock an alternative scenario when the company shares are traded is that the company simply plans to buy back shares from the market in order to give employees their shares when options are exercised   in this case the company needs the cash on hand or cash flow to take money from to buy those shares at current prices anyway in either case there is no dilution happening when the options get exercised   any dilution happened before or at the time the options were created    meaning the total number of shares in the company was already pre set at an earlier time   as a result the fact that the options exist in themselves will not slow price changes on the stock however price changes will be impacted by the total float of shares in the company or the impact to cash flow if the company has to buy shares to redeem its option commitments    this is almost the same thing you 're asking about but it is technically different as to timing if this is the case can this be factored into any option pricing models like black scholes you 're including the effect just by considering the total float of shares and net profits from cash flow when doing your modelling

let me summarize your question for you i do not have the down payment that the lender requires for a mortgage how can i still acquire the mortgage short answer find another lender or find more cash do n't overly complicate the scenario the correct answer is that the lender is free to do what they want they deem it too risky to lend you $ 1.1 m against this $ 1.8 m property unless they have $ 700k up front you want their money so you must accept their terms if other lenders have the same outlook consider that you can not afford this house find a cheaper house

i can see your point   there are more investors than investment banks so the power of each investment bank is substantially more than each individual investor   it would take a lot of coordinated effort on the part of investors to alter the balance of power   and to an extent a new or existing and improved ratings agency would be a proxy war between investors and investment banks even though the direct competition would be with other ratings agencies   at the same time ratings agencies as an industry have never had less credibility nor have the investment banks for that matter   i have to believe there is a realistic way to exploit that reality

has mentioned this in a comment but i think it ought to be expanded upon companies that are n't already penny stocks really do n't stand to gain anything from trying to prevent short interest   short selling does not inherently lower the stock price not any more so than any other kind of selling   when somebody shorts a stock it 's simply borrowed from another investor 's margin as long as it 's not a naked short resulting in an failure to deliver then it does not add any artificial selling pressure in fact shorting can actually drive the price up in the long term due to stops and margin calls   not a guarantee of course but if a rally occurs then a high short interest can cause a cascade effect from the short squeeze resulting in an even bigger rally than what would have occurred with zero short interest   many investors actually treat a high short interest as a bullish signal compare with margin buying essentially the opposite of short selling which has the opposite effect   if investors buy stocks on margin then if the value of that stock decreases too rapidly they will be forced to sell which can cause the exact same cascade effect as a short interest but in the opposite direction   shorting is in a sense evening out the odds by inflating the buying pressure at lower stock prices when the borrowers decide to cover and take profits bottom line is that aside from illegal insider trading it does n't do businesses any good to try to manipulate their stock price or any trading activity   yes a company can raise capital by selling additional common shares but a split really has no effect on the amount of capital they 'd be able to raise because it does n't change the actual market cap and a dilution is a dilution regardless of the current stock price   if a company 's market cap is $ 1 billion then it does n't matter if they issue 1 million shares at $ 50.00 each or 10 million shares at $ 5.00 each either way it nets them $ 50 million from the sale and causes a 5 dilution to which the market will react accordingly they do n't do it because there 'd be no point

when you start at a new job here in the u.s. the default means of payment is usually a paper check most folks will quickly set up direct deposit so that their employer deposits their paycheck directly into their personal bank account the incentive to do so is that you receive your funds faster than if you deposit a paper check   even if you set up direct deposit on your first day on the job you may still receive your first paycheck as a paper check simply because the wheels of payroll processing turn slowly at some large companies a counter example is a self employed contractor perhaps a carpenter or house painter   these folks are paid by their customers homeowners and such   many larger well established now accept credit card payments from customers but smaller may be reluctant to set up a credit card merchant account to accept payment by card because of all the fees that are associated with accepting credit card payments   3 transaction fees and monthly service fees can be scary to any businessman who already has very thin profit margins   in such cases these contractors prefer to be paid by check or in cash for the simple reason that there are no fees deducted from cash payments there are a few folks here who do n't trust direct deposit or more specifically do n't trust their employer to perform the deposit correctly and on time   some feel uncomfortable giving their bank info to their employer fearing someone at the company could steal money from their account in my experience the folks who prefer a paper paycheck are often the same folks who rush to the bank on payday to redeem their paychecks for cash   they may have a bank account helps with check cashing but they prefer to carry cash i operate in a manner similar to you i use a debit card or credit card i only have one of each for nearly all transactions in daily life i use electronic payments through my bank to pay my regular bills and mortgage and i receive my paycheck by direct deposit   there have been periods where i have n't written or received paper checks for so long that i have to hunt for where i put my checkbook even though i use a debit card for most store purchases the bank account behind that debit card is actually a checking account according to the bank   again the system defaults to paper checks and you have the option of going electronic as well before we judge anyone who does n't use direct deposit or who prefers to be paid in cold hard cash consider that direct deposit is a luxury of stability steady job home etc   direct deposit does n't make sense for a contractor or day laborer who expect to work for a different person each day or week i do n't think this is all that unique to the us   there are people in every city and country who do n't have long term employment with a single employer and therefore prefer cash or paper check over electronic payments    i 'd be willing to bet that this applies to the majority of people on the planet actually

yes it 's a good idea to have a separate business account for your business because it makes accounting and bookkeeping that much easier you can open a business checking account and there will be various options for types of accounts and fees you may or may not want an overdraft account for example or a separate business credit card just so you can more easily separate those expenses from your personal cards when i started my business i opened a business checking account and met with my banker every year just to show them how the business was doing and to keep the relationship going eventually when i wanted to establish a business line of credit it was easier to set up because i they were already familiar with my business its revenue and needs for a line of credit you can set up a solo 401k with your bank too and they 'll be very happy to do so but i recommend shopping around for options i 've found that the dedicated investment firms schwab fidelity etc tend to have better options fees and features for investment accounts just because a specific bank handles your checking account does n't mean you need to use that bank for everything lastly i use completely different banks for my personal life and for my business maybe i 'm paranoid but i just do n't want all my finances in the same place for both privacy reasons and to avoid having all my eggs in the same basket just something to consider i do n't really have a completely sane reason for using completely different banks but it helps me sleep

it certainly is possible for a run on the bank to drive it into insolvency   and yes if the bank makes some bad loans it can the problem generally this does not happen though   remember that banks usually have lots of customers and people are depositing money and making mortgage payments every day so there is usually enough on hand to cover average banking withdrawl activity regardless of any bad loans they have outstanding banks have lots of historical data to know what the average withdrawl demands are for a given day   they also have risk models to predict the likelihood of their loans going into default   a bank will generally use this information to strike a healthy balance between profit making activity e.g. issuing loans and satisfying its account holders in the event of a major withdrawl demand there are some protections in place to guard against insolvency there are regulations that specify a reserve requirement   the bank must keep a certain amount of money on hand so they ca n't take huge risks by loaning out too much money all at once   regulators can tweak this requirement over time to reflect the current economic situation if a bank does run into trouble it can take out a short term loan   either from another bank or from the central bank e.g. the us federal reserve   banks do n't want to pay interest on loans any more than you do so if they are regularly borrowing money they will adjust thier cash reserves accordingly if all else fails and the bank ca n't meet its obligations e.g. the fed loan fell through the bank has an insurance policy to make sure the account holders get paid   in the us this is what the fdic is for   worst case the bank goes under but your money is safe these protections have worked pretty well for many decades   however during the recent financial crisis all three of these protections were under heavy strain   so one of the things banking regulators did was to put the major banks through stress tests to make sure they could handle several bad financial events without collapsing   these tests showed that some banks did n't have enough money in reserve   not long after banks started to increase fees and credit card rates to raise this additional capital keep in mind that if banks were unable to use the deposited money loan it out invest it etc the current financial landscape would change considerably

i appreciate the detailed responses truthfully however i feel like at least half of your points are either just for its sake alone display a deep lack of understanding of unions collective bargaining and the histories of both or ignore and cling to an and ultimately self defeating ideology   gt collective bargaining is an ambiguous term that could refer to many concepts there is voluntarily agreed to collective bargaining which has nothing wrong with it and then there are laws that force the employer to collectively bargain with a union if a union requests it which is a mandate and violates the employer 's contract liberty   the law forces the two parties to sit at a table the law forces the two parties to discuss a few core things like wages the law does n't force anyone to agree to anything and very often they do n't i do n't see how this is a violation of anyone 's contract liberty a term i 've actually never heard before the idea is since these worker employer disputes exist naturally making them at least sit at a table together and talking is helpful in avoiding ego and fueled disruptions where no one benefits if this you see this as a violation of one 's liberty i really do n't know what to say to that    gt the prevalence of child labor was decreasing long before any law was created prohibiting it child labor is necessary in poor countries because people are far less productive per hour worked    i 'm not saying i do n't believe you but citation needed   gt as productivity increases parents can afford to send their children off to school instead of working since their own work is enough to support the family   would n't educating children first lead to an increase in productivity also what if the owners of the means of production only a few in an given area have incomes 100x greater than the workers they seem to be producing enough wealth to support themselves only they 're not the beneficiaries what 's the solution here   i understand that in a poor country child labor is seen as a necessity however i think there is a moral issue when someone from a developed nation opens a factory in a third world country with conditions that they would not want someone in their own family subjected to maybe these conditions are standard in the third world country but just because they 're standard that does n't mean the people there are happy with them   gt in other words no government mandate created due to union pressure can possibly lead to beneficial change since laws that limit people 's economic rights under the assumption that 51 knows what 's better for the minority than they themselves do generally do much more harm than good      this is quite a leap problem is you always assume that a company is always paying workers as much as it can instead of having a net income that can absorb an uptick in overhead    gt as history over the last century has shown it 's no hyperbole labor unions backed regulations soft socialism has succeeded in spite of the resistance of employers   and you owe this to violence or the threat of violence citation needed   gt because unions have destroyed nearly every major industry where they had a natural tendency to form large scale capital intensive manufacturing operations where large numbers of workers were concentrated in one place   this is typical anti union propaganda and it 's funny you pull it out since it ignores your own ideology what interest would a union have in destroying the very industry it needs to exist answer none this is just a way for a business to deflect criticism when they want to outsource killing us jobs just to increase their net income unions make concessions when they have to   gt the force of government prevents companies from refusing to collectively bargain with a labor union threat of violence violent strikes this is a straw man if i 've ever seen one who is threatening violence here this existed before government laws were created that made legal threats on behalf of employees that want to keep unionized employees employed and force companies to collectively bargain with a union now of course the themselves are not directly threatening violence since they are backed by the force of government   this is just showing a tremendous amount of ignorance regarding the way   things actually happen   gt collectively bargaining does n't benefit workers in general it benefits in the short term those workers who are employed and unionized at the expense of long term wage growth and employment opportunities for the unemployed and non unionized employees   i have no idea how one could come to this conclusion i can only assume it   stems from the same old idea that employers are always paying out the most that they can afford    i happen to have first hand knowledge that it 's false however when my workplace unionized recently one of around a dozen locations nationally and the only one to organize the company responded by increasing wages and benefits to all locations have any locations closed no has anyone been laid off no is the company still mad profitable yes

theoretically when a company issues more shares it does not affect the value of your shares   the reason is that when a company issues and sells more shares the proceeds from the sale of those shares goes back into the company using your example you have 10 out of 100 shares of the company for a 10 stake   let 's say that the shares are valued at $ 1,000 each meaning that the market value of the company is $ 100,000 and your stake is worth $ 10,000 now the company issues 100 more shares at $ 1,000 each   the company receives $ 100,000 from new investors and now the company is worth $ 200,000   your stake is now only 5 of the company but it is still worth $ 10,000 the authorized share capital is the amount of shares that a company has already planned on selling   when you buy stock in a company you can look up how many shares exist so you know what your percent stake in the company is   when a company wants to sell more shares this is called an increase of authorized share capital   in order to do this the company generally needs the approval of a majority of the existing shareholders

i 'm not sure if someone else answered already in the same manner i will i ca n't guarantee for sure if it 's the same in the it might since major credit cards companies like visa mc amex are american companies but in canada having keeping unused cc is a disadvantage because of the following banks and financing companies look more at the total amount of credit available to you than at how much purchases you have on your cards ex let 's say that you have the following visa cc with $ 10,000 limit and $ 2000 worth of purchases made more than 30 days ago on it mastercard cc with $ 10,000 limit as well and $ 1000 worth of purchases less than 30 days old a major retail store cc with $ 2000 limit and $ 0 balance hypothetical situation you want a bank loan to do some expensive house repairs and are looking for a lower interest rate than what your cc can offer the bank will not care about the amount on the cards they will add up all the limits of your cc and treat your loan request as if all your cards were filled to their respective limit   so in this case they will consider you as being right now in debt of $ k = $ 22,000 instead of only $ 3000 and they might   1 refuse you the loan 2 grant it only if you transfer all purchases on a single card and cancel all the others 3 once the $ 3000 is transferred on one of the cards and the others cancelled they can require that you reduce the limit of that card hope this helps

why does selling a bond drive up the yield the bond will pay back a fixed amount when it comes due the yield is a comparison of what you pay for the bond and what will be repaid when it matures assuming no default why does the yield go up if the country is economically unstable if the country 's economy is unstable that increases the chance that they will default and not pay the full value of the bonds when they mature people are selling them now at a loss instead of waiting for a default later for a greater loss so if you think greece is not going to default as it 's highly likely a country would completely default would n't it make sense to hold onto the bonds only if you also think that they will pay back the full value at maturity it 's possible that they pay some but not all it 's also possible that they will default it 's also possible that they will get kicked out of the euro and start printing drachmas again and try to pay the bonds back with those which could devalue the bonds through inflation the market is made of lots of smart people if they think there are reasons to worry there probably are that does n't mean they can predict the future it just means that they are pricing the risk with good information if you are smarter than the herd by all means bet against them and buy the bonds now it can indeed be lucrative if you are right and they are wrong

i bought health insurance for myself after a period without it and my premiums were not terrible i was a 27 year old man living in california no preexisting conditions and i paid approximately 90 $ a month this was for a standard health insurance plan   however when i moved back to ny a little while later insurance companies wanted almost $ 500/month for catastrophic coverage   so from personal experience my answer is that price varies widely by state different states have different regulations as to what health insurance companies need to cover and at what price in ny health insurance companies ca n't charge different rates according to age also in ny there is a price spiral where the price is so high few people buy it so they have to raise the price because not enough well people are in the pool so fewer people buy it to test it out go to an online insurance broker like and put in your proposed information including that you have n't been covered for a period this way you will know

i do n't think you understand the multiplier effect   the multiplier effect does not allow a bank to loan out more money than they have   the multiplier effect is the theory that when a bank loans out money that money will come back to the bank in the form of a deposit which they can loan out again   with this banking idea if there were enough popularity then when they loan out money they could be getting it back in the form of deposits that they can lend out again

the wash sale rule only applies when the sale in question is at a loss   so the rule does not apply at all to your cases 3 4 7 8 11 12 15 and 16 which all start with a gain   you get a capital gain at the first sale and then a separately computed gain loss at the second sale depending on the case but any gain or loss in the ira is not a taxable event due to the usual tax advantaged rules for the ira the wash sale does not apply to first sales in your ira because there is no taxable gain or loss in that case   that means that you would n't be seeking a deduction anyway and there is nothing to get rolled into the repurchase this means that the rule does not apply to 1 8   for 5 8 where the second sale is in your brokerage account you have a usual capital gain loss as if the sale in the ira did n't happen for 1 4 again the second sale is in the ira so that sale is not taxable what 's left are 9 10 brokerage > ira and 13 14 brokerage > brokerage    the easier two are 13 14   in this case you can not take a capital loss deduction for the first sale at a loss   the loss gets added to the basis of the repurchase instead   when you ultimately close the position with the second sale then you compute your gain or loss based on the modified basis   note that this means you need to be careful about what you mean by gain or loss at the second sale because you need to be careful about when you account for the basis adjustment due to the wash sale example 1 all buys and sells are in your brokerage account   you buy initially at $ 10 and sell at $ 8 creating a $ 2 loss   but you buy again within the wash sale window at $ 9 and sell that at $ 12   you get no deduction after the first sale because it 's wash   you have a $ 1 capital gain at the second sale because your basis is $ 11 = $ 9 + $ 2 due to the $ 2 basis adjustment from wash sale example 2 same as example 1 except that final sale is at $ 8 instead of at $ 12   in this case you appear to have taken a $ 2 loss on the first buy sell and another $ 1 loss on the second buy sell   for taxes however you can not claim the loss at the first sale due to the wash   at the second sale your basis is still $ 11 as in example 1 so your overall capital loss is the $ 3 dollars that you might expect computed as the $ 8 final sale price minus the $ 11 wash adjusted basis now for 9 10 things are a little more complicated   in the ira you do n't worry about the basis of individual stocks that you hold because of the way that tax advantages of those accounts work   you do need to worry about the basis of the ira account as a whole however in some cases   the most common case would be if you have non deductable contributions to your traditional ira   when you eventually withdraw you do n't pay tax on any distributions that are attributable to those nondeductible contributions because you already paid tax on that part   there are other cases where basis of your account matters but that 's a whole question in itself it 's enough for now to understand 1 basis in your ira as a whole is a well defined concept with tax implications and 2 basis in individual holdings within your account do n't matter so with the brokerage ira wash sale there are two questions   1 can you take the capital loss on the brokerage side   2 if no because of the wash sale does this increase the basis of your ira account as a whole   the answer to both is no although the reason is not obvious the irs actually put out a special bulletin to answer the question specifically because it was unclear in the law bottom line for 9 10 is that you apparently are losing your tax deduction completely in that case in addition if you were counting on an increase in the basis of your ira to avoid early distribution penalties you do n't get that either which will result in yet more tax if you actually take the early distribution in addition to the special bulletin noted above publication 550 which talks about wash sale rules for individuals may also help some

any way you look at it this is a terrible idea cars lose value   they are a disposable item that gets used up   the more expensive the car the more value they lose if you spend $ 100,000 on a new car in four years it will be worth less than $ 50,000   that is a lot of money to lose in four years in addition to the loss of value you will need to buy insurance which for a $ 100,000 car is incredible if your heart is set on this kind of car you should definitely save up the cash and wait to buy the car   do not get a loan   here is why your plan has you saving $ 1,300 a month $ 16,000 a year for 6.5 years before you will be able to buy this car   that is a lot of money for a long range goal   if you faithfully save this money that long and at the end of the 6.5 years you still want this car it is your money to spend as you want   you will have had a long time to reconsider your course of action but you will have sacrificed for a long time and you will have the money to lose   however you may find out a year into this process that you are spending too much money saving for this car and reconsider if instead you take out a loan for this car then by the time you decide the car was too much of a stretch financially it will be too late   you will be upside down on the loan and it will cost you thousands to sell the car so go ahead and start saving   if you have n't given up before you reach your goal you may find that in 6.5 years when it is time to write that check you will look back at the sacrifices you have made and decide that you do n't want to simply blow that money on a car consider a different goal   if you invest this $ 1300 a month and achieve 8 growth you will be a millionaire in 23 years you do n't need to take my word for it   look at the car you are interested in go to select the 2012 version of the car and look up the private sale value   you 'll most likely see a price that is about half of what a new one costs

utilization is near real time what that means is that what is reported is what is taken in terms of debt to income dti ratios when a mortgage broker pulls your credit they will pull the latest balances with the minimum payments this is what is taken to determine dti along with your gross monthly income if you do not pay your account in full before the statement date then you more than likely will have to wait an additional statement cycle before it reports to the credit bureaus therefore your utilization is dynamic and the history of your utilization month to month is not recorded forever only the current balance what is maintained and reported is your payment history so you want to never be late if you want to be approved anytime soon for a mortgage a lower dti will not help your interest rate as long as you stay away from the maximum dti for the mortgage vehicle you are attempting to be approved for va fha conventional etc then your dti should not be a concern if you are borderline at the time of underwriting you can take the opportunity and pay off the balances the mortgage company can then do what is called a credit supplement which entails contacting those lenders where you have proven you have a zero balance and manually input the zero balance cards that have not yet reported to the bureaus in your final application to the mortgage company for underwriting approval

one more scenario is when the company already has maturing debt   e.g company took out a debt of 2 billion in 2010 and is maturing 2016 it has paid back say 500 million but has to pay back the debtors the remaining 1.5 billion it will again go to the debt markets to fund this 1.5 billion maybe at better terms than the 2010 issue based on market conditions and its business the debt is to keep the business running or grow it the people issuing debt will do complete research before issuing the debt it can always sell stock but that results in dilution and affects shareholders debt also affects shareholders but when interest rates are lower companies tend to go to debt markets although sometimes they can just do a secondary and be done with it if the float is low

as of now you are doing that when you start earning larger sums of money you will not withdraw and keep it in your house you will leave it in the bank and they will earn money on it by lending it out at a higher interest rate when you are broke that same bank will offer you a credit card or some other instrument that will help you survive they will charge you money on that and make interest of you when you have too much money and you start wiring money they will charge you a wire transfer fees there are more than 500 ways in which banks make money off you if you plan receiving $ 100 and $ 250 all your life and withdraw it immediately and do n't plan doing anything else all your life then you will probably not let the bank make any money off you however there are a very few people like that and banks barely lose anything accepting those customers

i 'm assuming the tag of united states is accurate yes the remaining amount is tax free at the current price   if you sell at exactly the original price there is no capital gain no capital loss   so you 've already payed the taxes if you sell and there is a capital gain of $ 3000 then you will pay taxes on the $ 3000   if 33 is your marginal tax rate and if you held the stock for less than a year then you will keep $ 7000 and pay taxes of $ 1000   somehow i doubt your marginal tax rate is 33 if you hold the stock for a year after etrade sold some for you to pay taxes then you will pay 15 on the gain or $ 450 etrade sold the shares to pay the taxes generated by the income   yes those shares were considered income   if you sell and have a loss well life sucks   however if you sell something else you can use the loss to offset the other gain   so if you sell stock a for a loss of $ 3000 and sell stock b at a gain of $ 4000 then you pay taxes on the net of $ 1000

open google finance and divide the market capitalization by the total price that will give you the total number of shares outstanding now see the number of shares you could buy for $ shares of $ 25 each or 10 shares of 100 shares each now divide the number of shares you own by the number of shares outstanding in the company and multiply it by shares you own shares outstanding 100 that will give you the percentage or stake of the company you $ 1000 do n't expect it to be a very large number now ask your self the question is it worth it if i can buy x of this company for $ 1000 if the answer is yes go ahead and buy it   to answer your question in short no it does not matter whether you buy 10 shares for $ 100 or 40 shares for $ 25 cheers

you are very young you make a huge amount of money and you have from what information you provide very little debt if you simply want to buy a house for whatever reason sure but be honest with yourself about why you want to buy it i see a lot of people who think they 're doing it for smart financial reasons but then when i ask them about their pension savings and credit card debts and so on there is no evidence that they are actually the kind of person who makes decisions for smart financial reasons if you want a house because that seems like the thing that people do maybe you could think more about what you actually want if your concern is putting your money to work for you you seem to dislike that you pay rent each month and after that month you do n't have anything to show for your money except of course that you did n't spent the last month living on the streets you can do a lot better than getting a mortgage for example living frugally you should be able to dump 50k a year into investments if you did that for a few years you could reasonably expect the return to cover your rent and bills in a surprisingly small number of years a lot less than a 25 year mortgage your question seems to be starting from the position that you should buy a house you 're asking if you should buy it now or wait you are rich enough now and if your earnings keep going up will be even more rich in a few years that you should perhaps question your need to buy a house with your kind of money at this stage of your life you can do a lot better

the loan to value ratio ltv ratio is a lending risk assessment ratio that financial institutions and others lenders examine before approving a mortgage it sounds like your lender has a 60 requirement remember the home is the collateral for the loan   if you stop making payments they can take the house back from you   that number is less than 100 to accommodate changing market prices the cost of foreclosure repairing and reselling the home   they may be a safety factor built in depending on the home 's location    if you want to buy a $ 1.8 million dollar home you will have to come up with 40 down payment   that down payment is what reduces the risk for the lender   so no there is no way to cheat that think about the transaction from the view of the lender    note in some areas you can still get a loan if you do n't have the required down payment   you just have to pay a monthly mortgage insurance   it 's expensive but that works for many home buyers   a separate insurance company offers a policy that helps protect the lender when there is n't enough deposit paid update   er no   keep it simple   the bank will only loan you money if it has collateral for the loan they 've built in a hefty safety margin to protect them in case you quit paying them your monthly payments   if you want to spend the money on something else that would work as long as you provide collateral to protect the lender   you mention borrowing money for some other purpose then buying a home   that would be fine but you will have to come up with some collateral that protect the lender if you wanted to buy a new business the bank would first ask for an appraisal of the value of the assets of the business   that could be applied to the collateral safety net for the lender   if you wanted to buy a business that had little appraisal value then the bank would require more collateral from you in other forms   say you wanted to borrow the money for an expensive operation or cosmetic surgery in that case there is no collateral value in the operation you ca n't sell anything from the surgery to anybody to recover costs the money is spent and gone   before the bank would loan you any money for such a surgery they would require you to provide upfront collateral   in this case if you were to borrow $ 60,000 for surgery the bank would require $ 100,000 worth of collateral to protect their interest in the loan you borrow money then you pay it back at a regular interval at an agreed upon rate and schedule   same thing for borrowing money for the stock market or a winning horse at the horse race   a lender will require a hard asset as collateral before making you a loan    yes i know you have a good tip on a winning horse and you are bound to double your money but that 's not the way it works from a lender 's point of view     it sounds like you are trying to game the system by playing on words   i will say quit using the 40 to 60 phrase   that is just confusing   the bank 's loan to value is reported as a single number in this case 60   for every $ 6000 you want to borrow you have to provide an asset worth $ 10,000 as a safety guarantee for the loan if you want to borrow money for the purchase of a home you will need to meet that 60 safety requirement   if you want to borrow $ 1,000,000 cash for something besides a home then you will have to provide something with a retail value of $ as equity i think the best way for you to answer your own question is for you to pretend to be the banker then examine the proposal from the banker 's viewpoint will the banker have enough collateral for whatever it is you are asking to borrow if you do n't yet have that equity and you need a loan for something besides a home you can always save your money until you do have enough equity   comment one i thought that most lenders had a 75 or 80 loan to value ratio the 60 number seems pretty low   that could indicate you may be a high risk borrower or possibly that lender is not the best for you   have you tried other lenders   it 's definitely worth shopping around for different lenders    comment two i will say it almost sounds like you are n't being entirely honest with us here   no way someone with a monthly income who can afford a $ 1.8 million home would be asking questions like this   i get that english probably is n't your first language but still   the other thing is if you are truly buying a $ 1.8 million dollar home your real estate agent would be helping you find a lender that will work with you   they would be highly motivated to see this sale happen    all of your questions could be answered in ten minutes with a visit to your local bank or any bank for that matter   when you add up the costs and taxes and insurance on a 30 fixed loan you 'd have a monthly mortgage payment of nearly $ 10,500 a month or more   can you really afford that on your monthly income

1 interest rates what you should know is that the longer the term of a bond fund the more it will be affected by interest rates so a short term bond fund will not be subject to large gains or losses due to rate changes an intermediate term bond fund will be subject to moderate gains or losses and a long term bond fund will be subject to the largest gains or losses when a book or financial planner says to buy bonds with no other qualification they almost always mean investment grade intermediate term bond funds or for individual bonds the equivalent would be a bond ladder averaging an intermediate term if you want technical details look at the average duration or average maturity of the bond fund as a rough guide if the duration is 10 then a 1 change in interest rates would be a 10 gain or loss on the fund another thing you can do is look at long term 10 years or ideally longer performance history on some short intermediate and long term bond index funds and you can see how the long term funds bounced around more non investment grade bonds aka junk bonds or high yield bonds are more affected by factors other than interest rates including some of the same factors economic booms or recessions that affect stocks as a result they are n't as good for diversifying a portfolio that otherwise consists of stocks having stocks investment grade bonds and also a little bit in high yield bonds can add diversification though just do n't replace your bond allocation with high yield bonds a variety of complicated bonds exist convertible bonds are an example and these are tough to analyze there are also floating rate bonds bank loan funds these have minimal interest rate sensitivity because the rate goes up to offset rate rises these funds still have credit risks in the credit crisis some of them lost a lot of money 2 diversification the purpose of diversification is risk control your non bond funds will outperform in many years but in other years say the s&p 500 drop in 2008 they may not you will not know in advance which year you 'll get you get risk control in at least a few ways there 's also an academic modern portfolio theory explanation for why you should diversify among risky assets aka stocks something like for a given desired risk return ratio it 's better to leverage up a diverse portfolio than to use a non diverse portfolio because risk that can be eliminated through diversification is not compensated by increased returns the theory also goes that you should choose your diversification between risk assets and the risk free asset according to your risk tolerance i.e. select the highest return with tolerable risk see for excruciating detail the translation of the mpt stuff to practical steps is typically put as much in stock index funds as you can tolerate over your time horizon and put the rest in intermediate term investment grade bond index funds that 's probably what your planner is asking you to do my personal view which is not the standard view is that you should take as much risk as you need to take not as much as you think you can tolerate http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ but almost everyone else will say to do the 80/20 if you have decades to retirement and feel you can tolerate the risk so my view that 60/40 is the max desirable allocation to stocks is not mainstream your planner 's 80/20 advice is the standard advice before doing 100 stocks i 'd give you at least a couple see also

no it 's not all long term capital gain   depending on the facts of your situation it will be either ordinary income or partially short term capital gain   you should consider consulting a tax lawyer if you have this issue this is sort of a weird little corner of the tax law   irc do n't go into it nor do the attendant regs   it also somewhat the people on years ago they mostly and just declared it self employment income avoiding the holding period issue   but i did manage to find it in portfolio buried in there   that cited to a court case v. williams 152 5th and to revenue ruling 75 and to another   rev 75 cites fred 32 for the proposition that assets are acquired progressively as they are built   note also that land and improvements on it are treated as separate assets for purposes of depreciation pub so between williams which says something similar but about the industry and 75 as well as some related rulings and cases you may be looking at an analysis of how long your property has been built and how built it was   you may be able to some of the building as long term and some as short term   whether the apportionment should be as to cost before 1 year or value created before 1 year is explicitly left open in williams   it may be simpler to account for costs since you 'll have expenditure records with dates however if this is properly ordinary income because this is really business inventory and not merely investment property then you have fully ordinary income and holding period is irrelevant   your quick turnaround sale tends to suggest this may have been done as a business not as an investment a proper advisor with access to these materials could help you formulate a tax strategy and return position   this may be complex and law driven enough that you 'd need a tax lawyer rather than a cpa or preparer   they can sort through the precedent and if you have the money may even provide a formal tax opinion   experienced real estate lawyers may be able to help if you screen them appropriately i.e. those who help prepare real estate tax returns or otherwise have strong tax crossover knowledge

there are a couple of cases where i 'd argue in favor of the 401k employer matching if the employer matches your contributions then it makes sense to get these additional investments which if you are in a low bracket may exist as highly compensated employees may want those in the lower brackets to contribute as much as they can investment options if the employer has enough assets in the plan there could be access to institutional versions of those funds   for example compare vanguard institutional index viiix with vanguard 500 index vfinx where the expense ratio in the former is just .02 while the latter is .17   granted this is a minor difference in expenses there is something to be said for how much a .15 drag year over year could add up

this is a very good question the biggest difference is that when you put money in a savings bank you are a lender that is protected by the government and when you buy stocks you become an owner as a lender whether the bank makes or loses money on the loans it makes they still maintain your balance and pay you interest and your principal balance is guaranteed by the government in the usa the bank is the party that is primarily at risk if their business does not perform well as an owner you participate fully in the company 's gains and losses but you also put your money at risk since if the company loses money you do too because of this many people prefer to buy funds made up of many stocks so they are not at risk of one company performing very poorly or going bankrupt when you buy stock you become a part owner and share in the profitability of the company often through a dividend you should also be aware that stocks often have years where they do very poorly as well as years when they do very well however over a long period of time 10 years or more they have historically done better in outpacing inflation than any other type of investment for this reason i would recommend that you only invest in the stock market if you expect to be able to leave the money there for 10 years or more ideally and for 5 years at the very least otherwise you may need to take the money out at a bad time i would also recommend that you only invest in stocks if you already have an emergency fund and do n't have consumer debt there is n't much point in putting your money at risk to get a return if you can get a risk free return by paying off debt or if you would have to pull your money back out if your car broke down or you lost your job

other answers here cover some of the basics but this is also a great time to start establishing a credit history and developing good financial habits to carry throughout your life in addition to opening a free checking account with the local credit union establish an overdraft line of credit on that account never close this account or this line of credit as it will work to increase the average age of your accounts when you apply for credit later in life if you are disciplined with your use of credit cards you may also want to apply for a low limit credit card through the same credit union for the same purpose as above never carry a balance on this card but make minor purchases with it each month never more than 20 of the balance maybe just buy gas with it start tracking all of your spending and make a monthly budget there are a lot of online tools that make this very easy establishing the habit now will help you make informed financial decisions in the future open a roth ira and put at least 10 of your money away for retirement in the future your income may increase enough to put you in the 25 tax bracket if that ever happens open a regular ira and put the money there instead also when you have employers that offer 401k matching do the same thing with a roth 401k account keep your money invested in a low cost index fund

how you use the metric is super important    because it subtracts cash it does not represent value   it represents the ongoing financing that will be necessary if both the equity plus debt is bought by one person who then pays himself a dividend with that free cash    so if you are private equity this measures your net investment at not the price you pay at t=0   if you are a retail investor who a wo n't be buying the debt b wo n't have any control over things like tax jurisdictions c wo n't be receiving any cash dividend etc etc the metric is pointless

there are a lot of good answers above all of them will probably work for you in some way or another one point to note from the procrastination theme is that you could invest your free money that you have currently in some investment instrument which would require you to do some paperwork etc to get out this way the immediate cash flow is decreased and also invested now from each budget save a small amount for the things that you would like to buy give this small savings some months to accumulate so that you can afford only one of the items that you want to buy or target an item that you want to buy after the money is accumulated if you still want to buy the item then you probably should one point of note is that budgeting is also important on a monthly basis pete has provided excellent suggestion in this regard

i think most financial planners or advisors would allocate zero to a gold only fund that 's probably the mainstream view metals investments have a lot of issues more here what would be the signs of a bubble in silver also consider that metals and commodities despite a recent drop are on a big run up and lots of random people are saying they 're the thing to get in on usually this is a sign that you might want to wait a bit or at least buy gradually   the more mainstream way to go might be a commodities fund or all asset fund some funds you could look at just examples not recommendations might include several pimco funds including their commodity real return and all asset hussman strategic total return diversified commodities index etfs stuff like that has a lot of the theoretical benefits of gold but is n't as dependent on gold specifically another idea for you might be international bonds or stocks if you feel us currency in particular is at risk oh and reits often come up as an inflation resistant asset class i personally use diversified funds rather than gold specifically fwiw mostly for the same reason i 'd buy a fund instead of individual stocks is probably about right to put into this kind of stuff depending on your overall portfolio and goals pure commodities should probably be less than funds with some bonds stocks or reits because in principle commodities only track inflation over time they do n't make money the only way you make money on them is rebalancing out of them some when there 's a run up and back in when they 're down so a portfolio with mostly commodities would suck long term some people feel gold 's virtue is rather than being a piece of paper in an apocalypse ish scenario but if making that argument i think you need physical gold in your basement not an etf   plus i 'd argue for guns ammo and food over gold in that scenario

you need to find out if the credit card has been reporting these failed automated payments as late or missed payments to your credit report to do this go to annualcreditreport.com the official site to get your free credit reports and request your report from all three bureaus if you see late or missing payments reported for the months where you made a payment but then they did an automatic payment anyway you should call up the credit card company explain the situation and ask them to retract those negative reports if they refuse you should dispute the reports directly with the credit bureaus if they have been reporting late payments even though you have been making the payments that will impact your credit much more than the fact that they closed your account   unfortunately they can turn off your credit account for any reason they like and there is n't much you can do about that find yourself another job as soon as you can get back on your feet pay off your debt and think very carefully before you open another credit card in the future do n't start a new credit card unless you can ensure that you will pay it off in full every month

regarding interest on idle cash   brokerage firms must maintain a segregated account on the brokerage firm 's books to make sure that the client 's money and the firm 's money is not intermingled and clients funds are not used for operational purposes source    thus brokerage firms do not earn interest on cash that is held unused in client accounts regarding exchanges pay firm for liquidity i am not aware of any circumstances under which an exchange will pay a brokerage any such fee   in fact the opposite is the case   exchanges charge participants to transact business see how the nyse makes money similarly market makers do not pay a broker to transact business on their behalf   they charge the broker a commission just like the broker charges their client a commission   of course a large broker may also be acting as market maker or deal directly with the exchange in which case no such commission will be incurred by the broker   in any case the broker will pay a commission to the clearing house

when you compare the costs of paying your current mortgage with the rental income from the flat you 're not really comparing like with like firstly the mortgage payments are covering both interest and capital repayments so some of the 8k is money that is adding to your net worth secondly the value of the flat 130k is much more than the outstanding mortgage 80k so if you did sell the flat and pay off the mortgage you 'd have 50k left in cash that could be invested to provide an income the right way to compare the two options is to look at the different costs in each scenario let 's assume the bigger house will cost as it makes the figures work out nicely if you buy the bigger house with a bigger mortgage you will need to borrow 50k more so will end up with a mortgage of 130k and you will still have the 8k year from the flat depending on your other income you might have to pay tax on the 8k year e.g. at 40 if you 're a higher rate taxpayer leaving you with year if you sell the flat you 'll have no mortgage repayments to make and no income from the flat you 'll be able to exactly buy the new house outright with the 50k left over after you repay the mortgage on top of your old house you 'd also have to pay some costs to sell the flat that you would n't have to with the bigger mortgage but you 'd save on the costs of getting a new mortgage they probably are n't the same but let 's simplify and assume they are if anything the costs of selling the flat are likely to be higher than the mortgage costs viewed like that you should look at the actual costs to you of having a 130k mortgage and how much of that would be interest given that you 'll be remortgaging at current mortgage rates i 'd expect interest would only be 2 3 i.e around 4k so significantly less than the income from the flat even after tax the total payment would be more because of capital repayment but you could easily afford the cashflow difference you can vary the term of the mortgage to control how much the capital repayment is and you should easily be able to get a 130k mortgage on a house with a very good deal so if your figure of 8k rent is accurate considering void periods costs of upkeep etc then i think it easily makes sense to get the bigger house with the bigger mortgage given the tax impact which was pointed out in a comment a third strategy may be even better keep the flat but take out a mortgage on it in exchange for a reduced mortgage on your main house the reason for doing it that way is that you get some tax relief on the mortgage costs on an investment property as long as the income from that property is higher than the costs whereas you do n't on your primary residence the tax relief used to just be at the same tax rate you were paying on the rental income i.e. you could subtract the mortgage costs from the rental income when calculating tax it 's gradually being reduced so it 's just basic rate tax relief 20 even if you pay higher rate tax but it still could save you some money you 'd need to look at the different mortgage costs carefully as buy to let mortgages often have higher interest rates

is there anything here i should be concerned about a concern i see is the variable rate loans do you understand the maximum rate they can get to at this time those rates are low but if you are going to put funds against the highest rate loan make sure the order does n't change without you noticing it what is a good mode of attack here   the best mode of attack is to pay off the one with the highest rate first by paying more than the minimum when that is done roll over the money you were paying for that loan to the next highest note if a loan balance get to be very low you can put extra funds against this low balance loan to be done with it investigate loan forgiveness programs the federal government has loan forgiveness programs for certain job positions if you work for them for a number of years some employers also have these programs   what are the payoff dates for the other loans my calculations put a bunch in about 2020 but some as late as 2030 you may need to talk to your lender they might have a calculator on their website   why do my citi loans have a higher balance than the original payoff amounts some loans are subsidized by the federal government this covers the interest while the student is still in school non subsidized federal loans and private loans do n't have this feature so their balance can grow while the student is in school

its best to seek a lawyer but it is unlikely you can force him to pay   you probably know couples that are in some part of the divorce process that have trouble obtaining court ordered payments   in your case you have less of a legal standing exception if you have children together   as far as the house goes the two of you entered into some sort of business arrangement and it will be difficult to force him to pay    one thing that works for you is that he has excellent credit   if he is interested in keeping a high credit rating he will ensure that no payments are late on the home   your question suggests that the two of you are not getting along very well right now and that needs to stop   the best financial decision you can make right now is to get along with him    it seems that the two of you have not officially broken up   if you do decide to ways do so as as possible   you will have to work to get the home in your name only and him off the deed   this benefits both of you as you will have sole control of the house and this ill advised business decision can end   he will have the home off his credit and will not be responsible if you miss a payment and can also buy a home or whatever of his own good luck and do your best to work this out   seeking peace will cost you a lot less money in the long run   fighting in court cost a lot of money   giving in to semi reasonable demands are far cheaper then fighting here is an example   lets say he normally contributes $ 500 to the mortgage and he decides to move out   i would ask him to contribute $ 200 until you can get his name off the loan say 6 months at the most   after that you will put the house up for sale if you can not obtain a mortgage in your own name and will split any profits

morgan stanley was the lead investor and sold off their ownership before the casino had completed construction   took a billion dollar loss but it could have been much worse   that s a pretty telling sign that when wall street wants nothing to do with the project no other investor should have stepped into the investment

curtis fucked me up i thought i wanted real change but after listening to him i realize i 'm one of those with too much to lose even though it 's not much at all in the material sense and as he put it i just want to tweak it some as he says real change could be downright frightening   i 'm 66 and if i did n't have an extended family who still depend on me i might be one that would feel there 's not much to lose     i would n't surprise me at all to learn that every three letter agency in the govt had a hand in ows    i 'm assuming you have but just checking have you watched the century if the the century of the

taking into account your pov i would recommend mostly goods that will be harder to obtain precious metals not only gold and forex although the forex depends on some other country not having troubles with it 's own economy which in a world as interconnected as ours by internet and all the new technologies does n't seem likely   i highly recommend silver which is cheaper than gold and is stable enough in the long term

what the on reddit   they do n't need to if transacting in it were declared illegal it would become useless   it only has utility if it can be used to buy things or exchanged for real money   it may retain some niche value like gold coins in wow or in failed 3rd world countries but real corporations and banks in the developed world would be out

i 'd suggest you keep putting money in your savings account and start investing after you land that first big job as another answer mentioned unless you 're fortunate enough to have all of your tuition and living expenses paid for an emergency fund is an invaluable tool for a college student and the bigger the better your laptop gets stolen or your car 's air conditioner or heater dies both of these things happened to me in college and it would have been a much bigger deal for me if i did n't have some money tucked away

i would n't worry about his credit score the hit from a credit inquiry is not that big and it 's absolutely worth it in the long run i suggest you sign him up for a free budgeting app just google budgeting app that will help him not only take control of his spending but also help him with his loans transferring debt comes with a few caveats   his credit score is bad so i do n't know if he 'll be able to get 0 loan but even if he gets 6 8 that will save him money just do n't forget about the transfer fee   if he has checking savings account it 's worth talking to that bank first they might be able to give him a better deal for being their customer also if he tells them his story and credit score they might be able to give him an idea what they can offer him without doing a credit check   another option is to become a member of a local credit union they have great rates on loans credit cards credit card or personal loan does n't matter much whatever he can get with his credit score i doubt he 'll be able to get a good rate at chase or one of the other big credit card companies good luck

borrowing against your retirement is borrowing against your future you should n't do it expect for the most serious financial crises the market is down and 12 is a pretty darn good down payment you 'll hit the threshold where they waive pmi in a few years when you hit 80 ltv or when you get the house appraised when the market up again another option is to find a lender that does n't do pmi a few local banks and credit unions do this i managed to find one in my area that does n't require pmi or tax insurance

slightly off topic i wondered what inflation has been like since 1850   the fed says the current dollar is worth 28 times less than the 1850 dollar   this seems low   the 1850 dollar contained of an ounce of gold which sells at $ 65    today   so the current dollar is actually worth 65 times less another way of looking at this is by salaries   most jobs have changed too much but a grunt in the us army is essentially the same a private in 1850 made $ and in 2017 it 's $ so a dollar is worth 121 times less today     i have a hard time believing the fed 's figure when it seems like inflation is two to four times more
