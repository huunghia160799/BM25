three points for you to keep in mind 1 in the very first year you should have 182 days outside india so that in the year when you start your consultancy you will not have any liability to pay tax on earning abroad 2 although you may be starting a consultancy abroad if you do any services in india there will be withholding tax depending on the country in which you have started the consultancy business 3 whatever money you repatriate is not taxable in india however if you you repatriate the money as gift to anyone who is not a relative will be taxed in his her hand

on june 30 2015 the value of a key should be exactly the expected revenue from selling the chest contents owing to the fact that the next day the keys become worthless   looking at the steam community market it seems like the value of a key is higher than this but lower than 2.50   if that 's true then since the price of a key is higher than the expected revenue from selling the chest contents as you say then you can see that at some point the value of a key will have to go down   and as you get closer to the cutoff date the price will fall faster   it 's not quite the same but this pattern is usually what you see in the ticket resale market on say   if there 's something about keys that keeps their worth above the expected value of selling chest contents some value to the flexibility that keys offer over other tradable items maybe then in the short run that wo n't change due to this distant deadline just because it 's so far off   people will still want the flexibility keys offer   orthodox economics might suggest sell sooner rather than later but certainly do n't wait too long   different people react differently though   if there are a lot of people who sell their keys after hearing this news it might be a good time to buy   of course it 's a gamble but if you trust in whatever force keeps keys priced above the expected value of the loot they can buy then that force should win out in the medium term and you could turn a profit

imagine a $ 1,000 face value bond paying 10 interest semi annually that means every 6 months there is $ 50 being paid now if the price of that bond doubled to $ 2,000 what is the yield it is still paying $ 50 every 6 months but now sports a 5 yield as the price went up a great deal similarly if the price of the bond was cut in half to $ 500 now it is yielding 20 because it is still paying out the $ 50 every 6 months the dollar figure is fixed what percentage of the price it is can vary and that is why there is the inverse relationship between prices and yields note that the length of the bond is n't mentioned here where while usually longer bonds will have higher yields there can be inverted yield curves as well as calls on some bonds also inflation indexed and convertible bonds could have different calculations used as principal adjustments or possible conversion to stock can change a perception on the overall return

if it 's feasible try to get one card down to zero balance and preferably one of your cash back cards   then keep that at zero every month pay it off in full and use it for your purchases as you describe above the idea would be to get it so that you are not paying interest on your month to month purchases   this not only reduces the 20 or whatever that you 're paying on that balance but also the 20 or whatever you 're paying on those purchases remember a card you carry a balance on charges you interest on those purchases from the current month if this is n't feasible if these are all very high balance cards then i suppose the way you 're currently doing it would be okay though i think you 're overthinking things to some extent but with 80 interest if that 's a significant pile of money you may need to as clearly that needs to be tackled first   i think it 's mostly better for you to pay your day to day stuff out of pocket and not use your cards the way you are suggesting but with the 80 you may need to the reason i say it 's better not to use your card the way you suggest is that it is difficult to do properly and never get it wrong i.e. never go over a balance and it 's also leaving you in the habit of using credit   it does n't help you budget necessarily either   instead set up a fully developed budget that includes all of those minimum payments and pay them   certainly once you have the > 50 debt handled i would switch to this method not using credit cards at all

to build a us credit record you need a social security number ssn which is now not available for most non residents    an alternative is an itin number which is now available to non residents only if they have us income giving a reason to file a us tax return do you really want to get into all that assuming you did have a reason to get a itin one reason would be if you sold some ebooks via amazon us and need a withholding refund under the tax treaty then recent reports on give mixed results on whether it 's possible to get a credit card with an itin and whether that would build a credit record   it does sound possible in some cases    a credit record in any other country would not help   you would certainly need a us address and banks are increasingly asking for a physical address rather than just a mailbox regardless building this history would be of limited benefit to you if you later became a us resident at that point you would be eligible for a new ssn different from the itin and have to largely start again if getting a card is the aim rather than the credit record you may find some banks that will offer a secured card or a debit card to non residents especially in areas with lots of canadian visitors border florida arizona   you 'd find it a lot easier with a us address though and you 'd need to shop around a lot of banks in person until you find one with the right rules   most will simply avoid anyone without an ssn

real estate potentially has two components of profit the increase in value and the ongoing returns similar to a stock appreciating and its dividends    it 's possible to buy both badly and in the case of stocks there are studies that show the typical investor lags the market by many percent   real estate is not a homogeneous asset class a $ 200 k house renting for $ 1,000 is a far different investment than a $ 100 k 3 family renting for $ 2,000 total rents both exist depending on the part of the country you are in   if you simply divide the price to the rent you get either or this is an oversimplification and of course interest rates will push these numbers in one direction or another it 's safe to say that at any given time the ratio can help determine if home prices are too high a bargain or somewhere in between   as one article suggests the median price tracks inflation pretty closely and i 'd add that median home prices would track median income long term   to circle back yes real estate can be a good investment if you buy right find good tenants and are willing to put in the time   note buying to rent and buying to live in are not always the same economic decision the home buyer will very often buy a larger house than they should and turn their own profit into a loss e.g. a buyer who would otherwise be advised to buy the $ 150 k house instead of renting is talked into a bigger house by the real estate agent the bank the spouse the extra cost of the $ 225 k house is the 1/3 more cost of repair utilities interest etc it 's identical to needing a 1000 sq ft apartment but grabbing one that 's 1500 sq ft for the view

i debated whether to put this in an answer or a comment because i 'm not sure that this can be answered without a lot more information which actually would then probably make it a candidate for closing as too localized at the very least we would need to know where which jurisdiction she is located in so speaking in a generic way the options available as i see them are contact the mortgage companies and explain she ca n't continue to make payments they will likely foreclose on the properties and if she still ends up owing money after that if you are in the us this also depends on whether you are in a non recourse state then she could be declared bankrupt this is rather the nuclear option and definitely not something to be undertaken lightly but would at least wipe the slate clean and give her some degree of certainty about her situation look very carefully at the portfolio of properties and get some proper valuations done on them depending on where she is located this may be free also do a careful analysis of the property sales and rental markets to see whether property prices rental rates are going up or down then decide on an individual basis whether each property is better kept or sold you may be able to get discounts on fees if you sell multiple properties in one transaction this option would require some cold hard analysis and decision making without letting yourselves get emotionally invested in the situation difficult i know depending on how long she has had the properties for and how she came to own them it might be an option to pursue action against whoever advised her to acquire them clearly a large portfolio of decaying rental properties is not a suitable investment for a relatively elderly lady and if she only came by them relatively recently on advice from an investment consultant or similar you might have some there   another option could she live in one of the properties herself to reduce costs if she owns her own home as well then she could sell that live in the one of the rentals and use the money saved to finance the sale of the other rentals aside from these thoughts one final piece of advice do n't get your own finances tangled up in hers so do n't take out a mortgage against your own property for example obviously if you have the leeway to help her out of your budget then that is great but i would restrict that to doing things like paying for grocery shopping or whatever if she is heading for bankruptcy or other financial difficulties it wo n't help if you are too

a stock market is just that a market place where buyers and sellers come together to buy and sell shares in companies listed on that stock market there is no global stock price the price relates to the last price a stock was traded at on a particular stock market however a company can be listed on more than one stock exchange for example some australian companies are listed both on the australian stock exchange asx and the nyse and they usually trade at different prices on the different exchanges also there is no formula to determine a stock price in your example where c wants to buy at 110 and b wants to sell at 120 there will be no sale until one or both of them decides to change their bid or offer to match the opposite or until new buyers and/or sellers come into the market closing the gap between the buy and sell prices and creating more liquidity it is all to do with supply and demand and peoples emotions

there are two very small catches you have just increased your available credit   in some cases when you want to make a loan they will check your available credit against your creditworthiness your income and credit history in the short term with a greater credit limit you may have more difficulty getting a large loan   on the other hand your greater credit limit will make you seem more creditworthy as you have been walking around with the ability to borrow a whole pile and demonstrated the ability to not go bankrupt the other possible catch is that if something goes wrong and your credit line is maxed maybe you have a episode maybe you give your credit card and pin number to someone who buys a car on you your liability is larger if you can maintain spending discipline and do n't need every ounce of credit head room right now neither of these apply   in the medium to long term a lower credit utilization and a higher total limit will make you more creditworthy

checks in the us anyway are only good for six months after they have been written after that under the us uniform code they are considered stale checks and banks need not accept them my experience is that they generally wo n't but you probably should n't count on that either when figuring out whether to try depositing an old check or figuring out how much cash you need to keep in your checking account to cover recent stale checks the check you now hold is certainly a statement of intent to pay you and thus is a useful document to supplement other evidence that they still owe you the money but since checks can be cancelled and/or a replacement check may have been issued its value for that purpose may be limited you can try depositing it and see what happens if that does n't work or you do n't want to bother trying it you can contact the retirement plan point out that this check went uncashed and ask them to send you a replacement if they have n't already done so you might want to check your own records for that there should n't be any problem with this note many business checks have a statement printed on them that they 're only good for 90 days or so if yours does you can skip trying to cash it just contact the retirement plan offices

in the united states most residential real estate transactions employ a title company to process all the paperwork and transfer all the funds some paperwork has to be filed with the local government but they also have to deal with the banks mortgage companies on the two ends of the transaction at closing both parties will sign a ton of paperwork all of which was coordinated by the title company as for the funds the buyer will write a check the lender will send over the loan commitment papers for the rest of the money   how much money that depends on the purchase price the deposit the down payment the taxes and fees an other closing costs they are responsible for initial escrow inspection title insurance   the seller hopefully does n't have to write a check but if they underwater they will have to bring funds to closing from the incoming funds the title company will send money to the old lender the real estate agents the local government to record the deed   the sellers escrow money with the old lender may end up being sent back to the seller or some of the funds could be transferred to the buyer to help cover the portion of the real estate taxes from the perspective of the buyer they will only write two checks one at the start of the process for the deposit and one on closing day for their portion of the transaction the seller will hopefully walk away with a check of course determining if they will owe taxes for the transaction depends on a lot more information

i think there 's value in charging family members friends interest if it will make them take the loan seriously   the problem is that if you 're thinking about charging interest because the person seems to be borrowing from you too it may be too late to make them take it seriously in the situation you describe if you 're concerned about the loans being paid back i think you need to have a serious conversation with the kids and make it clear you expect them to pay the loans back on whatever schedule you agreed to   if based on your knowledge of your kids you think charging interest would help motivate them to do this great   if not charging interest is unlikely to accomplish anything that the conversation itself wo n't accomplish   if you have n't previously outlined a specific schedule or set of expectations for how you want to be paid back just doing that in writing may be enough to make them realize it 's not a joke the conventional wisdom is that you should n't lend money to anyone unless you 're either a okay with never being paid back or b willing to pursue legal remedies to ensure you 're paid back   most people are n't willing to sue their own family members over small loans which means in most cases it 's not a good idea to loan money to family unless you 're okay with never being repaid whatever level of okay with makes sense for you i should note that i do n't have kids my advice here is just how i would handle it if i were considering loaning money to my brother or a close friend or the like   this means i do n't really know anything about teaching the kids about the real world but i have to say my hunch is that if your kids are 25 + and married it 's too late to radically change their views on how the real world works unless they had a very sheltered early adulthood they 've been living in the real world for too long and will have their own ideas of how it works

my recommendation is to not ask for a credit increase but just increase the utilization of one card if you have multiple cards and decrease the utilization of the others and continue paying off all cards in full each month   in a   few months you   will likely be offered a credit increase by the card that is getting increased use   the card company that is getting the extra business knows that you are paying off big bills each month and keeping your account in good standing and they will likely offer you a credit increase all by themselves because they want to keep your business   if no offer is forthcoming you can call the card company and ask for a credit increase if they refuse tell them that you will be charging very little on the card in the future   or even canceling your card though that will cause a hit on your credit score because of their refusal and switch your high volume to a different card

there is no limit on the output maximum in one year the strength of the hsa is that if you do n't spend all the money in the account it rolls over to the next year the benefit is that if a few years down the road you get a huge medical bill you are protected because you can pull it out of the hsa   the goal for me was to build up the account to a level that even if i had to may the maximum out of pocket for my insurance policy the money game from previous years deposits and current year deposits even you ever have the situation where the employer does n't offer a high deductible plan the money for co payments and medicines can still be pulled from the pre existing hsa   if the government did limit you to withdraws not exceeding current year deposits the roll over feature would be worthless

first you 've learned a very good lesson that quite a few people miss out on notice how easy it is to get out of debt when you get a windfall of money   the trouble is that if a person does n't have the behavior to maintain their position they will end up in the same place   many lottery winners end up being poor in the long run because their behavior is the problem not their finances if you feel that you 're going to end up in debt again this means simply that somewhere in your finances your expenses exceed your income   simply put there 's only two fundamental things that can be done you can do one or the other or both   over budgeting i prefer automation automate your bills and spending by setting up a bill and spending account and when the money 's gone it 's gone you can tell yourself at that point i have to find another source of income before i spend more   this not only helps you show where your money is going now it also puts a constraint on your spending which sounds like most of the problem currently   many of my friends and i make our saved invested money very hard to access so that we ca n't get it immediately like putting it in an account that will require three or four days to get to the purpose of this is to shape your behavior into actions of either increasing your income decreasing your spending or both

normally i 'd say that because of the magic of compound interest balances of high rate cards shoot up rapidly so pay off the high rate cards one by one until they 're all zero in this case though 23 20 19 are close enough that i 'd pay off the card with the highest balance then 2nd highest then 3rd and leave the card for last note that sooner than you think other card companies will send you low rate balance transfer   take one asap and pay it down as much as possible so that when the low introductory rate is over the balance on your now high rate card is low bottom line balances on high interest rate card accumulate incredibly quickly so kill them first one at a time

there is the opportunity cost   let 's say it cost you $ 1000 to buy 0.25 discount over n number of years that saves you let 's say $ 2000 thus your profit is $ 1000 what if you took that $ 1000 and invested it would you have more than $ 2000 after n number of   years obviously answering this question is not easy but you can make some educated guesses for example you can compare the return you 'll likely get from investing in cd or treasury bond a bit more risky is to invest in the stock market but an index fund should be fairly safe and you can easily find the average return over 5 10 year period   for example if your loan is $ 200,000 at 0.25 per year you 'll get $ 500 in savings over 10 years that 's $ 5000 $ 1000 to buy the point you end up with $ 4000   using the calculator on this site i calculated that if you invested in the dow jones industrial average between 2007 and 2017   you total return would have been 111 assuming dividends are reinvested or you would've had a total of $   i 'm not sure how accurate those numbers are but it seems likely that buying points is a pretty good investment if you stay in the house for 10 years or more

it looks like these types of companies have to disclose the health of their accounts to cftc commodity futures trading commission that is the gist i get at least from this article about the traders that lost money due to the swiss removing the franc ’s cap against the euro the article says about the u.s. retail forex brokerage most of ’s retail clients lost money in 2014 according to the company ’s disclosures mandated by the cftc the percentage of losing accounts climbed from 67 percent in the first and second quarters to 68 percent in the third quarter and 70 percent in the fourth quarter side note the swiss national bank abandoned the cap on the currency 's value against the euro in mid january 2015 but above paragraph provides data on ’s retail clients in 2014 it could consequently be concluded that even without freak events such as switzerland removing the franc cap it is more likely for an investor to not make a profit on the forex market this is also in line with what and say in their answers

actually you 're missing the key feature of cdos   most cdos use much to our economic misery ultimately a system call   to simplify this idea i 'll make a two example   suppose i buy mortgages covering a face value of $   because they are subprime if i just put them in a pool and finance them with bonds the rating will be lousy and most investors will shun them at least investors who are safety oriented   what i do is divide them into two tranches   one bond issue is for $ 100,000,000 and another for $   the idea is that any defaulting mortgage comes out of the latter bond issue   i 'll probably keep these bonds the lower   thus buyers of the first issue are safe unless defaults exceed $   then the rating agencies rate the first issue aaa and it gets snapped up by investors   in a strict sense it is basically the entire $ backs up the first bond issue in reality many cdos had multiple tranches with the lowest being retained by the underwriters and the other tranches sold as bonds of various ratings

the two things are materially different point number 1   with a credit card the bank and card network earn a fee every time you spend on your card   you swipe a $ 100 dinner the credit card company makes about $ 3   you pay it back they may not make any interest but they 've made their $ 3   additionally if you have a $ 1,000,000 credit limit you 've only actually borrowed $ 100 which brings me to point number 2    point number 2   a credit limit of $ x is not in any way the same as a loan for $ x.   when you seek a personal loan the lender hands you money in equal amount to your loan less any origination fees that may apply   your loan for $ 8,000 results in $ 8,000 being wired to your account   your credit limit is only a loan when you actually charge something   until then its a simple adjustable risk limit set by the bank 's underwriters point number 3   your credit report contains no income information   it 's up to the lender to determine what sort of risk they 're willing to take   some personal lenders are just fine with stated income and employer contact information   some lenders want to see some pay stubs   some lenders will lend $ x on stated income but wo n't lend $ x+1 without income verification   some will lend the money at a lower interest rate if you do prove your income and employment   it 's all lender specific   credit card issuers are clearly lax on the income verification piece of the equation because of points number 1 and 2 point number 4   if you 're getting a loan for your required mortgage down payment you are a much bigger repayment risk than you realize

if the stock has low liquidity yes there could be times when there are no buyers or sellers at a specific price so if you put a limit order to buy or sell at a price with no other corresponding sellers or buyers then your order may take a while to get executed or it may not be executed at all you can usually tell if a stock has low liquidity by the small size of the average daily volume the lack of order depth and the large size of the gap between bids and offers so if a stock for example has last sale price of $ 0.50 has a highest bid price of $ 0.40 and a lowest offer price of $ and an average daily volume of 10000 share it is likely to be very illiquid so if you try to buy or sell at around the $ 0.50 mark it might take you a long time to buy or sell this stock at this price

the amount you are earning in the savings account is insignificant since you would only have the money in the account for 1 month after purchasing the car   the instant 1.5 cashback or travel mile reward on the other hand can be significant however it is not normal for a car dealership to allow you to put $ 16k on a credit card   the reason is that the fees that the dealer has to pay to process your credit card would be too burdensome   car dealers have a much smaller profit margin on their sales than a typical retail store so if the dealer has to pay 3 or 4 of the sales price in credit card fees it just eats up too much of their profit if the dealer does allow you to put the entire purchase price on a credit card be aware that they have already factored in their processing fees into the price   you might be able to get a better than 1.5 discount by offering to pay with cash instead

let 's say today you buy the bond issued by at let 's say morning the tv says that is going towards default if it happens it wo n't give you back not even the 18 $ you invested you and others that bought the same bond like you will get scared and try to sell the bond but a potential buyer wo n't buy it for 18 $ anymore they will risk maximum couple of bucks therefor the price of your bond tomorrow is worth 2 $ and not 18 anymore bond prices even zero coupon ones do fluctuate like shares but with less i.e. on the same period of time ups and downs are smaller in percentage compared to shares edit geo asked in the comment below what happens to the bond the fed rises the interest it very similar to what i explained above let 's say today you buy the bond just issued by us treasury at today the fed rewards money at 2 and the bond you bought promised you a reward of 2 per year for 10 years even if it 's zero coupon it will give you almost the same reward of one with coupons the only difference is that it will give you all the money back at once that is when the bond expires let 's say morning the tv says that fed decided to rise the interest rates and now on it lends money rewarding a wonderful 4 to investors us treasury will also have to issue bonds at 4 you can obviously keep your bond until expiration and unless us goes default you will get back all your money until the last cent but if you decide to sell your bond you will find out that people wo n't be willing to pay 50 $ anymore because on the market they can now buy the same type of bond for the same period of time 10 years that give them 4 per year and not a poor 2 like yours so people will be willing to pay maximum 40 $ for your bond or less

it 's more complicated than that governments raise money in a number of ways   first they tax economic activity within their borders and for connected companies and individuals   then some governments have actual revenues from state owned enterprises licences patents courts business revenues and so on whatever shortage arises between state expenditure and this income is the deficit which is usually financed through debt government usually issues a bond wikipedia for a list of government bonds of various types some with extremely lengthy maturation dates   these bonds can be purchased both locally and by foreign investment funds   the nature of who buys is important from the wikipedia link you 'll see that most government debt is very highly rated based on the ability of the state to simply raise taxes in order to fund redemption   pension funds are legally bound to only invest in highly rated investment classes and the bulk of bonds may be purchased to support local pensioners a state that defaults on debt will first hit its own most vulnerable citizens   in addition the fall out will result in a cut in ratings   countries like argentina and zimbabwe which have both refused to repay their debts even to the imf are currently unable to raise investment at all   this has a tremendous impact on local economic development so default is out of the question without severe penalties the second part of your question is about paying down the debt   as debts increase more and more of the revenue that a country does earn is spent on servicing debt repayments   sometimes bonds are issued merely to refinance old debt   a country that spends too much on refinancing debt is no different from an individual   less and less money is available to do other things in conclusion governments can neither default nor binge borrow unless they wish to severely limit economic opportunities for their citizens

depends on how the money is invested within the 401k but in general prices move both up and down with a long bias toward up   think of it this way with fund shares priced lower now you are getting shares cheaper than when you entered the plan so this dip is actually working in your favor as long as you are comfortable trusting that long term view and trusting the funds your 401k money is going into believe me it 's even when you 're nearer your target retirement date and a 10 dip may be six figures but it 's all theoretical until you actually start drawing the money back out and you have to learn to accept some volatility as part of the trade off   for getting returns better than bonds

i started with lending club about a year ago   i love it   it has been insightful   off topic but i am in a loan to a guy who make 120 k a year and is regularly late and has a pretty high interest rate   crazy you gain some economies of scale by going with a bigger note   i have $ 100 notes that i get hit for 2 or 3 cents for a fee where $ 25 notes are always a penny   however i do n't think that should be your deciding factor i scale my note purchases based on how much i like the status of the borrower   for example i did $ 100 which is currently my max for a guy with a reasonable loan amount 16 k a stable work history 15 + years a great credit history and a great interest rate   if one of those things were a bit out of whack   i might go $ 50 two $ 25    i prefer 36 month notes really 5 years to get out of debt   it is unlikely to happen imho keep in mind that if you invest $ 100 in a loan then you get one $ 100 note   you ca n't break them up into 4 $ 25 notes   for that reason if you are likely to want to sell the note prematurely keep it at $ 25   the market is greater    i 've had a lot of success using the trading account buying further discounted notes for people who want out of lending club or get spooked by a couple of late payments and a change in billing date    another advantage of using the trading account is you start earning interest day 1   i 've had new notes take a couple of weeks to go through    to summarize there are some other things but that is the main stuff i look at

i am a bit at a loss as to how you can read the same book that inspired warren buffet and take away that trading 600 contracts per month is a way to prosperity   as a fellow engineer i can say with assurance this speculation scheme is doomed to failure   crossing out the word gamble was a mistake    instead you should focus on two things   the first is your core business which is signal processing   work and strive to be the best you can   seek out opportunities to increase your income while keeping your costs low   as an engineer you have an opportunity to earn an above average salary with very low costs second would be to warehouse some of those earning and let others who are good at other things work for you   you may want to read the jack bogle books and seek an asset allocation model   i tend to be more aggressive then he would suggest but that is a matter of preference     you do n't really have the time when you focus on your core business to manage 6 trades a month let alone 600   put your contributions on auto pilot and a surprisingly short time you will have a pile of cash

what you have suggested would work in spain ireland us even italy but not in greece because the last piece of the cycle of money you outlined earlier would be that greek economy would expand and the government would collect revenues   the problem is that public and private projects in greece are very expensive due to strict labor laws a good chunk of any public money would end up in bank accounts outside greece and the resultant building would be of poor quality and little use in summary the greek government would be even more debt the economy would see very little benefit no increase in tax revenue and you would end up with a useless structure   even if greece had n’t joined the euro it would either suffer from inflation or from a crisis similar to this the global economic crisis has made the situation much worse it is not the cause of the crisis at least for greece

you could pay off a portion of the debt and your minimum payments should also go down proportionately   your investment managers may be able to continue making returns in the markets in a sideways and a bear market so you have 24k contributing to your net worth and giving you a negative net worth at best you can bring this down to a negative 25k net worth or you can start and keep using some of the gains from your investment account to supplement your credit payments along with your income this is based on chance that your investment managers can continue making gains compared to paying down 24k and having possibly zero liquid savings now but having more of your salary to start saving and make the lowered minimum payments assuming you do n't borrow more those are the options i 've thought of i do n't see either option being necessarily quicker than the other

i struggle to see the value to this risk from the standpoint of your mother in law   this is not a small amount of money for a single person to lend to a single person ignoring your personal relationship    right now using a blended rate of about 8 and a 5 year payment period your cost on that $ 50,000 is somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 11,000 with a monthly payment around $ using the same monthly payment but paying your mil at 5 you 'll complete the loan about 3.5 months sooner and save about $ 5,000 she will make about $ 6,000 in interest over 5 years against a $ 50,000 outlay alternatively you can just prioritize payments to the more expensive loans   it 's difficult to work out a total cost comparison without your expected payoff timelines and you 're currently paying toward all the loans   i 'm sure a couple hours with a couple of spreadsheets could yield a plan that would net you a savings substantially close to the $ 5,000 you 'd save by risking your mother in law 's money a lot of people think personal lending risk is about the relationship between the people involved but there 's more to it than that it 's not about you and your wife separating it 's not about the awkward dinner and conversations if you lose your job   something might physically happen to you you could become disabled or die   right now that 's an extremely diversified and calculated risk taken by a gigantic lender unless your mother in law is very wealthy this is not nearly enough reward to assume this sort of risk in my opinion   her risk far outpaces your potential five year savings if you wanted to pursue this as a means of paying interest to a family member rather than the bank i 'd only borrow an amount i budgeted and intended to pay within this single year   say $ 10,000 against the highest interest loan

as already noted options contain inherent leverage a multiplier on the profit or loss the amount of leverage is dictated primarily by both the options strike relative to the current share price and the time remaining to expiration options are a far more difficult investment than stocks because they require that you are right on both the direction and the timing of the future price movement with a stock you could choose to buy and hold forever buffett style and even if you are wrong for 5 years your unrealized losses can suddenly become realized profits if the shares finally start to rise 6 years later but with options the profits and losses become very final very quickly as a professional options trader the single best piece of advice i can give to investors in options for the first time is to only purchase significantly itm in the money options for both calls and puts do a web search on in the money options to see what calls or puts qualify   with itm options the leverage is still noticeably better than buying selling the shares outright but you have a much less chance of losing all your premium also by being fairly deep in the money you reduce the constant bleed in value as you wait for the expected move to happen the market moves sideways more than people usually expect to deeply itm options are the ones that options market makers like least to trade in because they offer neither large nor easy premiums and options market makers make their living by selling options to retail investors and other people that want them like you so connect the dots by trading only itm options until you become quite experienced you are minimizing your chances of being the average sucker all else equal some amateur options investors believe that similar benefits could be obtained by purchasing long expiration options like leaps for 1 + years that are not itm like atm or otm options the problem here is that your significant time value is bleeding away slowly every day you wait   with an itm option your intrinsic value is not bleeding out at all only the relatively smaller time value of the option is at risk thus my recommendation to initially deal only in to deeply itm options with expirations of 1 4 months out depending on how you wish to be with your move timing

i ca n't immediately think of a reason to keep your paycheck and spending account separate unless it be because you want to keep your savings in a money market or savings account and you deposit your paycheck into a checking account however i do have one reason from my experience to keep the bulk of your savings away from accounts that you transfer stuff out of   i used to keep all my cash savings in an account from which i transferred money into my brokerage account my paycheck was also deposited there   a couple of years back a state that i have n't lived in since i was a child took $ 40,000 out of my account   the broker mistakenly told the state i lived there and the state made some mistakes about how much tax i would owe   without either one telling me the state helped themselves to my checking account to cover the bill   when i called both acknowledged that they were wrong but it still took a long time many months and lots of letters and threats i was close to paying a lawyer before they returned my money   it was worse because this was my savings for a down payment on a home and having it taken and not returned affected my ability to buy the house i wanted if i had n't had my money in that account they would have tried to garnish my wages and would have immediately stopped their attempt once they found out they were in the wrong now i keep cash savings in an account that i never pay taxes out of and do not use to transfer money directly to any broker or anyone who might give my account number to an inept government

two factors that positively your credit score are the number of open accounts you have in good standing and the average age of the accounts the more accounts you have in good standing the more likely you seem to pay back what you borrow from new creditors the older the average age of the accounts the more you seem like an experienced borrower who has had many years of successful credit activity closing them would lower the total number of accounts in good standing you have and would also likely lower the average account age unless you 've recently opened them to simplify the number of cards you have pick the one or two you would consider cancelling worst rewards benefits highest yearly fee etc and just do n't keep them in your wallet anymore you do n't have to worry about paying them off every month because you do n't buy anything with them and you still get the credit score benefits of having the accounts open

scenario 1 is typically the better description if commercial banks were allowed to simply create money they would n't be in the mess they 're in now in the u.s. the central bank is the federal reserve or fed and is the only entity not the government not the banks not the people that is allowed to create money out of thin air it does this primarily by buying government debt the government spends more than it takes in and so to come up with the deficit it issues bonds the fed buys a certain amount of these bonds and simply prints the money or more realistically authorized the electronic transfer of $ x to the treasury which the government then spends that places money in the hands of corporations and the people who turn around and spend it however long term the interest charges on money borrowed from the fed will actually remove money from the economy the central banks therefore have to constantly make marginal changes to various monetary policy tools they have when the economy is just along if they do nothing then too much of a short term increase in money supply will result in there being too much money which makes an individual monetary unit worth less inflation while making money too hard to get will reduce the rate at which it 's spent reducing gdp and causing recessions the exact scenario you describe is typically seen in cases where the government is running with a balanced budget and the central bank thus ca n't give its new money to the government to spend when it wants to increase the money supply in that situation the central bank instead lowers its lending rate the percentage interest that it will charge on loans made to other banks thereby encouraging those banks to borrow more of the money created by the central bank those banks will then use the money to make loans invest in the market etc etc which puts the money in the economy   in the u.s. the fed does have this tool as well but increases or decreases in the federal funds rate are typically used to influence the rate that banks charge each other to borrow money thus encouraging or discouraging this lending a lowering in the interest rate makes banks more likely to borrow from each other and from the fed but the amount of money created this way is a drop in the bucket compared to current quantitative easing and thus increases the turnover of the existing money in the economy how many times a theoretical individual dollar is spent in a given time period

the $ 3 k includes property tax right it looks like the mortgage alone will be about $ or so if your cal state tax is enough to put you into itemized deductions your mortgage and property tax are a write off and the $ 3k will actually be closer to the $ 2 k you are considering for rent   the wild card as i see it is that your budget is so tight that any unforeseen expenses will be charged as a long time homeowner i know these expenses sometime appear to be high and regular despite their random nature the money earmarked for credit card payments will go a long way to cover the tight budget you seem to have this and your decreasing support makes this look tight but not impossible the condition of the house would make or break the deal in my opinion

the basic equation taught in day one of accounting school is that assets = liabilities + equity my first point was that i looked at the actual financial statements published as of the end of the 2nd quarter 2017 and the total liabilities on their audited balance sheet were like $ 13 billion not $ 20b i do n't know where the author got their numbers from   my second point debt usually needs to be paid on terms agreed upon by the debtor and the including interest so it is important for a business to keep track of what they owe and to whom so they can make timely payments as long as they have the cash on hand to make payments plus whatever interest they owe and the owners are happy with the total return on their investment then it does n't really matter how debt they have on the balance sheet   remember the equation a = there are precisely two ways to finance a business that wants to acquire assets liabilities and/or equity the appropriate level of debt vs equity on a balance sheet varies wildly and totally depends on the industry size of the business cash flow personal preferences of the ceo cfo shareholders et al etc     it gets way more detailed and complicated than that obviously but the point is that looking at debt alone is a meaningless metric this is corporate finance and accounting 101 so you can probably find tons of great articles and videos if you want to learn more

disclosure i am a real estate agent involved with houses to buy sell but much activity in rentals i got a call from a man and his wife looking for an apartment he introduced itself described what they were looking for and then suggested i google his name he said i 'd find that a few weeks back his house burned to the ground and he had no insurance he did n't have enough savings to rebuild and besides needing an apartment had a building lot to sell   insurance against theft may not be at the top of your list do n't keep any cash and keep your possessions to a minimum but a house needs insurance for a bank to give you a mortgage once paid off you have no legal obligation but are playing a dangerous game you are right it 's an odds game if the cost of insurance is .5 the house value and the chance of it burning down is 1 in 300 i made this up you are simply betting it wo n't be yours that burns down   given that for most people a paid off house is their largest asset more value that all other savings combined it 's a risk most would prefer not to take   life insurance is a different matter a person with no dependents has no need for insurance for those who are married or have a loved one or for parents insurance is intended to help survivors bridge the gap for that lost income the 10 20 times income value for insurance is just a recommendation whose need fades away as one approaches independence i do n't believe in insurance as an investment vehicle so this answer is talking strictly term

one common rule of thumb you can probably get 4 or better returns on your investments typical market rate of return is 8 to allow for inflation and off years figure out what kind of income you will want in retirement and divide by 0.04 to get the savings you need to accumulate to support that    this does n't allow for the fact that your needs are also going to increase with inflation you can make a guess at that and use an inflated needs estimate   not sophisticated   not precise but it 's a quick and dirty ballpark estimate and sometimes it 's surprisingly close to what a proper model would say

if you have an increasing population but a steady supply of wealth then there will be a perceived effect of decline   as the average person can afford less and less   if inflation is factored in this effect is accelerated as the value of money is reduced but the availability of that money is as well   in this model those who have tend to accumulate as they produce and those who do not have tend to lose wealth as they consume to fill basic needs at ever increasing prices with a declining source of income exacerbating the effect    if you control your population prevent inflation and deflation and maintain a constant production consumption cycle that is perfectly in balance then you could have that utopian society   but in practice there is waste   that waste makes maintaining that balance impractical at best   people have different desires and motivations   so while that utopian society that you propose seems possible at the theoretical level when solely looking at the mechanics and economics in practice it becomes more about managing the people   which makes the task virtually impossible as for the debt issue that is the strategy of many of the western nations   most of them experienced growth over the last 50 years that was unprecedented in history   many of them simply assumed it would continue indefinitely and failed to plan for a downturn   in addition they planned for the growth and borrowed based on the assumptions   when the growth slowed several continued to use the same projections for their budgeting with the effect of spending money they would not take in   so in a way yes the growth is needed to service the continued growth of debt unless the government issuing that debt is willing to reduce its expenses

in your scenario i would do the following if in the short term something should happen you can always tap into a line of credit or even a cash advance on the credit card   but you should in no way be paying $ 70 a month in interest    assume you want to pay off the credit card over 12 payments you would need to pay about 450 a month which costs 400 in interest   at the end of the year you have $ 5000 in savings and $ 0 debt the alternative is to pay off the credit card right now and put that $ 450 into savings you would have $ 5400 in savings and $ 0 debt i 'm usually the last to recommend a $ 0 safety net but i make an exception in the case of credit card debt    in the worst case you are no worse off than you are now in the best case you 're up about $ 400 at the end of the year

one possibility you may consider is to keep all of your funds in the stocks and shares isa while investing that proportion you wish to keep in cash into a tradeable money market etf a money market etf will give you rates comparable to interest rates on cash and at the same time it will give you instant access subject to normal 3 day settlement of equities    this is not exactly a perfect solution   most money market etfs will pay monthly dividends so depending on your timing you may have to give up some interest   in the worst case if you were to sell the day before going ex dividend then you would be giving up a months interest   in the best case   if you were to sell on the day of going ex dividend you would be giving up no interest

index funds can be a very good way to get into the stock market it 's a lot easier and cheaper to buy a few shares of an index fund than it is to buy a few shares in hundreds of different companies an index fund will also generally charge lower fees than an actively managed mutual fund where the manager tries to pick which stocks to invest for you while the actively managed fund might give you better returns by investing in good companies instead of every company in the index that does n't always work out and the fees can eat away at that advantage stocks on average are expected to yield an annual return of 4 after inflation consider that when you see an expense ratio of 1 index funds should charge you more like or so possibly more if it 's an exotic index the question is what sort of index you 're going to invest in the standard and poor 's 500 s&p 500 is a major index and if you see someone talking about the performance of a mutual fund or investment strategy there 's a good chance they 'll compare it to the return of the s&p 500 moreover there are a variety of index funds and exchange traded funds that offer very good expense ratios e.g. vanguard 's etf charges very cheap you can also find some funds which try to get you exposure to the entire world stock market e.g. vanguard total world stock etf nyse vt an index fund is probably the ideal way to start a portfolio easy and you get a lot of diversification later when you have more money available you can consider adding individual stocks or investing in specific sectors or regions someone else suggested brazil russia indo china or brics having some money invested in that region is n't necessarily a bad idea but putting all or most of your money in that region would be if brics are more of your portfolio then they are of the world economy your portfolio is n't balanced also while these countries are experiencing a lot of economic growth that does n't always mean that the companies that you own stock in are the ones which will benefit small businesses and new ventures may make up a significant part of that growth bond funds are useful when you want to diversify your portfolio so that it 's not all stocks there 's a bunch of portfolio theory built around asset allocation strategies the idea is that you should try to maintain a target mix of assets whatever the market 's doing the basic simplified guideline about investing for retirement says that your portfolio should have your in bonds e.g. a 30-year old should have 30 in bonds a old 50 this helps maintain a balance between the volatility of your portfolio the stock market 's ups and downs and the rate of return you want to earn money when you can but when it 's almost time to spend it you do n't want a sudden stock market crash to wipe it all out bonds help preserve that value but do n't have as nice of a return the other idea behind asset allocation is that if the market changes e.g. your stocks go up a lot while your bonds stagnate you rebalance and buy more bonds if the stock market subsequently crashes you move some of your bond money back into stocks this basically means that you buy low and sell high just by maintaining your asset allocation this is generally more reliable than trying to time the market and move into an asset class before it goes up and move out before it goes down market timing is just speculation you get better returns if you guess right but you get worse returns if you guess wrong commodity funds are useful as another way to diversify your portfolio and can serve as a little bit of protection in case of crisis or inflation you can buy gold silver platinum and palladium etfs on the stock exchanges having a small amount of money in these funds is n't a bad idea but commodities can be subject to violent price swings moreover a bar of gold does n't really earn any money and owning a share of a precious metals etf will incur administrative storage and insurance costs to boot a well run business does earn money assuming you 're saving for the long haul retirement or something several decades off my suggestion for you would be to start by investing most of your money in index funds to match the total world stock market with something like the aforementioned nyse vt for instance a small portion in bonds and a smaller portion in commodity funds for all the negative stuff i 've said about market timing it 's pretty clear that the bond market is very expensive right now and so are the commodities then as you do additional research and determine what sort investments are right for you add new investment money in the places that you think are appropriate stock funds bond funds commodity funds individual stocks sector specific funds actively managed mutual funds et cetera and try to maintain a reasonable asset allocation have fun most of your investment money you should have a separate fund for emergencies and do n't invest money in stocks if you know you 're going need it within the next few years

assuming you are in the us and are an average joe the answer to your question is no investment costs do not reduce your taxable income for the year you make the investment they do factor in to the cost basis of your investment and so will affect your taxes in the year you sell the investment if you want to reduce your taxable income you could contribute the $ 5000 to a traditional ira or 401k assuming you qualify depending on where the account is held you may then be able to use that $ 5k to purchase stock in the company you are interested in the stock would be held in your ira or 401k account and would be subject to more restrictions than a normal brokerage account

behind the scenes mutual funds and etfs are very similar   both can vary widely in purpose and policies which is why understanding the prospectus before investing is so important since both mutual funds and etfs cover a wide range of choices any discussion of management assets or expenses when discussing the differences between the two is inaccurate   mutual funds and etfs can both be either managed or index based   high expense or low expense stock or commodity backed method of investing when you invest in a mutual fund you typically set up an account with the mutual fund company and send your money directly to them   there is often a minimum initial investment required to open your mutual fund account   mutual funds sometimes but not always have a load which is a fee that you pay either when you put money in or take money out an etf is a mutual fund that is traded like a stock   to invest you need a brokerage account that can buy and sell stocks   when you invest you pay a transaction fee just as you would if you purchase a stock   there is n't really a minimum investment required as there is with a traditional mutual fund but you usually need to purchase whole shares of the etf   there is inherently no load with etfs tax treatment mutual funds and etfs are usually taxed the same   however capital gain distributions which are taxable events that occur while you are holding the investment are more common with mutual funds than they are with etfs due to the way that etfs are structured   see fidelity etf versus mutual funds tax efficiency for more details   that having been said in an index fund capital gain distributions are rare anyway due to the low turnover of the fund conclusion when comparing a mutual fund and etf with similar objectives and expenses and deciding which to choose it more often comes down to convenience   if you already have a brokerage account and you are planning on making a one time investment an etf could be more convenient   if on the other hand you have more than the minimum initial investment required and you also plan on making additional regular monthly investments a traditional no load mutual fund account could be more convenient and less expensive

what you are suggesting would be the correct strategy if you knew exactly when the market was going to go back up this is called market timing   since it has been shown that no one can do this consistently the best strategy is to just keep your money where it is   the market tends to make large jumps especially lately   missing just a few of these in a year can greatly impact your returns   it does n't really matter what the market does while you hold investments   the important part is how much you bought for and how much you sold for   this assumes that the reasons that you selected those particular investments are still valid   if this is not the case by all means sell them and pick something that does meet your needs

first it depends on your broker   full service firms will tear you a new one discount brokers may charge   you 'll have to check with your broker on assignment fees theoretically this is the case of the opposite of my answer in this question are underlying assets supposed to be sold bought immediately after being bought sold in call put option your trading strategy reasoning for your covered call notwithstanding in your case as an option writer covering in the money calls you want to hold and pray that your option expires worthless   as i said in the other answer there is always a theoretical premium of option price + exercise price to underlying prices no matter how slight right up until expiration so on that basis it does n't pay to close out the option however there 's a reality that i did n't mention in the other answer if it 's a deep in the money option you can actually put a bid < stock price exercise price trade fee and hope for the best since the market makers rarely bid above stock price exercise price for illiquid options but it 's unlikely that you 'll beat the market makers + hft   they 're systems are too fast i know the philly exchange allows you to put in implied volatility orders but they 're expensive and i could n't tell you if a broker exchange allows for dynamic orders with the equation i specified above but it may be worth a shot to check out however it 's unlikely that such a low order would ever be filled since you 'll at best be lined up with the market makers and it would require a big player dumping all its holdings at once to get to your order if you 're doing a traditional true blue covered call there 's absolutely nothing wrong being assigned except for the tax implications   when your counterparty calls away your underlyings it is a sell for tax purposes if you 're not covering with the underlying but with a more complex spread things could get hairy for you real quick if someone were to exercise on you but that 's always a risk   if your broker is extremely strict they may close the rest of your spread for you at the offer   in illiquid markets that would be a huge percentage loss considering the wide bid ask spreads

when you 're selling something through a provider like craig 's list or newspapers the only thing that may limit your choices is the provider they may refuse your post if it 's against their rules or the law but luckily they usually do n't limit or enforce certain payment choices   these private business providers have the right to do so if they want you do n't need to be their customer they may state their terms for using the service and even refuse service before any payment is made   the fun part is that you may do so as well just remember to state your terms in your post so the prospective buyers are aware of them i 've found it best to put payment and delivery terms in separate lines so that they are easily noticeable for example nice victorian with gold only used once signed by the original author comes with a certificate of authenticity no delivery only cash payments

each trade will cost you nearly $ 10 to buy and then $ 10 to sell with $ 1800 that is literally 1 of your initial investment lost to fees    it would be far wiser for you to learn with play money instead   head over to investopedia and use pretend money          if you 're absolutely fine with losing your $ 1800 than go ahead and jump into some companies you like   i would not recommend that though   put the $ 1800 into one single position that you will hold for a few years and play with pretend money to get a better feel for short term trades

you can not just decide to declare bankruptcy and make the debts go away bankruptcy proceedings under chapter 7 include accounting of all of your assets and income and all of your debts and dividing all your assets and income except for amounts left for your own support between the debtors so if you can i.e. capable pay the debts off there 's nothing magical in bankruptcy that will make it any better for you you will still pay the debts off except that now you will also have the huge and much heavier stain of bankruptcy for chapter 7 the length it stays on the credit report is 10 years not 7 under chapter 13 the procedure is less drastic does n't include complete liquidation of all of your assets but the result is equally not as good you still pay all your debts but they may be reorganized interest rates change durations change some things can still be charged off but not likely if you actually have the capability to pay chapter 13 stays on your credit report for 7 years

yes you must file north carolina and south carolina income tax if you live in one state and work in another the income is potentially taxed twice most states give a credit for taxes paid to the other state often you pay the tax in the state where you worked and then if the tax rate in the state where you live is higher you pay the difference but the details depend on the tax laws of the two states involved i 'm not an expert on either carolina 's tax laws start by getting the forms and instructions from both states and see what they say or if you 're using tax software see if it handles this case if someone else on here knows the specifics of the tax laws for the i gladly yield many states establish reciprocity agreements with other states usually the neighboring states that generally say that if the state you live in and the state you work in are both party to the agreement then you only pay tax in the state you live in this simplifies things a lot unfortunately neither north carolina nor south carolina have such agreements with each other or with any other state

while on the surface it may seem that the warrant you described is trading below intrinsic value there are many reasons why that might not be the case it 's more likely that you are lacking information than having identified a derivative instrument that the market has failed to reasonably price for instance might there be a conversion ratio on the warrants other than the 1:1 ratio that you seem to be assuming sometimes warrant terms are such that multiple warrants are required to buy one share of stock consider the conversion ratio is the number of warrants needed in order to buy    or sell one investment unit therefore if the conversion ratio to    buy stock xyz is this means that the holder needs three warrants    in order to purchase one share usually if the conversion ratio is    high the price of the share will be low and vice versa source conversion ratios are sometimes used so that warrants can be issued on a 1:1 basis to existing stockholders but where the potential number of new shares to be issued is much less conversion ratio is just one such example that could lead to perceived mispricing and there may be other restrictions on exercise warrants are not issued by an options exchange using standardized option contract terms and so warrant terms vary considerably from issuer to issuer even series of warrants from the same issuer may have differing terms always look beyond any warrant quote to find a definitive source of the warrant 's precise terms and read those terms carefully before taking any position

like anything else the price value of gold is driven by supply and demand mining adds about 2 a year to the supply then the question is will the demand in a given year rise by more or less than 2 on average the answer is more that may not be true in any given year and was untrue for   whole decades of the 1980s and 1990s when the price of gold fell steadily   on the other hand demand for gold has risen much more than 2 a year in the 2000s for reasons discussed by others that is seen in the six fold rise in price from about $ 300 an ounce to $ 1800 an ounce over the past ten years

the amount reliability and frequency of dividends paid by an etf other than a stock such as an index or mutual fund is a function of the agreement under which the etf was established by the managing or issuing company or companies and the basket of investments that a share in the fund represents   let 's say you invest in a djia based index fund for instance dow diamonds dia which is traded on several exchanges including nasdaq and amex one share of this fund is currently worth $ jan 22 2014 while the djia itself is $ as of the same time so one share of the etf represents approximately 1 of the index it tracks the etf tracks the index by buying and selling shares of the blue chips proportional to total invested value of the fund to maintain the same weighted percentages of the same stocks that make up the index mcdonald 's for instance has an applied weight that makes the share price of mcd stock roughly 5 of the total djia value and therefore roughly 5 of the price of 100 shares of dia now let 's say mcd issued a dividend to shareholders of say $ .20 per share by buying 100 shares of dia you own through the fund approximately five mcd shares and would theoretically be entitled to $ 1 in dividends however keep in mind that you do not own these shares directly as you would if you spent $ 16k buying the correct percentage of all the shares directly off the exchange you instead own shares in the dia fund basically giving you an interest in some investment bank that maintains a pool of blue chips to back the fund shares whether the fund pays dividends or not depends on the rules under which that fund was set up the investment bank may keep all the dividends itself to cover the expenses inherent in managing the fund paying fund management personnel and floor traders covering losses versus the listed price based on bid ask parity etc or it may pay some percentage of total dividends received from stock holdings however it will virtually never cut you a check in the amount of your proportional holding of an indexed investment as if you held those stocks directly in the case of the dia the fund pays dividends monthly at a yield of virtually identical to the actual weighted djia yield but lower than the per share mean yield of the dji 30 2.78 differences between index yields and etf yields can be reflected in the share price of the etf versus the actual index 100 shares of dia would cost $ versus the actual index price of a delta of $ or from the actual index price that difference can be attributed to many things but fundamentally it 's because owning the dia is not the exact same thing as owning the correct proportion of shares making up the djia however because of what index funds represent this difference is very small because investors expect to get the price for the etf that is inherent in the real time index

unlike others who have answered the question i have done this   here is my experience your mileage and friendship may vary i bought a condo years ago with a longtime childhood friend   we did it for all the reasons you mentioned sick of renting and not building equity were both young single professionals who had the money   the market crashed we have both since married and moved on to own other properties with our spouses   now we rent out the condo as selling in the current market is not doable   it 's not an ideal situation but that is because of the real estate market not who i bought with you need to discuss very openly all of the following scenarios as well as others i ca n't think of right now i am sure if you are n't both 100 in sync with these questions then do not do it i never understand why some people would buy with a girlfriend boyfriend but not a good personal friend   you 're more likely to have a falling out with your significant other then a long time close friend   my advice have honest open conversations about all possible scenarios   if you feel necessary put somethings down into some sort of legal agreement with us it was not and still is n't necessary

the value of debt is that it allows you to profit from the return of equity beyond the amount of actual net equity you own   of course this only works if the cost of borrowing is less than your return on equity   market timing matters a great deal but is n't accounted for in this view   for my answer i would like to hand wave away market timing considerations   one plausible justification is that you could default on your current home and then immediately go buy one of equal value   if you buy a new home of a lesser value due to lack of funds and then prices appreciate then you missed some opportunity cost but probably not $ 100k worth of it moving on here are some helpful assumptions i 'll make i 'll ignore performance of your portfolio after retirement and only seek to optimize f which will be your net worth upon retirement   in either case your current net worth is earning the r2 rate   we can convert this for both your current net worth and future savings using conversion formulas present to future value f = p annual to future value f = s 1 r2 adding these together is sufficient to obtain f in the case that you have no borrowing power   the case where you do not default and maintain your credit score is different due to an initial $ 100k penalty and the amortized value of borrowing power   in a completely theoretical sense you get an effective yield on all borrowed money   the future value will be the following f = a1 one step is missing however which is to convert this value the value of having a good credit score into present value to compare to value of your defaulting p of borrowing power = f = a1 now let 's put some specific values in   say that you can borrow $ 300k with your good credit history and this applies for the next 25 years after which you retire   the borrowing rate is 7 and the time value of money to you is 10   i would then calculate p of borrowing power = $ 58 k < $ 100 k this indicates that it would be more economical to default   of course some people might point out that it will be removed from your record after 7 years   if you plug 7 years instead of 25 years into the equation almost no assumptions about rates will lead to the option of keeping your house being preferable so in a nutshell the value of your credit is probably less than $ 100k in a purely mathematical sense   but there are other factors too   if you do n't have that borrowing ability maybe you would n't be able to borrow money to start the business of your dreams   if you are a rock star entrepreneur then time value of money to you could be 1,000 yield sure then maybe you could make the above numbers work to favor keeping the house   i 've also neglected ethics   as other people point out it would be like stealing from the bank

from irs publication 970 tax benefits for education note qualified tuition programs are also called 529 plans   changing the designated beneficiary there are no income tax consequences if the designated beneficiary of    an account is changed to a member of the beneficiary 's family see    members of the beneficiary 's family earlier   members of the beneficiary 's family for these purposes the beneficiary 's family includes the    beneficiary 's spouse and the following other relatives of the    beneficiary regarding ownership changes rollovers any amount distributed from a qtp is n't taxable if it is rolled over    to another qtp for the benefit of the same beneficiary or for the    benefit of a member of the beneficiary 's family including the    beneficiary 's spouse an amount is rolled over if it is paid to    another qtp within 60 days after the date of the distribution do n't report qualifying rollovers those that meet the above criteria    anywhere on form 1040 or 1040nr these are n't taxable distributions example when aaron graduated from college last year he had $ 5,000 left in his    qtp he wanted to give this money to his younger brother who was in    junior high school in order to avoid paying tax on the distribution    of the amount remaining in his account aaron contributed the same    amount to his brother 's qtp within 60 days of the distribution so it appears that as far as the irs in concerned the rollover could be done to change ownership as long as the beneficiary was in the same family it is possible that there could be a state tax issue with the change of ownership if it changed from a plan in state a to one in state b and state a treated the original contributions as a tax deduction so check the guidelines for the specific 529 plan

the simple answer is that even though mortgages can go for 10 15 20 and 30 year terms in the u.s. they 're typically backed by bonds sold to investors that mature in 10 years which is the standard term for most bonds these bonds in the open market are compared by investors with the 10-year treasury note which is the gold standard for low risk investment the u.s. government has a solid history of always paying its bills though this reputation is being tested in recent years with fights over the debt ceiling and government budgets the savvy investor therefore knows that he or she can make at least the yield from the 10-year t note in that time frame with virtually zero risk anything else on the market is seen as being a higher risk and so investors demand higher yields by making lower bids forcing the issuer to issue more bonds to get the money it needs up front mortgage backed securities are usually in the next tier above t debt in terms of risk when backed by prime rate mortgages they 're typically aaa rated making them available to institutional investors like banks mutual funds etc this forms a balancing act mortgage backed securities issuers typically ca n't get the yield of a t note because no matter how low their risk t debt is lower because one bank does n't have the power to tax the entire u.s. population but they 're almost as good because they 're still very stable low risk debt this bond price and the resulting yield is in turn the baseline for a long term loan by the bank to an individual the bank watching the market and its other bond packages knows what it can get for a package of bonds backed by your mortgage and others with similar credit scores it will therefore take this number add a couple of percentage points to make some money for itself and its stockholders how much the bank can add is controlled by other market forces you 're allowed to shop around for the lowest rate you can get which limits any one bank 's ability to jack up rates and this is the rate you see advertised and hopefully what shows up on your paperwork after you apply

the opposite of an economic bubble is a bubble burst :p jokes aside though an economic bubble occurs when the economy is in bull market mode and asset prices are growing very fast it 's usually measured by ratio 's like price to earnings and the levels of various market indices so the opposite would be when valuations are falling very fast or are very low and price to earnings ratios are low   this condition is usually a recession a recession is a market slowdown generally after a bubble bursts and severe recessions can become depressions if they last long enough great depression 1930s   a bubble is not necessarily negative stock prices usually rise a lot so paper wealth is greatly magnified if you can get out in time you 're golden similarly a recession is n't bad for everyone some investors keep large amounts of cash waiting for recessions so they can buy low sell high for most people however recessions are negative because unemployment increases and some people get fired and the economy slows down asset prices have fallen so their investments are worth less than they used to be on paper and people mainly have to it out until the market starts growing again

well first of all they clawed back 75 of those bonuses paid out so they really did n't get paid that money   second not every executive not even probably more than one executive was even aware this was happening there is one who might have known it was happening but the reality is that a lot of these decisions and plans are implemented several levels down from the executive team the executives do not get involved in day to day shit typically   third those bonuses to executives are paid out in stock options stock options glean their value from the price of the stock if the stock price goes down then their bonuses lose value or become worthless essentially meaning that they get reductions in pay or no bonus when the stock price goes down so if the scandal had no affect on the stock price why would n't they get paid their bonuses the stock is the best indicator of the public 's reaction to the entirety of the bank

determine an investment strategy and that will likely answer this for you different people have different approaches and you need to determine for yourself what buy and sell criteria you want to have again depending on the strategy there can be a wide range here as some may trade index funds though this can backfire in some cases in others there can be a lot of buy and hold if one finds an index fund to hold forever which depending on the strategy is possible returns can vary widely as an index can be everything from buying gold stocks in russia to investing in short term treasuries as there are many different indices as any given market can have an index which could be stocks bonds a combination of the two or something else in some cases so please consider asset allocation types of accounts risk tolerance and time horizon in making decisions or consider using a financial planner to assist in drawing up a plan with allocations and how frequently you want to rebalance as my suggestion here

however is it a risk that they may withhold liquidity in a market panic crash to protect their own capital   two cases exist here one is if you access the direct market then they can not secondly if you are trading in the internal market created by them yes they can do to save their behind but that is open to question they do n't make money on your profit or loss their money comes from you trading so as long as you maintain the required margin in your accounts you can go ahead i had a mail exchange with ig index regarding this and they categorically refuted on this point will their clients be unable to sell at a fair market price in a panic crash no also do cfd providers sometimes make an occasional downward spike to cream off their clients cut loss order   need proof regarding this not saying it can not happen they would n't the people bringing them business without any reason they would be putting their money at risk but you should know their traders are also in the market which might look skimming your money it would be their traders making money in the free market after all google facebook etc also sell your personal data for profit why should n't the cfd firm also since they are market makers what is to prevent them from attempting these tricks are these concerns also valid for forex brokers serving the retail public what you consider as tricks are legitimate use of information to make money

i 'll try to answer using your original example   first let me restate your assumptions slightly modified the mutual fund has note that i say the mutual fund has those gains and losses that 's because they occur inside the mutual fund and not directly to you as a shareholder i use realized gains and losses because the only gains and losses handled this way are those causes by actual asset stock sales within the fund as directed by fund management   changes in the value of fund holdings that are not sold are not included in this as a holder of the fund you learn the values of x y and z after the end of the year when the fund management reports the values   for gains you will also typically see the values reported on your 1099-div under capital gains distributions   for example your 1099-div for year 3 will have the value z for capital gains besides reporting any ordinary dividends in another box    your year 1 1099 will have $ 0 capital gains distributions shown because of the rule you highlighted in bold net realized losses are not distributed   this capital loss however can later be used to the mutual fund holder 's tax advantage   the fund 's internal accounting carries forward the loss and uses it to offset later realized gains   thus your year 2 1099 will have a capital gain distribution of y x not y thus recognizing the loss which occurred thus the loss is taken into account   note that for capital gains you the holder pay no tax in year 1 pay tax in year 2 on y x and pay tax in year 3 on z. all the above is the way it works whether or not you sell the shares immediately after the end of year 3 or you hold the shares for many more years   whenever you do sell the shares you will have a gain or loss but that is different from the fund 's realized losses we have been talking about x y and z

i wrote an article about this a while ago with detailed instructions so i 'll link to it here here 's a about how to use the roth ira loophole and report it properly you do n’t have any traditional rollover ira at all you deposit up to the yearly maximum currently $ 5500 into a traditional ira in your case you re characterized which means you essentially deposited the fact that it lost money may help you later if you have extra amounts in traditional ira you convert your traditional ira to become roth ira $ 5500 change designation from traditional ira to roth ira   you fill irs form 8606 and attach it to your yearly tax return no tax due you have   a fully funded roth ira account if you have amounts in the traditional ira in excess to what you contributed last year it becomes a bit more complicated and you need to prorate see my article for a detailed example on the form 8606 you fill the numbers as they are you deposited to ira 5500 you converted your $ 400 loss is lost unless you have more money in ira from elsewhere if you completely distribute your ira you can deduct the $ 400 on your schedule a if you itemize

i kinda thought it had something to do with losing 2.6 million jobs in 2008 now that 's a lot of revenue gone oh also the bush tax cuts   all the more reason to keep increase spending by 5 10 a year right how about we create an envionment that yields more jobs rather than increasing the taxes of those left because that worked so well for social security originally supported by 5 10 employees per 1 receiving benefits now it 's only supported by 2 employees per 1 receiving ultra sustainable   gt;so almost 10 of our deficit i 'd say that 's a good start    10 of our deficit so the amount of debt interest we 'll pay this year a drop in the bucket either way spending is the real culprit   gt;i do agree we spend way too much on the pentagon but pretty sure that went up a lot without our two unfunded republican wars    and now we 're in a half dozen active and secret conflicts pakistan syria libya all the more reason for obama to immediately remove us from those wars but he has n't he has expanded them and our military costs keep going up it 's not about this is n't the right time to withdrawl it 's about his corporate masters being the same as the bush corporate masters telling him to continue it 's about oil gas and the pipelines and projection of power that comes with it obama has continued and expanded the same policies as bush he can not hide behind well bush was worse he ca n't say that because it is nt true infact we 're killing more peasants in other countries than ever just with military industrial complex built drones   gt;there 's also the unfunded bush medicare prescription drug plan    yep that prevents the government from negotiating prices on prescriptions for a token   $ 10 billion rebate but which will yield $ 10 trillion in revenues over the next 15 years sounds like a great roi while the costs of drugs is in the us   so what did obama do he fed that industry another 30 million new customers without so much as any discount the government purposely stays out of the negotiation of price why because the bill was written by insurance industry and healthcare industry executives like most bills are healthcare is nice but its the cost of healthcare that is the issue if the cost was more reasonable you would nt even need insurance but because they can charge $ 70 for a single pair of rubber gloves when the market price on a box is $ 5 10 we can plainly see the cost of medical care in the us is bloated and we get much less than comparative countries    obama is just like bush he has enriched the various industries the only difference between bush and obama are which industries are enriched you 'll notice i did n't mention enrichment of citizens because they are an afterthought obama only needs to sell the program to citizens he sold it we bought it   gt;you ca n't seriously think putting those people back in charge will lead to good things   no i do n't think republicans or people like bush or romney are necessarily good for us either the thing i have a problem with is that people like you think obama is any different he 's not new president same as the old president new speech writer new cabinet stuffed with corporate cronies and former lobbyists but business as usual and orders from corporate and private masters

i would also consider the following factors how stable is your income   are you in an industry that could vanish in the near future   how long would it take you to replace this income   if you are at risk then you need to consider that your lenders do not care how fast you 've paid down your debt   all the care about is that you make next month 's payment   you need to have liquid reserves available to weather any storm current wisdom is 3 6 months expenses   it may be prudent to put this money in gics or t bills   there may be an early withdrawal penalty but at least you wo n't lose your house obviously this is n't as important when you can actually retire all debt what 's your debt level   if it 's more than 3x income then reducing that number might be the most prudent on another note what is your expected retirement income   iras defer the tax to a later year but if you expect a great pension it is feasible that you might be in a higher tax bracket on retirement when you withdraw the funds than you are now a situation that makes indexed retirement planning counterproductive rich people do n't buy iras

the finance sector is comprised of such enterprises as banks investment funds insurance companies and real estate it is traditionally contrasted with what has been called the real economy because funds created and utilized in this sector produce neither goods services or fixed capital the unproductive nature of transactions can easily be seen in such things as real estate when a company to build a house or whatever its input goes directly to the labor and goods necessary for such a project at its worst the financial sector funds not just for production but for simple acquisition should a company raise the funds to buy an already existing building or the mortgage on same quite obviously nothing is produced same building on day one as when it was owned by another    that of course is an extreme example as are corporate takeovers via private equity in that case the efforts of the financial sector are not just non productive but are often in fact anti productive as they destroy or prevent the use of real factors of production this anti productive action was demonstrated on a massive global scale during the last financial crisis    the basically parasitic nature of the financial sector is n't always so blatant there are some that argue that its services can be valuable to the real economy perhaps but that has to be determined on a case by case examination and while keeping the idea is there a better way to do this in one 's mind

this is probably a very opinion based but anyway my solution to such questions is to have multiple layers of emergency funds i have one amount in a bank account that i do not like to tap but can and do when i need money this is most close to your infrequent but not completely surprising moments of cash need i have a second layer in the form of stocks as i understand that selling stocks should not be done when you need money but when the stock price is good this provides a fairly high barrier to selling it on a whim before i do so especially if the stock price is n't at a local max it would have to be an emergency my third layer is even more fixed investment which i ca n't access with online brokerage the physical aspect makes sure that it has to be a real serious emergency before i turn that into cash if you have such a layered approach the question is not black and white anymore and easier to answer

gt they can be taxed at the long term capital gains rate whereas dividends are subject to a higher tax rate   that 's not true is it i 'm fairly sure they 're taxed at the same rate now buybacks are still better for shareholders though because those who do n't want to sell have the option of just holding the stock with dividends everyone gets a dividend and the associated tax hit whether they want it or not   edit oh right ordinary dividends are taxed as ordinary income qualified dividends are not but are n't qualified dividends the modal type

my theory is that for every stock you buy you should have an exit strategy and follow it   it is too hard to let emotions rule if you let your default strategy be let 's see what happens and emotional investing will almost never serve you well   so before buying a stock set a maximum loss and maximum gain that you will watch for on the stock and when it hits that number sell   at the very least when it hits one of your numbers consciously make a decision that you are effectively buying it again at the current price if you decide to stay in when you do this set a new high and low price and repeat the above strategy

this was a really unusual deal because a fund owned by one of the owners of the company was buying much of the shares seems that maybe someone at the company realized that they could get an ipo for much less than 7 because the bank was n't really doing much work or taking much risk for their cut and that nobody figured to put contingencies for this in a contract because how often does it happen   edit do people even read the articles for these things   you do an ipo where an existing shareholder and company director is buying half the deal that 's not quite the same as doing an ipo where the banks are just selling shares to investors that the banks dig up and when that shareholder decides that he 'd rather not buy his escape is not so much refusing to pay for his shares as it is trying to get the deal pulled   if sues the banks they can turn around and sue saying that this is a backdoor way of getting out of their contract

retirement calculation in general should be based on the amount of money needed per year month and the expected life expectancy life expectancy if calculated to 90 years let 's say indicates that post retirement age 60 yrs your accumulated invested money should generate adequate income to cover your expenses till 90 years the problem in general is not how long you shall live but what would be your expected spending from retirement to end of life expectancy the idea is at the minimum your investments should generate income that is inflation adjusted one way to do this is to consider your monthly expense now i.e. the expense that is absolute minimum for carrying on food electricity water medicines household consumables car petrol insurance servicing entertainment newspaper etc this does not contain the liabilities home loan child 's education other debts it is better to take this amount per family rather than per person and yearly rather than monthly as we tend to miss a lot of yearly expenses this amount that you need today will increase at a compounded annual growth rate cagr of the average inflation for example if today you spend 100 per year in 7 years you will need to spend 200 at 10 inflation now your investments will not increase post your retirement so your current investment needs to do two things 1 give you your yearly requirement 2 grow by a fixed amount so that next year it can give you cagr adjusted returns in general this kind of investment grows by high net amounts initially and slowly the growth decrease the above can be calculated by net present value npv formulae the key is to remember that the money that is invested when you retire should be able to give you inflation adjusted returns to cover your yearly expenses how much money you need depends on your life style expectation and how much return is received depends on the instruments that you invest on as for your question above on the difference between the age of you and your spouse it better to go with the consolidated family requirement and get an idea of how much investment is necessary and provision the same as soon as possible from your as well as your spouse 's income hope this thanks

the hardest part seems to be knowing exactly when to sell the stock   well yes that 's the problem with all stock investing reports come out all the time sometimes even from very smart people with no motivation to lie about expected earnings for this company or for that industry whether those predictions come true is something you will only find out with time what you are considering is using financial information available to you and equally available to the public to make investment choices this is called fundamental analysis that is the analysis of the fundamentals of a business and what it should be worth it forms the basis of how many investment firms decide where to put their money   in a perfectly efficient market all information available to the public is immediately factored into the market price for that company 's stock ie if a bank report states with absolute certainty through leaked documents that coca cola is going to announce 10 revenue growth tomorrow then everyone will immediately buy coca cola stock today and then tomorrow there would be no impact even if pwc is 100 accurate in its predictions if the rest of the market agrees with them then the price at the time of ipo would equal the future value of the cashflows meaning there would be no gain unless results surpassed expectations so what you are proposing is to take one sliver of the information available to the public have you also read all publicly available reports on those businesses and their industries and using that to make a high risk investment are you going to do better than the investment firms that have teams of researchers and years of experience in the investment world you can do quite well by picking individual stocks but you can also lose a lot of money if you do it be aware that there is risk in doing any type of investing there is higher than average risk if you invest in equities the stock market there is higher risk still if you pick individual stocks there is yet even higher risk if you pick small startup companies   there are some specific interesting side elements with your proposal to purchase stock about to have an ipo those are better dealt with in a separate question if you want more information search this site for ipo and you should find a good starting point in short the company about to go public will hire a firm of analysts who will try to calculate the best price the public will accept for an offering of shares stock often goes up after ipo but not always sometimes the company does n't even fill its full ipo order adding a new type of risk to a potential investor that the stock will drop on day 1 consider an analogy outside the investing world   let 's say auto trader magazine prints an article that says all 2015 honda civics are worth $ 15,000 if they have less than 50,000 miles assume you have no particular knowledge about cars if you read this article and you see an ad in the paper the next day for a honda civic with 40k miles should you buy it for $ 14k the answer is not without more research and even if you determine enough about cars to find one for $ 14k that you can reasonably sell for $ 15k there 's a whole world of mechanics out there who buy and sell cars for a living and they have an edge both because they can repair the cars themselves to sell for more and also because they have experience to spot low offers faster than you and if you pick a or a stock that does n't perform even when everyone expected it would then you could lose some serious money as with buying and selling individual stocks there is money to be made from car trading but that money gets made by people who really know what they 're doing people who go in without full information are the ones who lose money in the long run

so some background here when corporations large ones have to deal with tax they generally try to avoid as much tax as possible since there are places that are tax havens where there is less to even no tax on profit a lot of money gets routed there to avoid taxes in other places us or other unfavorable countries the problem with this from an irs government view is that they keep losing millions billions of dollars in money because of this i think the corporate federal tax rate is around 35 and that is without state taxes        unfortunately when you have less and less money at home less investment at home happens corporations stop doing business at home because they have more money somewhere else and it makes sense to move more of the company to where the money is or to more favorable tax locations even worse the corporation might just save its money somewhere else and kill all reinvestment thus the money is effectively dead to the rest of the economy       there is a lot of talk about a one time repatriation tax to allow companies that have dodged their tax burdens to have their money come back to the us and thus can be used locally at 10 instead of 35 since there is a vast amount of cash that would be injected into the us economy the government is hoping this stimulation will help gdp grow taxes grow and help the economy as a whole in reality it will reward corporations that broke the law even though everyone does it and probably just go into savings accounts here in the us and not be the silver bullet to the economy on verge of collapse again

there 's no unique way to split the profit it 's about claims and arguments   i propose the approach based on internal rate of return consider we have a project with cash flow at the beginning at 3 months and + 2300 1000 profit 200 fee + 1500 of initial investments at 1 year the balance looks as follows simple compounding the solution is r = 64 not bad now the value of the investment is + and the value of the second is + at year this gives the shares of and then split the profit according to the shares

the two are closely related a budget is a detailed plan for how to spend expense tracking is a tool to analyze your previous spending performance creating a plan for how to spend your money without any record of your previous spending is an empty promise to yourself that you will never follow up on did i stay within my budget does n't matter i did n't track the spending anyway even if you do plan to track your performance if you have not previously done so you wo n't have a good basis for how much to expect in each category   most people have a general idea of how much they have spent and many budgets are formed based on that general intuition but they are often surprised when they track how every penny is spent and look at the totals from month to month and over years by actually seeing how much has been spent it 's easier to pick the big financial drains and target them for reduction if your desire is more savings for example i know people who keep a close eye on what they spend each month but they do n't allocate money in categories for the next month they do n't perform as well on reducing spending but they often do n't care they feel like they make enough and they save enough so why worry i also know people who create an unrealistic budget each month because they have n't done a good job tracking their previous spending they know what the monthly bills are but they do n't account well for variable or cyclical expenses   like repairs christmas etc both tools are essential for maximizing your own personal finance

well i used to intern at a company finding its not easy there are prospecting tools like and but they are ridiculously expensive around $ 400 a month most advisers find clients through references so you 're going to have to network with cpas law firms and other advisers and get them to send you people what can you offer in return there is also the path of cold calling or setting up a website but those inevitably run into finra problems thus it tends to be a slow process that is built up over time the best thing you can do is create a niche for yourself and cater to it- so for example you can specialize in the retirement planning for certain occupations or under certain conditions however bear in mind wealth advisory is turning into a zero sum industry and software is going to make it even more compressed in the future my firm spent thousands of dollars on marketing and even then 3 5 new clients a year is good progress but these were also large accounts    what is your background

note the op does not state whether the employer sponsored retirement savings are pre tax or post tax such as a roth 401(k the following answer assumes the more common case of a pre tax plan this is a bad idea imho irs pub 970 lists exceptions to the 10 early withdrawal penalty for educational expenses this does n't include as far as i can tell student loan payments so withdrawing from your retirement account would incur both income tax and penalties even if there were an exception you 'd still have to pay income taxes which depending on the amount and your income could be at a higher marginal rate than you are currently paying   if you really want the debt gone as soon as possible why not reduce the amount you contribute to the retirement plan but not below the amount that gets you the maximum employer match and use that money to increase your monthly payments to the student loan note that if you do this you will pay taxes on income that would have been tax deferred in order to save money on interest so there 's still a trade off one more thing rather than rolling over to your new company 's plan you could roll over to a self directed traditional ira

this page from the cra website details the types of investments you can hold in a tfsa you can hold individual shares including etfs traded on any designated stock exchange in addition to the other types of investment you have listed   here is a list of designated stock exchanges provided by the department of finance   as you can see it includes pretty well every major stock exchange in the developed world if your bank 's tfsa only offers mutual funds gics and saving deposits then you need to open a tfsa with a different bank or a stock company with an execution only service that offers tfsa accounts   almost all of the big banks will do this   i use hsbc invest direct and td though my tfsa 's are all with hsbc currently   you will simply provide them with details of your bank account in order to facilitate money transfers tfsa contributions since purchasing foreign shares involves changing your canadian dollars into a foreign currency one thing to watch out for when purchasing foreign shares is the potential for high foreign exchange spreads   they can be excessive in proportion to the investment being made   my experience is that hsbc offers by far the best spreads on fx but you need to exchange a minimum of $ 10,000 in order to obtain a decent spread typically between 0.25 and 0.5   you may also wish to note that you can buy unhedged etfs for the us and european markets on the toronto exchange   this means you are paying next to nothing on the spread though you obviously are still carrying the currency risk   for example an unhedged s&p500 trades under the code bmo unhedged or ishares unhedged in addition it is important to consider that commissions for trades on foreign markets may be much higher than those on a canadian exchange   this is not always the case   hsbc charge me a flat rate of $ for both toronto and new york trades but for london they would charge up to 0.5 depending on the size of the trade   some foreign exchanges carry additional trading costs   for example london has a 0.5 stamp duty on purchases edit one final thing worth mentioning is that in my experience   holding us securities means that you will be required to register with the us tax authorities and with those us exchanges upon which you are trading   this just means fill out a number of different forms which will be provided by your stock broker exchange registrations can be done electronically however us tax authority registration must be submitted in writing   dividends you receive will be net of us withholding taxes   i am not aware of any capital gains reporting requirements to us authorities

i am going to assume your location is the us from what i am seeing it is unlikely you will get a loan other than some government backed thing   you are a poor risk at 7k month you have above average household income   the fact that all of your income is being washed off somewhere is a behavior problem not a mathematical one   for example why do you have a car payment   you should purchase a car for cash failing that given reasonable rent 1100 reasonable car payment 400 insurances 300 other expenses 1000 you should clear at least 4000 per month in cash flow   where is that money going   here tracking spending and budgeting is your friend   figure out the leaks in your budget and fix them by cutting back and perhaps working a second job or somehow earning more you could have a down payment for a home in as little as 10 months   that is not a very long time    similarly we can discuss the grocery store   had you prepared for this moment three years ago you could have bought the store for cash   this would have eliminated a bunch of risk and increase the likelihood of this venture 's success   if you had started this one year ago you could have gone in with a significant down payment   the bank would see this as a good risk if you wanted to borrow the remainder instead the bank sees you as a person as a poor risk   you spend every dime you make without much concern for the future or possible negative events by implication of your question   if you can not handle the cash flows of regular employment well how can you handle the cash flows of a grocery business   it is far more complex and there is far less room for error    so how do you get a loan   i would start with learning on how to manage your personal finance well prior to into the world of business

from the banks point of view the point of a current account like this is to get you as a regular customer they want to be your main bank the bank you interact with the most the bank you turn to first when you need financial products and services the bank whose advertising you see every time you log into online banking or walk into a branch the bank knows that if they just offer the high interest rate or other perks with no strings that people will open the account and dump a bunch of savings in it but wo n't actually move their financial life over their old bank will still be their main bank so they strings like a required minimum deposit a minimum number of direct debits and similar these have minimal effect on people actually using the account as their main current account while being a pain for people trying to game the system of course as you point out it is still possible to game the system but they do n't need to make gaming the system impossible they just need to make it enough that most people wo n't bother

gt 1 funny how you picked the highest estimate for the us and the lowest estimate for the uk   mea it appears average cost for the us is $ blog guides coronary cost my personal family experience with it is $ 50 k though this means the us costs would have to come down by only 80 to be affordable by us families i still strongly disagree that this could be accomplished by deregulation of any kind and that 's not even considering the loss in quality that would likely accompany such a move   if anyone expresses wishful thinking it 's you   sources man sources there is no argument without facts    gt;i live in a country with uh    well then we 're both operating from a position of ignorance i do n't know what it 's like with uh and you do n't know what it 's like without it in that case all i can do is look at the money the us spends vs everyone else and then look at our national health outcomes vs. everyone else e.g. heart health maternity health life span etc america sucks at both    still have the same problems except that you get a hefty tax increase on top and end up shoving 50 60 of your income down the state 's throat in addition   there are a handful of countries that charge that much income tax but the bottom line is that those countries on the whole still spend less on healthcare than the so while that 10 or 15 of your check that goes towards uh sucks remember that if you were in the us you 'd be paying 20 to 30 to an outside company for insurance plus you 'd have to deal with pre existing conditions and finding doctors in network and jumping all the bullshit hurdles americans do on a daily basis without any of the convenience of having one single system to coordinate those resources    so you 're either paying down the government 's throat or your paying twice that down a private company 's throat it sucks either way but uh mitigates how bad it sucks   and one interesting note i thought you were full of shit about paying 60 in taxes but some places actually do charge that articles countries with the highest taxes in the so you could be right but two interesting correlations about those countries is that they all have uh and they all dominate the top spots in the un 's happiest places in the denmark as worlds happiest country un report    do n't underestimate the stress of living as a regular citizen without the benefit of a strong social safety net

this is my opinion as a car nut it depends on what you want out of a car for your situation paying cash want to keep the car long term but also save money i recommend seriously considering a slightly used vehicle maybe 2 or 3 years old or a certified pre owned vehicle reasons much less expensive than a brand new car because the first two years have the biggest depreciation hit cars come with a 4-year warranty so a 3 year old car will still be in warranty yes a certified pre owned car will have a bit of a premium compared to a private party used car but the peace of mind of knowing it 's in good shape is worth the extra cost considering you want to keep it long term consumer reports will have good advice on the best values in used cars

unfortunately not even if the credit card balance is positive i.e. customer has overpaid the credit card account you can not withdraw cash for free as any cash withdrawal is subject to interest even if repaid in full at the end of the month the clarity credit card is one of the best cards for overseas spending as its load free no fees for purchases abroad and it gives near perfect exchange rates if your balance is positive you start at £ 0 then fund that credit card account from your bank account £ 500 you can then spend on your credit card and when your next bill is due at the end of the month they will use that extra £ 500 sitting in your account first and ask for the remainder from you i.e.     scenario 2 it is better in my opinion to set up a direct debit to always clear out the full amount on your credit card that way you have cash in your bank account for emergencies getting £ 500 back from a credit card will take a few days to process as opposed to having the ability to withdraw cash from the 24/7 and once the direct debit is paid automatically at the end of the month there are no fees voila your credit card is almost like a debit card spend on it when you like it gets paid automatically no hassle no worries this approach does take a careful mindset though as you need to know your credit limits and also you need to ensure your bank account has enough to pay off the direct debit at the end of the month otherwise those darn fees will get you and hurt your credit rating for cash spending you will want to either take cash with you check online here for best rates get the money well in advance to avoid fees also in some countries the exchange rate is better there than in the uk google will help you here if you do nt like the idea of carrying large sums of cash with you can use a prepaid card like which is one of the better ones out there the other well known ones are fairfx and travelex cash passport

the general argument put forward by gold lovers is n't that you get the same gold per dollar or dollars per ounce of gold but that you get the same consumable product per ounce of gold in other words the claim is that the inflation adjusted price of gold is more or less constant see link for a chart of gold in 2010 gbp all the way from in 2010 gbp means its an inflation adjusted chart as you can see there is plenty of fluctuation in there but it just so happens that gold is worth about the same now as it was in see link for a series of anecdotes of the buying power of gold and silver going back some 3000 years what this means to you if you think the stock market is volatile and want to de risk your holdings for the next 2 years gold is just as risky if you want to invest some wealth such that it will be worth more in real terms when you take it out in 40 years time than today the stock market has historically given better returns than gold if you want to put money aside and it to not lose value for a few hundred years then gold might be a sensible place to store your wealth as per comment from it might be possible to use gold as a partial hedge against the stock market as the two supposedly have very low correlation

there are several reasons to pay for data instead of using yahoo finance although these reasons do n't necessarily apply to you if you 're only planning to use the data for personal use   yahoo will throttle you if you attempt to download too much data in a short time period you can opt to use the yahoo query language which does provide another interface to their financial data apart from simply downloading the csv files although the rate limit is higher for you may still run into it an api that a paid data provider exposes will likely have higher thresholds   although the reliability varies throughout the site yahoo finance is n't considered the most reliable of sources you ca n't beat free of course but at least for research purposes the center for research in security prices crsp at and wharton is considered the gold standard on the commercial side data providers like bloomberg reuters also enjoy widespread popularity although both the output from and yahoo 's current csv output are fairly standard they wo n't necessarily remain that way a commercial api is basically a contract with the data provider that they wo n't change the format without significant prior notice but it 's reasonable to assume that if yahoo wanted to they could make minor changes to the format and break many commercial applications a change in yahoo 's format would likely break many sites or applications too but their terms of use do state that yahoo may change suspend or any aspect of the yahoo finance modules at any time including the availability of any yahoo finance modules yahoo may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the yahoo finance modules or the yahoo web site without notice or liability if you 're designing a commercial application a paid provider will probably provide technical support for their api   according to yahoo finance 's license terms you ca n't use the data in a commercial application unless you specifically use their badges whatever those are see here in this post a yahoo employee states the finance tos is fairly specific redistribution of data is only    allowed if you are using the badges the team has created otherwise you can use or whatever method to obtain data for    personal use the license itself states that you may not sell lease or the yahoo finance modules or access    or derive income from the use or provision of the yahoo    finance modules whether for direct commercial or monetary gain or    otherwise without yahoo 's prior express written permission in short for personal use yahoo finance is more than adequate for research or commercial purposes a data provider is a better option furthermore many commercial applications require more data than yahoo provides e.g. tick by tick data for equities derivatives futures data on mergers etc which a paid data source will likely provide yahoo is also known for inaccuracies in its financial statements i ca n't find any examples at the moment but i had a professor who enjoyed pointing out flaws in the 10 k 's that he had come across i 've always assumed this is because the data were manually entered although i would assume edgar has some method for automatic retrieval if you want data that are guaranteed to be accurate or at least have a support contract associated with them so you know who to bother if it is n't you 'll need to pay for it

as others have pointed out your bond funds should have short durations preferably not more than about 2 years if you are in a bond fund for the long haul meaning you do not have to draw on your bond fund a short time after interest rates have gone up it is not a big issue the fund 's holdings will eventually turn over into higher interest bearing paper if bonds do go down you might want to add more to the fund(s see my comment on age specific asset allocation below keep in mind that some stocks are interest sensitive for example utility stocks which are used as an income source and their dividends compete with rates on cds which are much safer right now cd rates are very low this could change it 's possible that we may be in an unusually sensitive interest rate period that might have large effects on the stock market yet to be determined the reason is that rates have been so low for such a long time that folks that normally would have obtained income streams from bonds have turned to dividend bearing stocks some believe that recent market rises are due to such people seeking dividends to enhance cash inflows if and emphasis on if this is true we could see a sharp drop in the market as sell offs occur as those who want cash streams move from stocks to ultra safe government insured cds only time will tell if this is going to play out if retirement for you is 15 + years in the future and the market goes down bonds or equities good stuff it 's a buying opportunity in whatever category has dropped most important is to keep an eye on your asset allocation and make sure it is appropriate to your age you did not state the percentages in each category so further discussion is impossible on that topic with more than 15 years to go i personally would be heavily weighted on the equity side mostly mid cap and some small equity funds or etfs in both domestic and international markets as you age shuffle some equities into fixed income bonds cds and the like work up an asset allocation plan start thinking about it now do n't wait

couple things i will admit i was wrong about the total graduates at each of those programs however numbers taper out the lower the program is down to about 250 300 a class also cut each of those numbers down to about 1/2 1/3 and you get the group that 's actually focused on finance many mbas do consulting marketing product development etc nowadays   also i 'm a bit offended by you saying i do n't understand the cfa could n't be more mistaken boss i 'm for l3 in june like you the requirement is only 2 years in an investment decision role this also means a lot of back office risk guys qualify that 's a pretty fungible qualification you do n't have to be a pm to qualify i have a buddy who qualified having done 2 years in fund accounting not exactly sell side er   i 'm also going to guess you 're a trader brokerage cap markets guy if you wanna throw titles around i 'm in a front office role at a bb too and worked at worked on buy side research at a value shop cfa is definitely more desired in sell side markets focused as opposed to ibd where an mba is more useful more strategy focused    the cfa is vital for up on quantitative skills an mba wo n't cover i 'll absolutely give you that but a lot of people fall into the trap of assuming a cfa is their ticket to bigger and better things if you 're working in back office risk management getting a cfa does n't immediately qualify you to do er which is a very common pitfall i see like an mba it teaches everyone how to do the same type of analysis too another reason   the title means less and less    last weekend i had a conversation with a friend of a friend about this very thing he 's sitting for l3 cfa works back office at a very notable hf and expects to be moved up without any indication that he will to research when he 's done i asked his opinions about things like the european situation fiscal cliff and a hard landing in china not only was he not familiar these concepts he did n't even know what hft was the cfa gives you the tools to analyze the impacts of pension liabilities on eps but it still takes a passion about the markets as well as creative analytical judgement to make it to er    my only point is an mba and cfa are very similar in many ways both tend to hold their noses way to high too it 's about what you chose to get out of it and too often people care more about the title than the process which is why they are still stuck in mediocrity after completing the designations    go through a list of the biggest pms in the business most do n't have either mbas or they achieved alpha by not following standard quantitative models but exploring creative and strategic avenues others undervalue while maintaining strict discipline a model is a tool to better describe behavior and understanding of markets it 's not a solution

will buying a flat which generates $ 250 rent per month be a good decision whether investing in real estate is a good decision or not depends on many things including the current and future supply demand for rental units in your particular area there are many questions on this site about this topic and another answer to this question which already addresses many risks associated with owning property though there are also benefits to consider i just want to focus on this point you raised i personally think yes because rent adjusts with inflation and the rise in the price of the property is another benefit could this help me become financially independent in the long run since inflation is getting adjusted in it in my opinion the fact that rental income general adjusts with inflation is a hedge against some types of economic risk not an absolute increase in value first consider buying a house to live in instead of to rent   if you pay off your mortgage before your retire then you have reduced your cost of accommodations to only utilities property taxes and repairs this gives you a relatively known fixed requirement of cash outflows if the value of property goes up by the time you retire it does n't cost you anything extra because you already own your house if the value of property goes down by the time you retire then you do n't save anything because you already own your house if you instead rent your whole life and save money each month instead of paying off a mortgage then when you retire you will have a larger amount of savings which you can use to pay your monthly rental costs each month by the time you retire your cost of accommodations will be the market price for rent at that time if the value of property goes up by the time you retire you will have to pay more on rent if the value of property goes down by the time you retire you will save money on rent you will have larger savings but your cash outflow will be a little bit less certain because you do n't know what the market price for rent will be you can see that because you need to put a roof over your own head just by existing you bear risk of the cost of property rising so buying your own home can be a hedge against that risk this is called a natural hedge where two competing risks can mitigate each other just by existing this does n't mean buying a house is always the right thing to do it is just one piece of the puzzle to comparing the two alternatives see many other threads on buying vs renting on this site or on google now consider buying a house to rent out to other people   in the extreme scenario assume that you do everything you can to buy as much property as possible maybe by the time you retire you own a small apartment building with 11 units where you live in one of them as an example and you have no other savings before owning your own home was among other pros and cons a natural hedge against the risk of your own personal cost of accommodations going up but now the risk of your many rental units is far greater than the risk of your own personal accommodations that is if rent goes up by $ 100 after you retire your rental income goes up by $ 1,000 and your personal cost of accommodations only goes up by $ 100 if rent goes down by $ 50 after you retire your rental income goes down by $ 500 and your personal cost of accommodations only goes down by $ 50 you can see that only investing in rental properties puts you at great risk of fluctuations in the rental market this risk is larger than if you simply bought your own home because at least in that case you are guaranteeing your cost of accommodations which you know you will need to pay one way or another this is why most investment advice suggests that you diversify your investment portfolio that means buying some stocks some bonds etc if you invest to heavily in a single thing then you bear huge risks for that particular market in the case of property each investment is so large that you are often if you invest heavily in it you ca n't just buy a house $ 100 at a time like you could a stock or bond of course my above examples are very simplified i am only trying to suggest the underlying principle not the full complexities of the real estate market note also that there are many types of investments which typically adjust with inflation cost of living real estate is only one of them

two comments on your calculations i worked for many years at a community college ontario canada where i received an annual salary for the contract period sept 1 year n to august 31 year n + 1 for most of that time the system was 26 pay cheques a year one every 14 days payroll made most mandatory deductions union dues pension etc on a monthly basis assigning them to one or the other of the two cheques each month   so there was a fairly large variation in the net amount received in the two cheques   plus there were those two extra cheques each year with very few deductions as in the answer of gregory additionally payroll was smart enough to make the last cheque of the contract year for a slightly odd amount just the correct amount to bring the total gross amount paid to the actual contractual salary evening out any extra days or rounding error they would restart the payment schedule on the second thursday in september

credit scoring has changed recently and the answer to this question will have slightly changed while most points made here are true but now as of july 2017 it is possible having a large available credit balance can negatively effect your credit score directly   vantagescore will now mark a borrower negatively for having    excessively large credit card limits on the theory that the person    could run up a high credit card debt quickly those who have prime    credit scores may be hurt the most since they are most likely to have    multiple cards open but those who like to play the credit card    rewards program points game could be affected as well source

this probably wo n't be a popular answer due to the many number of disadvantaged market participants out there but yes it is possible to distort the markets for securities this way but it is more useful to understand how this works for any market since it is illegal in securities markets where company shares are involves   since you asked about the company apple you should be aware this is a form of market manipulation and is illegal when dealing with securities in any supply and demand market this is possible especially during periods when other market participants are not prevalent now the way to do this usually involves having multiple accounts you control where you are acting as multiple market participants with different brokers etc the most ways to do with involve shell companies w/ brokerage accounts but this is usually to mask illegal behavior in the securities markets where there are consequences for manipulating the shares of securities in other markets this is not necessary because there is no authority prohibiting this kind of trading behavior account b buys from account a account a buys from account b etc the biggest issue is getting all of the accounts capitalized initially the third issue is then actually being able to make a profit from doing this at all because eventually one of your accounts will have all of the shares or whatever and there would still be no way to sell them because there are no other market participants to sell to since you were the only one moving the price therefore this kind of market manipulation is coupled with promotions to attract liquidity to a financial product note the mere fact of a promotion does not mean that illegal trading behavior is occurring but it does usually mean that someone else is selling into the liquidity another way to make this kind of trading behavior profitable is via the derivatives market options contracts are priced solely by the trading price of the underlying asset so even if your multiple account trading could only at best break even when you sell your final holdings basically resetting the price to where it was because you started distorting it this is fine because your real trade is in the options market lets say apple was trading at $ 200 the options contract at the $ 200 strike is a call trading at $ 1 with no intrinsic value you can buy to open several thousand of the $ 200 strike without distorting the shares market at all   then in the shares market you bid up apple to $ 210 now your options contract is trading at $ 11 with $ 10 of intrinsic value so you just made 1000 gain and are able to sell to close those call options then you unwind the rest of your trade and sell your $ 210 apple shares probably for $ 200 or $ or less because there are few market participants that actually valued the shares for that high the real bidders are at $ 200 and lower this is hardly a thing to do so like i mentioned before this is illegal in markets where actual company shares are involved and should not be attempted in stock markets but other markets wo n't have the same prohibitions this is a general inefficiency in capital markets in general and certain derivatives pricing formulas it is important to understand these things if you plan to participate in markets that claim to be fair there is nothing novel about this sort of thing and it is just a problem of allocating enough capital to do so

as others have already pointed out the bank is n't getting your money upfront the cash goes to the dealer and the bank will be financing you a much smaller amount they really do n't have any incentive to give you a better interest rate but it never hurts to ask the more important and question is should you do this keeping in mind that a loan with good credit could be in the 1.8 range average long term returns in the market are over 3x that so by paying upfront you 're trading the opportunity for returns for the ability to save -2 fees

hey nuts i 've been working with blockchain implementation since before you became an armchair investor   blockchain technology is an implementation of security by consensus it can be between 2 people and 100 million bitcoin 's incentive is the mother of all value into this so it has value so you can get value out of it it was never suppose to be industrialized in the way it has been and it 's become an amoral waste of resources further evidence can be found in the fact that bitcoin had no value except as a currency before people started hacking contracts and the like into it is admirable in that it actually has some kind of intent of value built into it but it 's simply not good enough for high demand applications   in a private chain mining does n't operate with an increasing cost it could be done by a single system which is good enough for an internal chain the security comes from the of the chain that is generated which is what everyone subscribed to the chain gains once something is added no amount of hacking a centralized system could change the confirmed blocks an attacker might be able to add a bunch of new blocks but you could with consensus roll back the entire chain    as a simple example a company has several partners who it coordinates exchange rates with they set the value and they want to share that with their partners while keeping an entirely proof history of the set values they start the chain and allow their partners to subscribe to it they can then set their system to add a block every hour which contains the set values now every partner is keeping a consensus based record of what the trading values were when if for whatever reason an audit was required ie say they suspect someone was trading higher lower than they should have they can audit the chain and see exactly what everyone agreed would be the price at the time the exchanges were made if a partner messed with his chain to cover whatever he would be involved in the other 's would refute it it would be exceptionally hard for any single bad actor to alter all the chains   the incentive in a private chain is rolled into business incentives for record keeping they gain value by keeping certain types of records secure in this manor therefore it is worth it to do they do n't need a literal payout to keep their own records secure   this is why companies want to use the blockchain records secured by even loose consensus are more secure than a centralized database but with little to no increase in operation overhead it then further gains value in that it could lead to distributed amp recorder keeping and management   tldr lol you armchair finance guys

to answer your question directly   you can investigate by using google or other means to look up research done in this area   there 's been a bunch of it here 's an example of search terms that returns a wealth of information i 'd especially look for stuff that appears to be academic papers etc and then raid the references section of those   look for stuff published in industry journals such as journal of portfolio management as an example if you want to try out different models yourself and see what works and what does n't this monte carlo simulator might be something you would find useful the basic theory for those that do n't know is that various parts of a larger market do not usually move in perfect but go through cycles one year tech might be hot the next year it 's healthcare   or for an international portfolio one year korea might be doing fantastic only to slow down and have another country perform better the next year     so the idea of re balancing is that since these things tend to be cyclic you can get a higher return if you sell part of a slice that is doing well e.g. sell at the high and invest it in one that is not buy at the low because you do this based on some criteria it helps circumvent the human tendency to hold on to a winner too long how many times have you heard someone say but it 's doing so well why do i want to sell now presuming trends will continue and they will lose out on future gains only to miss the peak and ride the thing down back into mediocrity   depending on the volatility of the specific market and the various slices using re balancing can get you a pretty reasonable lift above the market average for relatively low risk generally the more volatile the market such as say an emerging markets portfolio the more opportunity for lift i looked into this myself a number of years back the i came was that the most effective method was to rebalance based on need rather than time   need is defined as one or more of the slices in your portfolio being more than 8 above or below the average   so you use that as the trigger how you rebalance depends to some degree on if the portfolio is taxable or not   if in a tax deferred account you can simply sell off whatever is above baseline and use it to buy up the stuff that is below    if you are subject to taxes and do n't want to trigger any short term gains then you may have to be more careful in terms of what you sell   alternatively if you are adding funds to the portfolio you can alter how your distribute the new money coming into the portfolio in order to bring up whatever is below the baseline which takes a bit more time but incurs no tax hit   the other question is how will you slice a given market   by company size   by sectors such as tech finance industrial healthcare by geographic regions

in addition to evaluating the business great answer consider the potential payoff if bonds pay off in the 5 10 range the s&p500 has 10.5 you should be expecting a payoff of 15 20 to invest in something riskier than the stock market   that means that if you invest $ 10k then in 5 years you 'll need to get out $ 25 k 20 returns over 5 years    if you get less than this much in 5 years the risk to reward ratio probably rules this out as a good investment

first request that you complete a tax return on this tax return you will complete both the employed and self employed sections this will give you a total income and tax liability you will already have paid some tax via paye but you will have to pay additional tax for any other income for future years there is the option depending on amount to collect extra tax through paye to cover the other earnings if it is likely to be the same for the next few years this may be a better option than paying a lump sum the tax return is now mostly online and not too bad if your affairs are otherwise simple the hardest part will be keeping a good record of your other earnings remember that you have to keep these records for seven years in case hmrc ever want to audit them and it 's a good idea to have a separate account for the income or some other way of easily identifying it

in my opinion it depends on the type of product i would get a warranty for a washing machine or tumble dryer or other product with lots of moving parts that is liable to break down i also take into account my luck the one washing machine i did n't get covered broke down 2 weeks outside the normal warranty period i would not get a warranty for a consumer electronics product like a tv pc or ipod because they devalue so quickly as a rule of thumb if the model you buy today is going to be on sale for the next few years for around the same price and has moving parts it is worth considering a warranty if it will be worth a small percentage of its value because newer faster models come along to replace it do n't bother i would also not get the warranty from the shop i bought the product from you can get warranties for consumer products from specialist third parties that will allow you to cover multiple products for a discount these work out a lot cheaper than the one the shop will give you for example in the uk will cover 3 appliances for £ and 6 for £

marketwatch reports that the 108 strike call option sells for 1.45   down from yesterday if we split the bid and ask you get that is what that contract will likely trade at   the biggest problems with options are commissions and liquidity i have seen a commission as high as $ 45 per trade i have also seen open interest disappear overnight even if you obtain contracts that become worth more than you paid for them you may find that no one wants to pay you what they are worth   track your trade over a few weeks to see how you would have done it is my experience that the only people who make money on options are the brokers

the difference between dividend and growth in mutual funds has to do with the types of stocks the mutual fund invests in typically a company in the early stages are considered growth investments in this phase the company needs to keep most of its profits to reinvest in the business typically once a company gets a significant size the company 's growth prospects are not as good so the company pays some of its profits in the form of a dividend to the shareholders   as far as which is the best buy is totally a personal choice there will be times when one is better then the other most likely you will want to diversify and invest in both types

my opinion would be to sell now i think what valve is attempting to do is lance an bubble up until now you have people purchasing and storing more keys than they 're using in the hope that they 'll maintain or rise in value i.e. the value of a key is greater than the utility of opening a chest   in the coming year there most likely be more players wanting to sell keys for their value than players hoping to open chests so i think you 're going to see a minor crash in the value of the keys

it would be nice if the broker could be instructed to clear out the position for you but in my experience the broker will simply give you the shares that you ca n't afford then freeze your account because you are over your margin limit and issue a margin call this happened to me recently because of a dumb mistake options i paid $ 200 for and expected to expire worthless ended up slightly itm so they were auto exercised on friday for about $ 20k and my account was frozen only able to close positions   by the next monday market news had shifted the stock against me and i had to sell it at a loss of $ 1200 to meet the margin call   this kind of thing is what gives option trading a reputation for danger a supposedly turned into a 6x greater loss   i see no reason to ever exercise i always try to close my positions but these things can happen

if markets are efficient they will be unpredictable   if all past information is already priced into a stock then movement will only occur when new information is introduced   since no one can predict future events stocks will move in an unpredictable way   if markets are inefficient in the short term people should be able to figure out the long term price movements   this does n't seem to be the case   this is why the authoritative book on market efficiency is called a random walk down wall street

i 'm kind of shocked that no formal behavioral modeling has been proposed as an explanation yet one such model would be steep hyperbolic quasi hyperbolic discounting   consumers would rather pay for popcorn later than for an expensive movie ticket now   for instance consumers might when purchasing the ticket see a low value of popcorn and view the ticket price as the whole price because they do not predict purchasing popcorn   then when entering the theater the present value of popcorn is very high and they purchase it   there might therefore be a market for a commitment device such as a theater to make the appropriate decision ex ante   another commitment device that seems to be practiced is when individuals sneak their own popcorn into the theater   they may not actually want the popcorn but by bringing their own they ensure they do not purchase the theater 's

welcome to personal finance and money this answer will depend a lot on what is most important to the buyer for example whether it is important to always be in a newer car to save money or strike a balance between the two there are trade offs and i do n't think there is one right answer for all circumstances leasing leasing does make financial sense for at least two types of people i 'm aware of the company i work for provides company cars to sales executives which we lease we lease because it would n't be appropriate for a salesperson to meet a client in a car that clearly appears used similarly i know people who value being in a newer car all the time and for them leasing makes more financial sense then buying a new car every 2 3 years and selling their old car which is now 2 3 years old and has depreciated significantly they understand that they are paying more to always be able to be in a newer car i used to work with a manager who every time the new model of the car he owned came out would see the car and buy it on the spot even though he already owned last year 's model and he did n't need two cars he just could n't help himself he felt he had to have the new model it 's no use about how he should learn to save money by just being content with what he had in reality if he is going to buy the new model every year no matter what he should lease rather than buy from my experience i would only recommend leasing if you would otherwise be buying a new car on a regular basis and the lease would be less expensive this is probably the most cost effective way to maintain the highest possible quality but would cost much more than buying and holding a new car or buying a value used car i do n't see reliability as much of a factor here since the seller will have a very good idea of how much maintenance will cost but you will pay a premium to be able to pay a fixed cost for maintenance instead of risking a worse than average experience buying new according to edmunds and only a relatively small number of people are ever in the market for a new car at a given point in time while you do pay quite a bit more to own a brand new car instead of the same car that is 2 3 years old there are several reasons i 'm aware of why people buy new cars number 4 is probably the biggest reason and many people are willing to pay for the certainty of knowing that the miles are correct the parts are new the car is in good working condition etc additionally some makes of cars have much higher resale values than others such as meaning that there is n't as large of a drop in price between a new car and a used car many people consider buying a new car the best way to ensure they get the best reliability since they know the initial condition of the car and can care for it meticulously from that point on this can especially make sense when the buyer intends to keep the car for the like of the car as the buyer will then benefit from having no car payments once it is paid off buying used buying a used car is the most affordable option but for a given quality of car the reliability can be a significant potential pitfall it can be very difficult for a non professional to tell whether they are getting a good value additionally it is hard for an owner who wants to sell a used car in excellent condition to get the true value of the car and much easier for an unscrupulous seller to to get the market price by selling to an unaware buyer the lemons problem in economics you could buy an inspected car with a limited warranty from a retail seller like carmax or a dealership but you often pay a significant premium that cancels out much of the biggest reason to buy used saving money however there is an opportunity to save money when buying used if you 're willing to compromise on the condition of the car if you do n't care whether a car has hail damage for example or if you are able to wait until you find a motivated distressed seller who needs to sell quickly and is willing to sell at a discount if cost is your primary priority buying a used car is likely the best option but i would recommend the following in all circumstances if the seller is n't willing to offer both of these i would walk away when buying used you will also need to consider maintenance which will vary significantly based on the make and model of the car as well as the condition which is another risk you need to be willing to take on if you choose to buy used

i would n't focus too much on dividends itself at the end of the day what matters is total gain because you can convert capital gain into income by selling your assets they have different tax implications but generally capital gains tend to be more tax efficient     i think the more important question is how much volatility you can tolerate since your investment horizon is short your risk tolerance is low as in if you suddenly get much lower income than you planned from your investment you 'll be in trouble you probably want assets that have low volatility    to achieve that i 'd consider the following if i were you tl;dr if i were you i 'd just hold a general investment portfolio with a lower risk profile rather than focusing on dividend generating assets

canadian here the us is our biggest customer so we were impacted economically i expected that within a year or two of the us housing collapse we would also be hit but something else happened when the us dropped interest rates like a stone we were also forced to drop interest rates this meant that suddenly money was being handed out for very very cheap so cheap it was almost free if you had a decent job and good credit the housing market here for a brief moment and then continued climbing it never stopped until some new rules were implemented aimed mostly at foreign buyers and investors and put in place this year it appears however that this current drop in prices may be a temporary dip the average cost of a home in toronto is still around $ 1 m cad and our real estate is still among the most expensive in the world if you look at how much we pay compared to our incomes   in some places houses have basically tripled over the past decade   my point here is that canadian home owners were not impacted negatively by the 2008 crisis in fact once the free money started flowing and prices went up accordingly canadian home owners were enriched as a direct result of the 2008 us housing crisis the situation is clearly unsustainable and the market is irrational it 's easy to say that we are in a bubble but it is   impossible to tell when it will crash in canada it 's harder to walk away from mortgage debt if you 're underwater on your home and the bank forecloses on you and sells the house for less than you owe you still owe the bank the remainder of the money in most provinces

there are way too many details missing to be able to give you an accurate answer and it would be too localized in terms of time location anyway the rules change every year and your local taxes make the answer useless to other people instead here 's how to figure out the answer for yourself use a tax estimate calculator to get a ballpark figure and keep in mind that these only provide estimates because there are still a lot of variables that are only considered when you 're actually filling out your real tax return there are a number of calculators if you search for something like tax estimator calculator some are more sophisticated than others fair warning i used several of these and they told me a range of $ 2k $ 25k worth of taxes owed for a situation like yours here 's an estimator from turbotax it 's handy because it lets you enter business income when i plug in $ 140 k $ 70 40 hours 50 weeks for business income in 2010 married filing jointly no spouse income and 4 dependents i get $ 30 k owed in federal taxes that does n't include local taxes any itemized deductions you might be eligible for ira deductions etc you may also be able to claim some expenses as business deductions that will reduce your taxable business income so you 'd net $ 110 k after taxes or about $ $ 110k 50 40 of course you could get an answer from the calculator and congress could change the rules through the year you might come out better or worse depending on the nature of the rule changes that 's why i stress that it 's an estimate if you take the job do n't forget to make estimated tax payments edit some additional info if you plan on doing this on an ongoing basis i.e. you are going into business as a contractor for this line of work there are some tax shelters that you can take advantage of most of these wo n't be worth doing if you are only going to be doing contract work for a short period of time 1 2 years these may or may not all be applicable to you and do your research into these areas before diving in i 'm just scratching the surface in the notes below

i think the key point that 's making the other commenters misunderstand each other here is the concept of deductions i can only speak for the uk but that 's only a concept that business owners would understand in this country   for things like child credits or low income tax credits we do n't get paid them at the end of the tax year but into our bank accounts every couple of weeks all year round therefore we have nothing to deduct if we work for a company and have business expenses then the company pays for them if we make interest on our savings the bank pays it for us we make money at our jobs and the employer works out what taxes and national insurance we owe based on a tax code that the government works out for us annually which we can challenge   to be fair it 's not like we 're free from bureaucracy if we want to claim these benefits there are often lots of forms if you want child benefit or disability allowances for instance we just apply as soon as we 're eligible rather than waiting to get a lump sum rebate so it appears to be a very different system and neither is inherently better than the other though i 'm personally glad i do n't usually have to fill in a big tax return myself which i only did one year when i was self employed i 'd be interested to know since google has let me down which countries use the american system and which the british or czech

it depends an adr might be exposed to a larger market let 's say american with more volume and thus lower spreads and thus cheaper but it can also be the other way around that the adr serves a smaller market than the home market i would go for the largest market with the most volume so it 's quicker and cheaper to buy sell often adr has less shares meaning that the availability is lower and the prices higher more expensive this is often the case with asian stocks where governments try to limit their company 's exposure to foreigners as a general rule i would buy the home stock instead of adr from a tax standpoint it 's also easier to comply with local laws your local accountant will be more familiar dealing with local stocks
