you seem to be assuming that etfs must all work like the more traditional closed end funds where the market price per share tends based on supply and demand to significantly deviate from the underlying net asset value per share the assumption is simplistic what are traditionally referred to as closed end funds cefs where unit creation and redemption are very tightly controlled have been around for a long time and yes they do often trade at a premium or discount to nav because the quantity is inflexible yet what is generally meant when the label etf is used despite cefs also being both exchange traded and funds are those securities which are not just exchange traded and funds but also typically have two specific characteristics a that they are based on some published index and b that a mechanism exists for shares to be created or redeemed by large market participants these characteristics facilitate efficient pricing through arbitrage essentially when large market participants notice the price of an etf diverging from the value of the shares held by the fund new units of the etf can get created or redeemed in bulk the divergence quickly as these participants buy or sell etf units to capture the difference so the persistent premium sometimes dear or discount sometimes deep one can easily witness in the cef universe tend not to occur with the typical etf much of the time prices for etfs will tend to be very close to their net asset value however it is n't always the case so proceed with some caution anyway both cef and etf providers generally publish information about their funds online you will want to find out what is the underlying net asset value nav per share and then you can determine if the market price trades at a premium or a discount to nav assuming little difference in an etf 's price vs. its nav the more interesting question to ask about an etf then becomes whether the nav itself is a bargain or not that means you 'll need to be more concerned with what stocks are in the index the fund tracks and whether those stocks are a bargain or not at their current prices i.e. the etf is a basket so look at each thing in the basket of course most people buy etfs because they do n't want to do this kind of analysis and are happy with market average returns even so sector based etfs are often used by traders to buy or sell entire sectors that may be undervalued or overvalued

thank you for your service   my first suggestion since your car is a planned for the near future is keep that amount in savings and just pay cash there are plenty of attractive offers to entice you to finance your vehicle but there really is no compelling reason to do it considering the savings you have   second i would keep an additional portion of savings as a rainy day emergency fund how much is based mostly on what you feel comfortable with the number of possible emergencies that can come up is limited and your expenses are limited which is normal given your age this fund might be for something such as emergency travel for a sick family member cover a deductible for an auto accident whatever unforseen event might occur hence the name emergency fund what investments you are comfortable with will be determined by risk tolerance while in the military individual stocks that are aggressive risky investments may not be a good idea because of the extra attention they require and you ca n't really babysit a portfolio while deployed but there are many good low or no cost mutual funds or etfs that you could get into   i would look into setting up a recurring purchase with a set dollar amount monthly so you will continue to accumulate whatever option you are investing in regularly even if you are deployed which fund or etf you pick will depend on your goals and risk tolerance but you could very easily pick several for diversity good luck and thank you again for your service

you 're paying 5.2 interest on the $ 115 k 500 12 115,000 100 but the amount you pay back is not $ 115 k but 75 of the property value at sale is that right a mortgage would have cost about half that rate and the balloon payment would have been fixed you would pay back $ 115 k at maturity plus you could have sold it whenever you liked as said if you consider it to be rent then the situation looks different but the point of buying a house is to avoid paying useless rent build equity and hopefully make a capital gain i 'd speak to a lawyer possibly an accountant regarding the numbers

someone i forget who did a study on classifying total return by the dividend profiles in descending order by category the results were as follows 1 growing dividends these tend to be moderate say a year in today 's markets because their dividends are starting from a low level the growth of dividends is much higher than stocks in the next category 2 flat dividends these tend to be higher 5 and up but growing not at all like interest on bonds or very slowly less than a year 3 no dividends a neutral posture 4 dividend cutters just bad news

the deferral for the 401k means that you 're not collecting your pay immediately but instead diverting it to a retirement account roth 401k in this case this article defines deferral well what is the difference between a regular 401(k deferral pre tax and a roth 401(k deferral   under either a regular 401(k deferral or a roth 401(k deferral you    make a deferral contribution by electing to set   aside part of your    pay by either a certain percentage or a certain dollar amount   for    a regular 401(k deferral the   taxable wages on your w-2 are reduced    by the deferral contribution therefore you pay less current income    tax    however you will eventually pay tax on these contributions and    earnings when the plan distributes the regular   401(k deferrals and    earnings to you   the result is that the tax on the regular 401(k    deferrals and earnings is only   postponed   a roth 401(k deferral is an after tax contribution which   means you    must pay current income tax on the deferral    since you have already    paid tax on the deferral you wo n’t pay tax on it again when you    receive a distribution of   your roth 401(k deferral   in addition if    you satisfy distribution conditions then you wo n’t have to    pay tax   on the earnings either   this means   that the distribution of    the roth 401(k earnings can be tax free not just tax   postponed traditionally this deferred compensation typically was directed to a 401k but now that roth 401k is another available option deferred compensation can be directed there as well

you can not even if your children actually have that money your fiduciary duty is to them not to yourself you can not gift away money they own for your own purposes they have to want to gift it away since it belongs to them i doubt they do or they should since you have to have their best interests in mind you should n't allow them gift away such amounts even if they 're willing to doing otherwise will be a criminal act on your behalf embezzlement breach of fiduciary duty do talk to an attorney of course since i 'm not but that is my understanding of things if your kids do n't actually have the money then they can obviously not gift it so claiming that they did would be a tax fraud

you pay taxes on capital gains when you realize your gains by selling the investment property   also in the us taxes on capital gains are computed at special rates depending on your current income level and so when you realize your gains two years from now you will pay taxes on the gains at the special rate then applicable to your income level for the year of sale remember also that the us congress   can change the tax laws at any time between now and the time you sell your stocks and so the rates you are looking at now may have changed too

wikipedia talks about the chinese currency scholarly studies suggest that the yuan is undervalued on the basis of purchasing power parity analysis so despite it appearing cheaper due to the official exchange rate the price in china might actually be fair there are also restrictions on foreign exchange purportedly to prevent inflows of hot money which in concert with any other legal obstacles to owning or trading on the chinese exchange may also explain why the high frequency traders are n't tripping over each other to arbitrage away the difference

i think you need to understand the options better before you go around calling anything worthless   $ 11k in a 1 savings account gets you just over $ 100 each year   obviously you 're not buying with your returns but it 's $ 100 more than your checking account will pay you   and you 're guaranteed to get your money back i think a cd ladder is a great way to store your emergency fund   the interest rate on a cd is typically a bit better than a regular savings account though the money is locked away and while we seem to be on the cusp of a rate increase it might not be the best time to put the money in jail   generally there is some sort of fee or lost interest from cashing a cd early   you 're still guaranteed to get your money back stock trading is probably a terrible idea   if you want some market exposure i 'd take half of the money and buy a low expense s&p etf i would n't put my whole savings if i were you or if i were me   many large brokers have an s&p etf option that you can generally buy with no commission and no loads   vanguard is a great option voo schwab has an s&p mutual fund and there are others   actively trading individual stocks is a great way to let commissions and fees erode your account   there are some startup alternatives with lower fees but personally i would stay away from individual stock picking unless you are in school for finance and have some interest in paying attention and you 're ready to possibly never see the money again   you 're not guaranteed to get your money back there are also money market accounts   these will typically pay some interest based on exposing your funds to some risk   it can be a bit better return than a savings account but i probably would n't bother an ira roth and traditional is just an account wrapper that offers certain tax benefits while placing certain restrictions on the use of some or all of the money until you reach retirement age   as a college student you should probably be more concerned about an emergency fund or traveling than retirement savings though some here may disagree with me   with your ira you can buy cds or annuities or stocks and etfs or any other kind of security   depending on what you buy inside the ira you might not be guaranteed to get your money back first you need to figure out what you 'd like to use the money for   then you need to determine when you 'd need the money for that use   then you need to determine if you can sleep at night while your stock account fluctuates a few percent each day   if you ca n't or you do n't have answers for these questions a savings account is a really low friction low risk place store money and combat inflation while you come up with answers for those questions

but in the debt payoff first scenario i 'd be wiping out my debt in    two years it would take several more years if i were to just pay the    minimums and put the extra money toward investing instead right the idea is that in 2 years you are likely to have more in the savings stock account than you owe on the loan but the range of returns for x years has a smaller standard deviation the greater x is e.g. any year has about a 1 in 3 chance of being negative a 10 year period had a negative return -1 cagr in the recently but the 15 year return even around that decade would have been successful jan 1 96 dec 31 2010 returned cagr jan 1 2001 dec 31 2015 returned cagr   this tells you that the time frame is as important as your sleep factor your 2 years i 'd just kill the loans a 10 15 year horizon i 'd ask how you feel about that debt the cost of going after a potential higher return may not be worth the risk to many for some it 's fine i retired with a mortgage still in place but the money in my 401(k that could have paid off the mortgage is now about twice the remaining balance so i sleep like a baby   in the end i 'm a fan of investing for the long term vs paying off low rate debt but it 's a choice based on the individual

is it equity or debt understanding the exact nature of one 's investment equity vs. debt is critical when one invests money in a company presumably incorporated or limited by buying some or all of it as opposed to lending money to the company then one ends up owning equity shares or stock in the company in such a situation one is a shareholder not a creditor as a shareholder one is not generally owed a money debt just by having acquired an ownership stake in the company shareholders with company equity generally do n't get to treat money received from the company as repayment of a loan unless they also made a loan to the company and the payment is designated by the company as a loan repayment rather shareholders can receive cash from a company through one of the following sources loan repayment is n't one of those options it 's only an option if one made a loan in the first place anyway each of those ways of receiving money based on one 's shares in a company has distinct tax implications not just for the shareholder but for the company as well you should consult with a tax professional about the most effective way for you to repatriate money from your investment considering the company is established overseas you may want to find somebody with the appropriate expertise

can you afford to lose the $ 2200 if not the answer is do n't buy the stock no one can tell you if a stock will continue to go up but the general rule is that the more hype there is on a stock the more likely it is that it 's reached a top and is due for a downward correction soon also note that the more expectation there is for a company the more negatively the market will react if the company 's earnings report comes in even slightly below expectation or if the company hints at a slowdown in the future if that buyback does n't happen you mentioned expect the stock to drop a lot only a really positive surprise news announcement will make it continue to rise on earnings day if you really want to buy this stock my advice would be to learn about chart patterns and other basic technical analysis to have at least some idea of whether the stock is due for a correction soon if you see it grow in a hockey stick shape upward it probably is

in the us you are not required to have a corporation to use business expenses to offset your income the technical term you need is deducting business expenses and in matters of taxes it 's usually best to go straight to the horse 's mouth the irs 's explanations deducting business expenses   business expenses are the cost of carrying    on a trade or business these expenses are usually deductible if the    business operates to make a profit   what can i deduct cost of goods    sold capital expenses personal versus business expenses business use    of your home business use of your car other types of business expenses none of this requires any special incorporation or tax arrangements and are a normal part of operating a business   however there is a bit of a problem with your scenario you said you invested into a business but you mentioned buying specific things for the business which is not generally how one accounts for investment if you are not an owner operator of the business then the scenario is not so straight forward as you ca n't simply claim someone else 's business expenses as your own because you invested in it investments are taxed differently than expenses and based upon your word choices i 'm concerned that you could be getting yourself into a bit of a pickle i would strongly advise you to speak with a professional such as a certified public accountant cpa to go over your current arrangement and advise you on how you should be structuring your ongoing investment into this shared business if you are investing you should be receiving equity to reflect your ownership or stock in the company etc and investments of this sort generally can not be deducted as an expense on your taxes it 's just an investment the same as buying stock or cds if you are just buying things for someone else 's benefit it 's possible that this could be looked upon as a personal gift and you may be in a legal position as well where the money is indeed just a gift and gifts of this sort are n't deductible either   depending on how this is all structured it 's possible that you should both consider a different form of legal organization such as a formal corporation or at least an official business partnership a cpa and an appropriate business attorney should be able to advise you for a nominal few hundred dollars at most fee if a new legal structure is advisable you can potentially do the work yourself for a few hundred dollars or pay to have it done especially if the situation is more complex for a few hundred to a few thousand that 's a lot less than you 'd be on the hook for if this business is being accounted for improperly or if either of your tax returns are being reported improperly

yeah the 12 assumption is divorced from reality   that is a full 5 higher than the real return on the s&p for the last sixty years but buying a used car rather than borrowing for a new one is solid gold advice   it may take more iterations to get to the nice car because of things like taxes transaction costs repairs etc but staying out of debt or saving up as much as possible to get a reliable car is excellent advice

this is the best tl;dr i could make the rich hate inflation because reduced by 78 i 'm a bot gt so given an outstanding stock of trillions of dollars in fixed interest loans bonds an extra point of inflation should transfer tens of or hundreds of billions of dollars a year in real buying power from creditors to debtors   gt while the 20 certainly have debts they owe them mostly to themselves as bank shareholders so debtors don&amp;#039;t benefit from the cheaper payback caused by inflation it&amp;#039;s a wash   gt it&amp;#039;s roughly 3 of the annual income from capital and only $ 6,000 a year for each of the 20 million households in the top 20 but you can be quite sure that that number is at least one order of magnitude larger for households in the top if the top 1,000 or 10,000 households perceive themselves as losing say $ 600,000 a year in real buying power for each point of inflation are you curious why they hate inflation    extended summary**](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr | faq](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr comments/31b9fm faq_autotldr_bot/ version 1.65 tl;drs so far | feedback](http://np.reddit.com message compose?to=%23autotldr pm 's and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome | top keywords bank**^#2 year**^#3

with me and my wife coming from different countries and us both living in a non native country we have very little clue where we will eventually settle down the answer depends on where you reside currently tax rules and ability to move funds as well as where you plan to settle down and the tax rules there from what i understand once you eventually retire and take an annuity from your pension you are then taxed on it as income anyway yes and no for example if you move from us to india stay in india for 7 years you then move your retirement funds from us to india the entire amount would be taxable in india but would this freedom would come with significant costs in terms of savings at retirement the cost would be hard to predict it depends on the tax treatments in the respective countries on the retirement kitty   it also depends on whether the country you are staying in will allow complete withdrawal and transfer of retirement funds without penalty

a traditional bank is not likely to give you a loan if you have no source of income credit card application forms also ask for your current income level and may reject you based on not having a job you might want to make a list of income and expenses and look closely at which expenses can be reduced or eliminated use 6 months of your actual bills to calculate this list also make a list of your assets and liabilities a sheet that lists income expenses and assets liabilities is called a financial statement this is the most basic tool you 'll need to get your expenses under control there are many other options for raising capital to pay for your monthly expenses sell off your possessions that you no longer need or ca n't afford ask for short term loan help from family and friends   advertise for short term loan help on websites such as start a part time business doing something that you like and people need tutoring dog walking photography you make the list and pick from it look into unemployment insurance apply as soon as you are out of work the folks at the unemployment office are willing to answer all your questions and help you get what you need dip into your retirement fund to reduce your expenses here are a few things you may not have considered if you own your home make an appointment with your bank to discuss of your mortgage payments the bank will be more interested in helping you before you start missing payments than after depending on how much equity you have in your home you may be able to significantly reduce payments by extending the life of the mortgage your banker will be impressed if you can bring them a balance sheet that shows your assets liabilities income and expenses    as above for car payments as well call your phone cable credit card and internet service providers and tell them you want to cancel your service this will immediately connect you to customer retention let them know that you are having a hard time paying your bill and will either have to negotiate a lower payment or cancel the service this tactic can significantly reduce your payments when you have your new job there are some things you can do to make sure this does n't happen again set aside 10 of your income in a savings account have it automatically deducted from your income at source if you can 75 of americans are 4 weeks away from bankruptcy you can avoid this by forcing yourself to save enough to manage your household finances for 3 6 months a year is better if you own your own home take out a line of credit against it based on the available equity your bank can help you with that it wo n't cost you anything as long as you do n't use it this is emergency money do not use it for vacations or car repairs there will always be little emergencies in life this line of credit is not for that   pay off your credit cards and loans most expensive rate first use 10 of your income to do this when the first one is paid off use the 10 plus the interest you are now saving to pay off the next most expensive card loan create a budget you can stick to you can find a great budget calculator here note i have no affiliation with the above mentioned site and have a great respect for this woman 's ability to teach people about how to handle money

nothing will happen it will not affect your credit score you are not in trouble   assuming that you did n't already agree to a purchase contract you are not obligated to purchase simply because you had a pre approval credit check done however even if you did since they are n't shipping yet you could probably cancel if you are in doubt talk to customer service to ensure that they are n't planning on shipping one to you   they did check your credit report known as a hard pull and this does temporarily affect your credit score however it affects it the same whether you complete the purchase or not if you have another credit check done with another seller it will result in another hard pull affecting your credit score a little more but i would n't worry about a few hard pulls if you need to do some shopping just do n't go overboard and you 'll be fine

i wrote a detailed article on tax loss harvesting to show the impact on returns   for my example i showed a person in the 15 bracket in years with no loss they trade to capture gains at 0 long term rate thus bumping their basis up in years with losses they tax harvest for a 15 effective rebate on that loss   i showed how for the lost decade 2000 2009 a buy and hold would have returned -1 cagr but the tax loss would have gained 1 just 1 for the decade not cagr ending the decade with no loss   as one 's portfolio grows the math changes you can only take $ 3000 capital loss against ordinary income and my example relies on the difference between taking a gain for free but using a loss to offset income note the higher earner would take gains at 15 but losses at 25 but only for the relatively small portfolio the benefit for them is to use loss harvesting to offset gains less so for ordinary income   as the other answer state wealthfront can aid you to do this with no math on your part

yes it is safe we have been doing it for years we prefer our tenants to make their rent payments in this manner in fact we prefer that they set up an automatic payment for the rent either through their online banking or through their bank directly apart from getting your rent on time this method also has the added benefit of both parties having their own records of rent payments through their bank statements in case there is a dispute about the rent sometime down the track having a separate bank account just for the rent does make sense as well it makes it easier for you to check if rent has come in it makes it easier if you need to compare your statement without having to highlight all the rent payments amongst all other payments you might not want to show your other incomes and spending habits to others and you can withdraw the rents to your other account which might offer higher interest after it has come in leaving a small balance most of the time in your rent account

you can in theory have the stock price go up without any trading actually occurring it depends on how the price is quoted the stock price is not always quoted as the last price someone paid for it it can also be quoted as the ask price which is the price a seller is willing to sell at and the price you d pay if you bought at market if i am a seller i can raise the asking price at any time and if there are no other sellers or at least none that are selling lower than me it would look like the price is going up because it is it now costs more to buy it but no trading has actually occurred

yes you can do what you are contemplating doing and it works quite well just do n't get the university 's payroll office too by going in each june july august and september to adjust your payroll withholding do it at the end of the summer when perhaps most of your contract income for the year has already been received and you have a fairly good estimate for what your tax bill will be for the coming year do n't forget to include social security and medicare taxes both employee 's share as well as employer 's share on your contract income in estimating the tax due the nice thing about paying estimated taxes via payroll deduction is that all that tax money can be counted as having been paid in four equal and timely quarterly payments of estimated tax regardless of when the money was actually withheld from your university paycheck you could if you wanted to and had a fat salary from the university heh heh have all the tax due on your contract income withheld from just your last paycheck of the year but whether you increase the withholding in august or in december do remember to change it back after the last paycheck of the year has been received so that next year 's withholding starts out at a more pace

this may be a great idea or a very bad one or it may simply not be applicable to you depending on your personal circumstances and interests the general idea is to avoid passive investments such as stocks and bonds because they tend to grow by only a few percent per year instead invest in things where you will be actively involved in some form with those much higher investment returns are common but also the risk is higher and you may be tied down and have to limit the traveling you want to do so here are a few different ways to do that get a college degree but only if you are interested in the field and it ends up paying you well if you are n't interested in the field you wo n't land the $ 100k+ jobs later and if you study early childhood education you may love the job but it wo n't pay enough to make it a good investment of course it also has to fit with your life plans but that might be easier than it seems you want to travel have you thought about anthropology marine biology or pick a reputable hard to get into academic school rather than a oriented and make sure that they have at least some research program that 's one way to distinguish between the for profit schools who tend to be very expensive and land you in low paying jobs and schools that actually lead to a well paying future or if your interest runs more in a different direction start a business your best bet might be to buy a franchise many of the fast food chains such as mcdonalds will let you buy as long as you have around $ 300k net worth most franchises also require that you are qualified it may often make sense to buy not just one store but several in an area you can increase your income and your risk by getting a loan you can probably buy at least $ 5 million worth of franchises with your seed money btw i 'm only using mcdonalds as an example well known fast food franchises used to be money making machines but their popularity may well have peaked there are franchises in all kinds of industries though some tend to be very short term there is a franchise based on selling customer 's stuff on ebay while others can be very long lived many real estate brokerages are actually franchises do be careful which ones you buy some can be a license to print money while others may fail and there are some fraudsters in the franchising market out to separate you from your money advantage over investing in stocks and bonds if you choose well your return on investment can be much higher that 's generally true for any business that you get personally involved in if you do well you may well end up retiring a multimillionaire drawback you will be exposed to considerable risk the investment will be a major chunk of your net worth and you may have to put all your eggs in none basket if your business fails you may lose everything a third option but only if you have a real interest in it get a commercial driver 's license and buy an truck i hear that owner operators can easily make well over $ 100k and that 's with having to pay off a bank loan but if you do n't love culture it is likely not worth doing overall you probably get the idea the principle is to use your funds as seed money to launch something profitable and secure as well as enjoyable for you

the harvested losses are capital losses   see this irs page generally realized capital losses are first offset against realized capital gains   any excess losses can be deducted against ordinary income up to $ 3,000 $ 1,500 if married filing separately on line 13 of form 1040   losses in excess of this limit can be carried forward to later years to reduce capital gains or ordinary income until the balance of these losses is used up this means that your harvested losses can be used to offset ordinary income up to $ 3000 in a single year and with extra losses carried forward to future years   it is pretty close to a free lunch provided that you have some losses somewhere in your portfolio this free lunch is available to anyone but for a human it can be quite a chore to decide when to sell what keep track of the losses and avoid the wash sale rules   the advantage of robo advisors is that they eat that kind of bookkeeping for breakfast so they can take advantage of tax loss harvesting opportunities that would be too cumbersome for a human to bother with

you are co signer on his car loan you have no ownership unless the car is titled in both names   one option not the best see below is to buy the car from him   arrange your own financing take over his loan or get a loan of your own to pay him for the car   the bank(s will help you take care of getting the title into your name   and the bank holding the note will hold the title as well best advice is to get with him sell the car take any money left after paying off the loan and use it to buy cash purchase not finance a reliable efficient used car if you truly need a car at all if you can get to work by walking or public transit you can save thousands per year and perhaps use that money to start you down the road to financial independence   take a couple of hours and research this   in the us we tend to view cars as necessary but this is not always true   actually it 's true less than half the time even if you can not or choose not to live within bicycle distance of work you can still reduce your commuting cost by not financing and by driving a fuel efficient vehicle   ask yourself would you give up your expensive vehicle if it meant retiring years earlier   maybe as many as ten years earlier

i maintain a strong bias against taking on any debt of any sort and i feel it serves me well   this is not to say i would never take on a debt like a car loan mortgage or educational loan   it 's just that there is a built in bias against it    the reason that bias is good is that in my view taking on debt presents the following problems therefore the standing no debt bias that said if there is a very compelling reason to take on debt it could override the bias   the best example i know is that my mother bought a house with a mortgage when she had the cash because cds at that time were paying far more than the mortgage interest rate this was back around the 80s when cds hit an absurd 18   to not take on that debt would be refusing free money   but that 's a rare case   today cds and other guaranteed interest streams are at historical lows so this factor is really not in play

remember that shares represent votes at the shareholders meeting if share price drops too far below the value of that percentage of the company the company gets bought out and taken over this tends to set a minimum share price derived from the company 's current value the share price may rise above that baseline if people expect it to be worth more in the future or drop s bit below if people expect awful news that 's why investment is called speculation if the price asked is too high to be justified by current guesses nobody buys that sets the upper limit at any given time since some of this is guesswork the market is not completely rational prices can drop after good news if they 'd been inflated by the expectation of better news for example in general businesses which do n't crash tend to grow   hence the market as a whole generally trends upward if viewed on a long timescale but there 's a lot of noise on that curve short term or single stocks are much harder to predict

total capital this is a very old fashioned term that really is mostly only used in the finance industry today like when everyone was obsessed with bank capital total capital = preferred equity + common equity + liabilities true blue preferred shares are almost only used by financial companies banks specifically   the more modern ones that convert to common are used by all other companies notes payable this is another old fashioned term that now carries a different meaning in generally accepted account principles gaap the oldest definition of a note or a promissory note is a promise to pay a fixed amount of money on a specific date    this has been modified to resemble more a bond and evolved into the zero coupon bond a bond that makes no cash interest payments but makes one final payment that includes principal interest    a bank note like a one dollar bill is a note that pays something in this case one dollar never technically the repayment date is simply not specified in the contract   while it pays one dollar it never pays it back so it has a constant value of one dollar   the constant nature inflation notwithstanding is what makes bank notes the preferred medium of exchange gaap has taken its own definition to mean any debt payable within 12 months as it is a current < 12 months liability

thanks for the info things are starting to make more sense now for some reason i 've always neglected learning about investments now that i m in a position to invest and am still fairly young i 'm motivated to start learning    as for help with td ameritrade i was looking into index funds as another commenter mentioned that i should on their site and am a little overwhelmed with the options first i 'm looking at mutual funds going to symbol lookup and using type = i 'm assuming that 's the same thing as an index fund but since the language is slightly different i 'm not 100 sure however at that point i need some kind of search for a symbol in order to see any results makes sense but i do nt know where to start looking for good index funds     so my first question is if i find a good mutual fund is it correct to simply go to buy mutual funds and find it from there and if so my second question is how do i find a good mutual fund    my goal is to have my money in something that will likely grow faster than a savings account i do n't mind a little volatility i can afford to lose my investment i 'd plan on leaving my money in the fund for a several years at least    my last question is when investing in these types of funds or please point me in another direction if you think index funds are n't the place for me to start should i be reinvesting in the funds or having them pay out dividends i would assume that reinvesting is the smart choice but i can imagine situations that might change that in order to mitigate risk and as i 've said a few times in this thread including the title i 'm a complete amateur so my assumptions are n't necessarily worth that much    thanks for the help i really appreciate all the info so far

good debt and bad debt are just judgement calls   each person has their own opinion on when it is acceptable to borrow money for something and when it is not   for some it is never acceptable to borrow money for something they wo n't even borrow money to buy a house   others of course are in debt up to their eyeballs all debt costs money in interest   so when evaluating whether to borrow or not you need to ask yourself is the benefit i am getting by borrowing this money worth the cost home ownership has a lot of advantages for many these advantages coupled with the facts that home mortgages are available at extremely low interest rates and that home mortgage interest is tax deductible in the u.s. make home mortgages worth it in the eyes of many contrast that with car ownership for these reasons there are many people who consider the idea of borrowing money to purchase a car a bad idea   i have written an answer on another question which outlines a few reasons why it is better to pay cash for a car

since i personally agree with the investment thesis of peter schiff i would take that sum and put it with him in a managed account and leave it there i 'm not sure how to find a firm that you like the investment strategy of   i think that it 's too complicated to do as a side thing   someone needs to be spending a lot of time researching various instruments and figuring out what is undervalued or what is exposed to changing market trends or whatever i basically just want to give my money to someone and say i agree with your investment philosophy let me pay you to manage my money too no one knows who is right of course   i think schiff is right so that 's where i would put the amount of money you 're talking about   if you disagree with his investment philosophy this does n't really make any sense to do for that amount of money though i think firms would be willing to sit down with you and sell you their services   you could ask them how they would diversify this money given the goals that you have for it and pick one that you agree with the most

given your needs gnucash will do i 've used it for the past 3 years and while it 's a gradual learning process it 's been able to resolve most stuff i 've thrown at it schedule bills and deposits in the calendar view so i can keep an eye on cash flow   gnucash has scheduled payments and receipts and should you need them i prefer to keep enough float to cover monthly expenses in accounts rather than monitor potential shortfalls    track all my stock and mutual fund investments across numerous accounts it pulls stock mutual and bond quotes from lots of places domestic and foreign it can also pull transaction data from your brokers if they support that   i manually enter all my transactions so i can keep control of them i just reconcile what i entered into quicken based on the statements sent to me i do not use quicken 's bill pay there 's a reconciliation mode but i do n't use it personally the purpose of is less about catching bank errors and more about agreeing on the truth so that you do n't incur bank fees when i was doing this by hand i found i had a terrible data entry error rate but on the other hand the bayesian importer likes to mark gasoline purchases from the local grocery store as groceries rather than gas i categorize all my expenditures for help come tax time gnucash has accounts and you can mark expense accounts as tax related it also generates certain tax forms for you if you need that not sure what all you 're categorizing that 's helpful at tax time though i use numerous reports including net worth tracking cash not is retirement funds and total retirement savings tons of reports and the newest version supports sql if you prefer that vs their reports

gt europe is a temporary problem   lol   the better question for this thread is how is the european economy not utterly doomed   i see no way at all of the euro surviving   greece has already technically defaulted by saying it 's not going to pay back all of it 's debt   they will officially default when germany stops bailing them out   spain is in the exact same situation just about a year behind   they have n't technically defaulted yet but they will   they 're receiving bailout after bailout and the greece situation only makes their interest rates worse   italy is just barely behind spain the greek default followed by the spanish will send italian interest rates through the roof them to the same fate   this will eventually effect the us but our borrowing rates are held artificially low due to the fed just printing up more fake money and letting the us borrow as much as it wants   if you do n't see this scheme crumbling and collapsing i 'm just curious what you actually think will happen

your question indicates that you might have a little confusion about put options and/or leveraging   there 's no sense i 'm aware of in which purchasing a put levers a position   purchasing a put will cost you money up front   leveraging typically means entering a transaction that gives you extra money now that you can use to buy other things   if you meant to sell a put that will make money up front but there is no possibility of making money later   best case scenario the put is not exercised   the other use of the term leverage refers to purchasing an asset that proportionally goes up faster than the value of the underlying   for example a call option if you purchase a put you are buying downside protection which is kind of the opposite of leverage   notice that for an american put you will most likely be better off selling the put when the price of the underlying falls than exercising it   that way you make the money you would have made by exercising plus whatever optional value the put still contains   that is true unless the time value of money is greater than the optional insurance value   since the time value of money is currently exceptionally low this is unlikely   anyway if you sell the option instead of exercising you do n't need to own any shares at all   even if you do exercise you can just buy them on the market and sell right away so i would n't worry about what you happen to be holding the rules for what you can trade with a cash instead of a margin account vary by broker i think   you can usually buy puts and calls in a cash account but more advanced strategies such as writing options are prohibited   ask your broker or check their help pages to see what you have available to you

note that the series you are showing is the historical spot index what you would pay to be long the index today not the history of the futures quotes it 's like looking at the current price of a stock or commodity like oil versus the futures price   the prompt futures quote will be different that the spot quote if you the history of the prompt future you might notice the more how do you determine when to roll from one contract to the other many data providers will give you a time series for the prompt contract history which will automatically roll to the next expiring contract for you   some even provide 2nd prompt etc time series   if that is not available you 'd have to query multiple futures contracts and them based on the expiry rules which should be publicly available also is there not a price difference from the contract which is expiring and the one that is being rolled forward to yes since the time to delivery is extended by ~30 days when you roll to the next contract but yet there are no sudden price in the charts well there are but it could be indistinguishable from the normal volatility of the time series

similarly too much long term investment seems unproductive but what would be too much in 1900 the life expectancy of someone in the united states was less than 50   it is now in the 70s   my grandparents were born around that time and all lived into their 80s and 90s   life expectancy in india is currently about 66   you should expect that to increase into the 70s if not the 80s in the next fifty years    you should plan on living until 120   why   if you die earlier than that you may have wasted some money that you could have used for a better living standard   however if you do live that long and you spent all your savings by the time that you were 66 you 'll have a hard retirement   you 've already said that you wo n't have descendants to take care of you   you 'll need your investments to do so   you need long term investments more than someone with a family not less    you need to able to afford a house for retirement   you need to be able to maintain it buy food etc on your savings   in order to be sure it lasts you need to build your long term investments until they produce a steady income that comes close to matching your income    there are some costs that you wo n't have in retirement   you wo n't need to save for retirement   you wo n't need to commute to work   so your retirement income does n't need to support that    if i were you i 'd save like everyone else until income from investments matched my current expenses minus commuting   at that time you can readjust    overall you are far more likely not to save enough than too much   i would n't worry about in your twenties   no one actually does so

the thing is spain really is n't like greece and their financial crises are fundamentally different but unfortunately interconnected   greece 's issue is too much sovereign debt and a banking sector that lent far too heavily to their own government spain 's problems derive from a private banking sector crisis as they over lent particularly to fund an insane property boom that went really really bad really quick the root cause is far more akin to the us crisis than the greek one however being caught up in the eurozone and having banks exposed to the debt of other nations has really fucked them over in terms of borrowing and debt to gdp ratio   spain was one of the few eurozone nations that stuck to the max 3 og gdp borrowing rule not even germany stuck to that they were fiscally responsible then having to provide a huge bailouts to a financial sector as the economy was tanking from the global recession amd the bubble bursting and a crisis emerging in other eu nations and a lack of a central bank has been their ruin

rent the property is that a possible solution since selling the house is not an option and living in it is n't either then perhaps renting it is the way to go since no explanation for the sister 's motives is given i 'd speculate it is a mixture of emotional and financial concerns maybe mostly emotional i imagine letting go of the one physical thing that has memories of you and your parents attached to it is very difficult i do n't think getting a lawyer or doing what 's convenient for only your boyfriend is the way to go but that 's my own personal opinion clearly he only has one close family member left alive creating permanent wounds in that relationship will cost more along the way and quite frankly if the house is owned 50 50 do n't you need both owners to sign the deed to sell the house anyways if renting is not an option then maybe refinancing the mortgage to lower payments or airbnb it only half the time or rent it out for events to help with payments or ask the sister for a little money not for half the mortgage but at least a few hundred dollars to maintain the house and heat if she is indeed concerned with the property then maintaining it to prevent serious is in her interests no matter her income

over on quantitative finance stack exchange i asked and answered a more technical and broader version of this question should the average investor hold commodities as part of a broadly diversified portfolio   in short i believe the answer to your question is that gold is neither an investment nor a hedge against inflation although many studies claim that commodities such as gold do offer some diversification benefit the most credible academic study i have seen to date should investors include commodities in their portfolios after all new evidence shows that a mean variance investor would not want to allocate any of their portfolio to commodities this would include gold presumably nevertheless many asset managers such as pimco offer funds that are marketed as real return or inflation managed and include commodities including gold in their portfolios   pimco has also commissioned some research strategic asset allocation and commodities claiming that holding some commodities offers both diversification and inflation hedging benefits

assuming you plan to buy a whole number of shares and have a maximum dollar value you intend to invest it may be better to wait for the split if the figures do n't quite work out nicely for example if you are going to invest $ 1,000 and the stock pre split is $ 400 and the split is 2 for 1 then you 'd buy 2 shares before the split unless you have an extra $ 200 to add meanwhile after the split you could buy 5 shares at $ 200 so that you invest all that you intend aside from that case it does n't really make a difference since the split is similar to getting 2 nickels for a dime which in each case is still a total value of 10 cents

a credit default swap is a derivative a financial contract with a value dependent upon another asset a cds in essence is exactly what it sounds like a swap upon default the typical arrangement is that a holder of non risk free credit enters into an arrangement with a counterparty to pay the counterparty a portion of the income received from the non risk free credit in exchange for being able to force the counterparty to deliver risk free credit if the non risk free credit defaults banks use this mechanism to reduce the risk of the loans they produce while packaging them to be resold to investors   banks will typically buy on mortgages and corporate bonds paying part of the income from interest payments received to have the right to force counterparties typically hedge funds and insurance companies to swap national treasuries upon the event that the mortgages or corporates default   the banks receive less income yet are able to take on more inventory to sell to investors so that more loans can be made to borrowers households and corporations hedge funds typically take on more complex arrangements while insurance companies sell because they are usually overflowing with risk free assets yet are starved for income

crisis and volatility benefit financiers and the wealthy even more now than they did then back then anybody left standing could buy at the bottom of a depression while it was those who needed wages to eat who really suffered nowadays arbitrage and derivatives not to mention federal policy make volatility itself a profitable proposition for people with lots of money to invest   that said i do n't think it 's a necessary conclusion from 's statement that he thought those at the top intentionally caused inflation and depression merely that their actions brought it about maybe he was complaining that the economy would be healthier and more stable if it were truly a free market or maybe he was arguing that greed at the top led to imprudent policy

there are other good answers to the general point that the essence of what you 're describing exists already but i 'd like to point out a separate flaw in your logic why add more complications so that should i call this principal or interest actually makes a difference why 's the point incentive for this the incentive is that using excess payments to credit payments due in the future rather than applying it to outstanding principal is more lucrative for the lender since it 's more lucrative and there 's no law against it most all lenders use it as the default setting

i see two important things missing from your ongoing costs maintenance and equipment i also do n't see the one time costs of buying and moving maintenance involves doing some boring math like roofs go every 20 years or so and a new roof would cost $ 20k so i need $ 1000 a year in the roof fund furnaces go every 20 years and cost $ 5k so i need $ 250 a year in the furnace fund etc etc use your own local numbers for both how long things last and how much they cost to replace one rule of thumb is a percentage of the house not house and land price each year keeping in mind that while roof furnace carpet stove toilets etc all need to get replaced eventually not everything does the walls for example cost a lot to build but do n't wear out and not all at a 20 year pace some is more often some is less often i 've heard 5 but think that 's too high try 3 maybe so if you paid $ 200,000 for a $ 100,000 house sitting on $ 100,000 of land you put $ 3000 a year or about $ 250 a month into a repair fund then ignore it until something needs to be repaired when that happens fund the repair from the savings if you 're lucky there will always be enough in there if the house is kind of old and on its last legs you might need to start with a 10 or 20k infusion into that repair fund equipment means a and a snow shovel tools for fixing things hammer glue that sort of thing maybe tools for gardening or other hobbies that house owners are likely to have you might need to back some trees or if nothing else eventually you get tools for your tools such as a dad for sharpening your well lots of dads for sharpening lots of things   one time expenses include moving new curtains appliances if they do n't come with the house possibly new furniture if you would otherwise have a lot of empty rooms paint and painting equipment and your party there are also closing costs associated with buying a house and you might need to give deposits for some of your utilities or pay to have something eg internet installed be sure to research these since you have to pay them right when you have the least money as you move in

as part of the cost benefit analysis i would consider that the collections agency has often paid pennies on the dollar so you can negotiate a lower amount if the bill is legitimate   that may make paying the debt more attractive than fighting if the bill is illegitimate then you would mainly consider what legal means they have to attempt to collect   if they can put a lien on your property then you may want to settle it and avoid the hassle   if all they can do legally is keep calling you and asking for the money they may give up if you tell them that you have no intention of paying because you do n't believe you owe anything and you look forward to telling them the same thing tomorrow next week and next year followed by a change of subject ask some personal questions and go into a discussion of the weather etc   whether they give up will depend on how strong they think their legal position is

congrats on making it this far debt free it is rare but nice to be in the situation that you are in   the important thing here is that you want to remain debt free that 's really what the emergency fund is all about it keeps you from needing to go into debt should something unexpected happen   you 've got 1.5 months worth of expenses saved up and that 's great if you do n't have a family or other responsibilities that might be enough but think about this how are you paying for school and what would happen if those funds stopped coming in if you are paying for school out of your own income what happens if you lose your job if someone else perhaps your parents is paying for school what happens if they are suddenly no longer able to do so   while you have extra cash you want to be saving it up for situations like this   if i were you i would build up that emergency fund until it got to the point where it could pay all your expenses and tuition until graduation hopefully you wo n't need to touch it but it will be there if you need it   since you need to be able to access your money quickly it is generally recommended to park this money in a savings account where it is very safe mutual funds are a great way to invest but they are not safe in the short term   do n't stress out about not being able to start retirement investing just yet making sure you can finish school debt free is the best investment you can make right now after you graduate and land a job you can start investing aggressively

if you want your bank to pay $ 1 to a beneficiary bob then the service no matter how implemented needs to result in bob 's bank saying to bob hey i owe you $ 1     the usual way how this is done consists of two parts your bank needs to somehow tell bob 's bank hey guys do us a favor and please give bob $ 1 with a message from the sender and your bank needs to convince the other bank that they 'll pay for cover that this is the main source for the delays in international payments there are thousands of banks and most of possible pairs have no legal contact between themselves whatsoever no bilateral agreements no trust and no reasonable enforcement mechanism for small claims if i 'm bob 's bank then a random bank from anywhere from switzerland to nigeria can send me an instruction give bob $ 1 we 'll make it up for you the swift network is a common way of doing this however most likely i 'm going to give bob the money only after i receive the funds somehow which means that they have given the money to some institution i work with for payments within a single country it often is a centralized exchange or a central bank and the payment speed is then determined by the details of that particular single payment network e.g. uk faster payments or the various systems used in usa for international payments it may require a chain of multiple intermediaries correspondent banks for example a payment of $ 1 mm from to china will likely involve the bank asking their main correspondent in usa some major bank such as chase jpmorgan to give the money to the relevant chinese bank 's correspondent in usa say citi to then give the money to that chinese bank to then give the money to the actual recipient each of those steps can happen because those entities have bilateral agreements trust and accounts with each other and each of those steps generally takes time and verification if you want all payments to happen instantly then you need all institutions to join a single binding payment system it 's not as easy as it sounds as it is a nightmare of jurisdiction for example if you 'd want me as bob 's bank to credit bob instantly then the system needs to provide solid guarantees that i would get paid even if a the payer institution changes its mind made a mistake or intentional fraud b the payer institution goes insolvent c the system provider gets insolvent providing such guarantees is expensive they need to be backed by multi billion capital and they 're unrealistic to enforce across jurisdictions e.g. would an iranian bank get recourse if some funds got blocked because of usa sanctions the biggest such project as far as i know is sepa across most of europe visa and mastercard networks perform the same function a merchant gets paid by the cc network even if the payer ca n't pay his cc bill or the paying bank goes insolvent

if the person has prepared put your affairs in order then they will have a will and an executor and this executor will have a list of the life insurance policies and will contact the companies to arrange payouts to the beneficiaries it 's not really the beneficiary 's job to do that if the person has n't made a list of their policies but has a will and an executor then the executor can try things like looking at recently paid bills you 're sending $ 100 a month to friendly life insurance company bet it 's a life insurance policy or paperwork that is in the person 's home or their safety deposit boxes even if you do n't have the key to those boxes a copy of the will and the death certificate will get the box drilled out for you if you do n't know what bank they might have sd boxes at again your paperwork will get the manager to find out for you if there is a box at that particular branch so a day spent visiting branches can be fruitful something i know from personal experience with someone whose affairs were nowhere near in order generally you find out you 're a beneficiary of a will because the executor tells you i suppose it 's possible that a person might name you beneficiary of their life insurance without telling you or anyone else and without writing a will but it 's pretty unlikely if you 're worried i suggest you encourage your parents grandparents and other likely of you to write up some paperwork and keep it somewhere family is likely to find it not hidden inside a book on a or in the back of the wool

this is the sad state of us stock markets and regulation t. yes while options have cleared settled for t+1 trade + 1 day for years and now actually clear instantly on some exchanges stocks still clear settle in t+3   there really is no excuse for it if you are in a margin account regulations permit the trading of unsettled funds without affecting margin requirements so your funds in effect are available immediately after trading but are n't considered margin loans   some strict brokers will even restrict the amount of margin funds you can trade with scottrade used to be hyper safe and was the only online discount broker that did this years ago others will allow you to withdraw a large percentage of your funds immediately i think e*trade lets you withdraw up to 90 of unsettled funds immediately if you are in a cash account you are authorized to buy with unsettled funds but you ca n't sell purchases made on unsettled funds until such funds clear or you 'll be barred for 90 days from trading as your letter threatened besides most brokers do n't allow this   you certainly are n't allowed to withdraw unsettled funds by your broker in such an account as it would technically constitute a loan for which you are n't even liable since you 've agreed to no loan contract a margin agreement   i ca n't be sure if that actually violates reg t but when i am i 'll edit while it is true that all marketable options are cleared through one central entity the options clearing corporation with stocks clearing settling still occurs between brokers netting their transactions between each other electronically all financial products could clear settle immediately imo and i 'd rather not start a by giving my opinion why not do n't even get me started on the bond market as to the actual process it 's called clearing settling the general process which can generally be applied to all financial instruments from cash deposits to derivatives trading is the reason why all of the old financial companies were grouped on wall st. is because they 'd have runners physically all of the certificates from building to building   then they discovered netting so slowed down the process to balance the accounts and only cart the net amounts of certificates they owed each other   this is how we get the term bankers hours where financial firms would close to the public early to account for the days trading   while this is all really done instantly behind your back at your broker they 've conveniently kept the short hours

typically banks look for a steady source of income or savings based on which they issue a credit card if you ca n't show that build a cash balance and show it for example if you have an ppf account with say sbi they issue you a card with a limit of around 50 of the balance in ppf no other documentation is required similarly if you have fixed deposits for a large amount quite a few banks would give you a credit card my wife has a credit card because she had a good balance around 100,000 inr for around a year the bank kept calling her and offered her a card

gt the system is designed   would n't that be more the union is designed why not just end the union 's contract entirely and hire from outside the union or find a different union to negotiate with maybe someone wants to form a union of teachers who want to teach that focuses on job security for the best teachers not the longest serving   i mean if i was negotiating for myself i 'd want merit based pay increases rather than seniority based i 'd probably also be asking that my health benefits be the same as the district administration i might ask for a clause saying that i ca n't be fired unless all worse performing teachers have already been fired yeah about measuring that have n't figured that out yet i might also ask for some sort of third party policy for representation in the event that there 's a need to lawyer up under circumstances where a conflict of interest exists between myself and the district   the last of those the lawyer issue i 've been told by at least one teacher that they feel that 's the primary service the union provides they hate the contract negotiations because they always seem to go to threats to strike before being resolved   i guess it just seems weird to me that once a union has formed the union has a monopoly on providing the services you 'd think that some could join the union while others could choose to operate independently if the advantages of being in the union outweigh the advantages of being independent then you 'd expect everybody to join a 51 vote to unionize seems like a terrible reason to bring the rest of the employees and any new hire along for the ride it should be an individual 's choice to be represented by the union and whether to accept the union terms or negotiate on their own

best as i can tell the simple answer is the smartest approach to investing for dividends is to pick a company that is has and will continue to make a solid profits there are lots of them out there specifically companies with no debt a history of long term and steady growth and a stable market share will almost always recoup any drop in stock valuation due to a dividend payout and usually in short order this is why dividends were created as a mechanism for distributing profits back to investor without diminishing thier stake in the company the trick then is to find such companies with the best ratio between stock price and dividend payout and again there are a lot of good options out there   all the is justified however as many unscrupulous companies will try to pull investors in with high dividends as a means to simply generate capital these companies have few of the quality attributes mentioned above instead high debt fluctuating or negative profits minimal market share or diminishing growth present a very risky long term play and will be avoided by this conservative investor

these rates are so low because the cost of money is so low specifically two rates are near zero   the federal reserve discount rate which is the interest rate charged to commercial banks and other depository institutions on loans they receive from their regional federal reserve bank 's lending facility the discount window the effective federal funds rate which is the rate banks pay when they trade balances with each other through the federal reserve banks want to profit on the loans they make like mortgage loans to do so they try to maximize the difference between the rates they charge on mortgages and other loans revenue and the rates they pay savings account holders the federal reserve or other banks to obtain funds expenses this means that the rates they offer to pay are as close to these rates as possible as the charts shows both rates have been cut significantly since the start of the recession either through open market operations the federal funds rate or directly the discount rate the discount rate is set directly by the regional federal reserve banks every 14 days    in most cases the federal funds rate is lower than the discount rate in order to encourage banks to lend money to each other instead of borrowing it from the fed in the past however there have been rare instances where the federal funds rate has exceeded the discount rate and it 's been cheaper for banks to borrow money directly from the fed than from each other

victor addressed the card issue with an excellent answer i 'd like to take a stab at the budget and income side   your question clearly stated i am left with no extra money each month whenever i read such an assertion i ask the person but surely x% of people in your country get by on a salary that 's 95 of yours in other words there 's the juggling of the debt itself which as victor 's math shows is one piece of the puzzle the next piece is to sift through your budget and find $ 100/mo you spend that could be better spent reducing your debt turn down the temperature in the winter up in the summer etc take lunch to work no lattes really look at the budget and do something   on the income side there are countless ways to earn a bit of extra money i knew a blogger who started a site called deliver away debt he told a story of delivering pizza every friday and saturday night the guy had a great day job in high tech but it did n't lend itself to overtime and he had the time available those two evenings to make money to kill off the debt he and his wife had our minimum wage is currently just over $ 7 but i happened to see a sign in a pizza shop window offering this exact position $ 10/hr plus gas money they wanted about 8 hours a weekend and said in general tips pushed the rate to well over $ 15/hr they assumed i was asking for the job and i said i was asking for a friend this is just one idea   next and last i knew a gal with a three bedroom small house tight budget i suggested she find a roommate she got so many responses she took in two people and the rents paid her mortgage bill in full out of debt in just over a year instead of 4 + and in her case no extra hours at all   there are sites with literally 100 's of ideas it takes one to match your time interest and skill when you are at $ 0 extra even finding $ will change your life

the purpose is to go public but also to generate more wealth the real money comes when market values you at a price more than your cash flow if a company brings in $ 1000 of cash flow then that is what the employees and owners have to distribute among themselves but if they are likely to increase to $ 2000 next and $ 4000 next year and they go public then the stock will do well in this case the promoters and employees with options rsus will benefit as well the increased visibility is also very useful look at google or fb they did n't need the ipo proceed when they went public they had enough cash from their business but then they would only have $ 1 10 billion a year but due to the ipo their investors and employees have a huge net worth   basically with just a small of shares in the public you can value the company at a high price valuing in the future cash flows with a discount rate etc so instead of realizing the profit over the next 15 years you get to enjoy it right away

i have n't heard 30-year mortgages called unwise as said the shorter terms often will be cheaper if you are going to pay off within that term anyway but the extra cost of the 30 may still be justified because it gives you the safety net of being able to fall back to the lower payment if money gets tight cheap insurance if you might need that insurance that was n't something i was worried about so i took a 20-year later refinanced as 15-year and got a slightly better rate by doing so consider how long you expect to own this house and shop for the best deal you can find remember to figure points into the real cost the loan there are calculators on many bank credit union websites that can help you do this comparison

on international stock exchanges they trade puts and calls typically also for currencies if for example 1 nok is worth 1 $ now and you buy calls for 10000 nok at 1.05 $ each and in a year the nok is worth 1.20 $ which is what you predict you can execute the call meaning buying the 10000 nok for the contracted 1.05 $ and selling them for the market price of 1.20 $ netting you 12000 = 1500 $ converting those back to nok would give you 1250 nok considering that those calls might cost you maybe 300 nok you made 950 nok note that if your prediction is common knowledge calls will be appropriately priced = expensive and there is little to make on them and note also that if you were wrong your calls are worth less than toilet paper so you lost the complete 300 nok you paid for them all numbers are completely made up for illustration purposes you can make the whole thing easier if you define the raise of the nok against a specific currency for example $ or eur if you can you can instead buy puts for that currency and you save yourself converting the money twice

if you are able to buy a 150 k home for 50 k now that would be a good deal   however you ca n't you have to borrow 100 k in order to make this deal happen   this dramatically increases the risk of any investment and i would no longer classify it as passive income    the mortgage on a 150 k place would be about 30 year fixed   reasonably i would expect no more than in rent or   a good rule of thumb is to assume that half of rental revenue can be counted as profit before debt service   so in your case 7200 but you would have a mortgage payment of   leaving you a profit of after debt service   this is like 2 k per year   things in the financial world tend to move toward an equilibrium the benefit of rental property you can make a lot more than the numbers suggest   for example the home could increase in value and you can have fewer than expected repairs   so you have two ways to profit   rental revenue and asset appreciation however you said that you needed passive income   what happens if you have a vacancy or the tenant does not pay   what happens if you have greater than expected repairs   what happens if you get a fine from the hoa or a special assessment   not only will you have dip into your pocket to cover the payment you might also have to dip into your pocket to cover the actual event in a way this would be no different than if you borrowed 100 k to buy dividend paying stocks   if the fund company does not pay out that month you would still have to make the loan payment   where does the money come from   your pocket   at least dividend paying companies do n't collect money from their shareholders yes you can make more money but you can also lose more   leverage is a two edged sword and rental properties can be great if you are financial able to absorb the shocks that are normal with ownership

the question you should be asking yourself is this why am i putting money into a 401(k for many people the answer is to grow a large nest egg and save for future retirement expenses investors are balancing risk and potential reward so the asset categories you 're putting your 401(k contribution towards will be a reflection on how much risk you 're willing to take per a us news world report article ultimately investors would do well to remember one of the key tenants    of investing diversify the narrower you are with your investments    the greater your risk says vanguard 's diversification    does n't ensure against a loss but it does help lessen a significant    loss generally investing in your employer 's stock in your 401(k is considered very risk in fact one forbes recommends not putting any money into company stock finra notes simply stated if you put too many eggs in one basket you can expose yourself to significant risk in financial terms you are under diversified you have too much of    your holdings tied to a single investment your company 's stock    investing heavily in company stock may seem like a good thing when    your company and its stock are doing well but many companies    experience fluctuations in both operational performance and stock    price not only do you expose yourself to the risk that the stock    market as a whole could but you take on a lot of company    risk the risk that an individual firm your company will falter or    fail in simpler terms if you invest a large portion of your 401(k funds into company stock if your company runs into trouble you could lose both your job and your retirement investments for the other investment assets vehicles you should review a few things personally i prefer to keep my portfolio simple and just pick just a few options based on my own risk tolerance from your fund examples without knowing specifics about your financial situation and risk tolerance i would have created a portfolio that looks like this when i was in my 20 's i avoided the bond and income money market funds because the growth potential is too low for my investing horizon like some of the other answers have noted the target date funds invest in other funds and add some additional fee overhead which i 'm trying to avoid by investing primarily in index funds again your risk tolerance and personal preference might result in a completely different portfolio mix

it will depend on credit they are offering you during the period being covered a gas station locks up what they expect is the maximum transaction for most people when the prices of gas spikes some people have the pump turn off before the tank is filled therefore they need to use a 2nd card to complete the purchase before you arrive at a hotel they lockup the cost of one night in the hotel that way they still sell the room for one night if you never show while you are there they lockup the cost of what you could owe them this would include the cost of the room and average room service or bar service   for a car rental it would be based on the risk they perceive they do n't want to try and collect against a card you gave them when you reserved the car or when you picked up the car only to find that you have gone over the limit   some online systems will let you see what is pending against your card others could provide that information to you over the phone

if the country went to a sustainable minimum wage like 15 dollars an hour we would benefit more   anyone who thinks the walmart strikes are stupid and they should be fired clearly does nt understand how the economy should work     you can blame walmart for trying to make as much as possible and not caring about their workforce   look at costco and how they start all employees off at 12 dollars an hour   the company does amazing still   also there have been countless studies that show increasing minimum wage does not hurt local businesses but actually helps out the economy   because those lower middle class people have a higher purchasing power do not need government assistance as much and can work on starting other small businesses that help out   the big nay believe that it will cripple local businesses or increase the price of goods   while goods will increase in price some it is never anywhere near the amount to correlate with the wage increase   its sad as a country people believe slavery is fine   if you are pro for under 15 dollars an hour you are pro slavery   i m on my phone so i ca nt pull up all the fun statistics but feel free to do the searches yourself   lots of stories on how it benefits an economy overall   the only people making these facts up are the ones who own the businesses because their wealth will go down and be spread among employees more

metals and mining is an interesting special case for stocks   it 's relationship to u.s. equity spx is particularly weak correlation compared to most stocks so it does n't behave like equity   however it is still stock and not a commodities index so it 's relation to major metals gold for instance is not that strong either correlation metals and mining stocks have certainly underperformed the stock market in general over the past 3 vs 9.8 annualized so this does n't look particularly promising   it did have a spectacularly good 8 year period though 66 annualized   it 's worth remembering that it is still stock   if the market did not think it could make a reasonable profit on the stock the price would decrease until the market thought it could make the same profit as other equity adjusted slightly for the risk   so is it reasonable to expect that it would give the same return as other stock on average   yes   though as has been shown in the past 25 years your actual result could vary wildly both positive and negative all numbers are from monthly over the last 25 years using as a proxy

have n't read this but will thanks   i would agree with you that there are certain aspects and forms of private equity that could be considered reprehensible first carried interest probably is n't the fairest thing in the world but that 's not going to last much longer i think you could also argue that some hostile takeovers approach the reprehensible an example off the top of my head would be carl icahn and i would argue on the whole however that most hostile takeovers are accretive in the sense that you 're taking out management that is either being tremendously negligent or destroying value all together    in both of those instances you can make succinct and well thought out arguments but this is n't what 's happening with bain on the whole i would disagree and argue that pe backed restructurings are accretive to the economy as a whole

gt;no system is going to be perfect especially one that is totally inflexible   certainly but you come right back to the need for good wise management   and part of that is constructing a system that does n't have obvious and blatant loopholes   it is a lot easier to say no to someone when you can back it up by saying i think this is going to take 2,000 hours and the ceo has only granted you 1,000 hours figure out what you can live without and get back to me   and you have just given an example of a very bad unwise management system and likely entirely arbitrary budgets does the ceo know his arse from a hole in the ground   why was 1,000 hour budgeted how many departments are going to be allocated 1,000 hours and yet have little or no use for them but of course as will all budgeting systems those hours are probably use it or lose it so the department head of dept a will be deprived because of the arbitrary past weighted allocations and the head of dept b will end up wasting 1,000 hours on crap just to make sure he gets 1,000 hours again next year   bad management tends to build management systems that are even worse than their original management   and if you lived under your budgeted hours system for a couple of years you 'd be back here bitching about how stupid that system is

capping the upside while playing with unlimited downside is a less disciplined investment strategy vis a vis a stop loss driven strategy whether it is less risky or high risky also depends on the fluctuations of the stock and not just long term movements for example your stop losses might get triggered because of a momentary sharp decline in stock price due to a large volume transaction esp more so in small cap stocks although the stock price might recover from the sudden price drop pretty soon causing a seemingly preventable loss that being said playing with stop losses is always considered a safer strategy it may not increase your profits but can certainly cap your losses

you can invest another $ 5,500 in your roth ira each year so you can invest up to $ 11,000 between the two tax years additionally you can make investments for the previous year up until 15 april the following year in your case that will be close to graduation time and you may decide to max out the contribution for 2014 but wait until you are settled into a new job before setting those savings aside long term when you start your first job there will likely also be an option to invest in a 401k you can still have the advantages of a roth but you will be limited to the investments available in the plan most employers i 've seen today still offer a low cost index fund but you may have to speak up at a company meeting to pressure them to include one of those options in the plan with a 401k your limit increases to $ make sure that the index fund you invest in has the lowest possible expense ratio i use voo depending on trading fees etc you might pick something else

gt that is in large part do to insane healthcare costs passed on to the consumers by the aca healthcare spending has increased on average 1.5 annually since 2009 where as the highest growth in spending from 1991 until 2006 was 1.3   health care costs have actually been on the rise for decades now it was only noticed by the majority party i.e. the gop who had held the majority for 16 of the years prior to 2009 when the aca was enacted suddenly health care costs started to explode the truth is that health care costs have been on a steady rise in the time period from 1972 to 1982 costs rose on average 14 per causes of rising healthcare keep in mind this was prior to the expansion of medicare from 1983 1992 costs grew at a rate of 9 per year 3 times faster than inflation from 1993 to 2010 cost rose at a rate of 6.4 per year the aca of course was passed in 2009 but did n't start to take effect until 2011 since 2010 health care costs has risen about 4 per year that is a 2 drop in a short amount of time compared to the previous years however the numbers are already so big just like the national debt that the gop who had as much part to play in the health care costs as they did in the debt had tons of numbers they could use to make it seem like health care costs have exploded    in reality what happened is that people who never had health insurance before were forced to get it and started to realize how expensive it is when it actually covers what it was intended to cover preventative care as well as emergent care the gop has been on a steady march to undermine the new law as much as possible since it passed because it made some of their biggest donors and health care insurance providers uncomfortable the fact that they had to share their cost information and that the health care exchange required them to do a line item by line item comparison with other companies out there    so here we are the aca is going to be cut and millions of people are going back to be uninsured or what you are going to see is the rate of costs growth start to increase again after decades of slowly decreasing rates why because of the renewed ability of insurance providers to hide the costs to hide costs increases it will also cause hospitals to greatly overcharge the uninsured as they were doing before but there will be many more of them the goal being that the uninsured are unlikely to pay for the very large medical bills so knowing this hospitals artificially inflate the bill in the hopes of getting a larger portion of that unpaid bill liquidated through medicare    uninsured populations also lead to more unhealthy people you would think that not having health insurance would make people want to remain more healthy however studies show the opposite to be articles business in actuality people stress more about their health and avoid periodic checkups both of which lead to bad health results    trying to blame the cost increases in health care on government meddling or say it is a problem brought on by the aca is weird since there are so many examples of government sites s healthcare ranked dead last compared health care programs out there which are so much more efficient less costly and have resulted in much healthier populations    gt i do nt have health insurance and an er visit with costs me less out of pocket than 90 of the country why is that    i am going to call bs number one that is a huge claim to make without supporting evidence number two you would have to demonstrate how much that same visit would cost to those with health insurance    gt do you think it has to do with the fact that with the aca hospitals know they are getting paid with 0 questioning on pricing so charge whatever they want and with me they think shit this guy might not ever pay us lets just give him a decent price and get some money from him because all we can do is send his bill to collections    actually no the exact opposite they now because you are uninsured that you are unlikely to pay so they overcharge you for the same services because they know that they will only be reimbursed a percentage of the costs if it goes to medicare for non payment    gt the swiss do everything better   you keep referring back to switzerland do n't get me wrong they are a very good country and have the number 2 ranked health care system in the world however i do n't think they are the low tax haven that you think they are they have an average corporate tax rate of wiki whereas the us has it at 32 their highest income tax bracket is whereas the us is at 39 their sales tax goes at high as 8 where ours go as high as 11 their average effective rate is around 11 while ours is around 18 including social security puts switzerland at 17 and the us at 24    so they are definitely a lower tax rate country but in no way are they a no tax rate country then again switzerland has no military to speak of while the us spends more on military then the next 7 countries put together    gt this is the dumbest statement you ve made this entire time    i have been very patient i have stuck with this conversation in spite of the put downs and remarks i have a little too but you can go back to most of my remarks and see that i have been more i have given you some leeway because of your age and i am almost twice as old as you    so you gave me your background i will give you mine i am closer to 50 then i would prefer i left the house at 17 enlisted in the navy and spent the next 15 years serving in the military i ended my career in a select community i have been out for ten years this july i am now owner of a company that does r&amp;d and works with the government a lot of my knowledge about inventions and how commercial works with government comes from my own personal experiences i have seen the best and worst of government as well as seen the same on the commercial side of the house anyone comes to this game with the that government ca n't get anything done as well as commercial quickly learns that is not true anyone comes thinking that commercial equals efficient learns that is not always true too    gt take apple for instance where is all the government funding they recieved to be one of the most innovative companies in human history or microsoft   as i said previously that you thought was a dumb comment commercial is very good at taking existing systems and finding ways to make them efficient and better apple and microsoft is the same they both made their mark in history by expanding on and creating innovation with existing technologies that had their foundation in government r&amp;d projects including the digital wiki as well as computers like the and the issues and the advancements into tech ibm invent the personal computer answer which lead to the first efficient and cost effective personal computers the touchscreen was actually first invented in by engineers at wiki and of course we know that the internet started as a government funded project called news ask history who invented the internet    i think you would be surprised how much many if not most of the things we take for granted today have a foundation in government funded r&amp;d. my company is a commercial company and we do a great job creating our own products and innovation and yet still our best selling product is a design of a national laboratory that we license from them commercial industry is great at manufacturing and producing something the government is not as good at and so often they will license out designs for production to companies like ours some of the biggest commercial companies out there do the same

you have not specified what country you are in that radically changes everything in case you are in canada there 's a great blog that covers bankruptcy and student loans at loan fundamentally in order to discharge government backed student loans you must have ceased to be a student for at least seven years prior to filing even then though the government can object in which case you will still have to repay some or all of the loan more generally given that the collection agency appears to be operating in bad faith you 'll want to ensure that they send you written documentation of any offer they are extending you if they refuse to do this you should assume that they are n't actually offering you anything at all and you will have to pay back the full amount plus interest and penalties note that in many countries if you settle the debt that is pay anything less than the full amount plus interest and penalties this will be a black mark on your credit report in this case if you repaid the full $ 16,000 and they the extra $ 4,000 they would most likely still add a note to your credit report indicating that you did not pay the full amount that you owed and this will negatively impact your credit rating even beyond your late payments

i do n't buy new cars anymore but i 've helped family members negotiate prices on new cars recently there are various online services to see the average price paid as well as the low outliers i 've looked at for instance to see what others have paid within 50 miles of my zip code i think the only way for you to know you 're being offered a good deal is to see if any of the other dealers that have not responded are willing to talk when you offer them $ which the dealer above suggested was break even point if none of them respond then you know you 're really at the bottom of the negotiating window if one of them does respond then you can go back to that internet sales manager and ask why another dealership do not disclose which one is willing to sell it to you for less than $ do not disclose how much lower they offered to sell it for   in my experience most dealers will sell at or just below the break even price at the end of the quarter so that they can beat other dealerships out for the quota that gives you a week and a half to find the bottom price before going in on new years eve to seal the deal

determine an investment strategy and that will likely answer this for you different people have different approaches and you need to determine for yourself what buy and sell criteria you want to have again depending on the strategy there can be a wide range here as some may trade index funds though this can backfire in some cases in others there can be a lot of buy and hold if one finds an index fund to hold forever which depending on the strategy is possible returns can vary widely as an index can be everything from buying gold stocks in russia to investing in short term treasuries as there are many different indices as any given market can have an index which could be stocks bonds a combination of the two or something else in some cases so please consider asset allocation types of accounts risk tolerance and time horizon in making decisions or consider using a financial planner to assist in drawing up a plan with allocations and how frequently you want to rebalance as my suggestion here

sure   even milton friedman called hayek 's economic work   much of the austrian economic foundation rests without as solid of a   philosophical or mathematical foundation as most other schools of thought   i suppose the easiest way to understand this is to look at three foundational works   i recommend reading each of these anyways but skimming and paying attention to references should give you a good idea of the varying levels of rigor introduced into each school of thought   leaf through das = = = = = = = = false this is marx 's primary   it is far older than the following two that i will present   nevertheless it perhaps more than any other book played a pivotal role in the 20th century    leaf through a general theory of employment interest and = = = = = = = = = false this is the foundational work of the keynesians   there is much more here than simply the advice to increase government spending to stabilize demand during economic downswings   and it has been probably the most widely accepted work by the greatest number of economists over the 20th century      leaf through the theory of money and credit this is the austrian from von mises   it is the newest of the three   it is also likely the least rigorous   but please judge for yourself   von mises did do some more rigorous work in other areas     but all schools of economics ultimately rest on their theory of capital   so before you pick which church to belong to it 's worth reading their respective

it is typically possible to sell during a crash because there are enough people that understand the mechanics behind a crash generally you need to understand that you do n't lose money from the crash but from selling every single crash in history more than recovered and by staying invested you would n't have lost anything this assumes you have enough time to sit it out it could take several years to recover on the other side of those deals are people that understand that and make money by buying during a crash they simply sit the crash out and some time later they made a killing from what you panic sold when it recovers its value

you already got good answers on why you ca n't buy a toyota from the factory but my answer is regarding to the implied second part of your question how to avoid haggling i found a good way to avoid the haggling at a car dealership can be simply to not haggle go in with a different attitude the main reason car dealers list inflated prices and then haggle is that they expect the customers to haggle it is fundamentally based on distrust on both sides treat the sales person as your advisor your business partner as somebody you trust as an expert in his field and you 'll be surprised how the experience changes of course make sure that the trust is justified sales reps have a fine line to walk of course they like to sell a car for more money but they also do not want a reputation of overcharging customers they 'd rather you recommend them to your friends and post good reviews on yelp in the end all reputable dealers effectively have a fixed price policy or close to it even those who do n't advertise it and even for used cars haggling just the process to get there and sales reps are people often people who hate the haggling part of their job as much as you do i was in the market for a new used car a few months ago in the end it was between two cars one of them a toyota both from the brand name dealer 's respective used car lots in both cases i went in knowing in advance what the car 's fair market value was and what i was willing to pay as well as details about the car mileage condition etc thanks to the internet both cars were marked significantly higher as soon as the sales rep realized that i was n't even trying to haggle the price dropped to the fair value i did n't even have to ask for it the rep even offered some extras thrown into the deal things i had n't even asked for things like towing my old car to the junk yard

first pay off the highest interest first   if you have 80 pay it first    paying off a card loan with a lower rate but a lower payment or a lower balance can help your mental capacity by having fewer things to pay   but this should be a decision where things are similar such as 20 25 not 20 80    what about any actual loans   any loans with a fixed payment and a fixed amount    if you must continue to use cc while paying them off use the one with the lowest interest rate    call all of your debtors and ask for reduction in interest rate    this is not the option to take first   this is a strategic possibility and will cause credit score issues if you are considering bankruptcy or not paying back some then you have even more negotiation power   consider calling them all and telling them that you only have a little bit of money and would like to negotiate a settlement with them   i have only a limited amount of money and lots of debt   i will pay back whomever gives me the best deal   see what they say   they may not negotiate until you stop paying them for a few months   it is not uncommon to get them to reduce interest even to 0 and/or take a reduction in the amount due up to 25 cents on the dollar   to do this you might need to pay the amount all at once so look into loans from sources like retirement home equity life insurance family    also cut out all expenses   cut them hard cut until it hurts   cut out the cell phone get a pre paid plan and/or budget $ 10 cut out all things like alcohol tobacco firearms lottery tattoos cable tv steak eating out some people would suggest that you consider pets and finding them a new home   no games no trips no movies no new clothes   cut out soft drinks candy and junk food    take precautions to stay healthy do n't wear shoes in the house brush your teeth take a multi vitamin get exercise eat healthy this is not expensive organic stuff just regular groceries    consider other ways to save like moving in with family or friends   having family or friends live with you and pay rent   analyze costs like daycare vs. job income   apply for assistance there are lots of levels and some do n't rely on others such as daycare    consider making more money new job 2nd job overtime new career    consider commute walk bike take the bus   work 's      make a list of every expense and prioritize them   only keep things which are really necessary    good luck

what is the formula for calculating the total cost of a loan with extra payments towards the principal the formula you require is the standard one for calculating the time to repay   with larger repayments the time to completely repay the loan is reduced where the total cost of the loan is then n d. explanation calculation the formula for a loan is derived from the sum of the cash flows discounted to present value being equal to the principal   for further info see the section here titled calculating the present value of an ordinary annuity the summation can be reduced to a closed form by induction   rearranging for d and n with the op 's figures the original monthly repayment is $ adding $ 200 each month with the higher repayment the loan is repaid in months instead of 360   of course a bank would simply take a reduced payment in month but the amounts work out the same the saving is $ addendum if the repayments increase was made part way through the term of the loan the summation and formula would be   where then for example if for the first ten years the payments are $ and for the remaining time the repayments are $ the loan is completely repaid in months the saving is plotting over a range of m months

in theory anything can happen and the world could end tomorrow   however with a reasonably sane financial plan you should be able to ride this out if the government can not or wo n't immediately pay its debt in full the most immediate consequence is that people are going to be unwilling to lend any more money in future except at very high rates to reflect the high risk of future default    presumably the government has got into this state by running a deficit spending more than they collect in tax and that is going to have to come to an abrupt end   that means higher taxes public service and restrictions of service perhaps cuts to social benefits etc countries that get into this state typically also have banks that have lent too much money to risky customers   so you should also expect to see some banks get into trouble which may mean customers who have money on deposit will have trouble getting it back   in many cases governments will guarantee deposits but perhaps only up to a particular ceiling like $ 100k it would be very possible to lose everything if you have speculative investments geared by substantial loans   if you have zero or moderate debt your net wealth may decrease substantially 50 but there should be little prospect of it going to zero it is possible governments will simply confiscate your property but i think in a first world eu country this is fairly unlikely to happen to bank accounts houses shares etc typically a default has led to a fall in the value of the country 's currency   in the eurozone that is more complex because the same currency is used by countries that are doing fairly well and because there is also in other major currency regions jpy usd and gbp   in some ways this makes the adjustment harder because debts ca n't be inflated down all of this obviously causes a lot of economic so you can expect house prices to fall share prices to unemployment to rise   if you can afford it and come stomach the risk it may turn out to be a good time to buy assets for the long term    if you 're reasonably young the largest impact on you wo n't be losing your current savings but rather the impact on your future job prospects from this adjustment period you never know but i do n't think the weimar republic of banknotes situation is likely to recur people are at least a bit smarter now and there is an inflation targeting independent central bank i think gold can have some room in a portfolio but now is not the time to make a sudden drastic move into it   most middle class people can not afford to have enough gold to support them for the rest of their life though they may have enough for a rainy day or to act as a balancing component so what i would do to cope with this is be well diversified be sufficiently conservatively positioned that i would sleep at night and beyond that just ride it out and try not to worry too much

i think a larger issue is that you 're trying to do market timing whether you had a large or small amount of money to invest no one wants to put the money in to watch it go down   you ca n't really predict if prices in a market or security will go up in six months in which case you want to put all your cash in now of if it will go down in which case you 'd want to wait until the bottom or if it will around in which case you 'd want to only buy at the bottoms   of course if you 're magic enough to nail all of those market conditions you 're a master finance trader and will quickly make billions if you 're really concerned with protecting your money and want to take some long positions i 'd look into some put options you 'll of course pay the fees for those put options but they 'll protect your downside   much of this depends on your time horizon at the age of 35 someone can expect to see ~6 more recessions and perhaps ~30 more market corrections before retirement with that big of a time range it 's best to avoid micro optimizing since that tends to hurt your performance overall because you wo n't be able to time the market correctly most of the time   one thing that 's somewhat reasonable if you have the stomach for it is to not buy at somewhat obvious market highs and wait for corrections this is n't fool proof by any means but as an example many people realized that us equities basically were on a ~5 year up run by december 2014 many people cashed out those positions expecting that a correction would be due and around late summer of 2015 that correction came for those with patience they made ~15 with a few mouse clicks   of course many others would have been waiting for that correction since 2010 and missed out on the market increases   boiled down

if the savings rate is the same as the loan rate mathematically it does n't make any difference whether you pay down the loan more and save less or vice versa however if the loan rate is higher than the savings rate it 's better to pay it down as fast as possible the chart below compares paying down the loan and saving equally the gradual scenario versus paying down the loan quickly at 2 x $ and then saving 2 x $   the savings rate for illustration is 2 paying quickly pays down the loan completely by month 51   on the other hand in the gradual scheme the loan ca n't be paid down with the savings until month 54 which then leaves 3 months less for saving   in conclusion it 's better to pay down the higher rate loan first   practically speaking it may be useful to have some savings available

i have answered your question in detail here the annuity formula in fdic document is at first finding present value annuity due factor and multiplying it with annuity payment and then dividing it by an interest factor of to reduce the annuity to an ordinary annuity with end of period payments they could have simply used and multiplying it with annuity payment to find the present value of an ordinary annuity in any case you should not follow the directions in fdic document to find interest rate at which the present value of annuity equals the loan amount the method they are employing is commonly used by finance professors to teach their students how to find internal rate of return the method is prone to lengthy trial and error attempts without having any way of knowing what rate to use as an initial guess to kick off the interest rate calculations so this is what i would suggest if you are not short on time and would like to get yourself familiar with numerical methods or iterative techniques to find internal rate of return there are way too many methods at disposal when it comes to finding interest rates some of which include all of the above methods use a seed value as a guess rate to start the iterative calculations and if results from successive calculations tend to converge within a certain absolute error bound we assume that one of the rates have been found as there may be as many rates as the order of the polynomial in this case 36 there are however some other methods that help find all rates by making use of but for this you would need a lengthy discourse of linear algebra one of the methods that i have come across which was published in the us in 1969 the year i was born is called the method named after the two individuals who worked jointly on finding a solution to all roots of a polynomial any previous work on the same subject i been trying to go over the algorithm but am having difficulty understanding the complex nature of the calculations required to find all roots of the polynomial in summary you would be better of reading up on this site about the newton method to find irr

the following is based on my experian credit scoring feedback and experience here in the uk over many years   and for further information i currently hold a credit score of 999 the highest possible with 6 credit cards   now i 'm assuming that while there may be some differences in particulars in your case due to the difference in locality nevertheless the below should hopefully provide some broad guidelines and reasonable conclusion in your situation having a large number of active credit accounts may be seen as a negative   however having a large number of settled accounts should on the contrary have a positive effect on your score   as you keep your accounts mostly settled i think having another card will not be to your detriment and should in time be beneficial a large total credit balance outstanding may count against you   but see the next point    having your total outstanding debt on all credit accounts be a smaller proportion of your total available credit counts in your favour   this means having more cards for the same amount of credit in use is net net in your favour   it also has the effect of making even larger outstanding credit balances as in point 2 to be a lower percentage of your total available credit and consequently will indicate lower risk to lenders    it appears from my experience the higher the highest credit limit on a single card you are issued and are managing responsibly e.g. either paid off or used responsibly the better needless to say any late payments count against you   the best thing to do then is to set up a direct debit for the minimum amount to be paid like clockwork every month   lenders really like consistent payers new credit accounts initially will count against you for a while   but as the accounts age and are managed responsibly or settled they will eventually count in your favour and increase your score making many credit applications in a short space of time may count against you as you may be seen to be credit reliant   conclusion on balance i would say get the other card   your credit score might be slightly lower for a couple of months but eventually it will be to your benefit as per the above     having another card also means more flexibility and more more options if you do end up with a credit balance that you want to finance and pay off over a period as cheaply as possible    in the uk the credit card companies are falling over themselves trying to offer one interest free or 0 balance transfer offers   of course they 're not truly 0 since you typically have to pay a transfer fee of a couple of percent still this can be quite cheap credit much much cheaper than the headline apr rates actually associated with the cards   the catch is that any additional spending on such cards are paid off first and attract interest at the normal rate until paid off   usually also if you miss a payment the interest rate reverts to the normal rate   but these pitfalls are easily avoided pay by direct debit and do n't use card you 've got a special deal on for day to day expenses so having more cards available is then very useful because you then have choice   you can roll expensive debts to the cheapest lender at your disposal for as long as they 'll offer and then simply not use that card for any purchases while paying off the balance as cheaply as possible meanwhile using another card for day to day expenses

your biggest concern will be what happens during the transition period in the past when my employer made a switch there has been a lockout period where you could n't move money between funds then over a weekend the money moved from investment company a to investment company b. all the moves were mapped so that you knew which funds your money would be invested in then staring monday morning you could switch them if you did n't like the mapping no money is lost because the transfer is actually done in $ 's imagine both investment companies had the same s&p 500 fund and that the transfer takes a week if when the first accounts are closed the s&p500 fund has a share value of $ 100 your 10 account has a value of $ 1000 if the dividend capital gains are distributed during that week the price per share when the money arrives in the second investment company will now be $ 99 so that instead of 10 shares $ 100 you now will buy shares $ 99 no money was lost you want that lookout period to be small and you want the number of days you are not invested in the market to be zero the lockout limits your ability to make investment changes if for instance the central bank raises rates the number of days out of the market is important if during that period of time there is a big price increase you would n't want to miss it of course the market could also go lower during that time

exceeded your obligations   as others have mentioned if an extra $ 2 k in income generated $ 5 k in taxes chances are your return was prepared incorrectly the selection of an appropriate entity type for your business depends a lot on what you expect to see over the next several years in terms of income and expenses and the extent to which you want or need to pay for fringe benefits or make pretax retirement contributions from your business income there are four basic flavors of entity which are available to you sole proprietorship this is the simplest option in terms of tax reporting and paperwork required for ongoing operations your net gross minus expenses income is added to your wage income and you 'll pay tax on the total if your wage income is less than approximately $ 100 k you 'll also owe self employment tax of approximately 15 in addition to income tax on your business income if your business runs at a loss you can deduct the loss from your other income in calculating your taxable income though you wo n't be able to run at a loss indefinitely you are liable for all of the debts and obligations of the business to the extent of all of your personal assets partnership you will need at least two participants humans or entities to form a partnership individual items of income and expense are identified on a partnership tax return and each partner 's proportionate share is then reported on the individual partners tax returns general partners who actively participate in the business also must pay self employment tax on their earnings below approximately $ 100k. each general partner is responsible for all of the debts and obligations of the business to the extent of their personal assets a general partnership can be created informally or with an oral agreement although that 's not a good idea corporation business entities can be taxed as s or c corporations either way the corporation is created by filing articles of incorporation with a state government does n't have to be the state where you live and corporations are typically required to file yearly entity statements with the state where they were formed as well as all states where they do business shareholders are only liable for the debts and obligations of the corporation to the extent of their investment in the corporation an s corporation files an information only return similar to a partnership which reports items of income and expense but those items are actually taken into account on the individual tax returns of the shareholders if an s corporation runs at a loss the losses are deductible against the shareholders other income   a c corporation files a tax return more similar to an individual 's a c corporation calculates and pays its own tax at the corporate level payments from the c corporation to individuals are typically taxable as wages from a tax point of view it 's the same as having a second job or as dividends depending on how and why the payments are made if they 're in exchange for effort and work they 're probably wages if they 're payments of business profits to the business owners they 're probably dividends if a c corporation runs at a loss the loss is not deductible against the shareholders other income   fringe benefits such as health insurance for business owners are not deductible as business expenses on the business returns for s corps partnerships or sole proprietorships c corporations can deduct expenses for providing fringe benefits   llcs do n't have a predefined tax treatment the members or managers of the llc choose when the llc is formed if they would like to be taxed as a partnership an s corporation or as a c corporation if an llc is owned by a single person it can be considered a disregarded entity and treated for tax purposes as a sole proprietorship this option is not available if the llc has multiple owners   the asset protection provided by the use of an entity depends quite a bit on the source of the claim if a creditor plaintiff has a claim based on a contract signed on behalf of the entity then they likely will not be able to pierce the veil and collect the entity 's debts from the individual owners on the other hand if a creditor plaintiff has a claim based on negligence or another tort like action such as sexual harassment then it 's very likely that the involved will also be sued as individuals which takes away a lot of the effectiveness of the purported asset protection the entity based asset protection is also often unavailable even for contract claims because sophisticated creditors like banks and landlords will often insist the the business owners sign a personal guarantee putting their own assets at risk in the event that the business fails to honor its obligations   there 's no particular type of entity which will allow you to entirely avoid tax most tax planning revolves around income and expense items in the most favorable ways possible or around controlling the timing of the appearance of those items on the tax return

the alternative is n't too bad invest in a regular account the dividends and cap gains will see favorable tax treatment in my opinion much of the magic of the retirement account is with 401(k matched deposits   the benefit you 'll miss is the long term opportunity to skim income off the top at say 25 have it grow and then withdraw it at a much lower average tax rate if that benefit does n't outweigh the fear of the 10 stick with my first thought above

either way lease or buy it 's likely going to be an expense not a depreciation you would expense the entire lease amount whatever that is in the year it was paid a $ computer probably is n't worth the trouble of recording it as a fixed asset and depreciating it yearly i work for a company that buys thousands of pcs a year for its employees and we have a hard rule if it 's under $ 3k it 's an expense not an asset if you were buying $ servers this would be a different conversation both because of the price and the life of the item because it 's such a small amount unless you really are buying $ 20k pcs it does n't really matter whether it 's your biggest expense or not it 's likely just an expense though no one is preventing you from depreciating it over 5 years if you wanted to see in summary i would say your question is more of a business sense question than a tax question is it worth it to you to lease instead of buying because you are getting a new pc so often btw every 2 years is not that often it 's average whatever your decision i think the answer for taxes is the same expense it all in the year it was incurred unless you really want to spread it out and depreciate

how do i account for this in the bookkeeping here is an example below   this is how you would accurately contributions made by an owner for a business if you would want to remove money from your company or pay yourself back this would be called withdrawals it would be the inverse of the first journal entry with cash on the credit side and withdrawals on the debited side as it is an expense   you and your business are not the same thing you are two different entities this is why you are taxed as two different entities when you the owner make contributions it is considered to be the cash of the business from here you will make these expenses against the business and not yourself   good luck

it is the that makes this a rather ridiculous question makes me curious would this be a civil or criminal crime if you are convinced that this of illegality is a thing talk to a lawyer yes there may be consequences of doing any variety of actions while you owe the irs and while you do not owe the irs as an unincorporated business the irs does not stop you from gaining an additional source of income to pay them with   perhaps lenders might not help you with capital as an incorporated business no state is going to ask you if you owe back taxes before they allow you to pay them to register your business in their state this is n't legal advice i 'm just assuming there is no legal advice to give based on your to your original question i 'm going to go with no

you may as well ask why a piece of wood is 25 long but only 10 inches most units of measure are very arbitrary somebody decides that this amount of heat or distance or money is a convenient unit and so that 's what they use suppose that tomorrow the government issued a whole new currency that had 10 times the value of the old currency so if you used to make 10,000 foobars a year now you make 1,000 new foobars and likewise the price of everything you buy is divided by 10 if a certain model car used to cost 2,000 foobars now it costs 200 new foobars are you better or worse off clearly if all prices change by the same percentage then it makes absolutely no difference aside from the hassle of making the switch and getting used to the new numbers a currency where 1 unit of money buys more is not necessarily a stronger currency any more than inches are better than because you get more wood for an inch than you get for a a currency is said to be strong when it 's value is stable or increasing relative to other currencies if yesterday i could trade 10 foobars for 1 but today i only need 9 foobars to buy 1 then foobars are stronger than even though i still need more foobars than to buy the same item

i recognize you are probably somewhere in the middle of various steps here but i 'd start and go through one by one in a disciplined way that helps to cut through the overwhelming torrent of information that 's out there here is my start at a general checklist others can feel free to edit it or add their input how much house would you like to buy in terms of $ $ $ and bedrooms sq ft you can start pretty general here but the idea is to figure out if you can actually afford a brand new 2,500 sq ft house upwards of $ 500 k in your neck of the woods according to or maybe with your current resources you 'll be looking at something like a that is more entry level but still yours some might recommend that this is a good time to talk to any significant others and understand manage expectations my wife usually cares a lot about schools at this stage but i think it 's too early just ballpark whether you 're looking at a $ 500 k house a $ 300 k house or a $ 200 k   how much house can you afford in terms of monthly payments only not considering other costs like utilities yet looking around at calculators like this one from bankrate.com can help you figure this out set the interest rate 5 30-year loan and change the mortgage amount until you have something that is about of what you currently pay in rent each month i 'll get to why to your rent payment later   crap ca n't afford my dream house if you do n't have the down payment to make the numbers work remember that this does n't even include closing costs yet there are other loan options like fha loans that can go as low as about 5 down payment the math would be the same but you replace 0.8 with 0.95   then look at your personal budget come up with general estimates of what you currently bring in and spend each month overall just ballpark it   next figure what you currently spend towards housing in particular whether you are paying for it or your landlord is paying for it someone pays for a lot of different things for housing for now my list would include 1 rent 2 mortgage payment 3 electricity 4 gas 5 sewer 6 water 7 trash 8) other utilities tv internet phone 9 property insurance 10 renter 's insurance and 11 property taxes   i would put it into a table in excel somewhere that has 3 columns the first has the labels the second will have what you spend now and the third will have what you might spend on each one as a homeowner if you pay it now put it in the second column if your landlord pays it right now leave it out as that 's included in your rent payment obviously each cell wo n't be filled in fill in the rest of the third column you wo n't pay rent anymore but you will have a mortgage payment you probably have a good estimate of any electricity bills etc that you currently pay but those may be slightly higher in a house vs. a condo or an apartment as for things like sewer water trash or other community utilities my bet would be that your landlord pays for those if you need a good estimate ask around with some co workers or friends that own their own places they would also be a good resource for property insurance estimates shooting from the hip i would say about $ 100/month based on this website i 'm not affiliated   the real ouch is going to be property tax rates based on the data from this website your county is about 9 of property value so add that into the third column as well   can you really afford a house round 2 now add up the third column and see how that monthly expense amount on housing compares against your current monthly budget if it 's over you do n't have to give up but you should just understand how much your decision to purchase a house will strain your budget also you should use this information to look again at how much house can you afford   now do some more research if you need to get a revised loan amount based on the fha loan decision then use the bankrate calculator to find out what the monthly payment is for a 95 loan against your target price but remember that an fha loan will also carry pmi that is extra on top of your monthly payment or if you need to revise your mortgage payment downwards or upwards change the loan amount accordingly   once you 've got the numbers set look for properties that fit this way you can have a meaningful discussion with yourself or other stakeholders about what you can afford as far as arranging financing a realtor will be able and willing to point you in the right direction for obtaining funding etc and at that point you can just check anything you 're offered by shopping interest rates etc against what the internet has to say   feel free to ask us too it 's hard to give much better direction without more specifics

i 'm going to suggest a slightly different approach most answers seem to suggest paying off the lower rate card to clear it some answers comments also talk about emergency funds one risk of paying off a card is that the card issuer may choose to reduce your credit limit if they see you as high risk to prevent you re spending the money if you do n't trust yourself with the card then this could be a good thing and remember you 're always free to ask for a limit decrease but if you want access to emergency funds then i would suggest paying half onto each card that way if one card cuts you off you have a chance of still having access to the other in an emergency

foreclosure is at a high level the bank declaring that the debtor can not pay their promissory note their debt   this is shortly followed by default which is the removal of debtors rights to the property   after the debtor has defaulted he either chooses to voluntarily remove himself and his belongings from the property or is forcibly evicted   in the us eviction is carried out by local law enforcement such as the sheriff 's office    the bank is now the sole owner of the property and proceeds to sell it in an attempt to recoup their investment   if the bank can not recoup their investment by selling the house the rest may be converted to unsecured debt against the debtor   if the bank chooses to forgive the remaining debt the debtor may have a tax liability for cancellation of debt   also the debtor may also be liable for any appreciation the house did before it was sold but this likely to be nontaxable if the house in question is the debtor 's primary residence   they also send the credit bureaus the notice of foreclosure which is how your credit score is hurt private mortgage insurance or lenders mortgage insurance will pay the lender some amount back to cover their losses see also

so i want to sell my 100 shares of aapl to him at a price of 10 or    even 1 us dollar is that legal allowed of course it 's your stocks do with it what you want if the two persons are not served by a same broker you 'll have to talk to your broker about the technicalities of the transaction if the person who sell are us citizen and the person who buy are not and and vice versa since you asked specifically about us citizenship i 'll assume you 're in the us or the transaction is taking place in the us citizenship has nothing to do with it except may be for economic sanctions against russians or that may come into play what is important is the tax residency status such a transfer is essentially a gift and if you 're a us tax resident which does n't correlate to your immigration status necessarily you 'll have to deal with the gift tax consequences on the discount value for example you have 100 shares of aapl which you sold to your friend for $ 1 each when the fair market value fmv was $ 501 so essentially the friend got $ value for $ 100 i.e. $ 50 k gift since this amount is above the annual $ 14 k exemption you 'll have to deal with the gift tax and file gift tax return there are also consequences for the capital gains tax for both you and your friend i suggest you talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state about the specifics given your circumstances if you or the recipient are also a foreign citizen tax resident then that country 's laws also may affect your situation

in general the goal of an s&p 500 index fund is to replicate the performance of the s&p 500 index   to do this the fund will buy the same stocks in the same proportions as the weighting of the index the s&p 500 index is free float capitalization weighted   this means that the higher capitalization stocks based on publicly traded shares only are more heavily weighted and factor into the index value more heavily than the smaller capitalization stocks or the stocks that have a smaller publicly traded value   for example companies like apple and microsoft have a much larger weight in the index value than smaller companies alternatively there are some s&p index funds that are equal weighted   in these funds the managers have chosen to purchase all 500 of the stocks in the index but in equal proportions instead of the weighted proportions of the index   these equal weighted funds will not as closely match the index price as the traditionally weighted index funds   instead they might do better or worse than the index depending on how the individual stocks do you 'll need to look at the prospectus of the index funds you are interested in to see which approach the fund is taking

at an income of $ 95 k you are on the edge of qualify for $ 500,000 mortgage once you have a down payment    yes the fastest way to qualify for a $ 500,000 condo is to save for a down payment   i am suggesting that might not be the best long term financial plan   you are only going to qualify for a 30 year term   you still have a student loan where interest is not tax deductible    you have put you yourself in a long term debt position and if you lose your job a potential cash flow problem with a risk of losing the condo    since you are living at home i would go after that student debt   looks like you could pay it off in like a year   i do n't know prices in you area but maybe go in at less than $ 500,000 for your first home

do you plan a monthly budget at the beginning of each month   this might seem counter intuitive but hear me out doing a budget is of course critically important for those who struggle with having enough money to last the month   having this written spending plan allows people struggling with finances to control their spending and funnel money into debt reduction or saving goals   however budgeting can also help those with the opposite problem there are some like you perhaps that have enough income and live frugally enough that they do n't have to budget   their money comes in and they spend so little that the bank account grows automatically   it sounds like a good problem to have but your finances are still out of control just in a different way   perhaps you are simply because you do n't know if you will have enough money to last or not by making a spending plan you set aside money each month for various categories in three broad areas since you have plenty of money coming in generously fund these spending categories   as long as you have money in the categories when you go to the store you can feel comfortable splurging a little because you know that your other categories are funded and the money is there to pay those other bills   create other categories such as technology or home improvement and when you need an app or have a home improvement project you can confidently spend this money as it has already been allocated for those purposes if you are new to budgeting software such as ynab can make it much easier

yeah exactly the difference is that ferrari is making money   edit to clarify   ferrari sells a niche product to a boutique customer base willing to pay a premium in terms of both price and purchasing difficulty for exclusive super premium cars that are manufactured to standards with little or no regard for cost efficiency or price to value ratio etc people buying ferrari are not looking for a sensible deal they are people who can afford to pay for something special rare and tesla is in a similar market position    ferrari actually makes money selling their cars they do a low volume boutique business and charge prices that reflect a low volume of made specialty product i am sure that certain special order customers have to wait some time for delivery but i drive by a ferrari dealership every day on my way to work that has maybe 50 sitting in a lot that you can drive off with same day if you want you can literally drive up test drive and buy one tomorrow if you have the scratch    otoh   teslas are cheaper than but they are still deep into the super premium price category they are well outside the value proposition customer base they are also perhaps even more than ferrari in a market segment without meaningful competition there are several super premium in the $ 100 200k price range but i suspect most tesla shoppers are not mostly comparing them against or or the all electric market is not a highly competitive one    there is massive demand for teslas as is evidenced by the extremely thin used market the year plus long wait list and all that in the face of extremely customer unfriendly sales distribution and almost zero marketing that is people are waiting up in 18-month long lines to buy cars that they ca n't inspect at a local dealership have no way to test drive and often have never even seen in person and they are putting down cash deposits to do so in amounts that could buy some pretty nice sports cars for the deposit alone moreover it 's not like tesla buyers are going to change their minds and get a chevy volt or honda insight instead although they might get both    this is any startups wet dream   you have a product that is not only already in production but that you have been shipping for several you know the tooling manufacturing support and delivery costs because you have actually been doing it for years   you not only have no issues whatsoever with regards to building a customer base you already have paying customers and genuine orders already booked through 2014 more than you can keep up with   you have a product with massive demand and almost non existent price pressure you 've got orders booked over a year out at asking price with virtually zero marketing or advertising most customers buying site unseen purely based on concept and reputation and your customers are paying super premium prices with no direct competitor alternative    this is a this is the kind of thing that business school textbooks tell you never happens rational market theory says it 's impossible to have a big ticket product offering with essentially unlimited demand and zero meaningful competition    moreover this is happening in an environment where the business is not only receiving direct gov't subsidies but where borrowing costs are close to negative in real dollars a going concern with booked orders and guaranteed revenue through 2014 should if anything be borrowing from banks to buy back equity not selling equity to raise capital    if tesla needs to raise capital then something is seriously wrong with the underlying business as in wrong enough that its current sales are not only un profitable but that currently booked future sales will continue to be un profitable for the foreseeable future otherwise they could just borrow    you can plead startup when you have a small customer base but a great concept you can plead startup when you first start shipping product in small quantities at low prices but you ca n't plead startup when you have been shipping a product for years and when you have customer orders booked years out at full asking price with no meaningful price or product competition

there are a few questions i think you must consider when considering this problem do fundamental or technical strategies provide meaningful information are the signals they produce actionable in my experience and many quantitative traders will probably say similar things technical analysis is unlikely to provide anything meaningful of course you may find phenomena when looking back on data and a particular indicator but this is often after the fact one can not action trade these observations on the other hand it does seem that fundamentals can play a crucial role in the overall typically long run dynamics of stock movement here are two examples technical suppose we follow stock x and buy every time the price crosses above the 30 day moving average there is one obvious issue with this strategy why does this signal have significance if the method is designed arbitrarily then the answer is that it does not have significance moreover much of the research supports that stocks move close to a geometric brownian motion with jumps this supports the implication that the system is meaningless if the probability of up or down is always close to 50/50 then why would an average based on the price be predictive fundamental suppose we buy stocks with the best p e ratios defined by some cutoff this makes sense from a logical perspective and may have some long run merit however there is always a chance that an internal or some macro event creates a large loss   a blended approach for sake of balance perhaps we consider fundamentals as a good long term indication of growth what quants might call drift we then restrict ourselves to equities in a particular index say the s&p500 we compare the growth of these stocks vs. their p e ratios and possibly do some regression a natural strategy would be to sell those which have exceeded the expected return given the p e ratio and buy those which have underperformed since all equities we are considering are in the same index they are most likely somewhat correlated especially when traded in baskets if we sell 10 equities that are deemed too high and buy 10 which are too low we will be taking a neutral position and betting on convergence of the spread to the market average growth we have this constructed a hedged position using a fundamental metric and some helpful statistics this method can be categorized as a type of index arbitrage and is done roughly in a similar fashion if you dig through some data yahoo finance is great over the past 5 years on just the s&p500 i 'm sure you 'll find plenty of signals and perhaps profitable if you calibrate with specific numbers sorry for the long and rambling style but i wanted to hit a few key points and show a clever methods of using fundamentals

if banks are so evil why would i ever do any business with them   are you not familiar with the phrase a necessary evil   you must understand that the major difference between borrowing from an individual and borrowing from a financial institution is that the latter factors the risk of default into its business model   the bank expects a certain percentage of its borrowers to default and manages its risk accordingly which is why there are such things as credit scores and variable aprs in the first place   your bank does n't trust you any further than it could throw you

in canada there are many stores that take debit interac but do n't take visa or mastercard for example a corner store in the us the reverse is often true every tiny place seems to take visa or mastercard but not debit a visa debit card looks like a visa card to the merchant it therefore has the benefit of being usable at places that only take visa substitute mastercard as necessary this benefit is very small in canada less so elsewhere meanwhile the money is actually coming out of your bank account just like a debit card which therefore has the benefit that you 're not borrowing money ca n't accidentally overspend and run no risk of incurring interest charges it is also a way to get what appears to be a credit card when you ca n't qualify for credit if you do the majority of your spending in canada you do n't need a visa or mastercard debit card your regular debit card interac will work fine for you if you have a credit card anyway from another bank or whatever then again you do n't need a debit card that can pretend to be a credit card

in practice no not at zero banks currently have the ability to borrow at very low interest rates but not quite at zero   using the fed funds range as a metric we can see that recently nov 2015 the lower bound of the fed funds range was 0.05   fed funds are overnight lend borrow transactions between banks often between the federal home loan banks and other institutions 0.05 is also the fed 's current reverse repo program rate rrp which is the rate at which certain counterparties can deposit cash with the fed overnight in exchange for collateral   the collateral us treasuries is insurance against the fed defaulting a very low risk considering the fed has the ability to create more us dollars out of thin air   in theory the rrp rate should be a lower bound for the fed funds rate however in practice it is possible to see lower rates trade in the street what do you mean by third party institutions only banks of the highest credit quality are able to borrow at the lower bound of the fed funds range   these are usually large domestic banks like jp morgan bank of ny etc   as credit quality decreases the rate at which they borrow increases currently german french banks have relatively good credit and borrow overnight money towards the lower part of the fed funds range   italian spanish and smaller regional us banks have lesser credit quality and borrow at the higher end of the fed funds range institutions with lower credit quality would borrow at still higher rates

in addition to all the points made in other answers in some jurisdictions including the uk where i live the consumer credit laws require the lender to allow the borrower to pay off the loan at any time if the lender charges interest and the borrower pays off the loan early then the lender loses the interest that would have been paid during the rest of the loan period however if the actual interest is baked into the sale price of an item and the loan to pay for it is nominally 0 then the borrower still pays all the interest even if they pay off the loan immediately if you think this game is being played then you can ask for a cash discount or similar wording i once had problems with a car salesman who thought i meant a suitcase full of used £ 20s meaning you want to avoid paying the interest as you are not taking a loan

mostly you nailed it   it 's a good question and the points you raise are excellent and comprise good analysis probably the biggest drawback is if you do n't agree with the asset allocation strategy   it may be too much too little into stocks bonds international cash    i am kind of in this boat   my 401 k offers very little choices in funds but offers vanguard target funds   these tend to be a bit too conservative for my taste so i actually put money in the 2060 target fund   if i live that long i will be 94 in 2060    so if the target funds are a bit too aggressive for you move down in years   if they are a bit too conservative move up

i have worked for companies that have done this one did have a match and the other did not when they figured their profit at the end of the year a portion was given to the employees as a 401 k deposit   retirement and profit sharing plan contribution limits total annual contributions annual additions to all of your accounts    in plans maintained by one employer and any related employer are    limited the limit applies to the total of elective deferrals employer matching contributions employer nonelective contributions allocations of the annual additions paid to a participant ’s account can not exceed the    lesser of 100 of the participant 's compensation or $ $ 60,000 including catch up contributions for 2017   $ 53,000    $ including catch up contributions for 2016 so as long as everything stays below that $ limit you are good in one case the decision was made by the company for the employee the other company gave us the option of bonus check or 401k. i heard that most of the employees wanted the money in the 401k.

yes it 's called executive hedging and it 's a lot more common than most people know as long as it 's properly disclosed and the decision is based on publicly available information there 's technically nothing wrong with it   enron and are the most notable companies that had executives do it on a large scale but almost every company has or had executives execute a complex form of hedging known as a prepaid variable forward in a the executive gives his shares to an investment bank in exchange for a percentage of cash up front the bank then uses the executive shares to hedge in both directions for them this provides a proxy that technically is n't the executive that needs to disclose   there 's talk about it needing to be more public at the sec right now

my personal gold metals target is of my retirement portfolio right now i 'm because of the run up in gold metals prices i have n't been selling but as i add to retirement accounts i have n't been buying gold so it is going below the 5 mark i arrived at this number after reading a lot of different sample portfolio allocations and some books some people recommend what i consider crazy allocations 25 50 in gold from what i could figure out in terms of modern portfolio theory holding some metal reduces your overall risk because it generally has a low correlation to equity markets the problem with gold is that it is a lousy investment it does n't produce any income and only has costs storage insurance commissions to buy sell management of etf if that 's what you 're using etc the only thing going for it is that it can be a hedge during tough times in this case when you rebalance your gold will be high you 'll sell it and buy the stocks that are down in theory assuming you stick to disciplined rebalancing so for me 5 seemed to be enough to shave off a little overall risk without wasting too much expense on a hedge i do n't go over this and like i said now i 'm

it sounds like you are soliciting opinions a little here so i 'll go ahead and give you mine recognizing that there 's a degree of here   a basic portfolio consists of a few mutual funds that try to span the space of investments   my choices given your pot i like because regular bond index funds have way too much weight in government securities   government bonds earn way too little   the capm would suggest a lot more weight in bonds and international equity   i wo n't put too much in bonds because i just do n't feel like it   my international allocation is artificially low because it 's always a little more costly and i 'm not sure how good the diversification gains are if you are relatively risk averse you can hold some of your money in a high interest online bank and only put a portion in these investments $ 100 k is n't all that much money but the above portfolio is i think sufficient for most people   if i had a lot more i 'd buy some reit exposure developing market equity and maybe small cap   if i had a ton more several million i 'd switch to holding individual equities instead of funds and maybe start looking at alternative investments real estate startups etc

you also want to make sure that the loan is being re amortized sometimes called recasting   without this you are still responsible for the interest payments according to the original amortization table   if you re amortize the loan with a principal that is lower than on the table you will reduce the amount of interest you owe each period which means that if you maintain the same payment you will pay less in total interest   it 's important to realize that most people re amortize to reduce the payment amount but not the term   also not all loans can be re amortized and some banks limit how often it can be done

lower fees are always better everything else equal a lower fee makes your transaction overall a better deal all else equal   other transactions costs like the sec fee on sales are mostly the same across brokers and there is unlikely to be any difference in execution quality either   when comparing brokers be sure to consider the other issues to me most of these are minor issues   for that reason i 'd say let transaction cost be your guide i hear a lot of talk about the quality of the interface   if you just want to buy or sell a stock they are all pretty easy   some brokers have better tools for monitoring the market or looking at technical indicators if you are into that

you should look at the opportunity cost for your money i.e. what kind of return it could generate otherwise   we took advantage of these types of offer zero interest for x months in the past with the goal to redirect the money to the mortgage it was 7.5 back then and we made sure we do n't get hosed by the surprisingly high interest rate by having a big reminder in the bulletin board in the kitchen to make sure we pay off the money before the interest rate kicks in   so we basically reduced our interest on the mortgage during that period   oh we use an all in one account one so that was real nice i would stay away from those interest deferred offers it 's totally not worth it

looking over some historical data i can not really a find a case where a stock went from $ to $ 1 it almost seem that once a stock crosses a minimum threshold the stock never goes back up is there any truth to that that would be a 200,000 increase in the per share value which would be extraordinary   when looking at stock returns you have to look at percentage returns not dollar returns   a gain of $ 1 would be minuscule for berkshire hathaway stock but would be astronomical for this stock if the company is making money should n't the stock go up not necessarily   the price of a stock is a measure of expected future performance not necessarily past performance   if the earnings had been more that the market expected then the price might go up but if the market sees it as an anomaly that wo n't continue then there may not be enough buyers to move the stock up looking at it long term would it hurt me in anyway to buy shares which right now would run be about $ 24 including to fee and sit on it if you can afford to lose all $ 24 then no it wo n't hurt   but i would n't expect that $ 24 to turn into anything higher than about $ 100   at best it might be an interesting learning experience

first off i highly recommend the book get a financial life   the basics of personal finance and money management are pretty straightforward and this book does a great job with it   it is very light reading and it really geared for the young person starting their career   it is n't the most current book pre real estate boom but the recommendations in the book are still sound   update new edition of the book came out now with that out of the way there 's really two kinds of investing to think about for most individuals it is best to take care of 1 first   most people should n't even think about 2 until they have fully funded their retirement accounts established an emergency fund and gotten their debt under control there are lots of financial incentives for retirement investing both from your employer and the government   all the more reason to take care of 1 before 2 your employer probably offers some kind of 401k or equivalent like a 403b with a company provided match   this is a potential 100 return on your investment after the vesting period   no investment you make on your own will ever match that   additionally there are tax advantages to contributing to the 401k   the money you contribute does n't count as taxable income the best way to start investing is to learn about your employer 's retirement plan and contribute enough to fully utilize the employer matching beyond this there are also individual retirement accounts iras you can open to contribute money to on your own   you should open one of these and start contributing but only after you have fully utilized the employer matching with the 401k   the ira wo n't give you that 100 roi that the 401k will keep in mind that retirement investments are pretty much walled off from your day to day financial life   money that goes into a retirement account generally ca n't be touched until retirement age unless you want to pay lots of taxes and penalties   you generally do n't want to put the money for your house down payment into a retirement account one other thing to note   your 401 k and your ira is an account that you put money into   just because the money is sitting in the account does n't necessarily mean it is invested   you put the money into this account and then you use this money for investments   how you invest the retirement money is a topic unto itself   here is a good starting point   if you want to ask questions about retirement portfolios it is probably worth posting a new question

i do n't know chinese purchasing power has been steadily advancing i think that it 's a total cost of goods thing the total cost to manufacture package ship warehouse pay import export taxes etc all of that must be at a tipping point such that us is now the cheaper option   just because we can spend more would n't by itself force the relocation of a factory the input costs would have to be reduced to make the economics work it 's the exact opposite wage driven circumstance that resulted in factories being off in the first place    to repatriate manufacturing jobs the only thing that would have changed in any dramatic way would be the direct manufacturing wages

the short answer zero 's answer gives some good reasons why   you will basically never be able to achieve diversification with individual stocks that is anywhere close to what you can get with mutual funds   owning individual stocks exposes you to much greater risk in that random one off events that happen to affect one of the companies you own can have a disproportionate effect on your assets   for instance some sort of scandal involving a particular company can cause its stock to tank there are only two reasons i can see to invest in individual stocks a. you have some unique opportunity to acquire stock that other people might not be able to get or get at that price   this can be the case if you work for a privately held company that allows you to buy stock or options or allows you to participate in its ipo   even then you should not go too crazy since having too much stock in the company you work for can double your pain if the company falls on hard times you may lose your job and your investment b. for fun   if you like tracking stocks and trying to beat the market you may want to test your skills at this by using a small proportion of your investable cash no more than 10   in this case you 're not so much hoping to increase your returns as to just enjoy investing more   this can also have a psychological benefit in that it allows you to blow off steam and indulge your desire to make decisions while allowing your passive investments index funds to shoulder the load of actually gaining value

that 's because they literally could not help you it 's not that they were just unwilling to a hedge fund manager might be able to do it because the person who bet on facebook would be willing to let him borrow their shares   an ipo in explain like i 'm five   a bank helps underwrite the shares pre offering this means they buy the shares wholesale they buy a large majority of the company in order to offer them to the public when the stock goes public the bank does this for profit the company does this become it helps raise their price the bank that the stock is legally prohibited from short selling that stock for at least   30 days before the ipo this is to prevent the bank from trying to commit fraud by selling stock out the front door and betting against it out the back      so now let 's jump forward to the day of the ipo the bank is offering stock to everyone who wants to buy it other banks who will cut it up and sell it to more people in order to short the stock someone must be willing to let you borrow their shares only the bank that it prohibited from short selling it 's possible but hard the underwriter has the majority of the shares for the first thirty days anyways they 're just going to release enough of them to raise volume on the ticker symbol volume is the amount of people buying and selling the others the underwriter sold to are unwilling to let someone borrow their stock because they want to ride the price hike and shares are in short supply so while it 's possible to short shares it 's very hard the underwriters limit the supply of shares to prevent that from happening the underwriters ca n't just let you short their own shares because they are legally prohibited from it    basically you 're left with the fact that the only person who has enough supply to let you short is prohibited by law from letting you do it i 'm sure morgan stanley would have been happy to let their customers short facebook as long as you did it through them to hedge their bets but they ca n't

first bear in mind that you 're talking about having an average of saved up at any given time if you spend all your stipend every quarter at a steady rate you 'll start out with all of it and have none left at the end of the quarter along with any long term savings you manage to build up over time in today 's low interest rate environment of ~1 interest rates we 're talking about approximately £ interest so it 's not worth a huge amount of effort to this you mentioned a bonus but looking at the charter savings website i do n't actually see one listed for either the cash isa or the savings accounts you mention in general banks in the uk actually use bonus rates as a short term measure to suck in new customers and the bonuses typically expire after a while leaving you with a worse rate also i do n't think either of the rates you mention is guaranteed they are both listed as variable in reality i doubt they will go down too much more given that the likely next move in uk interest rates is upwards the typical main advantage of an isa is its tax free nature but from your question i assume you do n't have any other income so you wo n't need to pay tax on any interest you earn outside an isa either also given that your budget is quite tight and you expect to spend most or all of your stipend there 's no advantage to using an account where you can build up long term tax free savings even if you do have a few thousand pounds left over by the end of your phd you 'll easily be able to put those into an isa at that point given the annual limit of £ 20k. you 're right not to want to take any risks with the money and there are n't really any risk free investments other than savings accounts available at least on the you 're talking about so overall i 'd just go for the return edit as 's answer points out you will probably be able to find a loss leader current account that actually offers more interest than a savings account you 'll need to either use a single current account and manage your budgeting carefully or use a second current account as your savings account and make sure to set things up to satisfy the requirements of the account you choose such as incoming payments or outgoing direct debits

the calculations you suggest have some issues but i think they are not necessary to answer the question it sounds like you are buying the house either way so the question really is simply whether to pay toward your house first or your loan first   in that case the answer is simple pay whichever has the highest interest rate first   make the minimum payment on the other until the first is paid off   remember this and make it your mantra for the rest of your life   if you have any debts such as credit cards that charge a rate higher than the two options you have presented do them first now be careful as you compute the interest rates   most likely you can deduct interest on your mortgage so its effective interest rate is lower it is instead of r where t is your marginal tax rate for a while the cost of mortgage insurance will make your effective mortgage rate artificially high but it sounds like you intend to get to that 20 hurdle pretty fast so my guess is that this is not a big factor congratulations on your bonus and good luck with your new home

nafta affected u.s. workers in four principal ways first it caused the loss of some 700,000 jobs as production moved to mexico most of these losses came in california texas michigan and other states where manufacturing is concentrated to be sure there were some job gains along the border in service and retail sectors resulting from increased trucking activity but these gains are small in relation to the loses and are in lower paying occupations the vast majority of workers who lost jobs from nafta suffered a permanent loss of income   second nafta strengthened the ability of u.s. employers to force workers to accept lower wages and benefits as soon as nafta became law corporate managers began telling their workers that their companies intended to move to mexico unless the workers lowered the cost of their labor in the midst of collective bargaining negotiations with unions some companies would even start loading machinery into trucks that they said were bound for mexico the same threats were used to fight union organizing efforts the message was if you vote in a union we will move south of the border with nafta corporations also could more easily local governments into giving them tax reductions and other subsidies   third the destructive effect of nafta on the mexican agricultural and small business sectors several million mexican workers and their families and was a major cause in the dramatic increase in undocumented workers flowing into the u.s. labor market this put further downward pressure on u.s. wages especially in the already lower paying market for less skilled labor   fourth and ultimately most important nafta was the template for rules of the emerging global economy in which the benefits would flow to capital and the costs to labor the u.s. governing class in alliance with the financial elites of its trading partners applied nafta ’s principles to the world trade organization to the policies of the world bank and imf and to the deal under which employers of china ’s huge supply of low wage workers were allowed access to u.s. markets in exchange for allowing american multinational corporations the right to invest there   please thank bill clinton

i know i 'm late to the party but a couple of as a recent bitcoin advocate i may be out of place in this subreddit as i come from a primarily technological background not a financial one    gt is not a currency it 's a store of value because it is not widely accepted as tender by most people   bitcoin is not a currency yet but because it does not have widespread adoption like other revolutionary technologies there is an inflection bitcoin adoption price where adoption goes from hardly anyone to almost everyone very quickly example   gt;even as a store of value it 's not very good it 's volatile and the fact that there is a limited supply of bitcoin is not a good thing sure in the short run it results in speculation that drives up the price of a coin and makes it all the rage among gamblers but i do n't think anyone can explain how if used on a larger scale would n't lead to deflation in the price of goods   to me this is basic supply and demand and it would in theory become less volatile and more stable following mass adoption bitcoin has virtually no inflation and i agree that this could lead to the deflation of goods but only insofar as that valuation is determined in bitcoin for example milk is still $ 2 but as the value of bitcoin fluctuates i may pay .001 btc or btc for that milk it 's important to remember we 're dealing with a digital asset in an increasingly more world a point of sale device like we use for credit cards could certainly tackle that conversion in the future    gt;also at the end of the day fiat currencies are based on trust and accountability of the government how does bitcoin or any other online currency solve that problem there 's no accountability and it effectively acts as as an anti currency fueled by mistrust in the establishment   this is the best part of bitcoin understanding the incentives if you follow that supply and demand logic then it is in the best interest of everyone who uses bitcoin that the bitcoin software and the system itself be reliable and secure the software is open source so anyone can see how it works and where its flaws and weaknesses are and it is still standing strong after 8 years the biggest weakness so far has been in software updates and changes to the core protocol without any central structure i.e. accountability it can be slow to reach a democratic consensus is such a way that does n't split the blockchain or the network this has led to some of the recent extreme volatility    bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies have tremendous potential to disrupt existing financial institutions the private blockchains by banks are at this point just watch?v = = at some point these institutions will realize that they ca n't create their own facebook they need to find ways to become part of the new facebook market

considering i 'm putting 30 down and having my father cosign is there    any chance i would be turned down for a loan on a $ 100k car according to bankrate the average credit score needed to buy a new car is 714 but they also show average interest rates at for new car loans to people with credit scores in the 660 range high income certainly helps offset credit score to some extent   not every bank dealership does things the same way being self employed you 'd most likely be required to show 2 years of tax returns and they 'd use those as a basis for your income rather than whatever you have made recently if using a co signer their income matters another key factor is debt to income ratio if too much of someone 's income is already spoken for by other debts a lender will shy away so yes there 's a chance given all the information we do n't know and the variability with lender policies that you could be turned down for a car loan how should i go about this if you 're set on pursuing the car loan just go talk to some lenders you 'll want to shop around for a good rate anyway so no need to speculate just go find out include the dealership as a potential financing option they can have great rates personally i 'd get a much cheaper car your insurance premium on a 100k car will be quite high due to your age you might be rightly confident in your earning potential but nothing is guaranteed situations can change wildly in short order a new car is not a good investment or a value retaining asset so why bother going into debt for one if you do n't have to if you buy something in cash now you could upgrade in a few years without financing if your earning prediction holds and would save quite a bit in car insurance and interest over the years between

i often find the one star reviews on yelp help me determine whether or not i want to try the place more than the other reviews   if the complaint is something completely unreasonable e.g. long wait for on mother 's day or an idiot who does n't understand how that food is cooked or wine is served then i completely discount the negatives     the positive reviews are tough to judge by unless they are there en masse   i find hole in the wall places to be nearly impossible to judge on yelp because there seems to be a hipster vibe of i like this place because nobody knows about it   that said if you take your time and read all reviews you can get a pretty good sense of the place at least in my experience

the purpose of the emergency fund is to enable you to pay for unplanned necessary expenses without going into debt   you know that cars do n't last forever and eventually need to be replaced ideally you would have a car replacement fund which you contribute to a little every month essentially it is a car payment to yourself   then when it comes time to get a replacement car you have money set aside for this purpose and know exactly how much you can spend   however in your case it seems that you do n't have enough money in your car replacement fund for the car that you want   there are a few different causes that might have led to this situation due to unforeseen circumstances you need a replacement car before you thought you would need it   you find that your planning was not quite right and you were n't saving as much as you need   you are trying to buy a more expensive car than you need   if a replacement car is a necessity two of these are emergencies one is not   if you do n't have enough cash set aside for a car it is certainly better to spend your emergency fund and pay cash than to borrow money to buy the car only you can decide if the car you are looking at is appropriate for you or if you should be looking at a less expensive car after you purchase the car build your emergency fund back up first then start saving for your next car
