if commuting is a big budget item then can you a side job is one way to make extra money but i 'd suggest a home business   if your wife substitute teaches i bet she writes fairly well and in any case you can   write a personal finance blog or just a site with articles   focus on surviving and thriving with in a one income christian household in the suburbs of philadelphia   or if you have a hobby that your furnace write about that   heck do both   the content just stays there and gets traffic day after day that you can monetize my main suggestion would be to start this now because it 's not overnight money   but in the long run it can turn into a nice fairly passive income the big advantage of this is that mommy gets to stay home with the kids and build up a decent business   the cost is $ for the domain per domain and maybe $ 10/month for hosting or if some other legitimate work at home business presents itself go with that   i suggest blogging because it 's what i know but everyone 's an expert in something unique

i see three areas of concern for your budget this is way high   i am not sure how much of a house you live in but the total of these two numbers should be around 25 not 41 i am a person that considers giving an important part of wealth building and gives to my local church   but as one other person has rightly said this amount is irresponsible   i am okay at 12 but would like to see you at 10 until you are in a little better shape    that is pretty vague for a significant portion of your income   what makes up that other category    you are doing pretty darn good financially although i would like to see some contributions to investments   i think you are kind of failing there   your debt management is spot on   that is okay we can all get better at some stuff there needs to be some numbers behind these percentages   the bottom line is if you make an average household income say around 55 k you are going to struggle with or without children   if you guys make about 110 k and your wife makes 50 of your income and she quits work to take care of the then you will be in that boat having said all that i find 37 of your income as questionable   at least 5 of that should be invested so we are kind of like at 32   that is a significant amount of money
# 110672
how do people do it firstly i 'd advise you to explicitly budget all taxes the reason is because taxes get complicated when you have a child deduction not that raising a child is profitable post taxes but it can change your perspective with high income get by just fine the rest sacrifice they buy less house or rent they drive more than 30 minutes to work every day they work second jobs they stop saving for retirement and when they fail to save or plan they borrow from family or rack up huge credit card debt they do n't buy the sweet new truck they were planning on they cut cable and cook meals at home they skip church because they ca n't afford the and say it 's because they do n't have time do n't want their children to disrupt services etc   so right now that other basket is looking pretty juicy and the taxes can maybe be examined as well but ultimately if you 're looking at a 30 percent hit in pay that wo n't cut it mortgage + food alone is nearly half your budget
# 274422
as this is anonymous can you give us actual numbers i can make guesses based on your percentages but it would help lets assume you both make $ 35k since you said child care would take up the bulk of your wife 's income it must be fairly low incomes the answer usually is n't a simple do this but small adjustments in your lifestyle which add up church offering is 17 the standard is 10 lower it it 's the most obvious large non required expense transportation is almost 10 of your income if my numbers are right that is somewhere around $ 500 per month what kind of car cars do you have there are very cheap used cars which cost very little in upkeep fuel is it possible your cars are more expensive than needed my wife and i bought a used car for around $ 8k in cash a few years ago still running strong only have done oil changes since then food is 12 which would be perhaps $ 600 or $ 700 per month that seems awfully high maybe i 'm wrong about your salaries you said you were cheap but now the numbers do n't add up mortgage of 35 $ 2k with escrow if i 'm guessing on salaries right seems reasonable i 'm assuming you do n't want to downsize particularly if you 're going to have kids do you have a great mortgage rate i assume you 're on a 30 year fixed already
# 36440
others have tip around this but i 'll just come out and say it   the amount of money you 're giving to the church is bordering on irresponsible given that you 're just barely breaking even yourself   the best thing you can do if you want to have children is to stop paying such a high amount to the church and redirect most if not all of that money to your savings account
# 129306
if you want to have your wife stay home with kids you 'll have to make a plan to get there as you point out your situation right now wo n't support this create a budget that will work for you with a single income a zero based budget not a budget based on your current expense structure figure out what you can afford on just your income for housing church food transport etc or apply the same idea on the assumption that she will keep working budget based on a second income plus child care expenses then you can decide what you have to change in order for that to work maybe it means selling your house renting relocating selling a car finding a better or second job etc then decide what you need to do in order to make these changes
# 138428
with your wife 's income you 're not doing to see a net difference if she stops working that job you may actually yield a little more at the end of the day it 's doable but you 're going to have to rationalize your spending and one or both of you should pick up a part time job do you remember the last time you bought lunch or went out to dinner you 're wasting money even a 50 gig at a quality employer like starbucks or home depot will let you make $ 15 20k i respect your religious beliefs but 17 of your income is steep and you may want to revisit that
# 439071
what makes it hard is that you 're making this decision now when you 've already made decisions over the years going in a different route i 've noticed this recently w some of my friends that decisions even small ones over the years now come back to bite them b c they did n't have a long term view now in early 30 's they are constrained by choices throughout their 20 's unfortunately most people are n't equipped to make good decisions earlier which hurts them later so making such a change in lifestyle becomes harder   so while it can be done it 's going to take some hard decisions just remember children are a great reward and a great sacrifice

unless you have a history of over using credit i.e. you 've gotten yourself into debt trouble then i think that the banker is giving you bad advice in telling you to get your own credit limit reduced   having more credit available to you that is left unused will make your utilization ratio lower which is generally better for your credit score according to this article on creditkarma.com   the sweet spot seems to be 1 20 utilization of your total credit   but remember this is only one factor in your credit score and not even the having a long history of on time payments counts the most my own personal experience seems to bear this out   i have two major credit cards that i use   one card has a high credit limit high for me anyway and i use it for just about everything that i groceries gas durable goods services you name it   the other card has a limit that is about 1/3 of the first and i use it for a few recurring bills and occasional purchases where they do n't take the first card   i also have a couple of department store cards that i use rather infrequently typically 1 purchase every 3 months or so   at the end of each month when the respective statements post each card has a balance that is 15 or less of the credit limit on that card   i pay off the entire balance on each card each month and the cycle repeats   i have never been late on a payment and my credit history for all of these cards goes back 10 years   my credit score is nearly as high as it can go   if having unused credit were a detriment i would expect my score to be much lower so no having too much credit available is not going to hurt you unless you are not using it at all or are tempted to abuse it use too much   the key is to use common sense   have a small number of cards keep them active spend within your means so you can pay off the balance in full after the statement posts and never be late on your payments   that 's all it takes to have good credit

i 'd answer it this way   what do you want to do i 'd say any amount is acceptable from as low as $ 100   when you look at the specific tree of investing paying $ 5 for a $ 100 seems unacceptable   however when observing the forest what does it matter if you waste $ 5 on a commission   your friends and maybe you probably waste more than $ 5 multiple times per day   for them buying a latte might empower them if buying another share of hd for a similar cost you than do it   in the end who will be better off studies show that the more important part of building a significant investment portfolio is actually doing it   rate of return and the cost of investing pales in comparison to actually doing it   how many of your peers are doing similar things   you are probably in very rare company if it makes you happy it is a wonderful way to spend your money

any person at any time may produce their own currency one can even do so on the back of a paper napkin ripped beer coaster or whatever   this is not a banking privilege it is within the lawful ability of anyone capable of engaging in commerce it is called a negotiable instrument it gives the holder rights to a sum of money   notice that i say holder this is what distinguishes it from a non negotiable instrument the fact that you do n't need to redeem it from source you can pass it to another who then becomes the holder in due course and thus obtains the rights the rights over a sum of money or indeed other asset are themselves value do banks do this   yes all the time one of the simplest examples are cheques drawn against the bank which are considered as good as cash   usually they will be drawn out to the order of the person you wish to pay but can equally be drawn out to bearer   the only reasons they resist making out to bearer is but you can write your own at any time on any thing see the yet entertaining tale of the negotiable cow

i think it 's great idea   many large brokerages give customers access to a pretty sizable list of zero commission zero load funds   in this list of funds will certainly be an s&p 500 index   so you can open your account for free deposit your $ 1,000 for free and invest it in an s&p index for no cost   you 'll pay a very negligible amount in annual expense fees and you 'll owe taxes on your gain if you have to use the money   i do n't follow the school of thought that all investment money should be in retirement account jail but i think if you have your spending under control you have your other finances in order and just want to place money somewhere you 're on the right track with this idea

what is a dividend essentially for every share of a dividend stock that you own you are paid a portion of the company ’s earnings you get paid simply for owning the stock for example let ’s say company x pays an annualized dividend of 20 cents per share most companies pay dividends quarterly four times a year meaning at the end of every business quarter the company will send a check for 1/4 of 20 cents or 5 cents for each share you own this may not seem like a lot but when you have built your portfolio up to thousands of shares and use those dividends to buy more stock in the company you can make a lot of money over the years the key is to reinvest those dividends source what is an ex dividend date once the company sets the record date the ex dividend date is set based on stock exchange rules the ex dividend date is usually set for stocks two business days before the record date if you purchase a stock on its ex dividend date or after you will not receive the next dividend payment instead the seller gets the dividend if you purchase before the ex dividend date you get the dividend source that said as long as you purchased the stock before you are entitled to the next dividend if not you 'll get the following one after that

it would be quite the miracle if you found that you know now just graduating college what your tax rate would be at retirement   but it 's fair to say that chances are that you 'll be in a higher tax bracket in years to come due to promotions better job or he joy of dual income after marriage so i 'd suggest roth for now with an eye towards pretax savings as your income and bracket rises ideally a retiree finds himself in a bracket no higher than while working but also not lower you see saving in roth 100 and missing the ability to withdraw at 0 10 and 15 is as bad as saving 100 in pretax and you retire in a higher bracket no one can tell you the best path but at any given moment the highest probability outcome may be visible

according to your scenario then if gen xers are making less money then they 'll also be working longer thereby keeping millenials out of those jobs for even longer thereby reducing millenials earning expectations even further the gen xers are already in a better position because they are more likely to have experience in a given industry the millenials often lack even that and in addition they are likely to have large student debts because they paid more for college in the first place and no way of paying it back    i really do n't see how the generation attempting to enter the workforce now has any advantages over their everything is stacked against them i 'm not saying it 's good for other generations but it is worst for millenials it will probably be even worse for future generations

former financial analyst here happy to help you first off you are right to not be entirely trusting of advisors and attorneys they are usually trustworthy but not always and when you are new to this the untrustworthy ones have a habit of reaching you first you 're their target market i 'll give you a little breakdown of how to plan and a starting investment first figure out your future expenses a lot of that money may go to medical bills or associated care do n't forget the costs of modifications and customizations to items so you can have a better quality of life cars can be retrofit to assist you with a you can build a chair lift into a things like that which will be important for mobility all depending on the lingering medical conditions mobility and independence will be critically important for you your past expenses are the best predictor of future expenses so filter out the one time legal and medical costs and use those to predict second for investing there is a simple route to get into the stock market and hopefully you will hear it a lot exchange traded funds etfs you 'll hear the s&p 500 increased by 80 points today on the news the s&p is a combination of 500 different stocks and is used to gauge the market overall you can buy an exchange traded fund as a stock and it 's an investment in all those components there 's an etf for almost anything but the most popular ones are for those big indexes i would suggest putting a few hundred thousand into an s&p 500 indexed etf do it at maybe $ 10,000 per month so you spread the money out and ensure you do n't buy at a market peak and then let it sit there for many years you can buy stocks through online brokerages like scottrade or etrade and they make it fairly easy they even have local offices that you can visit for help stocks are the easiest way to invest once you 've done this you can also open a ira a type of retirement account with special tax benefits and contribute several thousand dollars to it per year i 'll be happy to give more advice if when you need it but there are a number of good books for beginning investors that can explain it better than i. i would suggest that you avoid real estate especially if you expect to move overseas as it is significantly more complicated and has maintenance costs and taxes

for me the main benefit of using duplicate checks is that the copy is created automatically   if i had to take an extra step whether taking a photo or writing on a stub i would probably not always remember to do it   there is also the issue that you might need to write a check when you do n't have your smartphone with you or it is broken or has a dead battery etc there are various pros and cons of having an electronic record versus a paper record   a paper copy of a check is more vulnerable to physical loss or intrusion but an electronic record is more vulnerable to hacking   you also have to keep the images organized somehow and take care of data security and backups for the images   you 'll have to evaluate which is the greater concern for you a minor side point is that check duplicates often omit the account number and obscure your signature   a photo of the original check would include both of these as far as evidence it seems to me they 're both equally good evidence that you wrote the check but that 's not really that useful   in most sorts of disputes what you would need to prove is that you actually delivered the check to the intended recipient and neither the photo nor the paper copy is evidence of that   you could have written the check taken your photo copy and then torn it up

if the interest rate on the student loan is lower than inflation then the student loan will be cheaper the longer you take to pay it    this is now a very rare instance but there were programs and loan consolidation opportunities in the 's that allowed savvy student 's to convert their loans to have an interest rate of around 1.5 right now the inflation rate is actually quite low but it 's not expected to stay there and was n't that low just a few years ago so in the long run this type of debt will only be cheaper the longer it takes to pay off it is risky as others point out as it ca n't be written off in bankruptcy but there are other situations where it can be written off more easily than other debts so on balance the risks are n't better or worse than other loans in general   for specific individual situations the risk equation might work out differently though further student loans are n't considered traditional debt by some lenders for specific lending opportunities thus allowing you to go into greater debt for certain types of purchases   whether this is good for you or not depends on the importance of the purchase if you need to buy a house and the interest rate is higher than your student loan rate it will be better financially to pay off the house first while paying the minimum on the student loans    if you have no other debt with a higher interest and the student loan interest is higher than inflation there is no reason to delay paying off the student loan

you seem to have a little confusion over terminology that should be cleared up you are calling this day trading day trading is the term for performing multiple trading actions in a single day while it appears that the coo has performed a buy and a sell on the same day most people would consider this a single trade in reality it seems that the coo had stock options a contract providing the option for the holder to buy stock at a specific price at some point in the future provided as part of his compensation package he decided or was required to exercise those options today this means he bought the shares using his special option price it is extremely common for employees who exercise stock options to sell all of the resulting stock immediately this is very different from usual day trading which implies that he would have bought stock in the morning at a low price and then sold it later at a high price you are calling this insider trading that term specifically often implies some level of unethical behavior in general stock options offered to executive employees are strictly limited in how they can be exercised for example most stock option plans require employees to wait x number of years before they can exercise them this gives the employee incentive to stay longer and for a high level executive with the ability to strongly impact company performance it gives incentive to do well technically you are correct this is likely considered an insider trade but given that it seems to have been a stock option exercise it does not necessarily imply that there was any special reasoning for why he did the trade today it could simply be that today was the first day the stock option rules allowed him to exercise as to your final question no these profits are the coo 's to do with as he likes

how i understand it is supply demand affect price of stock    negatively positively respectively correct volume is the amount of buying selling activity in these stocks more    volume = more fluctuation right sort of   higher volume means higher liquidity   that is a stock that is traded more is easier to trade   it does n't necessarily mean more fluctuation and in the real world it often means that these are well understood stocks with a high amount of analyst coverage   this tends towards these stocks not being as volatile as smaller stocks with less liquidity company revenue and profit will help an investor predict company    growth that is one factor in a stock price   there are certain stocks that you would buy without them making a profit because their future revenue looks potentially explosive   however these stocks are very risky and are bubble prone if you 're starting out in the share market it 's generally a good idea to invest in index funds i am not a broker my advice should not be taken as financial advice   these funds aggregate risk by holding a lot of different companies   also statistics have shown that over time buying and holding index funds long term tends to dramatically outperform other investment strategies particularly for people with low amounts of capital

some of the information on the form would have been useful to complete the income tax paperwork the next spring it would have had numbers for taxes and interest that were addressed at the settlement it is possible it is mixed in with the next years tax information if i needed a form from 15 years ago i would n't ask the real estate agent i would ask the settlement company they might have a copy of the paperwork they might have to retrieve it from an archive so it could take time and they could charge a fee the local government probably does n't have a copy of the but they do have paperwork documenting the sale price when the transaction took place i know that the jurisdictions in my area have on line the tax appraisal information going back a number of years they also list all the purchases because of the change in ownership and many also list any name changes   you probably do n't want a screen capture of the transactions page but the tax office might have what you need this is the same information that the title search company was retrieving for their report question is there going to be capital gains for a single person there is no gains unless the increase in price is $ 250,000 for a couple it is $ 500,000 i am ignoring any time requirements because you mentioned the purchase was 15 years ago i am also assuming that it was never a rental property because that would require a lot more paperwork

the reason on line savings accounts ally capitalone american express and many others provide much higher rates than brick and mortar banks is because they 're not brick and mortar they do not need to pay for a huge amount of real estate utilities public facing employees inter office mail security etc etc all that allows them to pay more for your money the back office of these banks is the same as that of chase boa or wells fargo its just that they do n't have the enormous expense of having a branch in every neighborhood while still reaching all the same population of depositors so no its not a scam these are reputable banks some have physical offices for example i know that capitalone has some branches in new york some do n't iirc neither ally nor american express federal saving bank have physical branches but they 're banks nonetheless insured as required by fdic or ncua in case of credit unions and provide all the same services for less or all the same savings for more if you will imho giving 0.01 apr is a scam not the other way around the old style banks want your money for free and you 're worried why would someone else treat you better well that 's why the us has one of the most retarded financial systems in the western world

while the other people have tried to answer your question as thoroughly as possible i fear they are entirely incorrect in answering your question itself as it stands the answer is that there are no usual terms there are a handful of different options coming out now for this exact scheme examples include the uk governments help to buy scheme is offered at a normal rate and a small portion of the rent is set aside each month at the end of a fixed period that money becomes a deposit which the letter hands over to a mortgage provider who accepts it as a deposit this might well be a terminology thing since the other scenario which people described falls into the same name you 've used that scenario is where the investor who owns the property is considering sale of the property and is happy to negotiate a price up front for the next year usually the rent and price is higher than the market rate because if the market goes well over the next year they could end up out of pocket putting that into perspective over that year they are gaining their $ 1,000 a month or so but having $ 100,000 invested means a return of 12 if the property value is over $ 250,000 which i believe to be more likely they are achieving a return of i think 4.8 that 's not a bad rate by any means but realistically they are losing a bit more for maintenance and they could be making more from their money if the market were to go up in that time by more than 4.8 my house for instance increased in value by over 15 in the last 12 months they are making a substantial loss since you are getting a house at 15 below the market rate the total works out to a loss for them note that i do n't know the us housing market at all i 'm speaking mostly from my experience of the market here in the uk this is what i hear what i see and what i 've played to a bit make sure you check your terms before signing anything

its a topic and to answer your question in full will require a book with a small booklet of legal advice attached to it i 'm not going to write it here but i 'll give you some very specific points to start your research with arm big no no do n't touch that get rid of those you have any way you can and then never ever do it again that 's the kind of crap that got us into the housing bubble mess to begin with especially with the rates as low as now the only future with arm is that you 're going to pay more way more than your initial period payments rates the rates now are very low they were even lower 12 24 months ago but are still extremely low make sure you get a fixed rate loan in order to lock these rates in for the remainder of the loan any arm loan will have higher rates in the future so go with fixed rate period fixed rate loans are given for periods up to 30 years the shorter the period the lower the rate however at the level they 're now you 're practically getting money for free the apr is comparable to the inflation even for 30 yr fixed loans pmi private mortgage insurance since you do n't have much equity the lender is likely to require you paying pmi this is a significant amount of money you pay until you have at least 20 equity it changes from lender to lender so shop around and compare government assistance that 's what the broker was referring to there were programs allowing people refinance even under water mortgages check what programs are still available in your area some banks will not refinance with less than 20 equity but some government assistance programs may help you get a loan even if you do n't have enough equity closing fees and points that 's the money out of your pocket shop around these vary wildly generally credit unions being non profits are cheaper on this item specifically while comparable to big banks on everything else

my answer is n't a full one but that 's because i think the answer depends on at minimum the country your broker is in the type of order you place limit market algo etc and the size of your order for example i can tell from watching live rates on regular lot limit orders i place with my uk based broker that they hold limit orders internally until they see a crossing rate on the exchange my requested stock is trading on then they submit a limit order to that exchange   i only get filled from that one exchange and this happens noticeably after i see my limit price print and my fills are always better than my limit price whereas with my us based broker i can see my regular limit order in the order book depth of book data prior to any fills   i will routinely be notified of a fill before i see the limit price print   and my fills come from any number of us exchanges nyse arca bats etc even for the same stock i should point out that the nbbo rule in the us under sec regulation probably causes more complications in handling of market and limit orders than you 're likely to find in most countries

there are probably many correct answers to this question but for most people the main reason is qualified dividends to be a qualified dividend and therefore eligible for lower tax rates the dividend paying stock or fund must be held for more than 60 days during the period that begins 60 days before the ex dividend date since many stocks and funds pay out dividends at the end of the year that means it takes until to late february to determine if you held them and therefore made the dividend qualified brokerages do n't want to send out 1099s in january and then possibly have to send out revised versions if you decide to sell something that paid a dividend in december that otherwise would have been qualified

the problem is that both the h1b and l1 visas have problems and are gamed and this is what is probably causing resentment   h1b visas have quotas that run out in one day a year it means for a company to employ someone with skills they need to throw a bunch of them at this yearly crap shoot and hope they manage to win a visa for one of them   the rest will have to wait another year to try again   this is not how businesses employ if they find a highly skilled foreign worker with skills they ca n't find in the us and are even willing to pay him more than anyone in the us they ca n't unless they want to play that yearly gamble   a highly skilled employee also do n't want to sit around waiting for it so they 'll work for someone else   the l1 visa at least allows large multi national companies to first employ people at one of their foreign offices for a year before them over to the us   it 's also good in a way to be able to figure out if the employee is as good as he seems on paper and in interviews even before he gets to the usa   this means most of the better skills probably enter the usa this way which leaves the h1b visas to who systematically game the system   they find a lot of young graduate applicants who are willing to wait for the yearly crapshoot and then take all those who win a visa and then employ them and contract them out competitively   the l1 visa can also be systematically gamed those who do n't win an h1b visa could be working for a foreign office of this consultancy in the meantime and then get a transfer to the usa on an l1 visa   i think what needs to happen is that the h1b visa bar should be raised e.g. a minimum salary and then the quotas should be spread over a year like they do in the uk   that means companies have more certainty that they can actually bring a skilled worker in and it would make sure it 's a skilled worker and not someone who is just a cheaper worker   then that would ideally shift the route for most skilled workers to h1b instead of l1 visas which means l1 visas can be tightened to make sure they are used appropriately too for example having to have worked for the company for 2 years instead of one and also a minimum salary

you are on the right path but this is actually an equivalent annual cost problem you have to take it a step further and divide the npv by the annuity factor   you need to calculate the annuity factor and divide the investment by that amount     annuity factor = /r    we know the annual cost of the the current forklift = $ 5k. we need to figure out the equivalent annual cost of the new forklift   investment annuity factor + annual cost =    therefore $ 20 k 1 ^ 10 0.04 = $ + annual maintenance = $ therefore it makes sense to replace the old machine

well that will depend on the time frame you are looking at it you ca n't compare the rsi on a five minute chart to the rsi on a daily chart the minute chart would represent the momentum of very small trends whilst the daily chart would represent the momentum of much larger trends on the daily chart the shares might be experiencing a strong uptrend with a rising rsi during each day the price might move up at the open then come down some then back up a bit more and repeat this several times during the day before closing higher during the day the rsi might have moved slightly higher   but during a single day on the 5 minute chart the price may have gone through several up and down trends with the rsi going into oversold and overbought several times what you should be looking at to strengthen the signal from the rsi is to watch for when the rsi is in the overbought at the same time the price is reaching a peak or when the rsi is in the oversold at the same time the price is reaching a these could represent potential turning points in price the time frame to use would depend on the type of trading you are attempting to undertake if you prefer day trading being in and out of a trade in minutes to hours you might look at time frames of minutes to hours if you prefer longer term position trend or swing trading you would probably stick to daily charts if you prefer longer term active investing you might stick to a combination of daily weekly and monthly charts

this is bad statistics if you look at people who jumped ship of course you 're going to see bigger increases in salary because you 're not counting those that looked for a new job and did n't find a better offer they stayed put   people are complacent but companies are too employers are n't putting a lot of effort into firing bad employees as soon as they can so there are employees that are n't jumping ship and could be paid more but there are also employees that should be kicked off the ship and paid less but are n't   all that said staying put is easier than moving and there 's a price for it if you 're willing to move around you might do better might not if you only look around at the ones that did move of course it 's going to look like they did better

how in the world is it the perfect vehicle to hide theft   every single transaction is publicly recorded and the best you can do is try to obfuscate that yet even if you get away with a crime today the ledger is open for anyone to analyze study survey and if you are caught later down the road with that wallet such as an file on a computer you will be linked to the crime you committed    plus you ca n't do anything nearly of any size and cashing out means revealing your identity through the exchanges which are under constant surveillance    so please tell me again how it 's the perfect vehicle to hide theft because i 'm sure the silk road chief who is sitting in jail would love to hear your tips

some pros and cons to renting vs buying some advantages of buying when you rent the money you pay is gone when you buy assuming you do n't have the cash to buy outright but get a mortgage some of the payment goes to interest but you are building equity ultimately you pay off the mortgage and you can then live rent free when you buy you can alter your home to your liking you can paint in the colors you like put in the carpet or flooring you like heck tear down walls and alter the floor plan subject to building codes and safety consideration of course if you rent you are usually sharply limited in what alterations you can make in the u.s. mortgage interest is tax deductible rent is not property taxes are deductible from your federal income tax so if you have say $ 1000 mortgage vs $ 1000 rent the mortgage is actually cheaper advantages of renting there are a lot of transaction costs involved in buying a house you have to pay a realtor 's commission various legal fees usually loan origination fees to the bank etc plus the way mortgages are designed your total payment is the same throughout the life of the loan but for the first payment you owe interest on the total balance of the loan while the last payment you only owe interest on a small amount so early payments are mostly interest this leads to the conventional advice that you should not buy unless you plan to live in the house for some reasonably long period of time exact amount varying with whose giving the advice but i think 3 to 5 years is common one mitigating factor bear in mind that if you buy a house and then after 2 years sell it and you discover that the sale price minus purchase price minus closing costs ends up a net minus say $ 20,000 it 's not entirely fair to say i lost $ 20,000 by buying if you had not bought this house presumably you would have been renting so the fair comparison is mortgage payments plus losses on the resale compared to likely rental payments for the same period

it 's all about access to capital you can borrow against 401ks up to an extent you can borrow against cds outside of tax sheltered retirement plans you ca n't borrow against an ira although there is a situation with a very small time frame that would still be state sanctioned with no tax penalties i would n't recommend it annuities come with penalties i 've looked at many possibilities of accessing retirement capital without penalty and 401k 's offer that ability but its also good to just have savings accounts and investments that are not tax deferred borrowing against 401k pros   cons outside of your general expenses and play money money you put toward say a house should be non tax deferred because if you like borrowing you can always borrow against the house or any property the root of the problem is liquidity and access to capital understanding those fundamental concepts will answer most questions am i liquid yes no can i be liquid without losing money yes no as usual more is more adjust your priorities accordingly

just so i 'm the end result is a long call and you think the stock is going up there is nothing wrong with that fundamentally   be aware though that 's a negative theta trade this means if your stock does n't increase in price during the remaining time to expiration of your call option the option will lose some of its value every day it may still lose some of its value every day depending on how much the stock price increases the value of the call option just goes down and down as it approaches maturity even if the stock price stays about the same being long a call or a put is a tough way to make money in the options market   i would suggest using an out of the money butterfly spread the potential returns are a bit less however this is a cheap positive theta trade so you avoid time decay on the value of the option

other than the exchange risk one more thing to consider is interest rate risk and the returns you are generating from your money if it is lying around in a current account with no interest then it is rational to keep it where you intend to or aus now if your money is working for you earning interest or has been invested in the market then it seems reasonable that you should put it where it earns the maximum for you but that comes with a rider the exchange risk you may have to bear if you are converting between the currencies do the returns earned by your money cancel out the fx rates moving up and down and still leave you with a positive return compared with what you would earn if your money was where you stayed consider the below scenarios do evaluate all your options before you transfer your money

i 'm kind of shocked that no formal behavioral modeling has been proposed as an explanation yet one such model would be steep hyperbolic quasi hyperbolic discounting   consumers would rather pay for popcorn later than for an expensive movie ticket now   for instance consumers might when purchasing the ticket see a low value of popcorn and view the ticket price as the whole price because they do not predict purchasing popcorn   then when entering the theater the present value of popcorn is very high and they purchase it   there might therefore be a market for a commitment device such as a theater to make the appropriate decision ex ante   another commitment device that seems to be practiced is when individuals sneak their own popcorn into the theater   they may not actually want the popcorn but by bringing their own they ensure they do not purchase the theater 's

joke warning these days it seems that rogue trading programs are the big market makers this concludes the joke historically exchange members were market makers one or more members guaranteed a market in a particular stock and would buy whatever you wanted to sell or vice versa in a balanced market one where there were an equal number of buyers and sellers the spread was indeed profit for them to make this work market makers need an enormous amount of liquidity ability to hold an inventory of stocks to deal with temporary imbalances and a day like october 29 1929 can make that liquidity evaporate i say historically because i do n't think that any stock market works this way today i was discussing this very topic with a colleague last week went to wikipedia to look at the structure of the nyse and saw no mention of exchange members as market makers in fact it appears that the nyse is no longer a member based exchange instead today most all trading happens on electronic crossing networks where the spread is simply the difference between the highest bid and lowest ask in a liquid stock there will be hundreds if not thousands of orders clustered around the current price usually diverging by fractions of a cent in an illiquid stock there may be a spread but eventually one bid will move up or one ask will move down or new bids will come in you could claim that an entity with a large block of stock to move takes the role of market maker but it does n't have the same meaning as an exchange market maker since there 's no entity between the bidder and asker there 's no profit in the spread just a fee taken   by the ecn edit i think you have a misconception of what the spread is it 's simply the difference between the highest bid and the lowest offer at the instant a trade takes place the spread is 0 the highest bid equals the lowest offer and the bidder and seller exchange shares for money as soon as that trade is completed the spread re appears the only way that a trade happens is if buyer and seller agree on price the traditional market maker is simply an entity that has the ability to buy or sell an effectively unlimited number of shares however if the market maker sets a price and there are no buyers then no trade takes place and if there 's another entity willing to sell shares below the market maker 's price then the buyers will go to that entity unless the market 's rules forbid it

both models understand that the value of a company is the sum total of all cashflows in the future discounted back to the present they vary in their definition of cash the gordon growth model uses dividends as a proxy for cashflow under the assumption that this is the only true cash received by shareholders in theory counting cash is meaningless if there 's no eventual end game where the accumulated cash is up amongst the owners the gordon model is best used to value companies that have an established reliable dividend the company should be stable and the payout ratio high will underestimate the value of firms that consistently maintain a low payout ratio and instead accumulate cash there are multiple dcf models a firm valuation measures all cash available to both equity and debt holders a traditional equity valuation measures all cash that can be claimed by shareholders while the latter seems most intuitive and pertinent to a shareholder the former is very good at showing what a company can do regardless of their choice of capital structure a small add on to a firm valuation is the concept of eva or economic value add where the return on capital all capital both debt and equity is compared to the blended cost of capital the dcf model is more flexible optimistic than the gordon in its approach to cash the approach can be applied to many types of companies at every stage in their maturity even if they do n't pay a dividend a simplistic or single stage dcf is similar to the gordon the assumption is that the company is fully mature growing at a rate perhaps just slightly above inflation forever for younger companies a multi stage dcf can be employed where you forecast fairly confident numbers for the next 3 5 years then 3 5 years beyond that the forecast is less certain but assumed to be slowing growth and a generally maturing stabilizing company and then the steady state stage is tacked on to the end you 'll want to check out professor damodaran 's website he addresses all this and so much more and has a big pile of spreadsheets freely downloadable to get you started i also highly recommend his book investment valuation it 's the bible on the topic

the only advantage of changing all your money now to the new currency is that you might get a better conversion rate now than later so you get more of the new currency and you may pay a lower percentage fee for changing a larger sum of money however regarding the better conversion rate you will not know this except with hindsight the disadvantage of changing all at once is that if you have changed too much and need to change back to your own currency or a third currency you will be charged fees and lose on the conversion rate twice if you know how long you are going to be in the new country say 12 months maybe start by converting an amount you think you will be spending in a month if you spend more then you can change a bit more the next month or if you spend less change less the next month if you find you are spending similar amounts for the next month or so then you can budget on the amount you may be spending for the remainder of your stay and then convert this amount over if you have a little left over at the end of your stay maybe reward yourself with something or buy a present for someone special back at home if you need a little more just convert this amount in the last month or so

benefit from lower interest rates because it decreases the rate at which they can borrow from the federal reserve from   but what matters is the spread if rates on the borrowing and lending side go down the spread shrinks which makes banks less profitable that 's why bank stocks go up when higher rates are anticipated you can think of a bank stock as being long interest rates   that 's why bank stocks have lagged the rest of the market during this long bull market   's assets are n't all debt   the vast majority is for most banks gs and ms are the rare exceptions

to the best of my knowledge in california there 's no such thing as registering a place as a business there 's zoning residential commercial mixed etc and there 's a business registered at a place but there 's no place registered as a business so you better clarify what it is that you think your landlord did it may be that the place is used for short term rentals in which case the landlord may have to have registered a business of short term rentals there depending on the local municipal or county rules specifically regarding the deposit however there 's a very clear treatment in the california law the landlord must provide itemized receipt for the amounts out of the deposit that were used and the prices should be reasonable and based on the actual charges by the actual vendors if you did n't get such a receipt or the amounts are bogus and unsubstantiated you have protection under the ca law

dollar cost averaging will allow you to reduce your risk while the stock prices falls provided you must invest a fixed amount $ x on a fixed time scale i.e. every y days by doing this you will be able to take advantage of the lowering price by obtaining more shares per period as the price falls but at the same time if it starts to rise you will already have your pig in the race   example suppose you wanted to invest $ 300 in a company we will do so over 3 periods as the price falls your average dollar cost will as well but since you do n't know where the bottom is you can not wait until the bottom by trying to guess the bottom and dumping all of your investment at once you expose yourself to a higher level of risk

once again this depends entirely on your definition of rational as it comes to money the idea that the rational thing to do with more money than you can spend is to maximize the amount of money you make that you still ca n't spend is arbitrary and really comes down an expression of personal values rather than any kind of rationality   it 's not at all inconsistent for mayweather to feel that the value of making good investments is to demonstrate his ability to make good investments again not about some utility function to maximize value but about power success and telling the world to fuck itself   look at the top voted comment in this thread    gt i have a feeling its because he does n't know what he 's supposed to do with checks   then look at this one down in the middle somewhere below yours   gt like most fighters before 2006 he fought under a promo company top rank he would get his guaranteed purse for fights and that was that instead of taking an $ 8 m payday he decided to cut out the middle man bob and bought out his contract for k and decided to promote the fights himself mayweather promotions instead of just getting his purse he now got a cut of every revenue stream involved in a fight ppv tickets broadcasting rights etc   mayweather is saying to the world you look at me and you see some guy who ca n't even read a cheque but the joke 's on you i know what i 'm doing so much that i can throw away more money than you 'll ever make just by not cashing a cheque and i do n't give a fuck   he 's also a woman beating asshole of course

when you are putting your money in an index fund you are not betting your performance against other asset classes but rather against competing investments withing the same asset class the index fund always wins due to two factors diversity and lower cost   the lower cost attribute is essentially where you get your performance edge over the longer run that is why if you look at the universe of mutual funds where you get your diversification very few will have beaten the index assuming they have survived winters

first i do n't think your parents are ripping you off but you should get your agreement in writing the fact that you never own more than 25 does n't matter if the condo 's value is increasing you are in fact building equity your share of the equity just does n't increase but it does n't decrease either for example if the condo is worth $ 300,000 now you have $ 75,000 in equity of course if the value is decreasing so is your equity if you are paying $ 500/month in interest as op clarified above and you do n't have a written agreement you are probably unable to claim that payment as mortgage interest if you itemize your deductions on u.s. federal or state tax returns thus you may be losing out on a legal tax deduction assuming you earn enough to itemize they will need to give you each year the proper irs form for mortgage interest form 1098 and they have to claim the $ 500/month as interest income on their tax returns having a written and signed contract eliminates confusion and potential for misunderstanding the future and it sounds like you are already experiencing some doubt and confusion now your rate seems within market rates for an interest only loan let 's say you wanted to buy out your parents share of the condo right now would you pay $ 115,000 or would you have to get an appraisal to find out what the condo is worth now if you ca n't answer that question you need to get that in writing so that you wo n't have an argument over it someday if the condo has appreciated significantly and all you have to pay is the $ 115,000 then that 's a sweet deal for you because you 'd be buying out a much more valuable property for much less than it 's worth if that is the agreement and the property is appreciating no guarantee especially with condos then you are essentially building equity if the property is declining in value and you do wish to sell it then you wo n't have to pay $ 115,000 they 'll just end up with their 75 share which will be less than the $ 115 k they invested both of you would lose some of your investment but you would have had all the benefits of living in a nice condo all those years and they would n't they are definitely taking more risk than you are second if you had $ 40,000 cash saved up your parents probably raised you with some good financial sense and work ethic so i 'm optimistic they have good intentions for your future operate from that frame of mind when you go to ask for a written agreement next read up about equity share agreements there are many models that will help inform your decisions but you should engage a real estate lawyer to help you draw up a fair agreement for both parties   i was in an equity share agreement for my first townhouse it 's a common practice and it wo n't cost all that much to get one created it 's worth the money to get it done properly

as mentioned in the comments the problem stems with converting your u.s. dollars to indian rupees so as to be able to purchase an indian fixed deposit at the time of writing this 1 u.s. dollar = 64 indian rupees consider the following economic factors both of the above factors are not definitive but are worth considering you might be what if i never intend to convert my rupees back to dollars if it is the case that money converted to rupees would stay that way that then eliminates the risk of foreign exchange losses mentioned above however you must still keep in mind that part of the reason interest rates on fixed deposits is as high in india is because inflation is high a 9 return must be looked at after adjusting for inflation inflation is somewhere between at the time of writing which then reduces your real return to about 4 pre tax

in the unlikely case that noone finds a way to extract resources from the company and distribute them to shareholders periodically in a way that 's de facto equivalent to dividends any company can be dissolved the assets of the company would be sold for their market value the liabilities would have to be settled and the net result of all this company cash + sale results liabilities would be distributed to shareholders proportionally to their shares the liquidation value is generally lower than the market value of a company as an ongoing concern that 's making business and earning profit but it does put a floor on it 's value if the stock price is too low someone can buy enough stock to get control of the company vote to dissolve it and make a profit that way and the mere fact that this can happen props up the stock price companies could even be created for a limited time period in the first hand which has some historical precedent with shareholders of trading companies with lifetime of a single trade imagine that there is some company where shareholders want to receive $ 1 m of its cash as dividends they can make appropriate contracts that will form a new company called that will take over all the ongoing business and assets except $ 1 m in cash and then liquidate and distribute it 's assets shares of and the dividend among themselves the main difference from normal dividends is that in this process you need cooperation from any lenders involved so if the company has some long term debts then they would need agreement from those banks in order to pay out dividends oh and everyone would have to pay a bunch more to lawyers simply to do dividends in this or some other convoluted way

if you have wage income that is reported on a w2 form you can contribute the maximum of your wages what you can afford or $ 5500 in a roth ira    one advantage of this is that the nominal amounts you contribute can always be removed without tax consequences so a roth ira can be a deep emergency fund i.e. if the choice is $ 2000 in cash as emergency fund or $ 2000 in cash in a 2015 roth ira contribution choice 2 gives you more flexibility and optimistic upside at the risk of not being able to draw on interest gains until you retire or claim losses on your tax return   if you let april 15 2016 pass by without making a roth ira contribution you lose the 2015 limit forever   if you are presently a student and partially employed you are most likely in the lowest marginal tax rate you will be in for decades which utilizes the roth tax game effectively    if you 're estimating a few hundred then what you pick as an investment is going to be less important than making the contributions   that is you can pick any mutual fund that strikes your fancy and be prepared to gain or lose call it $ or pick a single stock and be prepared to lose it all   at some point you need to understand your emotions around volatility and the only tuition for this school is taking a loss and having the presence of mind to examine any panic responses you may have   no reason not to learn this on a few hundred   while it 's not ideal to have losses in a roth a few hundred is not consequential in the long run    if you 're not prepared at this time in your life for the possibility of losing it all or will need the money within a year or few as your edit suggests keep it in cash and try to reduce your expenses to contribute more   can you contribute another $ 100   you will have more money at the end of the year than investment choice will likely return

you mention early exercise in your title but you seem to misunderstand what early exercise really means some companies offer stock options that vest over a number of years but which can be exercised before they are vested that is early exercise you have vested stock options so early exercise is not relevant it may or may not be the case that your stock options could have been early exercised before they vested but regardless you did n't exercise them so the point is moot as littleadv said 83(b election is for restricted stocks often from exercising unvested stock options your options are already vested so they wo n't be restricted stock so 83(b election is not relevant for you a taxable event happen when you exercise the point of the 83(b election is that exercising unvested stock options is not a taxable event so 83(b election allows you to force it to be a taxable event but for you with vested stock options there is no need to do this you mention that you want it not to be taxable upon exercise but that 's what incentive stock options isos are for isos were designed for the purpose of not being taxable for regular income tax purposes when you exercise although it is still taxable upon exercise for amt purposes and it is only taxed when you sell however you have non qualified stock options were you given the option to get isos at the beginning why did your company give you i do n't know the specifics of your situation but since you mentioned early exercise and 83(b elections i have a hypothesis as to what might have happened for people who early exercise for plans that allow early exercise there is a slight advantage to having compared to isos this is because if you early exercise immediately upon grant and do 83(b election you pay no taxes upon exercise because the difference between strike price and fmv is 0 and there are no taxes upon vesting for regular or amt and if you hold it for at least 1 year upon sale it will be long term capital gains on the other hand for isos it 's the same except that for long term capital gains you have to hold it 2 years after grant and 1 year after exercise so the period for long term capital gains is longer so companies that allow early exercise will often offer employees either or isos where you would choose if you intend to early exercise or iso otherwise if hypothetically that 's what happened then you chose wrong because you got and did n't early exercise

the pricing model makes all inverse leveraged etf decay over time when the price gets low the manager can once again do a stock split to make the share price more attractive the manager usually states a price range that will prompt a stock split but actually doing the split is at their discretion the russell 2000 has to decrease a lot yes but probably just a flash crash of 10 in a day can extend the to extremely high bids and asks a flash crash that far through the order books would wreck the liquidity of all the underlying assets and especially the derivatives products based on derived from those assets so a mathematical formula to price the etf during a period of high volatility and low liquidity becomes a lot less of a science and more of a random walk a good example of this would be to look at the 2010 flash crash and the price behavior of the etf where it spiked to $ from maybe $

the only reason i can think of would be if you were convinced that you could n't hold on to your money treasury bonds are often viewed as very safe investments and often used in some situations where cash is n't appropriate also they typically have a somewhat patriotic theme helping your country to grow in addition many people do n't really pay attention to the rate of the bonds but are just investing in them the more people investing in them the lower the yields become but the bottom line is i would invest in a savings account any day over a negative interest rate and it looks like i 'm in good company as well a quick study of reports seems to indicate that these are a very bad investment

in some cases it might be rational to pay low interest debt first because the consequences of defaulting on that debt are worse    consider this simplified example   suppose you have two debts a low interest mortgage secured by your house and a high interest unsecured credit card debt both of which are within a few years of being paid off   there is a chance that sometime between now and then something will happen to disrupt your income e.g. medical problems and it wo n't be possible to make the payments on either loan    defaulting on the credit card loan will result in a lower credit score and calls from collection agencies   defaulting on the mortgage will result in the foreclosure or forced sale of your house at best forcing you to move and at worst leaving you homeless at a time when you are also facing other e.g. medical problems   so you might rationally judge that losing your house is much worse than bad credit   therefore you might rationally conclude that it would be better to direct extra income toward paying down the mortgage to increase the chances that if and when an income disruption might occur the mortgage would already be paid off   in other words you shorten the window of time where income disruption results in foreclosure you might decide that this increased security is worth the extra interest you will pay compared to the strategy where you pay the high interest loan first this is a fairly special situation but you asked why might it be a good idea to do this and i am just giving an example where it could rationally be considered a good idea    of course in a real life version of this example there might be other options available such as refinancing the mortgage   if you like you could imagine a more extreme example where the lower interest debt is owed to the who will come and break your if you miss a payment

the price of a company 's stock at any given moment is established by a ratio of buyers to sellers   when the sellers outnumber the buyers at a given price the stock price drops until there are enough people willing to buy the stock to balance the equation again   when there are more people wanting to purchase a stock at a given price than people willing to sell it the stock price rises until there are enough sellers to balance things again   so given this it 's easy to see that a very large fund or collection of very large funds buying or selling could drive the price of a stock in one direction or another because the sheer number of shares they trade can tip the balance one way or another    what 's important to keep in mind though is that the ratio of buyers to sellers at any given moment is determined by market sentiment and speculation   people selling a stock think the price is going down and people buying it think it 's going up and these beliefs are strongly influenced by news coverage and available information relating to the company   so in the case of your company in the example that would be expected to triple in value in the next year if everyone agreed that this was correct then the stock would triple almost instantly   the only reason the stock does n't reach this value instantly is that the market is split between people thinking this is going to happen and people who think it wo n't    over time news coverage and new information will cause one side to appear more correct than the other and the balance will shift to drive the price up or down   all this is to say that yes large funds and their movements can influence a stock 's trading value but their movements are based upon the same news information analysis and sentiment as the rest of the market   meaning that the price of a stock is much more closely tied to news and available information than day to day trading volumes   in short buying good companies at good prices is just as good as it 's ever been    also keep in mind that the fact that you can buy and sell stocks without having a huge impact on price is an advantage that you have   by slipping in or out at the right times in major market movements you can do things that a massive investment fund simply can not

some people have this notion that withdrawing dividends from savings    is somehow okay but withdrawing principal is not   note this notion would someone please explain the mistake on and why it 's a    mistake because there may be times where withdrawing principal may be a good idea as one could sell off something that has gained enough that in re balancing the portfolio there are capital gains that could be used for withdrawing in retirement how and why does the sale of financial instrument equate to the    receipt of dividends   in either case one has cash equivalents that could be withdrawn if you take the dividends in cash or sell a security to raise cash you have cash thus it does n't matter what origin it has if i sell a financial instrument that later    appreciates in value then this profit opportunity is lost in the    case of a dividend i 'd still possess the financial security and    benefit from the stock 's appreciation one could argue that the in the case of a dividend by not buying more of the instrument you are missing out on a profit opportunity as well thus are you out to make the maximum profit overall or do you have reason for taking the cash instead of increasing your holding

it 's a problem from hell because all solutions have drawbacks unintended consequences and because they are all pretty complex to implement in practice   breaking up the big banks so that no bank is enough to bring down the economy with it is the strongest move but is riddled with problems when you start looking at it practically how do you determine the maximum size a bank should have should it be based on assets systemic importance i.e. interconnectedness with other banks how do you enforce it banks will find ways to offload assets etc into special purpose corporations to get around the laws somehow how do you compensate for the fact that size does help financial efficiency in some ways   imposing higher capital requirements is the next solution but that too is not so easy to implement with full success in practice what should be classified as a low risk asset how much capital do you require against a cdo vs a mexican government bond how often do you need to revise these standards at what point does the cost of higher capital requirements start to strangle lending and financial flows   the weaker maneuvers are things like constant government imposed stress tests orderly resolution mechanisms higher standards for internal risk management practices etc but those may not be adequate and also have their implementation problems

they are actually pretty common and it 's the reason that anyone who takes a board seat at a company without insurance is playing russian roulette   now winning a shareholder suit on the merits whether personal or derivative liability is a whole different story at least in delaware fun fact de has two judicial systems one for corporate stuff with world class talent and one for everything else     there 's this doctrine called the business judgment rule which is a very high bar for a shareholder to overcome otherwise you 'd see shareholder suits for every business deal that went wrong   the other problem these uber investors might run into is they have n't realized a loss nor are they likely to have a negative return on the initial investment marking down a gain against a high water mark is an uphill battle   based on what it public idk the cause of action maybe kalanick is going back on contractual language in his separation agreement which is currently non public or that some of his actions as ceo could be considered self dealing again not information currently in the public domain or maybe it 's just a threat to put all the non public shitty things he has done in a and therefore put it in the public domain

if you are just starting out i would say there is no disadvantage to using a personal card for business expenses in fact the advantage of doing so is that the consumer protections are better on personal cards than on business cards   one possible advantage to business credit cards is that many but not all will not show up on your personal credit report unless you default this might help with average age of accounts if you have a thin credit file but otherwise it wo n't make much difference issuers also expect higher charge volumes on business cards so as your business grows might question a lot of heavy charges on a personal card whether this would ever happen is speculation but it 's worth being aware of it

it 's more complicated than that governments raise money in a number of ways   first they tax economic activity within their borders and for connected companies and individuals   then some governments have actual revenues from state owned enterprises licences patents courts business revenues and so on whatever shortage arises between state expenditure and this income is the deficit which is usually financed through debt government usually issues a bond wikipedia for a list of government bonds of various types some with extremely lengthy maturation dates   these bonds can be purchased both locally and by foreign investment funds   the nature of who buys is important from the wikipedia link you 'll see that most government debt is very highly rated based on the ability of the state to simply raise taxes in order to fund redemption   pension funds are legally bound to only invest in highly rated investment classes and the bulk of bonds may be purchased to support local pensioners a state that defaults on debt will first hit its own most vulnerable citizens   in addition the fall out will result in a cut in ratings   countries like argentina and zimbabwe which have both refused to repay their debts even to the imf are currently unable to raise investment at all   this has a tremendous impact on local economic development so default is out of the question without severe penalties the second part of your question is about paying down the debt   as debts increase more and more of the revenue that a country does earn is spent on servicing debt repayments   sometimes bonds are issued merely to refinance old debt   a country that spends too much on refinancing debt is no different from an individual   less and less money is available to do other things in conclusion governments can neither default nor binge borrow unless they wish to severely limit economic opportunities for their citizens

if there are a lot of houses for sale can you be sure that in a year or two you can sell yours how long does the average house in that area stay on the market before it is sold what percentage of houses never get sold   if it ca n't be sold due to the crowded market you will be forced to rent the house the question for you then is how much rental income can you get compare the rental income to your monthly cost of owning and managing the house   one benefit to buying a house in a market that is easy to rent a house would be if you are forced to move quickly then you are n't stuck being 3 months into a 12 month lease   keep in mind that markets can change rather dramatically in just a few years housing costs were flat for much of the 90 's then up in the first half of the last decade and after a big drop they are one a slow climb back up but the actual path they are on depends on the part of the us you are in   the rule of thumb in the past was based on the fact that over a few years the price would rise enough overcome the closing costs on the two transactions unfortunately the slow growth in the 90 's meant that many had to bring checks to closing because the equity gained was n't enough to overcome the closing costs due to low down payment loans    the fast growth period meant that people got into exotic loans to maximize the potential income when prices were going up 10 20 a year   when prices dropped some found that they bought houses they could n't afford but could n't sell to break even on the transaction they were stuck and had to default on the mortgage   in fact i have never seen a time frame when the rule of thumb ever applied

i think the real answer to your question here is diversification   you have some fear of having your money in the market and rightfully so having all your money in one stock or even one type of mutual fund is risky as all get out and you could lose a lot of your money in such a stock market based investment   however the same logic works in your rental property   if you lose your and are unable to find a new one right away or if you have some very rare problem that insurance does n't cover your property could become very much not a break even investment very quickly   in reality there is n't any single investment you can make that has no risk   your assets need to be balanced between many different market investments that includes bonds us stocks european stocks cash etc   also investing in mutual funds instead of individual stocks greatly reduces your risk another thing to consider is the benefits of paying down debt   while investments have a risk of not performing if you pay off a loan with interest payments you definitely will save the money you would have paid in interest    to be specific i 'd recommend the following plan

the mortgage is a debt and you pay interest on it typically more than you can earn elsewhere especially once taxes are taken into account by lowering the principal you lower the total interest you pay this is true whether you sell the house after 1 year 10 years or 100 years in your case prepayments made in the next few years would mean that when you sell your mortgage principal would be lower than it otherwise would have been and your house equity will be higher you can therefore either move up to more house for the same monthly payment or have a lower monthly payment for the same kind of house either of those are good things right now is the easiest time to find a little more money so do it if you can later you will have more obligations and develop a taste for more expensive things statistically speaking and therefore find a few hundred a month much harder to come by

no money is gone   the movement of the existing currency has slowed down   currency moves through the economy through deposits or loans to banks and withdrawal from banks as proceeds from loans or return of deposits   when a bank makes a loan they provide a balance in a bank account which is n't converted to hard currency until withdrawn   so those bank loans essentially count as currency and thus effectively multiply the stock of currency available   deposits into money market funds and those funds loans into the commercial paper markets have the same effect   banks and money funds are now making fewer loans   in particular they are not funding companies that invested in securitizations of home mortgages and credit card receivables but they are also lending less to businesses and consumers   because they are lending less they are effectively multiplying the currency less    think of deposited and lent currency as spare cycles on a desktop computer   you let your computer help decipher the genome when you are n't using it yourself   if you somehow feared that you would lose those cycles slowing down your own computing you would be less likely to lend those cycles out   there would still be the same number of computing cycles in the world but the stock of those available for actual computing would appear to be diminished   the technical term for this concept is monetary velocity and it is a crucial factor in the level of overall economic activity banking stability and inflation

i think everything in your case is just simply missing one important rule of how credit works essentially your mil can not get a loan you can you are making her a large loan that she can not get for herself that is all that is the essence of what this deal is it is not without interest she makes a financial contribution toward your son you get the deal in 2 years assuming she does n't default she will etc imagine it this way you are sitting in the dealership with the dealer and your mil she wants a loan to pay for the car the dealership says you are way not credit worthy so your mil says why does n't my son in law take out the loan instead now the dealership says sure that 's fine from the dealer 's standpoint every other part of your arrangement is irrelevant boring even the only magic trick is in who takes the loan out no other difference you 're letting your mil pull a car out of her sleeve like a and in taking the deal you 're believing her   this sentence i am pretty sure that the ex mil will not let me down i 've loaned her large sums of money before and she always promptly repaid   is everything you 're making a rather large bet that the things that can go wrong in two years including any situation involving your wife 's welfare are rather miniscule and furthermore that the few times she 's paid you back that did not convince banks and dealer she is more creditworthy justifies her good creditworthiness is the interest worth it do you really believe that your mil needs to wring a car out of you before she would consider contributing to her grandson 's well being which is essentially the interest but wait it 's not everything her daughter my ex wife would drive it for 2 years and then turn the car over to our son even if your mil is creditworthy the woman you described as follows her daughter though is a loose will be holding and returning the collateral in this deal things she can do include so i 'm arguing two points obviously my opinion on this is clear i hope i did a decent job of explaining where the components of this deal credit interest collateral play out in the eyes of a dealer or bank and get lost in the mechanics of the rules you worked out with your family

this is why minimum wage has not gone up   its a fallacy way of thinking   your business will be required to do one of 4 things   raise prices fire employees remove pointless expenses or you take a hit   more than likely you will attempt to do situation 1 because you need all your employees you currently have   if you could work with less employees as a business owner you would of already had done that   the next part is you will find things that are pointless   why are you paying for a certain type of yeast when you found out you can get the same type from someone else cheaper   finally you may have to take the hit to yourself   the market will balance itself out   however this is the big part people do nt understand   the larger companies like to dick people over as much as possible   you think walmart which already uses illegal workers on their farms has everything made in china is going to raise prices the exact same amount   of course not   they will raise prices but nothing like that and the only people who will be hurt is the companies profit sheets and the ceo pay   that is nothing that will ruin a company   furthermore that person who was making around 7 dollars an hour will have a higher income to spend and instead of purchasing crap bread from walmart they will now splurge sometimes and purchase higher end bread from such as yourself   i think people do nt understand that companies will do and always done everything they can to save money   walmart will have no choice but to either raise prices or not make as large of a profit as they once made   the company wo nt fail the economy will also continue but the wealth is now going to spread out more   i wish i could make more people understand this but alas they will believe that you ca nt raise prices because it will ruin the economy   what s ruining the economy is actually letting the min wage stay so low   it basically turns most people into indentured servants because they can barely afford to live   does that make sense

the obvious thing would happen 10 shares change owner at the price of $ 100 a partially still open selling order would remain market orders without limits means to buy or sell at the best possible or current price however this is not very realistic usually there is a spread between the bid and the ask price and the reason is that market makers are acting in between they would immediately exploit this situation for example by placing appropriately limited orders orders without limits are not advisable for stocks with low trading activity would you buy or sell stuff without caring for the price

because you 've sold something you 've received cash or at least an entry on your brokerage statement to say you 've got cash so you should record that as a credit in your brokerage account in gnucash the other side of the entry should go into another account that you create called something like open positions and is usually marked as a liability account type if you need to mark it as such if you want to keep an accurate daily tally of your net worth you can add a new entry to your open positions account and offset that against income which will be either negative or positive depending on how the position has moved for against you you can also do this at a lower frequency or not at all and just put an entry in when your position closes out because you bought it back or it expired or it was exercised my preferred method is to have a single entry in the open positions account with an arbitrary date near when i expect it to be closed and each time i edit that value daily or weekly so i only have the initial entry and the current adjust to look at which reduces the number of entries and confusion if there are too many

the bank number is part of the iban number so the swift code is actually redundant it is still required for international payments because every country has its own payment infrastructure the swift code helps to route it to the correct region without having to know every single bank in that region it is usually not needed for national payments but banks ask for it anyway so that both national and international payments follow the same process   when you enter a wrong swift then this is what will happen when the swift code does exist then in the internet age it should be possible for all of this to happen within seconds but it will still take a few days because reasons iban numbers are globally unique so when you entered the correct iban there is no chance that the money will arrive on a different account than you intended to also the first two digits after the country code are a checksum so when you accidently make a typo while entering an iban there is a 99 chance that this will be detected automatically

for a cheaper hedge you can try a call spread e.g if you shorted a stock at 40 but are worried that it can get bought out for 60 then buy a 50 60 bull call spread with appropriate number of contracts or even 50 55 this is better than just buying a 50 call as it will be expensive also the other option is not to short but buy a debit bear put spread 40 30 near the money and then buy an out of money call spread 55 60

there is no simple way to calculate how much house any given person can afford in the answer keshlam gave several handy rules of thumb are mentioned that are used as common screening devices to reject loans but in every case further review is required to approve any loan   the 28 rule is the gold standard for estimating how much you can afford but it is only an estimate all the details that you do n't want to provide are required to give you anything better than an estimate in the spirit of joetaxpayer 's answer i 'm going to give you a number that you can multiply your gross income by for a good estimate but my estimate is based on a 15 year mortgage assuming a 15 year mortgage with a 3 interest rate it will cost $ per $ 100,000 borrowed so to take those numbers and wrap it up in a bow you can multiply your income by and have the amount of mortgage that most people can afford if you have a down payment saved add it to the number above for the total price of the home you can buy after closing costs are added in property taxes and insurance rates vary widely and those are often rolled into the mortgage payment to be paid from an escrow account banks may consider all of these factors in their calculators but they may not be transparent if you ca n't afford to pay it in 15 years you really ca n't afford it compare the same $ 100k loan in 30 years at 4 you pay about $ with a total of about $ in interest over the life of the loan in 15 years at 3 you pay about $ but the total interest is only $ 24k and you are out of the loan in half of the time the equity earned in the first 5 years is also different with for the 15 year loan vs. 9.5 on the 30 year loan   without too far into general economics 15 year loans would also have averted the mortgage crisis of 2008 because more people would have had enough equity that they would n't have walked out on their homes when there was a price correction

in my experience when a salesperson says a particular deal is only good if you purchase right now 100 of the time it is not true of course i ca n't guarantee that is universally the case but if you leave and come back 5 minutes later or tomorrow or next week it 's extremely likely that they 'll still take your money for the original price in fact sometimes after you leave you get a call with even a lower price than the excellent offer most of the time when you are presented with high pressure sales accompanied by a this price is only good right now pitch it ends up being because they do n't want you to go search the competition and read reviews in this case you have already done that and deemed the item to be worthwhile perhaps a better tactic for the salesperson would have been to try to convince you that others are interested in the item and if you wait it might be sold to someone else at that excellent price sales is an art and it requires the salesperson to size you up and try to figure out your vulnerability and exploit it this particular salesperson obviously you and/or you do n't have an easily vulnerability i would n't let the shortcomings of the salesperson get in the way of your purchase if you are worried about the scenario of someone else up the item consider offering a deposit to hold the item for a certain amount of time while you reflect and/or arrange for the funds

is the mortgage debt too high the rental property is in a hot re market so could be easily sold with significant equity however they would prefer to keep it given the current income there is no stress however in absence of any other liquid cash near cash assets having everything locked into mortgage is quite high even if real estate builds assets these are highly illiquid investments have debt on such investments is risky if there are no other investments essentially everything looks fine now but if there is an crisis unwinding mortgage debt is time consuming and if it forces distress sale it would wipe out any gains can they afford another mortgage and in what amount e.g. they are considering $ 50 k for a small cabin which could be rented out i guess they can but should they or diversify into other assets like stocks etc other than setting cash aside what would be some good uses of funds to make sure the money would appreciate and outpace inflation and add a nice bonus to retirement mutual funds stocks 401 k or other such retirement plans they are currently in 's if there is one key strategy or decision they could make today that would help them retire early say 's what should it be this opinion based it depends on what their lifestyle is and what would they want their lifestyle to be when they retire they should look at saving enough corpus that would give an year on year yield equivalent to the retirement expenses

the technical term of a recession is 2 successive quarters of negative gdp growth as is the natural cycle the curve will at some point in the future maybe it 's tomorrow or 5 years from now but nobody knows for certain one also should n't take any single indicator as the end all be all of indicators for example there are other spreads that indicate the health of credit in the global economy such as the ted spread and the libor spread if you take a peek at the ted spread it tells a much different story the ted spread measures the health of the global banking system by tracking the rate at which banks lend to each other a lower ted rate equals more trust and perceived creditworthiness of the borrower which would be another bank   lastly you really ca n't rely on a single article or single indicator to come to the conclusion that the sky is falling even if we are on the of a recession here in the us nobody can tell the impact and depth of the recession in my opinion we are nearing the top of the credit cycle and should be expecting a bit of a cooling off in the near term 1 3 years outside of that your guess is as good as mine

when you buy a property the house or the building goes down in value every year it gets depreciated similar to when you drive a new car out of the lot however it is the land that increases in value over time as land becomes the value of land in that area will increase in value as does land in sought after areas if more people want to live in a particular suburb the land value will keep on increasing year after year sometimes established areas with houses built in the 1980s or even earlier can be worth much more than newly built areas it comes down to the supply and demand of land and houses in a particular area you might even get a situation where a run down dilapidated house in a very sought after suburb sells for more than a brand new house in a less sought after suburb nearby properties can be a very good investment and they can be a very poor investment it can largely depend on the decisions you make in buying your investment property the first thing you need to make a decision on is the location of the property if you buy a property in a good area that is well sought after you can make good capital and rental returns over the long run if you buy poorly in an area no one wants to live in then you might have problems renting it out or only be able to rent it out to bad tenants who cause damage and you may not get any capital gains over many years the second thing you need to decide on is when in the property cycle you buy the property if you buy at the right time you can get higher rents and make some quick capital gains over a relatively short time i can provide a personal example of this situation i had bought a house in australia in 2007 for $ 240,000 at a time when interests where at their highest 9 no one was buying property and rents were on the increase with low vacancy rates today eight years after we are getting $ 410 per week rent and the house next door in worse condition than ours has been put on the market asking for between $ 500,000 to $ most houses in the area had been selling during this year for over $ 500,000 so you can say that our house has more than doubled in 8 years however up to a few months ago houses were selling within 2 weeks of being listed the house next door however has been listed for over a month and has not had very much interest so from this you can conclude that in 2007 we had bought near the bottom of the market whilst now we are near the top of the market what you also need to remember is that different areas of a country can have different cycles so there is not just one property cycle but many property cycles in the same country

my personal gold metals target is of my retirement portfolio right now i 'm because of the run up in gold metals prices i have n't been selling but as i add to retirement accounts i have n't been buying gold so it is going below the 5 mark i arrived at this number after reading a lot of different sample portfolio allocations and some books some people recommend what i consider crazy allocations 25 50 in gold from what i could figure out in terms of modern portfolio theory holding some metal reduces your overall risk because it generally has a low correlation to equity markets the problem with gold is that it is a lousy investment it does n't produce any income and only has costs storage insurance commissions to buy sell management of etf if that 's what you 're using etc the only thing going for it is that it can be a hedge during tough times in this case when you rebalance your gold will be high you 'll sell it and buy the stocks that are down in theory assuming you stick to disciplined rebalancing so for me 5 seemed to be enough to shave off a little overall risk without wasting too much expense on a hedge i do n't go over this and like i said now i 'm

credit in general having no significant change between an income level or net worth is due to the economic reciprocity principle inherent in many societies although some areas of credit may be more admirable to those who are n't as well off such as car loans the overall understanding of credit is a trust agreement between someone getting something e.g. credit card user and someone giving something e.g. bank or company credit does n't have to mean just money it can be anything of value including tangible materials services etc the fact is that a credit is a common element in most economical systems and as such its use is not really variable between income levels etc sure there is variance in things like credit line amounts and rewards but the overall gist is the same for everyone borrowing paying back benefits etc all of these exchanges form the same understanding we all know and follow credit brings along with it trust the form represented in a score while not everyone may depend entirely on credit and no one should use credit as a means of getting by entirely money everyone can understand and reap the benefits of a system whether they make 10 k a year of 10 m a year this is the general idea behind credit in the broadest sense possible besides just because one has or makes more money does n't mean they do n't prefer to get good deals nobody should like being taken advantage of and if credit can help anyone can establish trust

if you know when and by how much something will fluctuate you can always make money buy it when it 's cheaper and sell it when it 's more expensive if you just know that it fluctuated a lot recently then you do n't know what it will do next most securities that go to zero or go much higher bounce all over the place for a while first   but you do n't know when they 'll move lower or higher   so how could you figure out if you 'll make money you ca n't know dca will on average make you better off unless the extra commissions are too high relative to your purchase sizes but it will in retrospect make you worse off in many particular cases this is true of many investment disciplines such as rebalancing they are all based on averages   if the volatility is random then on average you can buy more shares when the price is lower using dca but when the lowest price turns out to have been on a certain day you 'd have been better off with a single lump sum put in on that day no way to know in advance   degree of volatility should n't matter any fluctuation is enough for dca or rebalancing to get you ahead though it 's true they get you ahead farther if the fluctuations are larger since there 's then more difference between dca and a lump purchase   i think the real reason to do dca and rebalancing is risk control they reduce the risk of putting a whole lump sum in on exactly the wrong day and they can help keep a portfolio growing even if the market is stagnant

now i have been trying to figure out how to split the money that we both earn from what i can see there are several concepts but none of them really seems ideal to me there is nothing fair or unfair in such arrangements it is what you both agree you can try and make this as scientific as possible but then there is no golden rule   for example your girlfriend makes 2200 now and due to child she is making 1100 the child is both of your responsibility so you need to compensate half of her salary loss 550 and she takes the other half if you hire a nanny to look after you kinds it would say cost you 500 but your girlfriend is doing that job so she should get additional 500 from common pot plus due to loss of few years in looking after the children she has a lost opportunity in career growth i.e. she may indefinitely make less money than she can so one gets into all kinds of theories and analysis and any arrangements will have some or the other gaps   so my suggestion do n't get too scientific about it just talk it out as to what you both feel how this should be and arrive it it is something every individual has to agree it also make sense to have the large assets or assets that matter like house car etc in clear title and who gets what in case you decide to separate other should be incidental

this article is bogus there may be companies where you would experience what the author describes but it 's not true where i work i manage a department of 54 in a with 350k employees worldwide    the books are cooked corporate boards must approve labor budgets raises and bonuses pretty early in the calendar year it 's true that the total department budget is set for example by june you might take 4 of everyone 's salaries and reserve that for raises to be allocated in the future that does n't mean everyone gets 4 increase though some may not be eligible for increase for example if they 've been there for 6 months or less some may underperform meaning they get 2 or 0 and some may exceed expectations so they get 6 performance definitely matters   nobody knows how to talk about performance well that 's quite a blanket statement is n't it true it 's to talk about a person 's performance and there 's certainly room for managers to improve performance and ability to give feedback but i 've had plenty of bosses that know how to give good feedback and do so throughout the year not just a year end i also believe that i 'm pretty good at it at least my employees have indicated that i 'm improving   unfortunately you are not as fabulous as the executives in your company large bonuses are given at the top which means that someone needs to be held accountable even if you 've met and exceeded your goals for the year that someone is you i 'm not even sure how to respond to that one the author needs some holiday cheer i think large bonuses are given at the top true what does that have to do with a not at the top employee 's accountability the points do n't seem to be related   managers really love forced ranking not true forced ranking sucks is n't fun and is difficult i believe good managers care for all of their employees bad managers are something else altogether   even if you rock there is n't much money to go around the first accurate sentence in the article however the author does n't take into account at all that money is n't everything surveys of what motivates employees consistently shows that money is n't number one things like having a challenging job and working on important products usually come out over dollars and cents and hey we 've built a real crappy economy what do you expect   as you participate in the end of year performance management process the best thing you can do is to stay neutral remain and be quiet i really take issue with this statement don't do that please use the opportunity you   have with your boss to discuss her or his expectations and what you can change so that you meet them or exceed them if you 're already exceeding expectations ask how you can take on new work how you can contribute to the welfare of your fellow employees this is how you get ahead    nobody really gets rich anymore from being a regular employee getting rich depends on how you spend and save not so much on how much you make

in my mind its not the same    if growth is stock value then this is incorrect because of compound interest in stock price $ 100 stock price after one year would be $ 105 and a dividend would be $ 2 next year the stock would be   $ compound interest and would the dividend really go up in lock step with the stock price well probably not but if it did then maybe you could call it the same even if the dollars are the same the growth rate is more variable than the dividends so its valuable to segregate the two i am open to criticism my answer is based on my personal experience and would love to hear contrary positions on this

compensation information is available in the annual reports 10-k filings which are available from the sec edgar system or generally the company 's website   additionally insider transactions are reported to the sec so you can see when an insider buys or sells stock or exercises options received as compensation background nowadays board and officers seem to secretly steal money from shareholders through options and other ways the stock buybacks that people think should boost the earnings per stock is in reality issued back to the management of the company and is a more stealth way to take money from the company compared to take higher salaries how do you know this is happening if you do n't know where to go to get the data needed to determine whether or not this is happening   do you really think company share buybacks involve just the amount of shares to pay an executive   apple has bought back $ worth of shares from the fourth quarter 2012 through the second quarter 2016 and paid a pretty substantial amount in dividends over the same period   do you really think these shares were simply handed to the executives   the huge pension funds and other huge investors would not let this slide for very long if it were even close to being true do n't come to an unfounded conclusion then seek data to prove your position   look at and analyze data then come to a conclusion

is there more on where dalio gets his definitions for the short term debt cycle 5 8 years or so and deleveraging and the long term debt cycle 75 100 years or his evidence that separates the two   at one point he says the difference is that in a deleveraging interest rates hit 0 and can no longer go lower but i do n't know if that works as a definition per se   there are other things that central banks do when interest rates hit 0 like buy up assets which he does mention and include in the print money category of things that can be done during a deleveraging   and one of the he cites england in the 1950s according to wikipedia was due to difficulty in transitioning out from war production and according to this excel statistics documents rates from the bank of england on historical rates it does n't say interest rates went to 0 at that time unless dalio is referring to another point in history when he cites 1950s england     his definition of a depression is when debt restructuring or defaults happen   interesting   what i learned was that there is n't really a hard and fast definition for recessions and depressions e.g. a recession is two quarters of negative growth in a row and a depression is just a bad long recession   and i do n't think i recall in the past an attempt to define what a deleveraging event of an economy is     is debt reduction and redistribution of wealth deflationary   i think it depends on how much the debt reduction or redistribution hurts the spending of the lender or wealthy versus how much it helps the spending of the borrower or the poor   both are actually similarly giving some from the haves to the have nots and especially redistribution of wealth is similar to fiscal spending which is mentioned as a valid inflationary way to try to help the economy   are deflationary methods say austerity needed to balance out the inflationary methods central bank buying assets and fiscal spending   are n't central bank interest rates quantitative easing and the government fiscal policy still the main things that move inflation or deflation   i would think that debt reduction and redistribution of wealth are good when needed but i would n't think you would do those things mainly for their supposed see above for my doubts deflationary effects     still a very interesting video and one of the best presented videos on a difficult subject

there are several aspects to this but at a high level it boils down to a lot goes in to insurance rating and risk projecting   you ca n't adjust a single variable and expect a proportional change in your premium 7,000 miles per year just wo n't be 70 of the cost of 10,000 miles per year because there are a lot of other things in play as well   to further address premium adjustments   consider this even if your liability coverage did scale with perfect correlation to your mileage using the same 70 from above 7,000 miles per year versus 10,000 miles per year then your premium composition is $ 200 to $ 170 is 15   no change will have a direct linear correlation to your total premium because there are different component pieces of the total premium   fixed costs may be built in to the amounts for other component pieces of the premium for example maybe no line of coverage ever has a cost below $ x. obviously these numbers are all made up additionally and also less considered is the fact that your liability also scales because of a lot of factors that have nothing to do with you   it might be the other cars that are on the road it might be that more densely populated areas have more   for example if you live in beverly hills you have a much higher likelihood of accidentally bumping a $ car than you do in say rural wisconsin   if your zip code is and everyone starts buying mercedes your liability coverage increases    you can not adjust one single variable and decide that you are lower risk than all insurers think you are   if you shop this coverage and all insurers are within a nominal margin of pricing for the same coverage levels there is n't much to argue with you are simply riskier than you think you are and the variable you are focused on is not as meaningful as you think it is

the government wants money and is n't particularly interested in you getting your deductions right doing the worksheet on the back of the w-4 will give you a much better idea of how many deductions you can take while many people are excited to get a tax refund a refund means you loaned the government money all year long without getting paid interest for your generosity the irs will penalize you for underpaying your taxes in amounts larger than $ 1000 or 10 of your income but a good ballpark estimate aiming for about ~$100 in payment at tax time is a relatively safe way to get all your money sooner than later

i want to caveat that i am not an active investor in australia you most likely should seek out other investors in your market and ask them for advice but since you came here i can give you some generalized advice   when investing in real estate there are a two main rules of thumb to quickly determine if the property will be a good investment the 50 rule and the 2 or 1 rule    the 50 rules says that in general 50 if the income from the property will go to expenses not including debt service   if you are bringing in $ 1000 a month 500 of that will go to utilities taxes repair capital expenditures advertising lawn care etc that leave you with 500 to pay the mortgage and if anything is left that can be cash flow   as this is your first property and it is in a relatively bad neighbourhood you might consider bumping that up to 60 just to make sure you have padding the 1 or 2 rules says that the monthly rent should be 2 percent of the purchase price in this case the home is bought at 150,000   if the rent is 1,500 a month it might be a good investment but if it rents for 3,000 a month it probably is a good investment   there are other factors to consider if a home meets the 2 rule it might be in a rough neighborhood which increases turnover which in general is the biggest expense in an investment property   if a property meets one or both of these rules you should take a closer look at it and with proper due diligence determine that it is a deal   these rules are just hard and fast guidelines to property analysis they may need to be adapted to you market   for example these rules will not hold in most all big cities

the principal of the contribution can definitely be withdrawn tax free and penalty free however there is a section that makes me think that the earnings part may be subject to penalty in addition to tax in publication under traditional iras > when can you withdraw or use assets > contributions returned before due date of return > early distributions tax it says the 10 additional tax on distributions made before you reach age 59½    does not apply to these tax free withdrawals of your contributions    however the distribution of interest or other income must be reported    on form 5329 and unless the distribution qualifies as an exception to    the age 59½ rule it will be subject to this tax this section is only specifically about the return of contributions before the due date of return not a general withdrawal as you can see from the first sentence that the penalty does n't apply to contributions which would n't be true of general withdrawals therefore the second sentence must be about the earnings part of the withdrawal that you must make together with the contribution part as part of the return of contributions before the due date of the return if the penalty it is talking about is only about other types of withdrawals and does n't apply to the earnings part of the return of contribution before the due date of the return then this sentence would n't make sense as it 's in a part that 's only about return of contribution before the due date of the return

as a canadian resident the simple answer to your question is yes having worked as a tax auditor and as a certified financial planner you are required to file an income tax return because you have taxable employment income all the employer is doing is deducting it at source and remitting it on your behalf that does not alleviate your need to file in fact if you do n't file you will be subject to a no filing penalty the one aspect you are missing is that taxpayers may be entitled to tax credits that may result in a refund to you depending on your personal situation e.g spousal or minor dependents i hope this helps

it is n't always clear cut that you should pay off a debt at all particularly a mortgage in simple terms if you are making a better return than what the bank is charging you and the investment meets your risk criteria then you should not pay back the debt in the uk for example mortgage rates are currently quite low around 2.5 3 is typical at the moment on the other hand you might reasonably expect a long run average return of around 9 11 on property 3 5 rental yield and the rest on capital gains to make the decision properly you need take into account the following

well this relates to how you interpret something 's value we can use that magazine and restaurant as an example for you the extra $ more on a decent meal or wine is worth it while $ 5 for a magazine entertainment on a train ride might not be this is how all markets work people make decisions about how they value something and hence choose to spend or not if you 're asking should i value certain things the way i do well that 's a different story   e.g. should i keep that picture frame for years in the attic to sell it for $ 3 on ebay later probably not worth it but again you are making that decision based on how you choose to value it so to answer your question how can i possibly care about this when my stock portfolio is losing or gaining $ 1000 a day and is it normal yes it is normal and we all care everyone makes these decisions throughout each day people will vary as to what they value something to be but all in all everyone does just what you explained here is something that you may find interesting it is about how we value money what color is your money if the pdf does n't work for you then try this link what color is your money alt link

is it safe to invest in a portfolio of dividend stocks yielding 7 9 with the money borrowed at 3 4 from one of these brokerages yes and no it depends on your risk profile any investment has its risks of losing your capital but not investing is a guaranteed risk as you will be guaranteed to fall behind the rate of inflation regarding investing on margin this can increase your gains but can also increase your loses regarding the stock market when investing in stocks you should not only look at the dividend rate but also the capital gain or loss potential remember in regards to investing on margin if the share price drop too much you can get a margin call no matter how much dividend you are getting it is no use gaining 9 in dividend yield per year if you are losing 15 or more in capital each year also what is the risk of the dividend rate being cut back or dividends not being paid at all in the future these are some of the risks you should consider before investing and derive a risk management plan as part of your investment plan before you invest no investment is totally safe or risk free but it is less risky than not investing at all as long as you understand the risks involved and have a risk management plan in place as part of your overall investment plan

i have n't dealt with this kind of thing in any way but i found some quotes from irs publications which i think are relevant and hopefully help your scenario sounds to me like a qualified tuition reduction as described in publication 970 tax benefits for education it appears the rules are different for graduate study as opposed to pre graduate work though i do n't see anything about any dollar amount limit there are various requirements and exceptions so hopefully reading through that section of the publication can help you understand whether the benefit is supposed to be taxable if taxable it should show up on your w-2 like any other income any tuition reduction that is taxable should be included as wages on your form w-2 box 1 report the amount from form w-2 box 1 on line 7 form 1040 or form 1040a or line 1 form 1040ez   it does n't appear that there is any special designation or box for the tuition reduction as opposed to normal work it just is income that 's been earned like any other if you need guidance on how much of the income is for normal work and how much is for the tuition reduction you probably need to see if you can figure it out from her pay stubs or contact the university 's hr department well looking through the credits i see in publication 970 there appear to be two possible credits the american opportunity credit section under no double benefit allowed says things like my emphasis added you ca n't do any of the following   my understanding from reading through the section is that expenses are only excluded if they were tax free so that there ca n't be a double dipping of benefits if they 're included as taxable income i think they would count under your second interpretation that the employer paid them like any other income and your wife spent them as educational expenses just like other students and they would qualify for educational credits in fact it explicitly states do n't reduce qualified education expenses by amounts paid with funds the student receives as which sure sounds to me that anything that counts as w-2 box 1 wages would be payments received that then the expenses were logically paid separately from the other credit the lifetime learning credit appears to use identical language no double benefits and do n't reduce by wages obviously this is just from my looking through publication 970 there may be more nuances here and for real advice you may want to speak more to the university hr department who perhaps have dealt with this before and/or a real tax advisor you might also see if you can get any sort of a receipt or even a form 1098-t from the university of what amount was paid on your wife 's behalf to help document it is truly that she was just paid more wages and spent them on classes as far as tax law is concerned

as others have said please talk to a professional adviser from my quick research domain names can only be amortized as 197 intangible if it 's used for the taxpayer 's business for example if corp a pays $ 200,000 for and uses that to point to their homepage they can amortize it over 15 years as a 197 intangible please refer to this irs memo the above memo does not issue any guidance in your case where domains are purchased for investment or resale regarding domain names the u.s. master depreciation guide 2016 by says many domain names are purchased in a secondary market from third parties who register names and resell them at a profit these cost must be capitalized because the name will have a useful    life of more than one year the costs can not be amortized because a    domain name has no useful life so your decision to capitalize is correct but your amortization deductions may be challenged by the irs when you sell your domain the gain will be determined by how you treat these assets if you treat your domains as 197 intangibles and thus had ordinary deductions through amortization your gain will be ordinary if you treated them as capital assets your gain will be a capital gain very conceptually and because the irs has not issued specific guidelines i think holding domain names for resale is similar to buying stock of a company you ca n't amortize the investment and when you sell the gain or loss is a capital gain loss

the intention of making the charitable contributions tax deductible is to provide an economic incentive to contribute to organizations which tend to improve the general welfare of the community deductibility impacts government revenue generation but has positive impacts that probably offset that loss by encouraging more giving by folks subject to high income tax particularly small business owners   unless you own a home and have a mortgage you may not have enough deductions to get any financial benefit from charitable contributions charitable contributions are only deductible when your deductions exceed the standard deduction   for most people charitable contributions are a way to support something that you care about and the tax benefits are a secondary benefit or a way to enhance their own giving

there are several reasons why this may happen and i will update as i get more information from you volumes on that stock look low supposing that they are either in a factor between and 1000s so it could well be that there was no volume on that day if no trades occur then open high and low are meaningless as they are statistics based on trades that occur that day and no trades occur remember that there has to be volume to get a price the stock may have been frozen by either the exchange or the company for the day this could be for various reasons including to prevent some illegal activity in that case no trades were made because the market for that stock was closed another possibility is that all trades that day were cancelled by the exchange the exchange may cancel all trades if there is unusual potentially fraudulent or other illegal activity on the stock in this case the last price for that day existed but was rolled back by the exchange and never occurred this is a rare situation although i ca n't find any holidays on that date it is possible that this is how your data provider marks market holidays it would be valid to ignore the data in that case as being from a non market day i can not tell if this is possible without knowing exchange information there is a possibility that some data providers do n't receive data for a day or that it gets corrupted it may be worth checking another source to ensure the integrity of the data that you are receiving whichever reason is true the data provider has made the close equal to the previous day 's close as no price movements occurred strictly the closing price is the price of the last trade made for that day and so should be null and open high and low should be null too and not 0 otherwise the price change on day is very large therefore to keep integrity you have a few choices

i 'll write this up as a more formal answer here i 'd suggest looking into a home equity line of credit or heloc you did n't mention in your question how much equity you have in the home but assuming at least 20 you might be able to open a heloc with a line of $ 40,000 my experience is that you can do 50 of your equity but depends on the bank here are a few notes that are generally in play with heloc 's ymmv so be sure to know the specifics before signing on the line doing this at least when we did 8 years ago did not subject us to pmi there are certainly plenty of things to research but it sounds like you 're pretty astute based on how you 're evaluating the financial side of this endeavor there are no guarantees in real estate houses could be selling like crazy now but in 6 months they might not it certainly sounds like that 's a lower risk in your area but you never know what might happen if you 're taking on this extra line of credit make sure that it 's something you could afford should the worst case scenario happen   equity loans are also available this is a more traditional fixed rate loan rather than line of credit so you 'd be looking at set monthly payments rather than the flexibility of paying interest only when you need to there 's a brief write up on the differences here i have also heard of a construction loan which falls into the same category as the aforementioned options but i ca n't speak to today 's market on those

for those who are looking to improve credit for the sake of being able to obtain future credit on better terms i think a rewards credit card is the best way to do that i recommend that you only use as many cards as you need to gain the best rewards i have one card that gives 6 back on grocery purchases and i have another card that gives 4 back on petrol and 2 back on dining out both of those cards give only 1 back on all other purchases so i use a third card that gives 1.5 back across the board for my other purchases i pay all of the cards in full each month if there was a card that did n't give me an advantage in making my purchases i would n't own it i 'm generally frugal so i know that there is no psychological disadvantage to paying with a card you have to consider your own spending discipline when deciding whether paying with cards is an advantage for you in the end you should only use debt when you can pay low interest rates or as in the case of the cards above no interest at all in the case of the low interest debt it should be allowing you to make an investment that will pay you more by having it sooner than the cost of interest you might need a car to get to work but you probably do n't need a new car borrow as little as you can and repay your loans as quickly as you can debt can be a tool for your advantage but only if used wisely do n't be in by the temptation of something new and shiny now that you can pay for later

the simplest way to handle this would be to buy money orders make them out to the charities and leave your name off them   money orders do n't require you to put your name on them just the name of whoever they 're being paid to   you can mail them with no return address as well if you 're sure you have the charity 's proper mailing address    this way you can still feel good about giving and leave no trace of who you are for anyone to use for future marketing i hope this helps good luck

am i wrong   yes the exchanges are most definitely not good ole boys clubs they provide a service a huge liquid and very fast market and they want to be paid for it additionally since direct participants in their system can cause serious and expensive disruptions they allow only organizations that know what they 're doing and can pay for any damages the cause is there a way to invest without an intermediary certainly but if you have to ask this question it 's the last thing you should do typically such offers are only superior to people who have large investments sums and know what they 're doing as an inexperienced investor chances are that you 'll end up losing everything to some fraudster honestly large exchanges have become so cheap e.g. xetra costs eur + per trade that if you 're actually investing then exchange fees are completely irrelevant the only exception may be if you want to use a dollar cost averaging strategy and do n't have a lot of cash every month fixed fees can be significant then many banks offer investments plans that cover this case

moral capitalism only makes sense when everyone agrees on the definition of that phrase whatever you decide is moral there will be someone that thinks it 's not   we should see taxes as an integral part of a moral capitalist economy providing health education and social care outside the market   taxes are a part of every government capitalist or otherwise that i know of the real question becomes how much health education and social care is it the government 's responsibility to provide or to put it another way what should i get for free at the expense of everyone else if i choose not to work   it 's a balancing act we generally want to support those who can not support themselves even when it does n't make sense speaking but we do n't want to create a disincentive for people to learn grow work and better themselves we do n't want it to be easier or more comfortable for able people to collect government checks instead of earning their own

it reminds me of the efficient market hypothesis except that just states in its weakest form that the current market price accounts for all information embedded in previous market prices in other words people buying today at 42 know it was selling for 40 yesterday and the patterns and such to say that stock is memoryless strikes me as not quite right to the extent that stocks are valued based on earnings much of what we infer about future earnings relies on past and present earnings one obvious counterexample to this memoryless claim is bankruptcy if a stock files bankruptcy and there is n't enough money to pay senior debt your shares are worth 0 in perpetuity

congratulations on seeing your situation clearly that 's half the battle to prevent yourself from going back into debt you should get rid of any credit cards you have and close the accounts just use your debit card your post indicates you 're not the type to splurge and get stuff just because you want it so saving for a larger purchase and paying cash for it is probably something you 're willing to do contrary to popular belief you can live just fine without a credit card and without a credit score if you 're never going back into debt you do n't need a credit score buying a house is possible without one but is admittedly more work for you and for the underwriters because they ca n't just ask the fico god to bless you they have to actually see your finances and you have to actually have some i realize many folks will hate this advice but i am actually living it and life is pretty good if you 're in school look at how much you spend on food while on campus $ for lunch adds up to $ over a month m f four weeks buy groceries and pack a lunch if you can if your expenses can not be reduced anymore you 're going to have to get a job there is nothing wrong with slowing down your studies and working a job to get your income up above your expenses it stinks being a poor student but it stinks even more to be a poor student with a mountain of debt you 'll find that working a job does n't slow you down all that much tons of students work their way through school and graduate in plenty of time to get a good job   good luck to you you can do it

if you 're trying to hedge the ups and downs of your local residential real estate market a reit fund holding commercial properties across the country is not the ideal match here 's a comparison of an index tracking single family home prices in one region los angeles and vnq another popular reit fund   there 's some correlation but there 's clearly different magnitudes and sometimes different directions with a national home price index the correlation is only 68 and it would be lower for individual cities you could still use it for hedging but there 's significant tracker error risk to be considered unfortunately i 'm not familiar with any investment that would be a better match for individual residential markets so if you decide to use this i 'd also adjust the level of exposure to get a closer result e.g. using approx 50 vnq and 50 cash results in a closer result after 2 years compared to national single family home price changes than either 0 vnq and 100 cash or 100 vnq and 0 cash

diversification is one aspect to this question and dr fred touches on its relationship to risk   another aspect is leverage so it again comes down to your appetite for risk   a further factor is that if you are successfully renting out your property someone else is effectively buying that asset for you or at least paying the interest on the mortgage just bear in mind that if you get into a situation where you have 10 properties and the rent on them all falls at the same time as the property market crashes sound familiar then you can be left on the hook for a lot of interest payments and your assets may not cover your liabilities

i agree the cfa is nice for students who have the time to take the exam because it could be a year or two before the start working so it is a reasonable resume especially if your major is engineer science or math and you want to do finance   if you are trying to do a career change it is important to know the material because if you do n't then you ca n't do the job even if someone gives it to you but passing the test is n't as important as actually applying to the jobs and networking   i switched from engineering to finance buyside equity analyst originally i planned to take the cfa exams to help me with my transition but their new rule required a valid passport and it takes a while to get one so i missed the deadline for last december 's exam that turned out to be a good thing because i just started networking cold calling emailing applying to jobs etc and i got my current job if i had actually decided to take the cfa i would have wasted all my time preparing for the exam instead of trying to get the job potential employers know if you are good or not after talking to you for 15 minutes it has nothing to do with being able to memorize a set of formulas some the last name of some economists and their theories some accounting differences between gaap and etc for me it was the fact that i invest my own money and that i am able to explain my own investments very intelligently aka it needs to be a lot better than what you see on /r investing   if you know nothing about finance studying the cfa material and then taking the exam is a good thing you are going to be studying the material anyways if you are serious about a career change so might as well take the exam afterwards and get a resume i did end up taking the level 1 this month because my new employer paid for it i do n't think it adds any value once your foot is already in the door especially since it takes 5 years of experience to get the charter after that amount of time it 's all about job experience

to be clear a 401 k is a vehicle you make investments within it if you choose poorly such as say putting all your money into company stock when working for the next enron you can still get hurt badly   so it is important to have diversity and an appropriate risk level based on your age tolerance for risk etc that said as vehicles go it is outstanding and the always max your 401 k is very very common advice for a large number of investing professionals cfa 's pundits etc   that said there are a few priorities to consider here first priority if there is some level of company matching grab that it 's hard to beat that kind of return in almost any other case second since you never want to tap into a 401 k if you can at all avoid it before you are ready to retire you should first be sure you have a good emergency fund set aside in the event you lose your job or some other major happens   many recommend setting aside at least 6 months of basic living expenses    third if you have any high interest debt like credit card debt pay that stuff down as fast as you can   you 'll save a ton of interest it 's pretty much the same as investing the money you use to pay it down and getting a return equal to the interest rate you are paying with zero risk ca n't be beat   you 'll also end up with a lot better cash flow and the ability to start saving first and spending out of savings so you earn interest instead of paying it once you have those things out of the way then it is time to think about fully funding the   401k.   and keep in mind since you do n't pay taxes on it the felt effect to you pocket is about 80 or even less of what goes into the account so it 's not as painful as you might think and the hit to your take home may be less than you 'd expect   contributing as much as you can as early as you can also lets you benefit from the effect of compounding and has a far larger affect on the balance than money put into the account closer to retirement   so if you can afford to max it out i surely would advise you to do so

i do n't know too much about the kelly criterion but going by the other answers it sounds like it could be quite risky depending how you use it i have been taught the first thing you do in trading is protect your existing capital and any profits you have made and for this reason i prefer and use position sizing ps the concept with ps is that you only risk a small of your capital on every trade usually not more than 1 however if you want to be very aggressive then not more than 2 i use 1 of my capital for every trade so if you are trading with an account of $ 40,000 and your risk r on every trade is 1 then r = $ 400 as an example say you decide to buy a stock at $ 10 and you work out your initial stop to be at $ 9.50 then our maximum risk r of $ 400 is divided by the stop distance of $ 0.50 to get your ps = $ = 800 shares if the price then drops after your purchase your maximum loss subject to no slippage would be $ 400   if the price moves up you would raise your stop until your potential loss becomes smaller and smaller and then becomes a gain once your stop moves above your initial purchase price the aim is to make your gains be larger than your losses so if your average loss is kept to or less then you should aim to get your average gains to or more this would be considered a good trading system where you will make regular profits even with a win ratio of 50

you can have as many ira accounts as you want whether roth or traditional so you can have a roth ira with american funds and another roth ira with vanguard if you like one disadvantage of   having too many ira accounts with small balances in each is that most custodians   including vanguard charge an annual fee for maintaining ira accounts with small balances but waive the fee if the balance is large so it is best to keep your roth ira in just one or two funds with just one or two custodians until such time as investment returns plus additional contributions made over the years makes the balances large enough to diversify further remember also that you can not contribute the maximum to each ira the sum total of all your ira contributions does n't matter whether to roth or to traditional iras for any year must satisfy the limit for that year you can move money from one ira of yours to another ira of the same type of yours without any tax issues to worry about such movements called rollovers or transfers are   not contributions and do not count towards the annual contribution limit the easiest way to do move money from one ira account to another ira account is by a trustee to trustee transfer where the money goes directly from one custodian american funds in this case to the other custodian vanguard in this case the easiest way of accomplishing this is to call vanguard or go online on their website tell them that you are wanting to   establish a roth ira with them and that you want to fund it by transferring money held in a roth ira with american funds give vanguard the account   number of your existing american funds ira tell them how much   you want to transfer over $ 1000 or $ 20,000 or the entire balance as the case may be and tell vanguard to go get the money   in a few days time the money will appear in your new vanguard roth ira and the american funds roth ira will have a smaller balance possibly a zero balance or might even be closed if you told vanguard to collect the entire balance   do not approach american funds and tell them that you want to transfer money to a new roth ira with vanguard they will bitch and and drag their heels about doing so because   they are unhappy to lose your business and will probably screw up the transfer talk to vanguard only they are eager to get their hands on your ira money and will gladly take care of the whole thing for you at no charge to you do not cash in any stock shares or mutual fund shares or whatever is in your roth ira in preparation for cashing out of the old account there is a method where you take a rollover distribution from your american funds roth ira and then deposit the money into your new vanguard roth ira within 60 days but i recommend most strongly against using this because too many people manage to screw it up it is 60 days not two months the clock starts from the day american funds cuts your check not when you get the check and it is stopped when the money gets deposited into your new account not the day you mailed the check to vanguard or the day that vanguard received it   and so on in short do not try this at home   stick to a trustee to trustee transfer and avoid the hassles
